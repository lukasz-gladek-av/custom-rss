                <p dir="ltr">Virture and 8BitDo have teamed up on a new smartphone controller designed specifically for use with the Viture Pro XR glasses. You can slot your Android phone into the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller</a> to turn it into a Steam Deck- or Switch 2-style gaming handheld. However, unlike 8BitDo's original Ultimate Mobile Controller and similar models that use Bluetooth to connect to your phone, this uses USB-C 3.0, and features an additional USB port for connecting the Viture XR and Pro XR glasses for zero-lag gameplay. The $79 controller is available now at Amazon.</p><p dir="ltr">While it currently only supports Android, Virtue says an iOS model will be available soon as well. A bundle that includes the Viture Pro XR Galsses and 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller is also available for $468.</p><div title="6532520 - Viture x 8BitDo ultimate controller" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3724" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532520 - Viture x 8BitDo ultimate controller" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Viture X 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$79</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr">The Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller is an all-in-one mobile and XR gaming setup that utilizes USB 3.0 for a plug-and-play experience. As the name implies, it uses the excellent 8BitDo Ultimate--one of our favorite third-party controllers available on all consoles--as the basis for the design and features, including Hall Effect thumbsticks and triggers, two extra back buttons, and support for button remapping and other customization settings via the 8BitDo Ultiamte Software V2 app on mobile and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">The 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller's direct USB 3.0 connection is important because it eliminates the input lag present on some Bluetooth mobile controllers and prevents interference from other wireless signals. It also means the controller offers seamless, lag-free passthrough for the Viture XR glasses.</p></div>                      </div><p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, 8BitDo also offers a Bluetooth version of its Ultimate Mobile Controller. While it lacks the low-latency input and video pass-through afforded by the new model's USB 3.0 connectivity, it's otherwise identical in features and form factor. This is also an Android-only device, but it's available in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Console/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Console/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white</a> models, both of which are available for $50 at Amazon.</p><h3 dir="ltr">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controllers</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Console/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller (Bluetooth, Android) - Black</a> -- $50</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Console/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller (Bluetooth, Android) - White</a> -- $50</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Viture X 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller (USB 3.0, Android)</a> -- $80</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.viture.com/product/viture-x-8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-gaming-pack?color=Jet+Black" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Viture X 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller + Viture Pro XR Glasses Bundle</a> -- $468 (a $538 Value)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-preorder-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530595/">Donkey Kong Bananza Switch 2 Preorders Are Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-carries-nintendo-games-again-including-new-switch-2-exclusives/1100-6532451/">Amazon Carries Nintendo Games Again, Including New Switch 2 Exclusives</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-bogo-50-off-movie-sale-includes-brand-new-4k-blu-ray-steelbooks-box-sets/1100-6529351/">Amazon BOGO 50% Off Movie Sale Includes Brand-New 4K Steelbooks &amp; Box Sets</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off-fantasy-sci-fi-horror-novel-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon B1G1 50% Off Book Sale - Popular New Novels, Box Sets, And All-Time Greats</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-deals-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-amazon-walmart/1100-6530578/">Walmart Has 512GB Switch 2 MicroSD Express Card For $65</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Today, PlayStation has launched Climate Station, an interactive app for PS5 and PSVR 2 designed to help educate users on the effects of climate change. Using real-world scientific data and produced in collaboration with research and policymaking organizations, Climate Station aims to make knowledge about meteorological systems and human-driven impacts more accessible to wider audiences.</p><p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/18/climate-station-launches-today-on-ps5-and-ps-vr2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, PlayStation shared that the app provides a number of different experiences to allow users to dive into different aspects of the global climate. Weather Year, for instance, uses global weather data to create a model of the Earth complete with a year's worth of storms, weather patterns, wildfires, sea-ice changes, human behavior, and other events. Climate Station also surfaces historic observations about global temperature, greenhouse-gas emissions, and sea level, in addition to visualizing projections for the next 75 years as produced by scientific models.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZatuxtL47Cc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZatuxtL47Cc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>PlayStation developed this app with an internal team in collaboration with the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading, Berkeley Earth, and the Playing for the Planet Alliance. It uses public data and research from the United Nations' International Panel on Climate Change, and the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</p><p>Climate Station is an important effort to address one of the core challenges to making meaningful progress in mitigating climate change's harmful effects. Climate change is a complex, non-linear process with impacts that differ across time and space, making communication and education time-consuming and expensive. Further complicating matters, the scientific community's understanding of anthropogenic (human-driven) climate change has evolved significantly over the past 50 years. This discrepancy between scientific consensus and popular narratives can drive distrust and conflicts with climate science, disrupting vital efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and, eventually, mitigate and reverse the effects of our rapidly warming world.</p><p>In addition, despite <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/scientific-consensus/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">overwhelming scholarly consensus</a> and <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/reports" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">consistent evidence</a> from <a href="https://antarcticrcc-network.org/climate-monitoring/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">worldwide research projects</a>, fundamental topics such as the existence of and threat posed by climate change have been repeatedly targeted by political polarization. The opposition to, marginalization of, and rejection of scholarly consensus and scientific research risks impeding or reversing climate-change mitigation. For example, the United States government has recently taken action to dismantle its climate change research capacity, including by <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/02/1117653/the-trump-administration-has-shut-down-more-than-100-climate-studies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">axing dozens of previously awarded grants</a>, removing <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/usda-orders-removal-climate-change-mentions-public-websites/story?id=118312216" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mentions of climate change from public websites</a>, and proposing <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-seeks-end-climate-research-premier-u-s-climate-agency" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the elimination of climate research labs at NOAA and NASA</a>.</p><p>PlayStation's creation of Climate Station presents one possible way to bring more dynamic, scientifically oriented, and engaging education to the broader public, but it may itself be vulnerable to the dismantling of climate science. As stated on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002901/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">its product page</a>, and like countless other educational projects, Climate Station relies on data provided by NOAA and NASA. This data has long been collected and published as a public service by these agencies, but this may not continue, as <a href="https://nsidc.org/data/user-resources/data-announcements/user-notice-level-service-update-data-products" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some NOAA and NASA monitoring programs have already been cut</a>.</p><p>For now, Climate Station is operational and an amazingly detailed resource for people interested in learning more about our world. It is also provided completely free, giving an accessible entry point into climate science, as long as you have a PS5. You can download it through <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002901/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the PlayStation Store</a> right now.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within's upcoming 11.2 update is bringing with it one unexpected addition popularized by From Software RPGs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dark-souls/" data-ref-id="5000-83346">Dark Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a>--asynchronous social features.</p><p dir="ltr">In the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh update</a>, Blizzard will add new social functions to Delves, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-finally-adding-a-new-endgame-activity-made-with-smaller-groups-in-mind/1100-6518919/" data-ref-id="1100-6518919">MMORPG's latest endgame mode that can be played solo or with small groups</a>. Like in Elden Ring or Dark Souls, players within a Delve will be able to see remnants of other players who have journeyed to the instance, see markers where a player may have died from a strong pack of enemies or hidden trap, and leave helpful messages for others to read while inside. I'm sure these messages will always be 100% serious.</p><p dir="ltr">It's an addition players may not have known they wanted, but one that makes perfect sense and should make Delves feel more alive than they currently do. WoW is a MMO, after all, even as it continues to offer new ways to achieve endgame goals entirely solo. Adding asynchronous social elements to the game's main endgame mode for solo players helps to further reinforce the idea that WoW is a game played alongside millions of other players, even for those players who largely stick to themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">Lead encounter designer Taylor Sanders said in an interview with GameSpot it's important that players are able to progress at their own pace in Delves and play with the group size that they want, whether that be solo or with a few friends. The new asynchronous social features in Delves are there to support that flexibility, as Blizzard believes the mode has been a huge success and doesn't want to change what's working.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a way of getting back to some of MMO's roots," Sanders said. "Of knowing that other players are around you, in a way, without necessarily grouping players up with other players they might not want to play with…This is a way of capturing some of that magic of MMOs, of seeing other players throughout the environment, seeing memories of where they may have messed up and gotten splattered by a trap or something, without necessarily impacting what we think has been really positive and successful about the feature."</p><p dir="ltr">The new Delve social features are just the tip of the iceberg for the Ghosts of K'aresh update, which in many ways serves as a sequel of sorts to events and lore first introduced in the game's The Burning Crusade expansion. It will transport players to the shattered homeworld of the Ethereals to stop a cosmic-level threat from returning. Along the way players will unlock a legendary cloak that can be used to transform into an energy form in order to access new content.</p><p>Blizzard hasn't revealed when the Ghosts of K'aresh update will be going live, but it's expected to be available on WoW's public test realm in the near future. Meanwhile, players are still waiting for more details on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/">WoW's upcoming player housing system</a>, which we said already feels full of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/">endless possibilities based on a recent hands-on preview</a>.</p>

                <p>Blizzard has lifted the veil on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within's next major update, and it's a surprising sequel to the MMORPG's first expansion, as players journey to the shattered homeworld of the mysterious Ethereals.</p><p dir="ltr">Update 11.2, Ghosts of K'aresh, brings to mind the Legion expansion's Shadows of Argus update, which also took players to a destroyed planet that has long existed in the lore. In Ghosts of K'aresh, players will travel to the Ethereal former home in an effort to stop the resurrection of Dimensius, a powerful void-lord responsible for the destruction of K'aresh and who players may remember dispatching a fragment of as part of a lengthy quest chain in The Burning Crusade back in 2007. Turns out Dimensius wasn't defeated for good and is back in 11.2 with a major glow-up, sounding and looking far more like a world-destroying entity compared to their <a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dimensius_the_All-Devouring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original oversized voidwalker look</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Ethereals, strange energy beings who could be found throughout TBC's continent of Outland, have gone on to be a fan-favorite group within WoW's fantasy universe since their introduction close to two decades ago. More recently in The War Within, the Ethereals have had a larger role to play in the MMO's ongoing story of Xal'atath and her powerful void-infused artifact, the Dark Heart. Speaking with GameSpot, associate art director Tina Wang said the team enjoyed looking back at how the Ethereals have been represented in the past in order to inform the look and feel of Ghosts of K'aresh.</p><p dir="ltr">"We really love the old themes from Burning Crusade, the key Ethereal elements, the mana forges, the Eco-Domes, the glowing pink pipes," Wang said. "I think folks who remember and look back at the Ethereals fondly will see a lot of elements that they really connect with."</p><p dir="ltr">To help navigate K'aresh, players will gain a new upgradeable artifact cloak, the Reshii Wraps, that will allow players to "phase dive" into an energy form similar to that of the Ethereals. This lets players see the world through a new lens and will allow access to new activities on K'aresh like Warrants, where players will help track down special enemies for lucrative rewards. The Reshii Wraps will also be used for unique mechanics within the update's new endgame content. One example of using the Reshii Wraps given by lead encounter designer Taylor Sanders is how players in the new raid, Manaforge: Omega, will need to swap to their energy form in order to dodge a giant laser that could wipe out the group.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516000-wowghostsofkareshreshiiwraps.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516000" data-ratio="0.56239870340357" data-width="1851" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516000-wowghostsofkareshreshiiwraps.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516000"></a><figcaption>The Reshii Wraps will allow players to phase dive into an energy form to complete new activities.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516000-wowghostsofkareshreshiiwraps.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Another major open-world activity coming as part of the update is called Ecological Succession. Players may remember the large Eco-Domes in TBC's Netherstorm region that helped to define the zone's look, where the Ethereals looked to create new, enclosed ecosystems amidst a backdrop of destruction. In Ghosts of K'aresh, players will get to go hands on and help manage their own Eco-Dome by partnering with the Broker Ve'nari, who will ask for players to retrieve plants and animals from older WoW zones to bring back to the Eco-Domes in an effort to kickstart life once more. It's part of the WoW's team's efforts to take advantage of the huge amount of content already within the MMO, Wang said.</p><p dir="ltr">Assistant lead quest designer Stephanie Yoon said progressing Ecological Succession and its storyline will take multiple weeks. It's a slow burn at first, Yoon said, as ecological change doesn't happen overnight. Over time, however, as players introduce new life and meet new characters, the Eco-Dome will change and the fruits of players' labors will become more obvious.</p><p dir="ltr">"When I first saw the end of Ecological Succession, I teared up," Yoon said. "So I hope it impacts players as much as it did me."</p><p dir="ltr">A new zone isn't complete without a new raid and dungeon, and 11.2 will have those too. The Manageforge: Omega raid will see players confronting Dimensius, who Blizzard described as the biggest raid boss in WoW history. How big, exactly? According to Blizzard, the new version of Dimensius is equivalent to the size of Stormwind itself.</p><p dir="ltr">"Players will be fighting against this void-lord, this being the size of Stormwind city, and they'll see him from different perspectives," Sanders said. "They'll be diving from thousands of feet away against lasers and thrown planets, and they'll also be fighting him up close and personal as he's smashing his fists down on the platform next to you that are the size of a school bus. It's going to be an epic encounter."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516002-wowghostsofkareshecodomes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516002" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516002-wowghostsofkareshecodomes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516002"></a><figcaption>Ghosts of K'aresh's pink Eco-Domes will be a familiar site to those who played The Burning Crusade.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516002-wowghostsofkareshecodomes.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">On the dungeon front, Eco-Dome Al'dani is a new three-boss instance, one where the dungeon's story will actually take place canonically after the events of the raid and dive into how the Ethereals are looking to sustain life on their home planet. For the more solo-minded players, there's a new Delve as well, one that will actually return adventurers to the Azure Vault in the Dragon Isles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wows-next-major-update-will-add-one-of-dark-souls-most-innovative-features/1100-6532496/" data-ref-id="1100-6532496">Delves are additionally receiving new souls-like social functions</a> like player ghosts, death markers, and the ability to leave messages for other Delvers to see.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that the update is all about the Ethereals and the Brokers, the Shadowlands mega-dungeon Tazavesh, the Veiled Market will return for The War Within Season 3's Mythic+ dungeon pool, split into two instances. Tazavesh will be joined by the new Eco-Dome Al'dani as well as Halls of Atonement from Shadowlands and four War Within instances. On the PvP side of the season, K'aresh itself will have a specific PvP zone, Vanquisher's Wake, earmarked for open-world PvP where players will be able to complete their weekly spark quest to earn rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard hasn't yet revealed when WoW's Ghosts of K'aresh update will release, but it will likely be available for testing on the game's public test realm in the near future. As for what else is coming to WoW in 2025, Blizzard previously announced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-legion-is-getting-the-remix-treatment-blizzard-confirms/1100-6531479/" data-ref-id="1100-6531479">Legion Remix event for later in the year</a>, and players are hoping to see more of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/" data-ref-id="1100-6529278">WoW's player housing system</a> as well. In a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">WoW player housing hands-on preview</a>, we said even in their currently early form, the possibilities offered by the game's housing decoration tools already feel endless.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Season_4_Reloaded">What to expect from Season 4 Reloaded</h2><h3 id="Two_new_weapons">Two new weapons</h3><p dir="ltr">Season 4 Reloaded adds two new weapons to Black Ops 6 and Warzone. Activision announced the Olympia, a double-barrel shotgun, and the pickaxe melee weapon will arrive sometime during this midseason update.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517092-pickaxeweapon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517092" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517092-pickaxeweapon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517092"></a><figcaption>Pickaxe melee weapon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517092-pickaxeweapon.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Two_new_events">Two new events</h3><p dir="ltr">Each seasonal update usually includes a few events. So far, the only ones confirmed for Season 4 Reloaded are two community-based Zombies events. These are vaguely described by Activision, so it's not yet clear how these event or reward systems work.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>King of the Dead</strong> runs from June 26 to July 3. For this, players must eliminate zombies in any Zombie mode to earn points to climb a leaderboard.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Master of Grief</strong> runs from July 10-17. This event is described as collecting Essence in Grief in order to earn points to climb a leaderboard.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6">Black Ops 6</h3><h4 id="More_multiplayer_maps">More multiplayer maps</h4><p dir="ltr">For Black Ops 6 multiplayer, the Season 4 Reloaded adds two more maps: A brand-new map called Eclipse and a remaster of Fringe from Black Ops 3.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517103-bo6-season-04-announcement-009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517103" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517103-bo6-season-04-announcement-009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517103"></a><figcaption>Eclipse multiplayer map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517103-bo6-season-04-announcement-009.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Activision recently confirmed that next season will bring the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-podcast-confirms-black-ops-7-is-boots-on-the-ground/1100-6532517/">final Zombies map for Black Ops 6</a>. This means players won't get a new map for the midseason update, but there will be new limited-time modes for Zombies.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="New_Zombies_LTMs">New Zombies LTMs</h4><p dir="ltr">The <strong>Starting Room LTM</strong> is inspired by the starting room of the classic Moon map from Black Ops 1, where players are limited to only a small section of the map. This mode will be available on all Black Ops 6 maps, with each one giving a limited area for players to survive as long as they can.</p><p dir="ltr">The <strong>Abomination Challenge LTM</strong> is vaguely described by Activision as taking place on "a warped version of Liberty Falls" and players must hunt down and eliminate an ultra-powered-up Abomination.</p><p dir="ltr">Grief mode launched at the start of Season 4, and Treyarch confirmed the mode is permanent. The latest patch notes for Black Ops 6 included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-update-improves-grief-mode-and-returns-disabled-skin/1100-6532410/">several improvements to Grief</a>, and the developer revealed more updates are currently in testing, so it's likely Season 4 Reloaded could include even more quality-of-life changes the mode.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h3><h4 id="More_Ranked_Play">More Ranked Play</h4><p dir="ltr">Season 4 Reloaded returns Resurgence Ranked Play to Rebirth Island. The competitive mode will exist alongside Ranked Play on Verdansk and feature a separate ranking system and rewards, so players can progress through both ladders.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517185-bo6-season-04-announcement-058.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517185-bo6-season-04-announcement-058.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517185"></a><figcaption>Resurgence Ranked Play on Rebirth Island</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517185-bo6-season-04-announcement-058.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to sweaty Ranked Play modes, Season 4 Reloaded includes the Havoc Royale LTM and Resurgence Casual.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="Additional_game_modes">Additional game modes</h4><p dir="ltr">The Havoc Royale limited-time mode is described as chaotic 15-minute matches with 44 players on a limited section of Verdansk. Each circle collapse will include a different game modifier to affect the match, and players will need to adapt fast to survive.</p><p dir="ltr">With the success of casual BR modes on Verdansk, Season 4 Reloaded adds the Resurgence Casual mode, bringing bots to Rebirth Island. This mode will still follow the normal Resurgence gameplay, but the lobby is made up of a mix of real players and bots.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">Activision announced Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> during June's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. The publisher has also confirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-podcast-confirms-black-ops-7-is-boots-on-the-ground/1100-6532517/" data-ref-id="1100-6532517">Black Ops 7 is a boots-on-the-ground game</a>, squashing the rumors of potential jetpack or wall-running mechanics.</p>
