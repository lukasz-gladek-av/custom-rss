                <p>Prime Big Deal Days ended on October 8, but folks looking to upgrade their PC setup can still check out a few great Logitech deals available at Amazon right now. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible/dp/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logitech G Pro X Superlight Wireless Mouse</a> is down to one of its best prices of the year, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Full-Size-Mechanical-Programmable-Anti-Ghosting/dp/B0BBFWTD7T?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logitech G413 SE and G502 Hero Bundle</a> gets you an impressive mouse and keyboard for just $97.72 (was $160). Both of these are limited-time deals, though it's unclear when Amazon plans to end the price cuts.</p><div title="6535524 - Asus Keyboard and Mouse Deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4721" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535524 - Asus Keyboard and Mouse Deal" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible/dp/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible\/dp\/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible/dp/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Logitech G Pro X Superlight Wireless Gaming Mouse</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible/dp/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible\/dp\/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible/dp/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$95 (was $150)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Besides a few good discounts in February and March, this is the best price we've seen for the Logitech G Pro X Superlight this year. Equipped with the Hero 25K Sensor for accurate movement tracking, five programmable buttons, and a weight of just 63 grams, itâ€™s a good choice for fast-paced FPS games. Its PTFE feet also help it glide across most surfaces, and you shouldn't have to worry about any input lag thanks to Logitech's Lightspeed technology--which uses a USB receiver for rapid responses.</p><p>The wireless gaming mouse is compatible with both PC and Mac, though the deal is only available for the black model. Opt for the white model and you'll pay $100.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Full-Size-Mechanical-Programmable-Anti-Ghosting/dp/B0BBFWTD7T?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Logitech-Full-Size-Mechanical-Programmable-Anti-Ghosting\/dp\/B0BBFWTD7T?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Full-Size-Mechanical-Programmable-Anti-Ghosting/dp/B0BBFWTD7T?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Logitech G413 SE Keyboard + Logitech G502 Hero Mouse Bundle</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Full-Size-Mechanical-Programmable-Anti-Ghosting/dp/B0BBFWTD7T?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Logitech-Full-Size-Mechanical-Programmable-Anti-Ghosting\/dp\/B0BBFWTD7T?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Full-Size-Mechanical-Programmable-Anti-Ghosting/dp/B0BBFWTD7T?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$97.72 (was $160)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>If you prefer wired connections for their reliability, take a peek at this G413 SE and G502 Hero bundle. Both products are wired, and if you're playing an MMO or other game that could benefit from dozens of inputs, the G502 Hero Gaming Mouse and its 11 programmable buttons could be a good fit. It's also equipped with the Hero 25K Sensor like the G Pro X Superlight above, though its design is decidedly more aggressive and "gamer." As a bonus, its weight can be adjusted using five 3.6 gram weights.</p><p>The G413 SE Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is a full keyboard with F Keys and a numpad, so it's a nice fit for both gaming and working. Its aluminum top case should make it durable enough to hold up nicely over the years (or during rage-inducing key smashings), and its tactile mechanical switches are built to be highly responsive. It also benefits from 6-key rollover, LED lighting, and PBT keycaps.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>Alongside these two Logitech deals, a bunch of Asus products are also discounted at Amazon right now. This includes the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCZQTF74?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Wireless Mouse</a> for $70.49 (was $150) and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-Three-Layer-Hot-Swappable-PBT/dp/B0CLF3WYGC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Azoth Wireless Mechanical 75% Keyboard</a> for $155 (was $275). The former is even lighter than the Logitech G Pro X Superlight at just 54 grams, while the latter is a 75% board with a unique OLED display that can show your system info, an audio visualizer, or simple animations. It's a stylish model equipped with swappable ROG NX mechanical switches, tons of RGB lights, and support for Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz connections.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3CX3QMD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Keris II Ace Wireless Gaming Mouse</a> is on sale for $100 (was $180), and with a 107-hour battery life, micro switches rated for 100 million clicks, and the reliable ROG AimPoint Pro 42K Optical Sensor, it's worth a closer look if you don't mind upping your budget. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Falchion-Hall-Effect-Gaming-Keyboard-PC/dp/B0DG7H487F?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Falchion Ace HFX 65% Keyboard</a> is discounted, too, which could be a better choice if you're working with a small desktop or need to save space for sweeping mouse movements.

<section><p>Game Pass was the best deal in gaming. Now it's a deal in gaming, for some people.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Microsoft recently announced that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is climbing from the sweaty price of $20 US per month <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">to an eye-watering $30</a>. The "real" gamers around the internet already have a joke for it: "Xbox 360 dollars per year."</p><p dir="ltr">But while the jokes write themselves, determining if Game Pass is still of value to me at this new price has taken far more energy. Yes, the company has also added new incentives and moved some features around, but do these additions create value, or just even more confusion? Let's break things down a bit.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate includes access to all Microsoft-published games--as well as many other titles--on their respective release days. It also includes a subscription to EA Play, Ubisoft Classics, and will soon include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Crew. With Ubisoft Classics coming in at $80 per year, EA Play at $40 per year, and Fortnite Crew at $144 per year, the total value of these subscriptions is $264, which definitely helps sweeten spending $360 a year on Game Pass--if you actually use them.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's talk about the subscriptions that come with Ultimate and what they mean. First, there's Ubisoft Classics. If you look at the Ubisoft Classics website, the standard subscription tier costs $7.99 per month, but only offers PC play. Ubisoft Classics' Premium tier, however, features both PC and Xbox play for a total of $17.99 per month. Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" rel="nofollow ">claims that its version of Ubisoft Classics adds $7.99 per month</a> of value <em>per</em> platform, meaning those playing on both PC and Xbox receive the greatest benefit. With the Game Pass version of Ubisoft Classics, you get access to a rotating menu of games in their standard editions rather than the 100-plus games--often in their Premium editions--that are promised in Ubisoft Premium. You're getting access on PC and Xbox, yes, but to a smaller library of games, in Standard editions instead of Premium. Microsoft wants you to think of this as a $15.98 value each month, but with all these caveats, it's hard to take the quoted "$7.99 a month per platform" value seriously.</p><p dir="ltr">EA Play, meanwhile, is more straightforward. Through EA, the subscription costs $5.99 per month and offers 10-hour trials on new games and "unlimited access to a collection of top EA titles," and it seems as though that's what Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is offering as well.</p><p dir="ltr">However, in their standalone versions, both of these programs offer discounts on Ubisoft and EA games respectively; there's no word on whether those discounts would apply to Game Pass subscribers. We're guessing they won't, though, because as part of the price increase, Xbox also <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox-game-pass-perks-discounts-ended/" rel="nofollow ">eliminated the game and DLC discounts</a> that previously were included as part of the service.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite Crew is a bit more complex. If you stay subscribed to Fortnite Crew all year long, you gain access to all battle passes all year, and receive 1,000 V-Bucks per month (12,000 total in a year) and 12 sets of unique Fortnite Crew outfits. But while this might sound like a good deal, even if you play a lot of Fortnite, it still isn't worth the value. That's because not all the rewards you get for being a Crew member are created equal--Fortnite battle passes and Crew rewards are full of throwaway items you probably won't care about to fill out their offerings. These rewards mostly aren't the cool genre-bending collaborations like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-fortnitemares-2025-everything-to-know/1100-6535025/" data-ref-id="1100-6535025">Scooby-Doo</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-morphin-time-in-fortnites-incredible-live-action-power-rangers-teaser/1100-6533692/" data-ref-id="1100-6533692">Power Rangers</a>, they're generic, non-copyright-infringing characters and songs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4587176-4582319-fortnitemares2025keyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4587176" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4587176-4582319-fortnitemares2025keyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4587176"></a><figcaption>A promotional image from Fortnite's Scooby-Doo-filled Fortnitemares event.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4587176-4582319-fortnitemares2025keyart.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You'd have to love the Crew outfits, use the Jam Tracks, and play LEGO Fortnite modes--along with completing the Battle Passes--to really get your money's worth. The short version is that Fortnite Crew is $144 for about $100 worth of V-Bucks, some skins you probably won't use, some LEGO pieces you probably won't use, and Jam Tracks that you may or may not even care about.</p><p dir="ltr">Regular Fortnite players (myself included) will often buy a Crew Pass to complete a season's Battle Pass and earn the corresponding bonus V-Bucks. But as an ongoing subscription, you have to be <em>extremely</em> invested in Fortnite to justify Crew on its own merits.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, when speaking purely in terms of Microsoft-published games, Game Pass admittedly makes a pretty strong case for itself. This year alone has brought us <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/" data-ref-id="5000-22229">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gears-of-war-reloaded-all-cog-tag-locations/2900-6885/" data-ref-id="2900-6885">Gears of War Reloaded</a>, and I'd be remiss not to mention that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/" data-ref-id="5000-659496">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/keeper/" data-ref-id="5000-681590">Keeper</a> are all just around the corner. This also doesn't include the various third-party games that come to Xbox Game Pass on Day One--games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. But again, the exact "value" here is subjective--you'd have to play a lot of those games for the math to actually add up.</p><p dir="ltr">Coincidentally, a study published by Circana shortly after the Game Pass price hike found that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/majority-of-us-gamers-buy-a-max-of-two-games-annually-analysts-say/1100-6535300/">most US game players purchase two or fewer new games a year</a>. Sure, there is a lot of nuance to this statistic, but at the same time, when the majority of gamers report they spend around $140 a year on new games, does the average player truly find value in spending $360 a year just to temporarily gain access to a handful of them?</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that we can't rely on Microsoft to release that many games next year or the year after. It might happen, but again, we're talking about <em>potential </em>value.</p><p dir="ltr">To get the greatest value out of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you'd almost have to use it to the exclusion of other gaming services, and that's not how the majority of gamers are using the service. Personally, I tend to like Microsoft-published games; by the end of the year I'll have played five of the above Microsoft-published games, along with a bunch of other third-party Game Pass games. I also play Fortnite <em>a lot</em> and tend to play games on my Xbox rather than my PlayStation. I'm one of the rare cases that can <em>maybe</em> justify that "Xbox $360" price tag. But even then, I hesitate.</p><p dir="ltr">In earlier days, Game Pass felt like a steal: You only had to play one or two games to justify the cost. Everything else was just gravy. With this price increase, though, the math becomes far more complex--to the point that it feels like you're talking yourself into giving your wallet to a guy who says he'll definitely bring it back and not to worry. And if that doesn't get you, the changes and transient nature of the service will.</p><p dir="ltr">Game Pass <em>was</em> the best deal in console gaming. Now, it's <em>a</em> deal in console gaming--but only under very specific circumstances.</p>
