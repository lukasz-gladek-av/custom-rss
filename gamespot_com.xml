                <p>Avowed game director Carrie Patel has discussed Obsidian's effort to "make everything intentional" in the RPG, and that meant not simply following other fantasy tropes but instead crafting the game to stand on its own. Among other things, this means there was no rule for Avowed that said dwarves had to have a Scottish accent like they do in lots of other fantasy media.</p><p>"With all our games, and certainly with the lore of Pillars, we want to make everything intentional," Patel said in an interview with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/07/avowed-living-lands-next-great-frontier-for-obsidian/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox</a>. "Dwarves don't need to have Scottish accents just because they do in other fantasy settings, and elves don't need to all speak with <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Received-Pronunciation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Received Pronunciation</a>."</p><p>Instead, Patel said an intentional effort was made to focus on "stripping back those tropes" for Avowed to stand out.</p><p>"One example was the idea of mountain dwarves tending to be more itinerant. Traditional dwarven societies build impressive places but then scatter and move on due to resources, personal disagreements, or political rifts," Patel said. "This created an interesting opportunity for us in Avowed to explore: What it would be like if one of these settlements stuck around. What would that culture be like? Why would those characters have made that decision, and what would that mean for the story?"</p><p>Avowed was previously set for release at the end of 2024 but was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-avowed-was-delayed-due-to-scheduling-not-quality/1100-6527757/" data-ref-id="1100-6527757">delayed to February for scheduling purposes, not due to quality.</a> The game officially launches on February 18, but the $90 Premium edition unlocks five days early, beginning February 13.</p><p>Like Microsoft's other first-party games, Avowed is included with Game Pass Ultimate at launch. Members can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-members-can-upgrade-to-avoweds-90-premium-edition-for-a-fraction-of-the-price/1100-6529257/" data-ref-id="1100-6529257">buy an upgrade add-on to the Premium edition for $22.50 to get all the perks</a>, including early access.</p><p>In addition to Avowed, Obsidian is currently at work making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, which is planned for release this year.

                <p>Sid Meier's Civilization 7 is finally in the hands of players who paid for early access, and one of the 4X strategy game's weirder bugs has already been discovered. During Age transitions, players can hear weird noises, some of which sound like coughing, when picking a new civilization to play as.</p><p>One of the biggest changes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/" data-ref-id="5000-631817">Civilization 7</a> makes to the series' core formula is that playthroughs are split into three Ages. Players pick a new civilization to control at the start of each new Age. A piece of music plays in the background as players do this, but fans quickly started hearing weird audio as they did this and discussed their findings on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1ij1clt/you_can_hear_a_person_coughing_and_typing_on_a/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>. There was speculation that some unintentional sounds made their way into the orchestral music track already, but the Civilization 7 support website revealed the actual issue.</p><p>"During an Age Transition, players might hear strange noises. This is likely due to the audio from the Main Menu being played over Age Transition screens," <a href="https://support.civilization.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/38315115956371-Audio-from-the-Main-Menu-plays-during-Age-Transition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a support page explains</a>. "This means you may hear short voice lines, shuffling around, and general idle noises while on the Age Transition menu."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeYvr1q4Ev8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JeYvr1q4Ev8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Essentially, players hear the Leaders' idle voice lines and actions that typically play on Civilization VII's main menu screen while they're mid-playthrough. Currently, 2K and Firaxis have not outlined any clear way to resolve this issue. They're aware of the issue and have already committed to thorough <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-quality-of-life-fixes-are-inbound-starting-with-its-ui/1100-6529313/" data-ref-id="1100-6529313">post-launch support for Civilization 7</a>, so hopefully, a fix isn't too far off.</p><p>Sid Meier's Civilization 7 will get a wide release on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on February 11. You can play now if you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-on-sid-meiers-civilization-7-preorders-for-pc-mac-early-access-starts-february-6/1100-6525971/" data-ref-id="1100-6525971">purchase the more expensive Deluxe or Founder's editions</a> of the game.</p>

                <p>Sea of Thieves players should be wary when Season 15 launches on February 20, as two new megalodons will be creeping in the waters. But should pirates be able to take down these fearsome sea creatures, they'll have new spots in the game's world to sell their megalodon meat.</p><p>Season 15, titled "Wild Things," expands the Hunter's Call trading company, which offers rewards and gold in exchange for fish, cooked meat, and other items. The company's vendors are scattered around the sea in tiny, lonely Seaposts, but Season 15 will incorporate them into the game's seven Outposts, according to a <a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com/news/this-month-february2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sea of Thieves blog post</a>.</p><p>The new megalodon variants are the Feared Redmaw and Barnacled Dread, with an X post from the Sea of Thieves account sharing a look at a megalodon covered in what appear to be yellow and purple crystals. The blog post states that these megalodons have "devastating new abilities" that will challenge even the most experienced buccaneers.</p><p>Players can also expect new voyages, a hunting spear item, "untamed wildlife," and other features. Eagle-eyed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seaofthieves/comments/1ij2o26/season_15_wild_things_released_february_20th/mbah25t/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sea of Thieves fans noticed</a> a spotted variant of pig in the teaser image, which also led to speculation that players can have pigs as pets, and a treasure chest with the Hunter's Call emblem, which may indicate new types of loot.</p><p>Unlike the other trading companies in Sea of Thieves, Hunter's Call has no emissary flag or unique voyages, so <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seaofthieves/comments/1ij2o26/season_15_wild_things_released_february_20th/mbalhwy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">players are hoping</a> Season 15 will add more to the Hunter's Call progress experience and endgame.</p><p>Until the launch of the season, pirates can participate in limited-time <a href="https://x.com/SeaOfThieves/status/1887803559414047123" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dark Fortress Raids</a> beginning February 14 and earn tons of loot from fighting Phantoms at Sea Forts. Hopefully, Sea of Thieves Season 15 will have a smoother launch than the previous season, where developer Rare had to temporarily <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-is-removing-its-new-stealth-features-following-season-14-launch-issues/1100-6527342/" data-ref-id="1100-6527342">roll back some new features</a> due to technical issues.</p>

                <p>With Super Bowl LIX on Sunday with the defending champions, the Kansas City Chiefs, taking on the Philadelphia Eagles, all eyes are on New Orleans, with every sportsbook ready and waiting. There have already been some Madden 25 simulations from excited fans, but Mutant Football League wanted to take a stab at trying to predict the outcome.</p><p>While sadly the Superdome won't have death traps and allow powerbombs, Mutant Football League 2 has players covered. The simulation pitted the Karcass City Creeps against the Killadelphia Evils, with the Creeps taking the win.

And just like in the first match-up of these two great franchises, late questionable calls by the refs helped pave the way to a Karcass City victory."</p><p>You can watch the full Mayhem Bowl LIX simulation <a href="https://youtu.be/a3TomoocHko" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>, if you want to kill time in your lunch break.</p><p>Looking at Madden's official simulations over the past 12 years, the game has predicted the correct outcome <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-super-bowl-predictions-over-the-years-how-often-does-ea-get-it-right/1100-6487137/" data-ref-id="1100-6487137">about half the time</a>. EA got off to a solid start by accurately predicting the Super Bowl winners four straight years, from Super Bowl 38 to Super Bowl 41.

                <p>Krafton has revealed a new name and more details for its first-ever PUBG spin-off. PUBG: Blindspot, which was previously known as Project Arc when it was revealed in 2024, is a top-down shooter launching in beta on Steam later this month.</p><p>Blindspot is a 5v5 tactical shooter that aims to offer a blend of strategy and shooting from a top-down perspective. The mission in the game is to break into a crypt inside a building to install an item called a Decrypter. Players use things like grenade launchers and explosive hammers to crush the building's walls to get into the crypt. Those on the defending team can set up barricades and other preventative measures to try to stop attackers from getting in.</p><p>"PUBG: Blindspot presents real-time line of sight shared with your teammates, which creates immediate, non-verbal cooperation, allowing you to experience fast-paced CQB combat with your teammates in real-time against actual players," Krafton said.</p><p>The game features weapons like the Mk14, AWM, and P90, as well as gadgets like proximity explosives, flashbangs, and smoke grenades, among other things. Take a look at the trailer below to get a closer look at Blindspot.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jP7p9DAKKI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3jP7p9DAKKI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A free demo for Blindspot launches February 20 at 8 PM PT / 11 PM ET on Steam--the game has only been confirmed for PC. The developer said it will gather feedback from fans to help "refine and enhance" the game. A release date has not been announced.</p><p>Blindspot is the first PUBG spin-off from the popular battle royale game. It wasn't always going to be the first spin-off, though, as the horror game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-is-no-longer-a-pubg-spin-off/1100-6503927/" data-ref-id="1100-6503927">The Callisto Protocol was going to be until plans changed.</a></p>

                <p>Just in time for Valentine's Day, Nintendo is dropping Wario Land 4 on Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on February 14. The weird Game Boy Advance platformer sees the gassy antihero turning into Zombie Wario and Bouncy Wario--just a couple of the transformations--as he explores a golden pyramid for the riches inside.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wario-land-4-review/1900-2831796/">Wario Land 4</a> originally debuted in 2001 as an early title for Game Boy Advance. It's actually the fifth mainline Wario platformer in the series when taking into account Virtual Boy Wario Land. Additionally, Wario Land 4 arrived before the WarioWare franchise even existed.</p>
