                <p>As ICE raids continue to take place across the US, an itch.io bundle has been set up to help raise funds for two organizations. The first is the LA-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center, a "next-generation social justice law firm that defends our immigrant communities against injustices in the immigration system," as described on its <a href="https://www.immdef.org/about" rel="nofollow ">website</a>. The second is the Texas-based <a href="https://raicestexas.org/" rel="nofollow ">Raices</a>, an organization that provides "legal and social services to people and families who want to put down roots in the US."</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://itch.io/b/3110/no-ice-in-california" rel="nofollow ">No ICE in California bundle</a> will set you back only $10, a reasonably easy amount of money to part with considering it's going to two organizations doing important work, but it also nets you 560 games as an added bonus. It mostly includes tabletop games, but there are a number of video games in it, as well as some game-making assets.</p><p dir="ltr">Highlights include games like <a href="https://devonwiersma.itch.io/bombing-a-graffiti-sandbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bombing!! A Graffiti Sandbox</a>, where you can practice your graffiti skills in low-fi environments; <a href="https://rocketadrift.itch.io/raptor-boyfriend-a-high-school-romance" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Raptor Boyfriend: A High School Romance</a>, a "dating sim about a teen girl who moves to a small secret community of cryptids;" and the tabletop RPG <a href="https://dannymakesrpgs.itch.io/garfield-plusminus-you" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Garfield Â± You</a>, a "two player RPG about a person experiencing major milestones in their life, at which time they also are visited by Garfield."</p><p dir="ltr">The bundle has a goal of $50,000, and is currently a little under halfway there at just over $21,500. You've still got a while to pick it up though, as it's running for the next month.</p>

                <p>I thought the introduction of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outlast-trials/" data-ref-id="5000-505577">The Outlast Trials</a>' previous Big Bad, a gun-wielding, man-child mobster named Francisco Barbie, was pretty ruthless of the development team at Red Barrels, but Season 4's introduction of conjoined twins who work together to find and slaughter players is really taking it to another level.</p><p>Project Diarchy, The Outlast Trials' latest season of content, is coming on July 15, bringing the <strong>new Prime Assets (major enemies) </strong>to the game, Otto and Arora Kress. The twins share a single body, but are conjoined in such a way that Arora is almost riding atop Otto's shoulders, pointed in another direction, thus giving the killers more coverage when they're prowling for players in shadows, lockers, or barrels.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfcv30W857o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qfcv30W857o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Otto wields a chainsaw, while Arora lobs toxic chemicals at players. Together, they have a 360-degree field of vision, which will make sneaking around much harder. Red Barrels says the pair combine to make up "the most difficult Prime Asset [players] have yet faced."</p><p>With a new season tends to come a <strong>new map</strong>, and that's true once more. This time, players will be exploring a shopping mall, which will host both the new Trial, or main mission, Kill The Politician, as well as additional MK-Challenges, which play out like shorter missions in similar environments.</p><p>The new season will also come with a new catalog, the game's free battle pass-like system of gruesome cosmetic rewards, as well as additional paid cosmetics, which this time will be split into four solo packs for $5 each rather than the typical $20 pack for a set of four. This will let players pick and choose the skins they like most, so they needn't buy the whole set just to get one or a handful of the skins they sought.</p><p>Along with all of that, the game's endgame missions return in a new form. <strong>Rebirth 2.0</strong> adds co-op options to the experience, unlike the previous version that forced players to play the game solo. Rebirth can take place on any of the major maps in the game, so it won't be the same mission each time anymore, and it will be played in mirror mode, borrowing a popular, albeit unexpected, feature from Mario Kart.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4527385-unnamed%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4527385" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4527385-unnamed%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4527385"></a><figcaption>The Vote or Die campaign is really ramping up.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4527385-unnamed%285%29.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527396-tot_season04_shoppingmall-02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527395-tot_season04_shoppingmall-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527394-tot_season04_mk01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527393-tot_season04_custo.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527392-tot_season04_primeasset-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527390-tot_season04_mk02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527389-tot_season04_primeasset-02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4527396,1300-4527395,1300-4527394,1300-4527393,1300-4527392,1300-4527390,1300-4527389" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527396-tot_season04_shoppingmall-02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527395-tot_season04_shoppingmall-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527394-tot_season04_mk01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527393-tot_season04_custo.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527392-tot_season04_primeasset-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527390-tot_season04_mk02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527389-tot_season04_primeasset-02.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527396-tot_season04_shoppingmall-02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527395-tot_season04_shoppingmall-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527394-tot_season04_mk01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527393-tot_season04_custo.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527392-tot_season04_primeasset-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527390-tot_season04_mk02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527389-tot_season04_primeasset-02.png"></figure><p>"It's something that we discuss pretty often when we're coming up with new trials," narrative designer Jonathan Morrell told me. "Within the company, it's just [about] trying to find that line that we need to tiptoe. Someone will suggest something, and even internally, we'll go, like, 'I don't think we could do that.' Or like, 'Maybe that's a little too much, even for us.' And it's kind of like we go back and forth until we find that line. And so far, at least, it seems like we haven't overstepped it, which is cool, because I agree that there aren't many games out there that are as graphic or thematically disturbing as The Outlast Trials."</p><p>Community manager Rosemarie Sarno added that the team wants to "always try to keep it different enough that we know that no other game would do <em>this</em>."</p><p>The Outlast Trials Season 4 update arrives for free on July 15, though the sound of the chainsaw might cost you some hours from your sleep schedule.</p>

                <p>Majjam is the first game from the recently-announced studio Opus Major, and it's an exciting multiplayer adventure game that relies entirely on music to power its gameplay. From the way you traverse the world and engage in combat through to how you interact and explore, Majjam is inspired by "live jam" sessions--where musicians bring their instruments and voices to an improvised musical collaboration.</p><p>Majjam is described as a co-op multiplayer adventure and MMO, where you can use your own rhythms, melodies, and harmonies to work together to rescue the world around you. Music, as the world's life force, is the only thing holding back the corruptive element known as KodÃ©. KodÃ© is a dark presence that's encouraging death and silence via an ominous fog.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOnYB4W_PYo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vOnYB4W_PYo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Working together, you and your friends will harness musical energy via jams, using your characters' unique abilities and instruments to solve puzzles, defeat enemies, and ultimately rescue the world.</p><p>While Majjam relies on music and creativity to progress through the game, Opus says that there is "no instrumental expertise" required to play. You'll unlock more musical abilities as you progress, and each one has a specific power that will unlock the world's true potential.</p><p>Speaking about the announcement, Opus Major founders Pierre-Armand Nicq and Jean-Nicolas Vernin said, "Our team's dream is to make the world jam together. In music, a jam is a suspended moment--a shared energy between friends, strangers, and other passionate souls who just happen to be there. You might not know each other, but for a few magical, spontaneous moments, you vibe together. It's that same spark you sometimes feel in a multiplayer game. Our dream is to bring all these joyful moments together into one single, shared experience."</p><p>Majjam is launching a closed alpha playtest this September. Opus says it knows the first version of the game will be "flawed" but that it values player feedback. "We're inviting players not just to test the game, but to help us build it in the next months," it said. To join the closed alpha test, you can sign up on the <a href="https://www.majjam.com/news/get-ready-to-jam/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Majjam website</a>. It's also available to wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3845650/MAJJAM/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p>

In the team's own words, "Where's the guy that said the game would be dead in a week?"</p><p dir="ltr">Over the weekend, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3527290/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the game reached an all-time peak of just under 114,500 players. For comparison, Content Warning, a game from other co-developer Landfall that sits within that slightly hard to define genre of comedy co-op games, achieved an all-time peak of a little over 204,000 when it was released. The big difference there is that Content Warning was free at launch, so Peak's accomplishment is nothing to be sniffed at.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4528230-peak.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528230" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4528230-peak.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528230"></a><figcaption>Surviving with friends in PEAK.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4528230-peak.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Last week, the game received a fresh update with a few bug fixes that was quickly reverted due to inviting in even more bugs missed in testing. Right now the main thing for both developers is prioritizing bug fixes and stability, but in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498325386812195119?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam post</a> from last month they did say that they are "looking into possible updates." No details on what that might include, and that did come with the caveat that you shouldn't expect new content right away.</p><p dir="ltr">For those of you that have missed out on Peak, the concept's pretty simple: You're a funny little guy who, along with a few friends, crashed on an island, the only hope of escape presenting itself in the form of a mountain you must climb.
