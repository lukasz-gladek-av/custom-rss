                <p>Epic has revealed a new Halo-inspired Fortnite collaboration. Only this time, the focus isn’t centered solely on Master Chief but on UNSC Spartans as a whole; players will be able to gain access to these colorful skins via Fortnite’s upcoming battle pass when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-battle-pass-theme-and-everything-else-we-know/1100-6533459/" data-ref-id="1100-6533459">Season 4</a> goes live on August 7.</p><p>Epic broke the news through the Fortnite X/Twitter page. There, the company informed fans of the upcoming battle pass as well as hint at a possible Power Ranger sighting; a fan asked if the rangers were making their debut, to which the account responded with a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1951729012071338345?t=UfRgdXu5YSJwaWbO6gFNzQ&amp;s=19" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">few promising emojis</a>.</p><p>Of course, this isn’t the first time we’ve seen a Halo x Fortnite event. Master Chief joined Fortnite’s legacy series back in 2020--he was added to the shop during Chapter 2, Season 5 as a standalone or bundled purchase. Players could don his armor in two different colors, wield his gravity hammer pickaxe, float with the UNSC Pelican Glider, and even ride a mini warthog via a special emote.</p><p>This would be the first time players will get to play as the Power Rangers though. If the rumors/leaks are true--as suggested by popular Fortnite leaker <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1951721905293242855" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shiina</a>--we’d expect them to show up as a bonus that’s unlocked through specific quests or maybe as a high-tier achievement on the battle pass. Whatever the case, Fortnite fans seem to be in for an out-of-this-world treat come August 7.</p>

                <p>Disney's big Fortnite project--whatever it might be--is still in the works and is said to be targeting a Fall 2026 release. That's according to a report from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-ai-hollywood-movies-5982a925?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAj1WlG90hfrlndqPntMcR366Qqal9vfmaEL3j9hN4JnWUrH_70M8ucT_sHstYc%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6890bed5&amp;gaa_sig=lpo4UvT40pOKiDH3Wi8wRCBs-Zfur_-2gFEdrybB-Tpi6kvRjmJq_Gl_8MLGnqOexWLZM29y1vwGyoqDMOTQkQ%3D%3D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Wall Street Journal</a>, which also claimed some Epic executives have complained about Disney's reportedly slow sign-off and approval process. At the same time, the report said some Disney executives have expressed concerns about the project.</p><p>The report said Disney believes gaming can be a major revenue-driver for the company, which is why it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-its-fortnite-deal-is-so-important-we-have-to-adapt/1100-6526831/" data-ref-id="1100-6526831">invested $1.5 billion with Epic</a> to make a Disney universe inside Fortnite. Disney's Fortnite project is codenamed "Bulldog," the report said.</p><p>It remains to be seen exactly what Disney's plans are, but regarding the reported frustrations from Epic's side, the report said Disney requires sign-off from "so many different divisions."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2bRcSIUsE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Yf2bRcSIUsE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Whatever the project turns out to be, the report said Disney parks and resorts boss Josh D'Amaro is personally leading the effort to get it done. The report said he's spent time with Epic's CEO Tim Sweeney near the company's HQ in North Carolina, and they have gone on hikes together.</p><p>The report added that "some Disney executives have raised concerns" about the project regarding "who owns fan creations based on Disney's characters." The publication said if a Fortnite player created their own mashup dance featuring Darth Vader and Spider-Man, that could lead to legal questions about ownership, among other things.</p><p>Disney and Epic have of course already worked together on Star Wars and Marvel crossovers, among others, but not all of them have gone over entirely smoothly. When Disney brought an Darth Vader to Fortnite featuring the AI-powered voice of James Earl Jones, people <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darth-vader-could-say-the-f-word-in-fortnite-for-a-brief-time/1100-6531608/" data-ref-id="1100-6531608">quickly made him say questionable things and curse.</a> This was corrected quickly, but it surely has not been forgotten.</p><p>The official word is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-its-fortnite-deal-is-so-important-we-have-to-adapt/1100-6526831/" data-ref-id="1100-6526831">Disney is working with Epic </a>to create "a place where you can play games, a place where you can be social, [and] a place where users can generate their own content." Essentially, D'Amaro said Disney's aim to create an entire "universe" where "all our stories can come to life."</p><p>"They can come to life in different forms, [like] games. They can come to life in ways that you can just interact with and play with the franchise in a way that's meaningful to you--a place where you can actually build," he said. "And we think that this is going to be a place where all fans can come and interact 365 days a year."</p><p>Characters and content from Disney's Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and Avatar brands, among others, will be represented in Fortnite. Disney and Epic have yet to officially unveil any specific projects in Fortnite tied to Disney, but many are hoping to see some kind of "virtual Disney World." Along those lines, a Disney Imagineer recently teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-teases-theme-park-integration-with-disney-x-fortnite-project/1100-6530010/" data-ref-id="1100-6530010">some kind of theme park integration for people who visit Disney's parks and play the upcoming game.</a></p><p>As for D'Amaro, he is said to be a leading choice to replace CEO Bob Iger after he plans to retire in 2026.</p><p>Fortnite is more of a platform than a single game that gets new updates constantly, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-battle-pass-theme-and-everything-else-we-know/1100-6533459/" data-ref-id="1100-6533459">soon-to-release Season 4</a>. In addition to the main battle royale game, Fortnite hosts games like Rocket Racing, Fortnite Festival, and Lego Fortnite, along with countless other user-created games and experiences on the platform. Whatever Epic and Disney might be cooking up could be just the latest game to exist on the Fortnite platform.</p><p>Disney no longer develops big games in-house, as its own Disney Interactive Studios shut down years ago. These days, Disney works with outside teams as part of licensing arrangements. Not all of the games are successful, though, as Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">Star Wars Outlaws failed to sell up to expectations</a>. One of Disney's latest major games was Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which was developed by MachineGames in partnership with Lucasfilm. The game is <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/blog/indiana_jones_article/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">performing well, it seems.</a></p>

Nintendo has once again assured Metroid fans that the game will be out this year for Switch 2 and Switch, allaying fears that it might be delayed.</p><p>Ahead of its appearance at Fan Expo Canada later this month, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/fan-expo-canada-attendees-will-have-access-to-play-the-latest-and-upcoming-titles-on-nintendo-switch-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo says</a> that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be playable and will be "available later in 2025" alongside other games on Switch 2. This isn't the first time that the public has been able to go hands-on with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and Nintendo's statement confirms that the game will still launch within the next five months.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p><em>When </em>it will launch in this period still remains uncertain. Nintendo has been spacing out first-party releases for the Switch 2, starting with Mario Kart World as a Switch 2 launch game in June, Donkey Kong Bananza in July, Drag x Drive in August, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A is scheduled to arrive on October 15. If the pattern holds up, it's not unlikely that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond could arrive during the lucrative holiday season as a must-have Switch 2 game, considering that the console already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">has an install base of 6 million users and counting</a>.</p><p>This will bring a lengthy development cycle to a close for Nintendo, following the company's decision to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/">restart development in 2019</a> after it failed to reach the standards that the company expected of it, under Bandai Namco. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-re-revealed-with-impressive-trailer-and-2025-release-date/1100-6524332/">The game was re-revealed in 2024</a>, and since then, we've seen a trickle of new gameplay showing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/">off action and mouse controls</a>.</p>

"Like really - loads of it. In a surprising way. And I can’t wait to show you. But you’ll need to be patient / we’ll need a bit of time to make it all work. It’ll be worth it though."</p><p>Larian has been keeping its next project--codenamed<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-next-game-is-codenamed-excalibur-no-idea-what-it-is-yet/1100-6523807/" data-ref-id="1100-6523807">"Excalibur</a>"--under wraps, but in January, the studio confirmed it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">giving its "full attention" to the game</a>.

The game was later released for PS5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, and went on to win Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2023, among many other awards and accolades, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2023/1100-6519739/" data-ref-id="1100-6519739">GameSpot's Game Of The Year</a>.</p><p>The most recent update for Baldur's Gate 3, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-introduces-cross-play-photo-mode-and-12-new-subclasses/1100-6530875/">Patch 8</a>, introduced 12 new subclasses, a photo mode, and cross-platform play for multiplayer. Unfortunately, Larian has confirmed it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-director-says-making-dlc-for-its-games-is-boring-for-larian/1100-6531125/" data-ref-id="1100-6531125">not interested in making any DLC</a>, despite the game's popularity.</p><p>"You want a happy player and happy business, but you also need to have a happy developer," Vincke said in an interview with GameSpot earlier this year. "What we're doing now makes developers way more happy. We had a huge hit, and people said 'DLC this' and 'DLC that,' and we said we'd make DLC, but then when we had a moment to think, we asked ourselves, 'what are we doing?'"</p>
