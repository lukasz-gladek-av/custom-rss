                <p dir="ltr">One of the largest labor unions in North America is creating a new United Videogame Workers union, which aims to allow anyone in the business to join. Communications Workers of America has teamed up with the American Federation of Musicians to launch this new gaming-specific organization to coincide with the start of the Game Developers Conference.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/faq" rel="nofollow ">the group's FAQ</a>, this new gaming union will offer basically anyone in the industry--in the United States and Canada--<a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/membership" rel="nofollow ">the opportunity to sign up</a> and then eventually pay dues. This is also open to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/">the thousands of people who have lost their jobs</a> over the past couple of years. The United Videogame Workers mission statement mentions taking "back our lives, our labor, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs; to empower our fellow workers; to link up arms with the laid off, with the freelancer, with the disillusioned contractor, with the disenfranchised and the marginalized, with the workers laboring invisibly to keep this industry afloat." The new organization also advocates for creating studio-specific unions, too, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/qa-workers-at-zenimax-studios-have-become-the-gaming-industrys-largest-union/1100-6510268/">like ZeniMax Workers United</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"The creation of this union was not done in isolation; it's a cumulative effort by the thousands of video game workers who have been fighting for years to redefine what it means to stand together and reclaim power in one of the largest and highest-grossing industries on the globe," said CWA's senior director of organizing Tom Smith in a press release.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time the CWA has made waves in the gaming industry. For example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-is-now-unionized-across-the-board-recognized-by-microsoft/1100-6525206/">Bethesda Game Studios became unionized</a> last year with the help of the organization. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-qa-workers-say-they-were-laid-off-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6524209/">the CWA went after Microsoft for allegedly firing QA testers</a> because they were attempting to unionize. Last but not least, in October, the labor union <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-shutdown-just-another-example-of-bad-decision-by-highly-insulated-ceos-labor-union-says/1100-6527505/">criticized Sony's decision to shut down Concord developer Firewalk</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/">video game voice actors went on strike</a>, and it's now going on its eighth month. Recently, SAG-AFTRA argued there are<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-publishers-have-too-many-alarming-ai-loopholes-says-striking-actors-union/1100-6530074/"> too many AI loopholes for game publishers to use</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-developers-choice-awards-2025-nominees-revealed/2900-6173/#1">GDC</a> kicks off today in San Francisco.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Roger Craig Smith has voiced loads of iconic video game characters, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-dream-team/">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/batman-arkham-origins/">Arkham Origins</a>' Batman, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> fan-favorite Mirage. He's perhaps best known for his performance as the ledge-climbing, leap-of-faith-taking Ezio Auditore da Firenze in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-ii/">Assassin's Creed II</a> (and several other games in the franchise), but fans of Assassin's Creed will likely be surprised to learn that Smith is absolutely terrified of ledges.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshualamb/2025/03/19/assassins-creeds-roger-craig-smith-i-have-a-fear-of-ledges/" rel="nofollow ">Forbes</a>, Smith--who is a big fan of gaming--was asked if there's a specific gaming memory in his life that "stands out." For Assassin's Creed fans, his answer was a bit unexpected.</p><p dir="ltr">"Climbing to the top of a tower in Assassin's Creed II and synchronising so the map unlocks for you; that iconic and sweeping entrance [to the game] always gets me," Smith said. "I have a fear of ledges, and this game would give me the heebie jeebies moving around up there. I'd get butterflies in my stomach, but it's such a beautiful moment. Getting to be a part of it and seeing what everyone had worked so hard to create was just such a 'Wow,' moment for me."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4461733-eziocollection.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461733" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4461733-eziocollection.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461733"></a><figcaption>Smith is afraid of heights--even in games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4461733-eziocollection.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Smith also revealed which game he'd play for the rest of his life, if he were only allowed to play one.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'll cheat and say the entire Assassin's Creed franchise," Smith answered. "That'll give me at least a lifetime of gaming there. Aside from the fact that I got to be a part of the franchise so early on, I've always thoroughly enjoyed playing all of the games. The music, storytelling, visuals, gameplay--it all works so well, and that's rare to have everything fire off and hit the way those games do."</p><p dir="ltr">Smith did add that he hasn't had much time for gaming as of late due to being busy with work, saying that it's "no way to live," and that he needs to "turn [his] gamer card in."</p><p dir="ltr">Still, Smith has always had a reputation for genuinely enjoying games. In the wake of Apex Legends' wildly successful 2019 launch, Smith and fellow Apex voice actor Chris Edgerly (who voices Pathfinder) did several livestreams together, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iOUS-vRI00">playing Apex and messing with unsuspecting teammates</a> by using their respective Apex characters' voices in voice chat.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, Smith seems extremely content with the state of his career. When asked if there are any video game voice roles he wishes he'd gotten, he simply expressed gratitude for the opportunities he's had in the industry.</p><p dir="ltr">"Lightning has struck so many times in my life and career," Smith explained. "I've been able to look people in the eye and tell them that I'm the voice of Ezio, Batman, and Sonic. In all honesty, I just look forward to the next project. It's amazing to think that there's somebody out there who loves games and storytelling and is creating something we can't even imagine that could become <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/">the next Assassin's Creed</a>."</p><p>Speaking of the next game in the franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> launches on Thursday, March 20, but you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/">GameSpot's review of the latest entry</a> in the long-running series now.</p>

                <p>Before the Marvel Cinematic Universe changed the face of the movie industry with its series of interconnected films, a video game version of this concept was once pitched to Disney, according to Bungie co-founder Alexander Seropian.</p><p>On an episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W6fCpdYs4Y">The Fourth Curtain podcast</a>, Seropian and his guest Alex Irvine revealed (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/there-was-once-an-idea-for-a-marvel-gaming-universe-that-would-tie-all-the-video-games-together-like-the-mcu-but-it-didnt-get-funded" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>) how they'd come up with a plan to create a connected universe for future Marvel games, but Disney higher-ups decided to pass on the idea. Seropian--who was VP of game development for Disney's game division until 2012--and Irvine--who has writing credits on several Marvel games--added that funding for the idea never materialized, killing the idea early on in its development.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W6fCpdYs4Y" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_W6fCpdYs4Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I was coming out of ARGs at that point and thinking, 'Wouldn’t it be cool if we had some ARG aspects?' There would be a place where players could go that all the games touched, and we could move them back and forth from game to game," Seropian explained. "We could link in comics, we could loop in anything, we could do original stuff. And then, as Alex said, it didn’t get funded. So we made a bunch of games."</p><p>Irvine added that it was also a challenge to make the proposed Marvel video game universe stand out from the comics and film adaptations, and in the end, the idea was scrapped. Currently, Marvel video games from Spider-Man to Guardians of the Galaxy all exist in their own distinct universes, and the only exception to the rule is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/insomniac-ps5-spider-man-and-wolverine-are-in-the-same-universe-dev-confirms/1100-6518742/" data-ref-id="1100-6518742">Insomniac's upcoming Wolverine game</a>, as it'll be set in the same Earth-1048 reality that the web-slinger calls home. Other in-production Marvel games include a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-black-panther-game-with-marvel/1100-6515782/" data-ref-id="1100-6515782">Black Panther title from EA's Cliffhanger Games</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-will-be-set-in-occupied-paris-wakanda-and-beyond/1100-6528536/" data-ref-id="1100-6528536">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> from Skydance.</p><p>Meanwhile, Marvel's rival DC Comics has struggled in the video game space as of late. Rocksteady's Arkhamverse adventure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was a massive flop</a> for the studio and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/">the Wonder Woman game was also canceled earlier this year</a>. Developer Monolith Productions was one of several studios closed by Warner Bros. Games, alongside Player First Games and WB San Diego.</p>
