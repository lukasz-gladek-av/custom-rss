                <p dir="ltr">After countless leaks and rumors, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/">Nintendo finally formally unveiled the Switch 2</a> with a surprise video today on social media. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-bigger-is-nintendo-switch-2-heres-our-first-size-comparison/1100-6528851/">The hybrid console is bigger</a>, has magnetic Joy-Cons, and yes, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-mario-kart-may-have-been-revealed-in-switch-2-trailer/1100-6528850/">a new Mario Kart is seemingly on the way</a>. However, this reveal comes across as overly corporate, bland, and lacking a basic sense of joy that should accompany the introduction of a brand-new video game system.</p><p dir="ltr">There isn't a human in sight for the first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>. Instead, the majority of the two-and-a-half minute video features an off-white background and CGI animation to showcase how Switch 2 differs from the original Switch. Clearly, Nintendo doesn't want <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-wii-u-is-not-a-peripheral-nintendo-reminds-shoppers/1100-6416840/">a Wii U situation on its hands</a>, spelling out clearly that Switch 2 isn't some add-on to the original and will replace the previous system. However, the teaser feels too much like a basic upgrade trailer--way too similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izljcyvozig">the New Nintendo 3DS XL first look</a>, for example--than shouting out Switch 2 is the next generation of Nintendo gaming.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="473204499" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

However, that reveal trailer feels so much more full of life (thanks to actual people being present) and creativity than what we experienced today. The Switch introduction video begins with a man playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on his TV screen, before quickly snapping to the Switch logo and to show how he can take the system on the go. The hook of the system is showcased up front as the guy brings the Switch with him to take his dog to a park in the early morning. While unconfirmed, if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> works or even has better visuals on Switch 2, maybe showing that anticipated game on Switch 2 could have provided a similar sense of awe or at least an idea of the system's technical prowess.</p><p dir="ltr">From there, Nintendo presents all of the various ways the Switch can be utilized, whether on an airplane or even during a rooftop party. This reveal trailer also sees actual people interacting with and using the system--something that isn't present at all with the Switch 2 first look. Nintendo also sprinkles in a handful of third-party games with the original Switch, giving a better idea at what's on the way for the system. For instance, this was when we learned that Skyrim would come to the console. Now, for context, third-party support had absolutely cratered on Wii U, so the company needed to convey that partners were on board with Switch. However, it would have been nice for Nintendo to give third parties the option to tease their games with Switch 2 instead of only vague Mario Kart footage. Showing that Fortnite will, in fact, work on Switch 2 seems like a no-brainer and easy win.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1938400712" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

last third of Switch's unveiling is where Nintendo really flexes its muscles compared to what we see with Switch 2. The Switch unveiling not only shares gameplay footage of what ends up being Super Mario Odyssey, but also offers up a teaser for Splatoon 2 (though people were unsure it was a full sequel at the time). Once again, with Switch 2, Nintendo presents a pretty uninspired glimpse at a new Mario Kart--presumably Mario Kart 9. Of course, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-8-deluxe-is-nintendo-best-selling-game-of-all-time/1100-6523297/">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is basically Nintendo's best-selling game ever</a>, so if Switch 2 launches with a new entry, it will do gangbusters. But the presentation behind this could have been injected with at least a little bit of fun or at the very least highlight how this new Mario Kart will be unique. (Eagle-eyed fans believe 24 racers can compete at one time, and Donkey Kong seems redesigned to more closely resemble his appearance in the New Super Mario Bros. Movie.)</p><p dir="ltr">The most intriguing part of the Switch 2 unveiling relates to what appears to be optical sensors in each new Joy-Con. Nintendo then has a small segment where the controllers seem like they're ice-skating across a surface, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=switch+2+mouse+controls+gamespot&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">possibly hinting that Switch 2 will feature mouse-like controls</a>. If true, why not shout out to everyone that there is new functionality behind the Joy-Cons for Switch 2? Why only point out the magnetic aspect? To me, showing mouse-like controls on Switch 2 with something like a new Mario Paint, Mario Maker, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, or even an old game like Minecraft would have added a bit more wonder and excitement to this reveal.</p><p dir="ltr">It's easy to wave away complaints and claim Nintendo will sell boatloads of Switch 2 systems regardless. But first impressions matter. Has Nintendo given up on expanding the video game user base? Because this video implies that to me. Nothing about Switch 2 looks revolutionary or particularly refreshing. Instead, this is more of the same. Maybe that's all that's needed: not rocking the boat on a system that people already love.</p><p dir="ltr">But Nintendo, historically, has struggled when the company gets conservative and complacent. So far, Switch 2 seems way too safe. That said, with a Switch 2 Direct coming on April 2, there is plenty of time to build up the hype train.</p>

                <p>Nintendo historically holds Nintendo Direct briefings in February, and it seems that tradition will continue this year. Podcaster NateTheHate has reported that Nintendo will host a Nintendo Direct event focused on games for the original Switch sometime next month.</p><p>He said this during the <a href="https://youtu.be/RWifbMkXe_4?si=4BqSCo5C_e4nAuZT" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">same podcast </a>where he correctly predicted the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event would take place on January 16.

It's expected that this broadcast will feature lots of news and updates on the Switch 2. </p><p>The Switch 2 was officially confirmed today, January 16, which is just a few weeks before Nintendo next reports earnings on February 4. Nintendo could also share <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-switch-2-14-new-details-we-spotted-about-the-console/2900-6134/" data-ref-id="2900-6134">information about the Switch 2</a> during that event, or at least it's expected analysts and investors will ask management about it.</p><p>The original Switch has sold more than 146 million units and 1.3 billion games, becoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-nintendo-platforms-of-all-time-and-how-many-units-they-sold/2900-5124/" data-ref-id="2900-5124">one of the best-selling video game consoles of all time.</a> Hopes are high for the Switch 2, but <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lfufhi6mvk2a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one analyst is doubting the console's ability to expand Nintendo's reach in a meaningful way.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Popular indie FPS <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortunes-run/">Fortune's Run</a> won't be seeing any updates for a while--about three years, to be precise, as that's how long its sole developer, known only as Dizzie, will be spending behind bars.</p><p dir="ltr">"I have some stuff going on I need to make public as it's going to interrupt development," Dizzie <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1692240/announcements/detail/532087801681805319">shared in a post</a> on the game's Steam page. "I've been sentenced to prison for the next three years. It's a long story, but I've lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn't living very well."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WGagabyqUc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7WGagabyqUc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"My case is about five years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I've been working on this," he added. "I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I'm going away next month. It's a shame, but it's the consequences of my actions."</p><p dir="ltr">Described by Dizzie as a "fast-paced melee boom-shoot fighting game platformer action immersive sim role-playing fever dream adventure story," Fortune's Run's only other developer recently left the project. According to Dizzie, his former co-developer left for a number of reasons, one of which was a series of struggles she faced after what the post describes as a "botched surgery."</p><p dir="ltr">"The other developer has left the project," Dizzie wrote. "Once she recovered [from surgery], she decided that she was no longer interested in game development. She was in charge of QA and a few level segments, all of which have been abandoned and I've been forced to get by on my own for the past while. It's been very difficult to do alone, but I actually managed--by basically not sleeping--to complete all of the work in time so that it could be released before I'm sent away."</p><p dir="ltr">"Since we decided to part ways, development will be completely interrupted until I'm released," He continued. "I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there's absolutely nothing I can do, these wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it's just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time."</p><p dir="ltr">The dev added that he is "no longer in financial dire straits" since Fortune's Run "actually sold OK," and noted that he "should be able to afford rent" once he's released from prison.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's a chance that if you wait a few years, I'll be able to cap off the release," he wrote. "In fact, there's not very much content left to work on, I've been making stubs and prototypes of the missing levels in my spare time."</p><p dir="ltr">Dizzie also noted that "the game isn't <em>totally</em> dead, but unfortunately due to even further bad things happening, it's unclear what will happen [to it]."</p><p dir="ltr">Dizzie's identity--and the crime for which he is being incarcerated--are not known to the public, though he admits in the blog post that his sentence is the result of violence on his part.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was a very violent person [in the past] and I hurt a lot of people in my life," he wrote. "Unfortunately, the sentence isn't going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that."</p><p dir="ltr">Dizzie also noted that another Fortune's Run update is in the works and will be released before he begins serving his sentence.</p><p dir="ltr">"Oh yeah. What about the update, huh? I'm going to put that in the next news post, because it feels weird to uh, put patch notes at the bottom of this blog post."</p>
