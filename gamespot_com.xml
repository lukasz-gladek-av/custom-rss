                <p>After nearly a decade of anticipation for the next installment of Dragon Age, the latest sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, unfortunately <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/" data-ref-id="1100-6528964">failed to reach EA's expectations</a>. Subsequently, the game's developer, BioWare, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">laid off staff members</a> and became considerably smaller. Now, one of the voice actors from The Veilguard is sharing her dismay about the backlash against the game from people who she says wanted to see BioWare fail.</p><p>Alix Wilton Regan--who voices the female Inquisitor in both Dragon Age: Inquisition and Dragon Age: The Veilguard--recently told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-star-absolutely-devastated-over-backlash-says-people-wanted-to-see-bioware-fail" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that she loved the game and she suspects that The Veilguard's haters were intentionally trying to bring it down.</p><p>"I feel absolutely devastated for BioWare as a studio that they got such mixed reactions to the game," said Wilton Regan. "I personally thought it was a really strong game. I thought it was just BioWare being more BioWare. I also think a lot of people kind of wanted to see it fail, or wanted to see [BioWare] fail, either because they're just really bad people on the interne--of which there are unfortunately many, as we have discovered... "People were attacking the game before it was released. It's ridiculous. How can you judge a game, a book, a film, a TV show before it's actually released? You can't. It's an idiotic stance to take."</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like Dragon Age will get a sequel any time soon. EA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">shifted some of BioWare's developers</a> to other parts of the company, while leaving the remaining devs to tackle the next Mass Effect game. </p><p>EA chalked up The Veilguard's disappointing response to an "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">evolving industry landscape</a>." BioWare wasn't the only developer inside of EA to face layoffs. Earlier this week, EA shuttered Cliffhanger Games and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-its-developer-and-lays-off-additional-staff/1100-6531883/" data-ref-id="1100-6531883">canceled the AAA Black Panther game</a> that was in development.</p>

                <p>The Duchess is one of the eight available classes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, but it's not one that you'll have unlocked by default at the start of the game. Instead, you have to complete a specific action to unlock the class and start using it on your expeditions.</p><p>Of course, if you already have the Duchess unlocked in Nightreign, then you might be wondering the best way to build out the class. Fortunately, we have you covered on both fronts. You can see our full detailed guide below on how to unlock the Duchess and the best build for it in Nightreign. You can also check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-nightreign-classes-and-tier-list/2900-6624/" data-ref-id="2900-6624">tier list for all eight classes</a> so you can see how the Duchess stacks up to its counterparts.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_unlock_the_Duchess_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to unlock the Duchess in Elden Ring Nightreign</a></li><li><a href="#Duchess_class_overview_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Duchess class overview in Elden Ring Nightreign</a><ul><li><a href="#Passive_Ability__Magnificent_Pose">Passive Ability: Magnificent Pose</a></li><li><a href="#Character_Skill__Restage">Character Skill: Restage</a></li><li><a href="#Ultimate_Art__Finale">Ultimate Art: Finale</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_Relics_for_the_Duchess_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Best Relics for the Duchess in Elden Ring Nightreign</a><ul><li><a href="#Old_Pocketwatch">Old Pocketwatch</a></li><li><a href="#Golden_Dew">Golden Dew</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="How_to_unlock_the_Duchess_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to unlock the Duchess in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>First and foremost, you need to know how to unlock the Duchess if you want to start using the class.</p><p>You won't be able to unlock the Duchess until you defeat the first expedition boss in Nightreign, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-tricephalos-boss-guide-how-to-beat-gladius/1100-6531888/" data-ref-id="1100-6531888">Tricephalos</a>. This is the only major boss you have access to after completing the tutorial, and you can go on the expedition to fight the boss by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-roundtable-hold-guide/2900-6607/" data-ref-id="2900-6607">interacting with the Roundtable Hold's</a> central table.</p><p>After you have defeated the Tricephalos boss, you'll receive an "Old Pocketwatch" as a reward for completing the expedition. This Old Pocketwatch can be used as a Relic at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-relics-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531727/" data-ref-id="1100-6531727">Relic Rites station</a> in the Roundtable Hold. However, you don't want to make plans with the Old Pocketwatch just yet, as it's the main way to unlock the Duchess class.</p><p>With the Old Pocketwatch in your inventory, go speak with the white-gowned woman who first spoke to you upon arriving at the Roundtable Hold. During the dialogue with the woman, she'll ask you to give her the Old Pocketwatch, as it was hers to begin with. You can either choose to hand over the Old Pocketwatch or keep it for yourself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504107-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.42.30.59.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504107" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504107-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.42.30.59.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504107"></a><figcaption>Choosing to hand over the Old Pocketwatch or keep it. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504107-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.42.30.59.png"></figure><p>You want to choose to hand over the Old Pocketwatch to the woman. Doing this results in the woman trusting you more, causing her to reveal her true identity. The woman is the Duchess herself, and as soon as you hand the watch over, she transforms into the Duchess. You now have full access to the Duchess in Elden Ring Nightreign, and you also get to keep the Old Pocketwatch as a usable Relic.</p><h2 id="Duchess_class_overview_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Duchess class overview in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>The Duchess is unlike any other class in Nightreign, as she excels in quick combat with fast attacks and speedy movement. However, with this speed, the Duchess doesn't have a ton of HP, so you'll need to use your movement to weave your way in and out of battles to avoid being hit too much. The Duchess's starting weapon is a dagger that can attack extremely quickly, but doesn't do an overwhelming amount of damage per hit.</p><p>Here are all of the Duchess's abilities in Nightreign:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504109-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.46.05.94.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504109" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504109-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.46.05.94.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504109"></a><figcaption>All of the Duchess's skills in Elden Ring Nightreign.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504109-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.46.05.94.png"></figure><h3 id="Passive_Ability__Magnificent_Pose">Passive Ability: Magnificent Pose</h3><ul><li>Attack and dodge optimally, dodging repeatedly when necessary.</li></ul><p>The Duchess's increased movement abilities allow her to dodge over and over, which gives you the ability to avoid damage as much as possible.</p><h3 id="Character_Skill__Restage">Character Skill: Restage</h3><ul><li>Stage reprisal of recent occurrences to damage nearby foes.</li></ul><p>Restage is a fairly decent ability that gives the Duchess a chance to deal damage while not engaging with foes. You can stand back, cast the ability, and watch a phantom deal the same moves that you just dealt to the nearest enemy.</p><h3 id="Ultimate_Art__Finale">Ultimate Art: Finale</h3><ul><li>Obscure self and surrounding allies to hide from foes.</li></ul><p>This is a classic assassin-type skill that the Duchess can use to get out of trouble, sneak past enemies, or turn the aggression of a boss to another character. The Finale skill also obscures your nearby allies, though, so it's important to consider their positioning before casting it.</p><h2 id="Best_Relics_for_the_Duchess_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Best Relics for the Duchess in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>Now that we've gone over how to unlock the Duchess and all of her skills, it's time to build out the class using Relics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504111-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.14.38.57.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504111" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504111-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.14.38.57.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504111"></a><figcaption>The Duchess' Goblet can be purchased at the Small Jar Bazaar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504111-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.14.38.57.png"></figure><p>For starters, it's best to go to the Small Jar Bazaar and purchase the Duchess' Goblet for 1,200 Murk. This gives you a new set of Relic Rites, which include two orange slots and one green slot. By default, you have access to the Duchess' Urn (two red slots, one blue slot). By swapping to the Duchess' Goblet, you're able to make use of much stronger Relics. You can also eventually upgrade to the Duchess' Chalice.</p><h3 id="Old_Pocketwatch">Old Pocketwatch</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504110-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.16.44.19.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504110" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504110-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.16.44.19.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504110"></a><figcaption>The Old Pocketwatch is one of the best Relics for the Duchess</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504110-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.16.44.19.png"></figure><p>Coincidentally, one of those Relics is the Old Pocketwatch, which is tailor-made for the Duchess. The Old Pocketwatch is a green Relic Rite and has the ability to restore FP upon successive attacks and gives a flat +3 to Dexterity, the main stat the Duchess utilizes.</p><p>The FP restoration after successive attacks is perfect for the Duchess since you can attack multiple times using her default dagger and any other fast weapons you find during an expedition.</p><h3 id="Golden_Dew">Golden Dew</h3><p>The other Relic you want to make sure you equip for the Duchess is the Golden Dew, which is an orange Relic Rite that can slide right alongside the Old Pocketwatch. The Golden Dew Relic is unlocked through the Duchess' Remembrance quest in Nightreign and offers improved Character Skill Attack Power for the Duchess specifically, as well as boosts the attack power of added Affinity Attacks.</p><p>The third Relic slot for the Duchess (using the Goblet) can be filled with other Relics that you earn as rewards while playing as the Duchess. You want to focus on the Dexterity attack, dagger attack power, and bonuses for attacking quickly.</p><p>That does it for our Duchess class guide in Elden Ring Nightreign.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6 Season 04 | Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Why these ads were added four seasons into Black Ops 6 instead of earlier (or preferably never) is unclear, but it's easy to see why players aren't exactly thrilled about them. For starters, it's not like the battle pass isn't already featured very prominently, as it has its own dedicated menu tab and there are frequent reminders for players to claim rewards and upgrade to the premium version.</p><p dir="ltr">Ads for weapon blueprints are equally frustrating. If a player hasn't kept up with each season, they may have numerous weapons they need to grind XP for in order to unlock. Buying a weapon blueprint for that weapon, however, unlocks it immediately. It's easy to see these in-game advertisements then as publisher Activision's way of trying to entice players to simply pay for access to new weapons.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1928155987409514677" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Activision has now added Bundle and Battle Pass advertisements to the Create a Class and Events tab with the Season 4 update in Black Ops 6 and Warzone. <a href="https://t.co/4rLvLbWmTe" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/4rLvLbWmTe</a></p>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1928155987409514677?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty is, of course, no stranger to microtransactions. Black Ops 6 has sold mini-event battle passes and even an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-has-an-option-to-pay-for-better-audio/1100-6527328/" data-ref-id="1100-6527328">option for better audio</a>, and its store is filled with so many weapon and Operator bundles it's hard to keep track. In-game advertisements for those microtransactions sadly feel par for the course, but it's still disappointing nonetheless.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what else is coming as part of Black Ops Season 4, new maps, modes, and weapons are available now, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wicks-ballerina-is-coming-to-call-of-duty/1100-6531722/" data-ref-id="1100-6531722">John Wick Ballerina crossover</a> set to begin later in the season.

Patch 1.02 is scheduled to release sometime next week and will improve the solo experience of playing this co-op game.</p><p>"Next week, Patch 1.02 will be released, and will include several bug fixes as well as improvements for solo expeditions," the official <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436889293345246" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elden Ring account on X</a> explained. While the full patch notes won't be released until next week, the account did tease some important updates coming to solo expeditions in Nightreign. After Patch 1.02, solo players will be able to revive themselves once per night-boss battle and gain more runes (a form of in-game currency) while playing.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436890924884471" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The following improvements for solo expeditions will be added to the game:<br>- The effect "Automatic Revival Upon Defeat", which allows revival once per night boss battle, will be added to solo expeditions.<br>- The amount of runes gained will be increased.<br>Thank you for your support.</p>  — ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436890924884471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Nightreign remixes the critically acclaimed 2022 game from Dark Souls creator From Software into a more multiplayer-focused experience where players take on tough bosses together. That said, players also have the option of going on these expeditions alone if they really want to, although even GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/" data-ref-id="1900-6418368">glowing review of Nightreign</a> admits that "it never feels like it was designed to accommodate a single player." After Patch 1.2, Nightreign should feel more welcoming to those solo players.</p><p>The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-players-warned-of-pc-performance-issues-in-day-one-patch-notes/1100-6531903/" data-ref-id="1100-6531903">received a day-one patch</a> that implemented some last-minute balance adjustments and warned of PC performance problems. It's currently unknown if Patch 1.02 will fix any of those performance issues. None of these balance, PC performance, or solo play issues have prevented Nightreign from becoming an instant success, though. It has already been confirmed that <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928451382111052101" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2 million people</a> have played Elden Ring Nightreign on its first day.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is available now for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

This will be hosted by Geoff Keighley (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-conference-schedule-2025/1100-6531627/" data-ref-id="1100-6531627">Summer Game Fest</a>, The Game Awards), and the event will be held inside the Orpheum Theatre. In case you can't make it, this showcase will also be livestreamed.</p><p>In addition to Keighley, Death Stranding creator Hideo Kojima will also be present, and there'll be a panel discussion with special guests.

Death Stranding 2 takes place 11 months after the first game, and the gameplay has been expanded with a day-and-night cycle, natural disasters, and new mechanized enemies that will menace protagonist Sam Porter Bridges. One of the big features from the first game being upgraded for the sequel is the Social Strand System, as you'll be able to grow your reputation and access new gear and resources on your journey.</p><p>In case you missed it, a new marketing campaign in Japan <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/secret-death-stranding-2-video-has-been-revealed-but-dont-get-too-excited/1100-6531775/">revealed a brief look at the game</a>, albeit through a Prepper ASMR lens that isn't nearly as exciting as the previous trailer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-in-june/1100-6529987/">and its tease of Pacific Rim-like fights</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-is-getting-a-limited-edition-dualsense-controller/1100-6531400/">Fans of Death Stranding can also preorder a special DualSense controller</a> right now.</p>

Not all of the seasonal content has arrived yet, but dataminers are already showing off new bundles planned for the in-game shop, including this upcoming weapon blueprint with a must-see weapon inspection.</p><p dir="ltr">As leaked by <a href="https://x.com/thund3rCOD/status/1928208792518267150" rel="nofollow ">Thund3r</a>, the "Combo Bash" Mastercraft weapon blueprint for Season 4's new FFAR1 assault rifle has a highly detailed weapon-inspection animation. The Combo Bash blueprint can be seen in the post below, which reveals a colorful, cel-shaded variant of the FFAR1 with an entire arcade fight scene taking place during the weapon inspection.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/thund3rCOD/status/1928208792518267150" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">A whole ass fight scene with this new Mastercraft 🔥 <br>This is the Combo Bash Mastercraft blueprint and inspection for the FFAR 1 <a href="https://t.co/OScxzgJqMN" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/OScxzgJqMN</a></p>  — Thund3r (@thund3rCOD) <a href="https://twitter.com/thund3rCOD/status/1928208792518267150?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Call of Duty has featured such a wild and detailed weapon inspection, but these over-the-top animations are usually reserved for the weapon blueprints found in Call of Duty Mobile. One of the most notable gun animations from the mobile version is a mythic weapon blueprint with a gun inspection that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-mobile-weapon-inspection-is-an-entire-ww2-cinematic-experience/1100-6522802/">includes an entire WW2 cinematic experience</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Those looking to score Black Ops 6's Combo Bash weapon blueprint will need to wait until Season 4's "Tracer Pack: Arcade Champ Mastercraft" bundle hits the shop. Activision has not released the date or price for the pack, but this is part of an arcade-themed bundle with an operator skin for Toro as well as additional cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 4's battle pass adds the new FFAR1 assault rifle and LC10 submachine gun, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-new-call-of-duty-season-4-guns-and-how-to-unlock-them-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/2900-6617/">more weapons will arrive in Season 4 Reloaded</a>.
