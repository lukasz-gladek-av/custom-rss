                <p>Steve Downes, the voice of Master Chief in the Halo series, has teased that "big news" may be coming soon, and he's saying this not long after Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/news-on-halos-future-is-coming-very-soon/1100-6535104/" data-ref-id="1100-6535104">confirmed a big Halo reveal for later this month.</a></p><p>Downes shared a photo of himself from Collect-A-Con recently in Chicago wearing an "I Love Cortana" t-shirt. He said himself and Jen Taylor, the voice actress behind Cortana, are excited to attend the Halo World Championships at the end of the month. "PS: BIG NEWS A'COMIN!!" he said.</p><p>At the end of September, Microsoft reaffirmed plans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-rumors-of-halo-on-ps5-and-switch-2-microsoft-confirms-halo-news-is-coming/1100-6532848/" data-ref-id="1100-6532848">first announced in June</a> to reveal "what we've been working on" during the upcoming Halo World Championships event this October.</p><p>Halo Studios said the team will appear on the main stage to "talk about it." There will also be a "deep dive" panel lined up that Halo Studios says "you won't want to miss."</p><p>These events both take place on Friday, October 24. That's all Microsoft had to say--the company did not even specify if it plans to talk about new games or if the announcement could be something else.</p><p>Whatever the case, Microsoft has already confirmed it's working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">multiple new Halo projects</a>, and one of them is said to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744"> remake of the original Halo game for PS5 and Switch 2</a>.</p><p>2026 marks the 25th anniversary of Xbox and Halo, and Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-teases-2026-plans-including-possible-halo-release/1100-6532264/" data-ref-id="1100-6532264">Microsoft could release a new Halo project next year</a> alongside new Fable and Gears of War games.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382432-screenshot2024-10-10at10.10.10am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4382432" data-ratio="0.55941023417173" data-width="1153" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382432-screenshot2024-10-10at10.10.10am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4382432"></a><figcaption>A work-in-progress image of Halo made in Unreal Engine 5</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382432-screenshot2024-10-10at10.10.10am.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382433-screenshot2024-10-10at10.19.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382434-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.05am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382435-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.15am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382436-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.26am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382437-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.35am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4382433,1300-4382434,1300-4382435,1300-4382436,1300-4382437" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4382433-screenshot2024-10-10at10.19.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4382434-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.05am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4382435-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.15am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4382436-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.26am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4382437-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.35am.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382433-screenshot2024-10-10at10.19.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382434-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.05am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382435-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.15am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382436-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.26am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4382437-screenshot2024-10-10at10.20.35am.png"></figure><p>It was at 2024's Halo World Championships that Microsoft revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">"A New Dawn" trailer</a> that showed off concepts for new Halo projects in the Unreal Engine, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">Project Foundry</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Witchbrook</a>, the highly anticipated life-sim and social RPG from Chucklefish, has officially been delayed to 2026. Originally slated for a Winter 2025 release, the developers announced theyâ€™ve made the difficult decision to shift the release into next year, despite strong development progress.</p><p>"Witchbrook is a big project, and it's taking shape exactly as we hoped; full of charm, depth, and detail," the <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/development-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developer shared</a>, emphasizing its commitment to quality and maintaining a healthy work environment. Chucklefish added that while this approach can extend timelines, it leads to "better games" crafted by "developers who are healthy and well-rested."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWDGCwFZMbk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZWDGCwFZMbk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Set in the seaside city of Mossport, Witchbrook invites players to enroll at the magical Witchbrook College. As an aspiring witch, you'll uncover a rich world where the familiar and fantastical entwine. Players can expect to build lasting friendships, explore mystical environments, discover forgotten secrets, and even find love, all while learning to harness magic.</p><p>"We wanted to create a living, breathing world for you to explore," Chucklefish continued, and how it wanted a game full of "spellbinding stories, captivating quests, and enchanting systems."</p><p>To showcase the scale of the experience, the team also revealed the first look at the Map of Mossport, highlighting just how expansive the game world is. Every colored area on the map is fully playable--from the trails of Shadhollow Forest to the shores of Parasol Sands. The bustling Mossport High Street offers festivals and markets, while the Student Village hums with youthful energy.</p><p>The team promises more updates soon, including a deep dive into character customization and a new issue of The Witchbrook Oracle. Until then, Chucklefish and its co-developers at Robotality invite fans to get ready for the magic: "We can't wait to share more. Welcome to Mossport!"</p><p>Looking ahead, the extra development time has opened doors to exciting new opportunities, including support for additional platforms and languages. Witchbrook is now planned for release on PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, with more platforms to be confirmed.</p>

                <p>The war-torn sandboxes of any Battlefield multiplayer mode are primed for absurd and physics-defying moments, but an exploit in the newly released Battlefield 6 that lets you bounce off of ladders is in the crosshairs of the game's developers.</p><p>Assault-class players can equip a ladder in one of their gadget slots, giving them and their squadmates easier ways to traverse vertically to higher ground. But the ladder has some quirks with its physics, and players have found themselves bouncing off this piece of equipment when trying to climb.</p><p>As with any bug, people began experimenting to find ways to exploit it, leading to many gameplay clips online showcasing players "ladder launching" themselves airborne. It doesn't appear to be a particularly useful strategy at the moment, and players hoping to hone this technique probably won't get to use it in the long term.</p><p>In response to an X post calling for the bug to be patched, Battlefield lead producer <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1977705926476918979" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">David Sirland simply replied</a>: "We will."</p><p>Battlefield Studios has been quick to jump on player feedback, addressing issues like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-conquest-matches-are-speeding-up/1100-6535444/" data-ref-id="1100-6535444">pace of Conquest matches</a> and wonky hit detection. These fixes should put Battlefield 6 in a solid place before its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">first season launches on October 28</a>.</p><p>Less than a week after its release, Battlefield 6 already looks like a hit, much like that shot that didn't register, with one report claiming that the EA-published title has already produced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-almost-cod-like-launch-with-6-5-million-copies-sold-in-first-days-report/1100-6535428/" data-ref-id="1100-6535428">Call of Duty-like sales numbers</a> of around 6.5 million copies of the game sold.</p>

If you haven't played any Psikyo games yet and you're on PC, you'd be wise to purchase them soon, as they're being delisted from Steam at the end of October.</p><p>Due to a license expiring, following October 31, the following Psikyo games will no longer be available on Steam:</p><ul><li>Strikers 1945</li><li>Strikers 1945 II</li><li>Strikers 1945 III</li><li>Gunbird</li><li>Gunbird 2</li><li>Gunbarich</li><li>Samurai Aces</li><li>Samurai Aces Episode II: Tengai</li><li>Samurai Aces Episode III: Sengoku Cannon</li><li>Sol Divide</li><li>Dragon Blaze</li><li>Zero Gunner 2</li></ul><p>The delistings only apply to the Steam versions, so those looking to buy the games on other platforms, like <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/psikyo-shooting-stars-bravo-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOor1AZv8bT2C1YYW3KRBxJAD3JJpCbD2D_uHnK-feBRL3sjYmujV" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch</a>, will still be able to do so, and you can continue playing them on Steam past October 31 if you've purchased them.

Alongside the Strikers trilogy (and a Neo Geo version with some gameplay differences) the Gunbird and Samurai Aces series are among the highlights, as is the fantasy-themed Dragon Blaze. They offer a number of difficulty settings and tremendously fast-paced and polished action. Prior to iiRcade's shutdown in 2023, the majority of Psikyo games were also available on its digital store, which players can still enjoy if their cabinet didn't break like mine did.</p>

                <p>Battlefield Studios continues to update <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/" data-ref-id="1900-6418420">Battlefield 6</a> based on feedback, with the newest change addressing ticket numbers for the Conquest maps.</p><p>In a statement, Battlefield Studios said it's reducing the starting ticket-counts to help matches "finish at a more natural pace." The developer said its data showed that "many rounds" were concluding by time limit as opposed to when one team ran out of tickets, which is why it's making these new changes. The developer also pledged to continue looking at feedback and data to sure match flow "feels right."</p><p>For anyone unaware, in Battlefield games, tickets are reduced by killing enemies or holding more capture points than the other team. Here is a breakdown of the changes:</p><ul><li>Siege of Cairo from 1000 to 900</li><li>Empire State from 1000 to 900</li><li>Iberian Offensive from 1000 to 900</li><li>Liberation Peak From 1000 to 800</li><li>Manhattan Bridge From 1000 to 800</li><li>Operation Firestorm From 1000 to 700</li><li>New Sobek City from 1000 to 900</li><li>Mirak Valley from 1000 to 700</li></ul><p>Battlefield Studios also recently <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978400189476896968" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">made a change to Battlefield 6 to address hit-registration</a> after some people said it wasn't working properly. Another recent change included <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977809244906037359" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">increasing ticket-count for some maps for Rush mode, from 75 to 100</a>. There have been weapon-balance changes, too, including reduced muzzle velocity for the M2020 ESR and the PSR.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">Battlefield 6 Season 1 </a>launches on October 28, which is also the day the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">game's battle royale mode is rumored to launch.</a></p><p>Publisher Electronic Arts has not announced any sales numbers for Battlefield 6 yet, but one analyst estimated the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-call-of-duty-size-launch-with-6-5-million-copies-sold-in-4-days-report/1100-6535428/" data-ref-id="1100-6535428">sold 6.5 million copies out of the gate.</a></p>
