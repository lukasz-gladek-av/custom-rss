                <p>Despite everything, Undertale is now 10 years old. To celebrate the momentous occasion, a one-night-only orchestral concert, The Determination Symphony, has been announced. Those looking to <a href="http://www.eventimapollo.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">purchase tickets</a> for the exclusive event--which will take place at London's Eventim Apollo on June 22, 2025--can do so starting tomorrow, March 28, at 6 AM ET.</p><p>According to the event's press release, the concert will run for approximately two hours and will encompass Undertale's 10-year history, taking fans on a journey from "the initial fall at Mount Ebott, and leading them through Froggit Village, the Snowdin Temple, Temmie Village, and so much more." Accompanying this adventure is a 25-piece orchestra that will be performing developer Toby Fox's original music, which has received unending praise and critical-acclaim throughout the past decade. This praise includes that given in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/undertale-review-nintendo-switch-update/1900-6416315/" data-ref-id="1900-6416315">Undertale review</a>, in which we wrote, "Undertale's soundtrack has timeless appeal and is great at evoking emotions."</p><p>Lambert Jackson Productions, the London-based studio behind the Oliver award-nominated play Cruise, will be heading production for The Determination Symphony. The event is scheduled to take place at the Eventim Apollo (formerly the Hammersmith Apollo), one of London's premiere theaters.</p><p>In other Undertale news, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/undertale-sees-new-peak-for-steam-concurrent-players-nearly-a-decade-after-launching/1100-6530156/" data-ref-id="1100-6530156">recently broke its own Steam record</a> for concurrent players. After listing the game for $1 as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-spring-sale-2025-deals/2900-6318/#2" data-ref-id="2900-6318">Steam Spring Sale</a>, developer Toby Fox took to X to announce the news, writing that this was the first time this had happened since the game was released back in 2015. Last October, Fox confirmed that Undertale follow-up Deltarune's next chapters will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-will-definitely-be-released-in-2025-toby-fox-says/1100-6527507/" data-ref-id="1100-6527507">released some time in 2025</a>. The first two chapters of Deltarune are currently available for free on PC, PS4, and Switch.</p>
