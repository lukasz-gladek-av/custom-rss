                <p>Ubisoft reportedly canceled an entry in the Assassin’s Creed franchise last year after determining that its proposed setting--the American Civil War and the Reconstruction era of the 1860s and 1870s--was too controversial for its audience, according to the newsletter <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=175622801&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=1t4m1&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File.</a></p><p>The game, which was canceled early in development, would have put players in control of a Black protagonist who escaped enslavement and started a new life away from the South. He is later recruited by the Assassins, returns to the South, and confronts prominent racist groups like the Ku Klux Klan.</p><p>Three sources told Game File that the game was cancelled due to online backlash after the reveal of Yasuke, a historically-inspired Black samurai, as a protagonist in Assassin’s Creed Shadows and the uneasy political climate in the United States. Developers working on the project were upset, believing that the company was giving in to perceived controversy.</p><p>Ubisoft has developed and published Assassin's Creed games set in North America before. Assassin's Creed 3 takes place during the American Revolution, set in 18th-century Boston, New York City, and the American frontier. It follows two protagonists, including one half-Indigenous Assassin seeking to avenge the death of his mother.</p>

                <p>Literal walking simulator Baby Steps is already a punishing affair, but the game has one last trick up its sleeve that might make certain players fume with rage.</p><p>If you skip enough cutscenes in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/well-this-esrb-description-sure-is-a-wild-ride/1100-6534659/" data-ref-id="1100-6534659">wacky and raunchy Baby Steps</a>, you'll be treated (or penalized, depending how you look at it) with a meandering 28-minute long cutscene full of meta jokes and haphazard conversation topics, which user Cuttyflame shared on YouTube (per <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/skipping-all-baby-steps-cutscenes-unlocks-a-secret-28-minute-punishment-cutscene/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>).</p><p>Baby Steps, which was made by Ape Out developers Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and QWOP creator Bennett Foddy, actively discourages players you skipping story cutscenes, requiring you to complete minigames that increase in complexity each subsequent time you try to skip a scene.</p><p>Skipping around 30 cutscenes results in this shaggy dog story of a cutscene playing at the end of the story, according to Cuttyflame.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQahQACsvPU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mQahQACsvPU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The secret ending cutscene has protagonist Nate, voiced by Cuzzillo, reaching the cabin of donkey-human hybrid Moose, voiced by Foddy. Nate makes some fourth wall-breaking comments about the player skipping cutscenes, beginning a long-winded conversation with a spread of topics.</p><p>From their interest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-new-ip-intergalactic-has-the-deepest-gameplay-the-studio-has-ever-done/1100-6531793/" data-ref-id="1100-6531793">Naughty Dog's next game</a> to their favorite fictional clowns, Cuzzillo and Foddy go on and on, adding in additional jabs toward cutscene skippers and joking that they'll likely skip this scene as well.</p><p>The role of non-interactive cinematics in what is otherwise a very interactive medium of entertainment has always been a subject of debate, but this extended scene almost feels like Cuzzillo and Foddy putting a spotlight on their voicework and shaming players for missing out on it, though all in good fun.</p><p>Baby Steps is currently available only on PlayStation 5 and PC, along with being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baby-steps-is-steam-deck-verified-meaning-you-can-just-throw-the-whole-system-when-frustrated/1100-6534828/" data-ref-id="1100-6534828">verified for Steam Deck</a>. Just think twice about skipping those cutscenes, though.</p>

                <p>Company of Heroes developer Relic Entertainment is keen to make and release games faster, CEO Justin Dowdeswell said in a new interview, but the company isn't banking on AI to get there.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-relic-entertainment-wants-to-make-games-more-quickly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>, Dowdeswell said one of the company's Achilles heels is that it has taken too long to release new games. "There's long stretches of time between game releases, and you lose touch with the players, people lose touch with what you're up to--and they generally cost a lot more, the longer they take," he said.</p><p>Part of what Relic will look to do in the future is "get to market more frequently," and that doesn't mean the company wants to lower the quality bar and simply ship things faster for the sake of it.</p><p>How can Relic achieve this? Already, the studio has improved how fast it can prototype new ideas, Dowdeswell said, noting that staffers can now get a prototype up and running in four weeks. The executive added that improving project management and specifically controlling scope is another way.</p><p>Could AI help Relic make games even faster, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">some developers are attempting</a>? Dowdeswell said businesses around the world today are "trying to figure out" how AI can help them, and right now, AI tools and systems are helpful for Relic in "workflows around the office."</p><p>"Even just reviewing something or summarizing something. I get more done. And I think that there's something in that concept of getting more done, that's part of where the power is," he said.</p><p>As for actual game development, Dowdeswell said humans will continue to be essential to the process. "We still need people making decisions, we still need people coming up with ideas, we still need people creating an architecture," he said. "And for me at least, it's not about replacing people, it's just [about taking] some of the slightly more annoying things off the list and getting them done more quickly. There's power in that."</p><p>Dowdeswell said AI may be able to be implemented in game development to help people with "augmenting skills" they already have.</p><p>Relic "can't ignore" AI, Dowdeswell said, but he's not ready to go all-in yet, either. "So I think understanding how it serves us and where it serves us is the starting point. And then as we gain experience with it, understanding where we want it to stop, I think that's important," he said.</p><p>Another area of concern around AI for Relic is regarding public perception. Right now, Dowdeswell said, "I don't think we have an answer for that," but it's something the studio is "in the middle of figuring out collectively."</p><p>People have concerns about AI for a variety of reasons, including the possibility of job losses, copyright and plagiarism issues, and a number of other elements. Thanks in part to AI, Nvidia's market cap has exceeded $4 trillion and the company is now the world's most valuable by a significant margin. Some have expressed fears of an AI bubble that could pop and lead to a number of negative consequences.</p><p>Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine-learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a> EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a> Meanwhile, Candy Crush developers who got laid off by Activision Blizzard said they are <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being replaced by AI tools they helped create.</a> A recent report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further implement AI systems to help ramp up development amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">private sale to an investor consortium.</a></p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Microsoft unleashed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">a massive wave of layoffs</a> and game cancellations, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">Project Blackbird</a>, an MMO that was described as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-elder-scrolls-online-teams-reportedly-canceled-mmo/1100-6533760/" data-ref-id="1100-6533760">a cross between Cyberpunk 2077 and Destiny</a> from the team behind The Elder Scrolls Online. Now, that team has reunited to form an employee-owned studio, Sackbird Studios.</p><p>The studio shared the announcement on <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/news/studio-takes-flight" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">its official site</a>, and noted that Sackbird is self-funded "for multiple years" without the aid of outside investors. That will allow the team to retain full creative control of their own games.</p><p>"After years in AAA, we wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets, said Sackbird Studios chief creative officer David Worley in a statement. "We're fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games."</p><p>"We're grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people," added Sackbird CEO Lee Ridout. "When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft--and our team--was to create a studio where creative independence isn't negotiable."</p><p>The announcement notes that there are under ten current employees in the studio. Sackbird isn't ready to disclose its first game yet beyond sharing that it will be an original project, which will be available on PC and consoles. The studio also reaffirmed the team's desire to craft "bold, character-driven experiences free from corporate compromises."</p>
