                <p>Valve has unveiled its first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">its new gaming machines</a>, including Steam Frame, a virtual reality headset that can handle VR and non-VR games. Apparently, Steam Frame is also being used as a way to bring Android games directly to Steam users.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Valve will support and encourage developers to bring Android apps to Steam. As part of this initiative, Valve will release a Steam Frame developer kit for developers who already use Android APKs for apps and VR headsets on Android phones.</p><p>"From the user's perspective, our preference is that they don't even have to think about it," explains Valve engineer Jeremy Selan. "They just have their titles on Steam, they download them and hit play ... They're really VR developers who want to publish their VR content, and they're porting a mobile VR title where they're already familiar with how to make those APKs. They are now free to bring those to Steam, and they'll just work on this device."</p><p>This seamless transition from Android to Steam is possible because Steam Frame uses an Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, which can run the apps directly. That will allow the Android games and VR apps to be easily accessed on Steam Frame.</p><p>In addition to Steam Frame, Valve announced a Steam Machine that can bring PC games to living rooms like a console, as well as a new Steam Controller. Valve <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">hasn't disclosed pricing for any of its new Steam hardware</a> yet, but hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Steam Machine will likely be competitively priced to be an affordable alternative to consoles.</p><p>"If you're trying to make a PC that has similar features and similar performance, I think the Steam Machine is going to be a really competitive price to that and provide really good value to it," said Aldehayyat.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/runescape-3/" data-ref-id="5000-174981">RuneScape's</a> Treasure Hunter microtransactions will soon be no more, after the game's community overwhelmingly voted to see it and other similar microtransactions removed. Developer Jagex is calling it a "new era" for the MMORPG.</p><p dir="ltr">In a video announcing the decision, Jagex CEO Jon Bellamy (known to the community as Mod North) said "the community has spoken," and as such, Treasure Hunter will be removed on January 19, 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">The feature sees players granted keys each day that can be used to open what are effectively loot boxes containing XP, gold, and more. While players are granted a number of keys for free each day, keys can also be bought for real money. More than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/runescapes-future-may-be-radically-reshaped-after-fan-vote/1100-6535811/" data-ref-id="1100-6535811">120,000 players voted</a> to see Treasure Hunter and other microtransactions removed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCjHVGbFwr4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JCjHVGbFwr4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That is, however, just the start of Jagex's plans. Bellamy said on the same day Treasure Hunter is removed, Jagex will also significantly reduce the amount of "gameplay-impacting MTX across the board." That includes the ability to purchase items that grant direct XP, as well as other items like Proteans, Dummies, and more, North said.</p><p dir="ltr">"January 19 is the start of a new era for RuneScape, powered by a shared desire to see this game grow for decades to come," North said.</p><p dir="ltr">Next year, Jagex will release an "integrity roadmap" that will address core issues surrounding the game, including the user interface and user experience, the game's visual identity, and more. Additional details will be shared on January 19.</p><p dir="ltr">Removing Treasure Hunter has been a long time coming. In June, Bellamy noted in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbIXekZocI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> that its approach to microtransactions was "harming RuneScape" and stated "it's time that we took action. Jagex then experimented with a number of different changes to in-game purchases. In September, Bellamy said in an <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/jagex-prepared-to-take-financial" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a> that Jagex "probably won't maintain the revenue that we currently are" when making changes to microtransactions.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's the truth," Bellamy said. "But equally, if we're taking a 10 or 15 or 25-year view, some short-term pain is probably worth the restoration of the game if we can get to that point."</p><p dir="ltr">Jagex's adherence to a community vote for the removal of Treasure Hunter is similar to how it handles the much less microtransaction-heavy Old School RuneScape. Released in 2013 and based on the 2007 version of RuneScape, Old School Runescape is now far more popular than the more modern RuneScape (aka RuneScape 3). New features are only added to Old School RuneScape if 70% of its community votes for them.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/old-school-runescape-is-more-popular-than-ever-breaks-concurrent-player-record/1100-6533697/" data-ref-id="1100-6533697">Old School RuneScape is more popular than ever before</a>, and even broke player number records earlier this year with more than 241,000 concurrent players. The MMO's first new skill as voted on by the community, <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/sailing-launches-on-november-19th?oldschool=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sailing</a>, is set to release November 19.</p>

                <p>Even former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime was surprised by the somewhat sparse launch lineup of the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>"I wouldn't be completely honest if [I didn't say] from a business perspective, when I first saw that lineup, I scratched my head a little bit," said Fils-Aime--who served as Nintendo of America's president and chief operating officer from 2006 until he retired in 2019--during an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about?triedRedirect=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "But I think certainly what I underestimated was the enhanced performance, the enhanced Nintendo Switch 1 content, I think has been compelling. The stuff that you get for free as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, I think that has helped drive some of the momentum. And then certainly Bananza was a key driver for them."</p><p>When the original Switch launched in 2017, it was accompanied by The Legend of Zelda: Breathe of the Wild and joined later in the year by Super Mario Odyssey. Switch 2's big launch title was Mario Kart World in June 2025, followed by Donkey Kong Bananza a month later. But while many didn't consider those games to be system sellers, they were both hits with players and critics alike.</p><p>Fils-Aime attributed the success of the Switch 2 launch to Nintendo's global team and noted that "being able to successfully launch a new system after you've had historical success with the prior system is quite a challenge." He pointed to several examples of that, including Nintendo following the Wii with the less successful Wii U.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-alum-reggie-subtly-roasts-switch-2-welcome-tour-price/1100-6530775/" data-ref-id="1100-6530775">Fils-Aime appeared to disagree</a> with Nintendo's decision to charge $10 for the Switch 2 Welcome Pack. As a contrast, he compared it to his decision to release Wii Sports as an included title for Wii consoles in North America. In 2022, Fils-Aime predicted that the large number of studio acquisitions by Sony and Microsoft would lead <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-nintendo-of-america-boss-reggie-fils-aime-reacts-to-microsoft-and-sonys-acquisition-sprees/1100-6507374/" data-ref-id="1100-6507374">to senior designers breaking away</a> and launching their own innovative games. There have been some high-profile directors and designers that left larger companies, but Fils-Aime noted a lack of innovation during his new interview.</p><p>"I do hope that this industry doesn't stagnate," said Fils-Aime. "There are, at times, signs that the innovation isn't there. The breakthrough new type of content seems to be a little bit further and far between. That concerns me, and I hope that doesn't stop."</p>
