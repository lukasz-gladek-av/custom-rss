                <p>The PC version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> has been out for almost a decade, and it's been endlessly modded in the intervening 10 years. However, the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5s-new-enhanced-pc-edition-how-to-preload-and-transfer-story-progress-for-free/1100-6529782/" data-ref-id="1100-6529782">Grand Theft Auto 5 Enhanced</a> upgrade isn't compatible with mods from the prior version. But now, it looks like Rockstar is opening the door for those mods to make the leap into the Enhanced era, courtesy of the team behind its FiveM and RedM creator communities.</p><p>Cfx.re, which was brought into Rockstar in 2023, <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/coming-soon-new-official-modding-utility/5312475" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has revealed</a> that it is developing a new official mod tool that will "assist the modding community in making their assets compatible with the new upgrade."</p><p>According to the announcement, Cfx.re hasn't set a release date for the mod tool yet. But it notes that that "we're currently focused on completing the final few tasks required to release the tool." The full announcement of the tool, with "comprehensive documentation," will be shared on the day it goes live.</p><p>While GTA 5 Enhanced gave the PC version upgraded visuals, it's also been bombarded with bad reviews on Steam. The original version of GTA 5 has also been delisted on Steam, which means that the enhanced version is the only one available to new players.</p><p>For now, GTA 5 Enhanced will be the only modern Grand Theft Auto game on PC, since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-breakdown-easter-eggs-references-and-teases/2900-4973/" data-ref-id="2900-4973">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will only be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S when it's released later this year. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/" data-ref-id="1100-6529346">PC version of GTA 6</a> is expected to be released at some point, but it's currently unannounced. There's been persistent chatter that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-100-could-reward-players-too-analysts-argue/1100-6529948/" data-ref-id="1100-6529948">GTA 6 could arrive with a $100 price tag</a>, but Rockstar has yet to comment on that or confirm pricing.</p>

                <p>The God of War franchise is turning 20 years old later this month, and to celebrate, developer Sony Santa Monica has announced a free update to God of War Ragnarok that'll go live on March 20. Inspired by the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-wars-kratos-almost-had-a-different-name/1100-6468253/" data-ref-id="1100-6468253">working title of 2005's God of War</a>, as well as the skin that players could earn in God of War 2 if they finished the game on God Mode difficulty, the Dark Odyssey collection includes several cosmetic skins for Kratos and his weapons, and outfits for Atreus and Freya.</p><p>Beyond that, fans can also expect the franchise to celebrate its impressive milestone with an art exhibition, game sales, and some retail therapy as there'll be quite a lot of celebratory merchandise available to purchase.</p><p>First up, the Dark Odyssey collection adds a modern version of the black and gold character skin that can be equipped to Kratos, complementary armor pieces, new armor sets for companions, and new weapon cosmetics. One thing to note here is that the Dark Odyssey cosmetics for weapons and shields are made specifically for the <strong>fully upgraded version of each weapon </strong>and will only be available for use upon reaching that upgrade level.</p><p>Here's the full list of everything:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4459549-daryodyssey%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4459549" data-ratio="0.33896185115697" data-width="1599" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4459549-daryodyssey%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4459549"></a><figcaption>God of War Dark Odyssey skin</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4459549-daryodyssey%282%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4459550-daryodyssey%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4459551-daryodyssey%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4459552-daryodyssey%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4459550,1300-4459551,1300-4459552" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4459550-daryodyssey%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4459551-daryodyssey%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4459552-daryodyssey%284%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4459550-daryodyssey%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4459551-daryodyssey%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4459552-daryodyssey%284%29.jpg"></figure><p><strong>Dark Odyssey armor and appearance for Kratos</strong></p><ul><li>Dark Odyssey Kratos appearance</li><li>Dark Odyssey armor set for Kratos (Dark Odyssey Breastplate, Dark Odyssey Bracers, and Dark Odyssey Belt)</li></ul><p><strong>Dark Odyssey companion armor </strong></p><ul><li>Dark Odyssey vestment for Atreus</li><li>Dark Odyssey witch frock for Freya</li></ul><p><strong>Dark Odyssey weapon appearances and attachments</strong></p><ul><li>Dark Odyssey Leviathan Axe appearance and Dark Odyssey knob attachment</li><li>Dark Odyssey Blades of Chaos appearance and Dark Odyssey handles attachment</li><li>Dark Odyssey Draupnir Spear appearance and Dark Odyssey hind attachment</li></ul><p><strong>Dark Odyssey shield appearances and rond</strong></p><ul><li>Dark Odyssey Guardian Shield appearance</li><li>Dark Odyssey Dauntless Shield appearance</li><li>Dark Odyssey Stone Wall Shield appearance</li><li>Dark Odyssey Shatter Start Shield appearance</li><li>Dark Odyssey Onslaught Shield appearance</li><li>Dark Odyssey Spartan Aspis Shield appearance</li><li>Dark Odyssey rond</li></ul><p>Sony also plans to host an art exhibition in partnership with Gallery Nucleus in Los Angeles, California.

(Players with save files beyond level 30 will still receive these additional points.)</li><li dir="ltr">The game now includes a new high-contrast documents setting, allowing players to increase font size and apply bold formatting to nearly all in-game text, including documents, tutorials, pop-ups, and the quest tab.</li><li dir="ltr">Players using a mouse and keyboard can now toggle between walking and running.</li><li dir="ltr">A HUD-hiding keybind (default: backslash) has been added for easier screenshotting, along with a HUD opacity slider that allows players to tweak its transparency.</li><li dir="ltr">A third-person FOV slider has been added, and can be found in the game's graphics settings.</li><li dir="ltr">A new static compass option now allows players to choose between a rotating compass or one that always points North.</li><li dir="ltr">Full support for customizing controller keybinds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The patch also includes stability improvements (for both PC and Xbox), and quite a few fixes for bugs related to quests, companions, environmental collision, and more.

Nintendo has not published any sales projections for the system, but one analyst has now said the new console will fail to sell as many units right away compared to the original system. </p><p>Joost Van Dreunen of Aldora said in a <a href="https://www.beautiful.ai/player/-OL44iya9VPmIeTHhtHw/ALDORAs-SXSW-2025-State-of-Play-Report" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report</a> that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">Switch 2's backwards compatibility support</a>, along with its "relatively modest technical improvements," will "ensure a slower adoption curve." This will be particularly pronounced for cost-conscious consumers, Van Dreunen said. The analyst said the Switch 2 is projected to sell for about $400 at launch, which is $100 more than the Switch launched at in 2017. Other analysts have suggested similar price points, while one analyst believes it could <a

a specific unit sales projection for the Switch 2. For comparison, the original Switch sold 13.12 million units during its first calendar year. A different analyst, meanwhile, is projecting the Switch 2 to have the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-higher-chip-price-could-make-system-500-analyst-says/1100-6530129/" data-ref-id="1100-6530129">biggest console launch in history and sell 20 million units in its first year.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, George Jijiashvili of Omdia told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/analysts-say-nintendo-switch-2-wont-outsell-the-original-switch-but-thats-okay" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that the Switch 2 could sell 14.7 million units through its first calendar year, exceeding the first-year sales of the original Switch. The Switch 2 won't be able to sell as many lifetime units, however, Jijiashvili said. The Switch has sold <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 150 million units</a>, making it the No. 2 best-selling console ever, only behind the PS2.</p><p>Nintendo will further discuss the Switch 2 during a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Nintendo Direct broadcast on April 2</a>.

One of the games expected to come to Switch 2 is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-9/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">new Mario Kart game</a>.</p>
