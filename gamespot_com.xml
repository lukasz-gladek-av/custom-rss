                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is still a little over 10 months away, assuming its November 2026 release window holds. Earlier this week, GTA 6 watchers were unsettled when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier noted that the game might not be as "content complete" as Rockstar has said in the past, and he didn't rule out another delay. Some fans took that as if GTA 6 was already pushed back again, which is why Schreier has stepped forward to clarify his comments.</p><p>During a recent appearance on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EANk4uOn68ddip6pKliqY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Button Mash</a> podcast, Schreier said, "The last I heard, [GTA 6] was still not content complete. That is to say people were still finishing things up, still finalizing levels, and missions, and seeing what is going to make it into the game." He added that he doesn't "think anyone at Rockstar can tell you, with 100% certainty, that they will make it out in November."</p><p>Schreier responded to reports based on his comments by reiterating that he "wouldn't be shocked if GTA 6 'does' come out this fall, following the same delay pattern as [Red Dead Redemption 2]." He also characterized some of the reports as, "a complete misunderstanding of what I said."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/app.bsky.feed.post/3mbw6vt7l3s25" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreifmmw55edle55ebrtjxurpv4qjqd4af2eggqctnleafiyz5jz2saq" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><div><p>This is a complete misunderstanding of what I said, which is that I wouldn't be shocked if GTA6 *does* come out this fall, following the same delay pattern as RDR2. Of course another delay is possible. It's a video game. But this blog post is very misleading (just reach out to me - it's not hard!)</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3mbw6vt7l3s25?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow ">[image or embed]</a></p></div>  — Jason Schreier (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow ">@jasonschreier.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3mbw6vt7l3s25?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow ">January 8, 2026 at 6:28 AM</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>As Schreier and others have previously noted, Rockstar does have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-did-rockstar-delay-gta-6/1100-6536423/" data-ref-id="1100-6536423">a history of delaying its AAA games</a>, and GTA 6 in particular has already been pushed back twice. It's been reported that the current delay <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-could-cost-rockstar-60-million-as-insiders-report-game-is-content-complete/1100-6536115/" data-ref-id="1100-6536115">may cost Rockstar upwards of $60 million</a>.</p><p>Some analysts continue to make the case that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-warrants-a-100-price-tag-gta-5-actor-says/1100-6535876/" data-ref-id="1100-6535876">GTA 6 could be $100 for its standard edition</a>, which would potentially encourage other publishers to raise their prices as well. For now, Rockstar has yet to commit to a price for GTA 6.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is scheduled to be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on November 19.</p>

                <p>Near the end of 2024, CD Projekt Red put <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-4/" data-ref-id="5000-561041">The Witcher 4</a> into full development with a release date potentially years away. Now, some outlets are putting forth theories that there may be a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/" data-ref-id="5000-167462">Witcher 3</a> expansion to fill the gap between the present and the fourth game's release.</p><p><a href="https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw?_gl=1*15mojc3*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTI2MzU0NjY5LjE3Njc4OTI3MzQ.*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3Njc4OTI3MzQkbzEkZzAkdDE3Njc4OTI3MzQkajYwJGwwJGgw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN Poland</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> separately released stories suggesting that The Witcher 3 will get its first expansion since Blood and Wine was released in 2016. Eurogamer's report suggests that the drive to release something new this year is because CD Projekt Red is behind sales goals that would trigger financial incentives for its employees.</p><p>That program has been <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mentioned by the company itself</a>, which stated in a 2025 investor's call that, "There is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year, having an impact on our results and increasing the likelihood of achieving the earnings condition for the first stage of the incentive program."</p><p>The report from IGN Poland offers some speculative details about what The Witcher 3 expansion may contain, including Zerrikania, "an exotic desert region to the far east of The Witcher 3's current map." Blood and Wine did refer to the Zerrikanian Manticore School, which could be followed-up on if the report is accurate.</p><p>For now, neither report is confirmed. CD Projekt Red has only announced that The Witcher 3 will get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-3-adding-a-big-new-feature-10-years-after-launch/1100-6531938/" data-ref-id="1100-6531938">one final update</a> that will allow console players to enjoy many of the mods that PC players have used for years. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-3s-last-patch-is-delayed/1100-6535045/" data-ref-id="1100-6535045">that update was pushed back to this year</a> late in 2025. Outside of the games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-season-5-coming-this-year-will-end-the-series/1100-6537256/" data-ref-id="1100-6537256">The Witcher Season 5</a> will wrap up its run on Netflix in 2026.</p>
