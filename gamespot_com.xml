                <p>Want to know when the next Grow A Garden update is? Releasing weekly since the game started in March 2025, every new patch brings new items and plenty of other fun to keep you playing and collecting all the different plant and pet variants. Some events are more elaborate in their design, introducing Obbies and other secret areas to discover.</p><p dir="ltr">Every update in this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/">Roblox game</a> brings along with it a whole bunch of new unlockables, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grow-a-garden-pets-tier-list/2900-7008/">Grow A Garden pets</a> with themed effects, seeds to grow in your garden, and even occasionally new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-grow-a-garden-mutations/1100-6534388/">Grow A Garden mutations</a> never seen before. The best events are ones that require a little more time playing the game, such as exploring new areas outside of the main garden. The rewards are worth the effort, so below are all the details we know about the upcoming update, what’s currently in the game you should get as soon as possible, and what Admin Abuse events are.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_is_the_next_Grow_A_Garden_update_">When is the next Grow A Garden update?</a></li><li><a href="#Current_Grow_A_Garden_event">Current Grow A Garden event</a><ul><li><a href="#New_gear">New gear</a></li><li><a href="#New_seeds">New seeds</a></li><li><a href="#New_pets">New pets</a></li><li><a href="#New_cosmetic_items">New cosmetic items</a></li><li><a href="#Chubby_Chipmunk_weight_rewards">Chubby Chipmunk weight rewards</a></li><li><a href="#Season_Pass_items">Season Pass items</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Admin_Abuse_events">Admin Abuse events</a></li></ul></div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4580115-next-grow-a-garden-update-unknown.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580115" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4580115-next-grow-a-garden-update-unknown.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580115"></a><figcaption>When a new update has been released or we don't know anything about the next event, you'll see this image.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4580115-next-grow-a-garden-update-unknown.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_is_the_next_Grow_A_Garden_update_">When is the next Grow A Garden update?</h2><p dir="ltr">The next Grow A Garden update begins on Saturday, October 11, at 10 AM ET / 7 AM PT. This weekend’s update is currently unknown, but it will likely introduce a new feature to the Event space in the garden. Expect new rewards, seeds, pets, quality-of-life updates, and weather conditions.</p><p dir="ltr">During a previous Admin Abuse event, it was announced by one of the mods, Jhailatte, that the developers are looking to “release some more long-term content soon”. This may mean that the evolving seeds and the season pass from the previous week's event, or it could indicate that some permanent new features will appear in-game in the near future.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4580117-next-grow-a-garden-update-chubby-chipmunk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580117" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4580117-next-grow-a-garden-update-chubby-chipmunk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580117"></a><figcaption>The Nut Acorns stand in the Event space during the Chubby Chipmunk update has a free Chipmunk that you should grab as soon as possible.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4580117-next-grow-a-garden-update-chubby-chipmunk.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Current_Grow_A_Garden_event">Current Grow A Garden event</h2><p dir="ltr">The current Grow A Garden event began on Saturday, October 4, at 10 AM ET / 7 AM PT and will last one week. The Chubby Chipmunk update adds a special event in the center of the map with a free Chubby Chipmunk pet. Collecting it and putting it in your garden will cause it to feed every few minutes, resulting in an Acorn spawning on the map. Collect it to get one of the rewards below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Watering Can x15 - 14.12%</li><li dir="ltr">Event Lantern x20 - 12.24%</li><li dir="ltr">Godly Sprinkler x2 - 11.29%</li><li dir="ltr">Legendary Egg x1 - 11.29%</li><li dir="ltr">Reclaimer x3 - 10.35%</li><li dir="ltr">Nutty Crate x1 - 8.47%</li><li dir="ltr">Silver Fertilizer x1 - 6.59%</li><li dir="ltr">Nutty Chest x1 - 5.65%</li><li dir="ltr">Master Sprinkler x1 - 5.18%</li><li dir="ltr">Medium Treat x1 - 3.29%</li><li dir="ltr">Medium Toy x1 - 3.29%</li><li dir="ltr">Mythical Egg x1 - 2.82%</li><li dir="ltr">Nutty Chest x2 - 2.35%</li><li dir="ltr">Grandmaster Sprinkler x1 - 2.35%</li><li dir="ltr">Rainbow Fertilizer x1 - 0.47%</li><li dir="ltr">Pet Shard Nutty x1 - 0.24%</li></ul><p>In addition, the vendor will collect up to 1,500 points worth of plants you give him, causing the Nutty Fever weather condition to occur for 5 minutes. This will speed up the rate at which the Chubby Chipmunk feeds to once every 30 seconds. The amount you give to the vendor is tied to the player, and other players can't fill it for you, but it will retain progress if you change servers.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="New_gear">New gear</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Energy Chew</strong>: (Use on a pet to immediately activate its passive ability) - Chubby Chipmunk weight event reward (2.15kg, 13.65kg, and 36.48kg</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Pet Shard Nutty</strong>: (Gives a pet the Nutty mutation) - Chubby Chipmunk event acorn reward (0.24%)</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="New_seeds">New seeds</h3><ul><li><strong>Hazelnut </strong>- Nutty Chest (34.5%)</li><li><strong>Persimmon</strong> - Nutty Chest (14.5%)</li><li><strong>Acorn</strong> - Nutty Chest (1%)</li><li><strong>Acorn Squash</strong> - Chubby Chipmunk weight event reward (5.88kg)</li><li><strong>Ferntail</strong> - Chubby Chipmunk weight event reward (24.99kg)</li><li><strong>Pecan</strong> - Chubby Chipmunk weight event reward (50kg)</li><li><strong>Fissure Berry </strong>- obtain from the Hyrax pet.</li></ul><h3 id="New_pets">New pets</h3><ul><li><strong>Chubby Chipmunk</strong> - collect for free at the Event Stand.</li><li><strong>Farmer Chipmunk</strong> - Nutty Chest (34.5%)</li><li><strong>Idol Chipmunk</strong> - Nutty Chest (14.5%)</li><li><strong>Chinchilla</strong> - Nutty Chest (1%)</li><li><strong>Hyrax</strong> - Chubby Chipmunk weight event reward (30.48kg)</li><li><strong>Fortune Squirrel</strong> - Chubby Chipmunk weight event reward (46.43kg)</li></ul><h3 id="New_cosmetic_items">New cosmetic items</h3><ul><li><strong>Acorn Stool</strong> - Nutty Crate (32%)</li><li><strong>Acorn Couch</strong> - Nutty Crate (25%)</li><li><strong>Acorn Lantern</strong> - Nutty Crate (20%)</li><li><strong>Acorn Bookshelf</strong> - Nutty Crate (15%)</li><li><strong>Squirrel House</strong> - Nutty Crate (5%)</li><li><strong>Acorn Statue</strong> - Nutty Crate (2.5%)</li><li><strong>Acorn Fountain</strong> - Nutty Crate (0.5%)</li><li><strong>Acorn Mirror</strong> - Chubby Chipmunk weight event reward (8.53kg)</li><li><strong>Acorn Rug</strong> - Chubby Chipmunk weight event reward (17.77kg)</li><li><strong>Acorn Table</strong> - Chubby Chipmunk weight event reward (33.41kg)</li></ul><h3 id="Chubby_Chipmunk_weight_rewards">Chubby Chipmunk weight rewards</h3><p>Having your Chipmunk feed on fruit automatically via its ability will make it heavier.

Generally, it’s an excuse for Jandel or one of the other admins to wreak havoc on the servers. During this time, specific Admin-only <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grow-a-garden-weather-events/2900-7058/" data-ref-id="2900-7058">Grow A Garden weather</a> effects will occur, shops will replenish with the rarest items, and minigames will trigger, rewarding those who finish with cosmetics and other valuable prizes. Sometimes you'll even get a free ultra-rare pet such as the Chicken Zombie or Junkbot.</p><p dir="ltr">We highly recommend playing this hour on a private server, or at least one with few players. This is because other players may have plants that escape the boundaries of their plot, so they may cover up valuable information or even impede your progress in giveaways. For example, in the Find the Pet weather effect, you need to search for a specific critter before time runs out. If that pet is trapped inside someone’s overgrown Briar Rose, you’re potentially missing out on a free and rare pet. We also suggest sticking around a little bit after the Admin Abuse just in case there is an encore, with more giveaways and new weather effects.</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> beta rolls on with some major new changes and additions, including the beta opening up to everyone and the debut of a mostly non-SBMM playlist.</p><h2><strong>Open for all</strong></h2><p>The Black Ops 7 multiplayer beta kicked off on October 2, but only for people who preordered the game, had Game Pass Ultimate, or obtained a code by another means. As of October 5, however, <strong>the beta is now free and open to everyone on all platforms</strong>. The beta runs through October 8.</p><p>All you have to do is find the game client from your preferred platforms--PC, PlayStation, or Xbox--and you should be all set.</p><h2><strong>A non-SBMM playlist has finally arrived</strong></h2><p>Skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) is a hot-button issue in a lot of multiplayer games, including Call of Duty. Some portion of the audience enjoys and embraces SBMM because they say it helps place them into matches with people more aligned with their skills. Other people want to see less SBMM and more "open" playlists in Call of Duty, and that's now available.</p><p>An "open" playlist in the Black Ops 7 beta debuted over the weekend, and people have responded enthusiastically to it. Developer Treyarch, for its part, <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1974591695141704012" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it was "excited to see the response" to the introduction of the playlist, which the company says is "classic matchmaking where skill is minimally considered."</p><p>"As a reminder, we're always listening to our community. As many of you have noted, we continue to prioritize updates (and why we're making them) based on player feedback. Beta is all about trying things, gathering data and being a part of the community dialogue," the developer said. "We look forward to sharing more in-depth takeaways from the beta on the road to launch, including more on matchmaking and how we keep players together."</p><p>For years, hardcore Call of Duty fans have bemoaned how <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1974517777450045878" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision reportedly "turned up" SBMM</a> and created what some thought was a negative experience because of it. With this new change for the Black Ops 7 beta, people are saying it's exactly what they've wanted to see for years, with faster matchmaking times, lower pings, and matches populated by players with a variety of skill levels.</p><p>Many are hoping that this playlist stays in the game for launch, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1974646289347575911" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and one report said that's the plan</a>, but it remains to be seen if that will actually happen.</p><h2><strong>Current playlists</strong></h2><p>The Black Ops 7 beta features both multiplayer and Zombies right now--here is a rundown of what's available:</p><h3><strong>Maps</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Zombies</strong>: Vandorn Farm (Extended to end of Open Beta)</li><li><strong>Multiplayer</strong>: Blackheart (NEW), Cortex, Exposure, Imprint, The Forge</li></ul><h3><strong>Playlists</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Zombies:</strong> Survival, Training Course</li><li><strong>Multiplayer:</strong> Moshpit, Open Moshpit, Open Hardcore Moshpit (NEW), Open Search &amp; Destroy (NEW), Training Course</li></ul><h3><strong>Modes</strong></h3><ul><li>Team Deathmatch (Core + Hardcore)</li><li>Domination (Core + Hardcore)</li><li>Hardpoint</li><li>Kill Confirmed</li><li>Overload</li><li>Search &amp; Destroy</li></ul><p>For more, check out these stories:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-all-guns/2900-7063/" data-ref-id="2900-7063">All Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Guns, Weapons, And Perks Available At Launch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-all-maps/2900-7062/" data-ref-id="2900-7062">All Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Maps Available At Launch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-all-modes/2900-7059/" data-ref-id="2900-7059">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 - All The Multiplayer Modes For Beta And Launch</a></li></ul>
