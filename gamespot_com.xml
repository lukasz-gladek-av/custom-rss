                <p>Resident Evil is lurching back into theaters next year in a new film by Barbarian and Weapons director Zach Cregger. In an interview, Cregger spoke about how he grew up playing the Resident Evil games, and how that love for the Capcom franchise has guided his vision for this new film adaptation of it.</p><p>"I played all of the games. I played Resident Evil 4 a hundred times through. I'm obsessed with it. And so, I just want to tell a story that feels like it's honoring the experience you get when you play the games," Cregger said to <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/resident-evil-reboot-movie-zach-cregger-tease-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComicBook</a>. "I haven't seen the movies; that's just not my thing. But the games are my thing. That's just a playground I just love--I think the movie is going to rip."</p><p>All but one of the previous live-action Resident Evil films were directed by Paul WS Anderson. They were very loose adaptations of the games, remixing ideas from them with original storylines centered around Milla Jovovich's character of Alice. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-movie-director-says-hes-expecting-online-hate-and-heres-why/1100-6533133/" data-ref-id="1100-6533133">Cregger doesn't want to be slavishly obedient</a> to the lore of the games, but as he explained in a separate interview earlier this month, he isn't planning to break "any major rules" of the franchise with his spin on it. Overall, the director says that he just wants to "tell a story that just feels authentic to the experience you get when you play the games."</p><p>In the video game department, the next Resident Evil game is scheduled to be released in February 2026. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/" data-ref-id="1100-6532378">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> will see players travel back to the ruins of Raccoon City for a new survival-horror experience, and it'll be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. A mobile spin-off game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-newly-revealed-resident-evil-game-is-not-what-youd-expect/1100-6532940/" data-ref-id="1100-6532940">Resident Evil: Survival Unit</a> is also in development, and Cregger's Resident Evil film is targeting a September 18 release date next year.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> debuted earlier this year to critical acclaim, including praise for the performance of the voice cast. Charlie Cox--who is perhaps best known for playing the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Daredevil--lent his voice to the game as Gustave. Cox has previously shared that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-actor-felt-like-a-total-fraud-after-the-game-became-a-massive-success/1100-6532618/" data-ref-id="1100-6532618">he isn't a gamer</a>, and he still hasn't played the game. But it sounds like he's ready to change that.</p><p>During a recent appearance at Galaxy Con (via <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-cox-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gustave-actor-1851786701" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>), Cox noted that the last game he played was Super Mario 64 for the Nintendo 64 nearly three decades ago. But after hearing so much praise for Expedition 33, Cox wants to experience it for himself.</p><p>"I want to play the game," said Cox. "I need to play the game. I need to get a console first, and then I need to play the game ... I'm so happy for these guys because they're not like a big company that makes a ton of games. And I hear it's a frontrunner to win Game of the Year or something. It's really cool."</p><p>Until recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-is-no-longer-the-best-rated-game-of-2025/1100-6532565/" data-ref-id="1100-6532565">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was the best-rated game of 2025</a>. It was only outdone by the Switch 2 upgrade for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Regardless, industry figures-- <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-says-expedition-33-is-ideal-for-this-one-reason/1100-6532484/" data-ref-id="1100-6532484">including Hideo Kojima</a>--have had nothing but good things to say about Expedition 33.</p><p>The game's developer, Sandfall Interactive, has shared a message for fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-exploring-more-localization-options-new-content/1100-6532452/" data-ref-id="1100-6532452">about potential future updates</a> and which features may be added to Expedition 33. Sandfall is also actively working <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unsurprisingly-another-game-from-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-is-coming/1100-6531816/">on its next game</a>, which will not be a sequel to Expedition 33.</p>
