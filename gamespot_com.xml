                <p>During PAX East 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/">Borderlands 4</a> developer Gearbox hosted a panel in which it revealed more details on the upcoming looter-shooter. One of the primary topics of conversation related to quality-of-life changes for co-op, as Gearbox is aiming to address complaints from previous games in the Borderlands series and apply these improvements to the sequel.</p><p>While we already know that the game will feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-loot-system-offers-more-variety-than-ever-before/1100-6531246/" data-ref-id="1100-6531246">instanced loot for every player</a>, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford also commented on how Borderlands 4 will have dynamically scaled difficulty for each player in co-op as well, to keep the game fairly challenging. Other big upgrades include a completely revamped lobby system, drop-in and drop-out co-op, and best of all, fast-travel to friends. Borderlands 2 is currently on GameSpot's list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games/2900-5361/" data-ref-id="2900-5361">best co-op games</a>, and while Borderlands 3 featured several improvements on this part of the gameplay experience, it wasn't a dramatic leap forward.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvsx1FzIKEg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mvsx1FzIKEg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Co-op is a religion to us. If you play co-op, it is best-in-class co-op by far," Pitchford said. "We have revamped the lobby system so it's easier than ever to connect with people, easier to get into a co-operative game. It's drop-in and drop-out, none of this play for three hours and then you can start co-op. No, just get in, people can drop in and drop out."</p><p>The panel also touched on a few other topics, like the revamped loot chase--expect far fewer Legendary-class weapons in comparison to Borderlands 3--and the other two Vault Hunters joining Vex and Rafa were also revealed. In case you don't want to play as a Siren or a Tediore Exo-soldier, you can also choose to experience the game as Harlowe the Gravitar or Amon the Forge Knight.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will launch for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-up/1100-6531192/">on September 12</a>, but amidst soaring video game prices, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-price-is-a-mystery-even-to-randy-pitchford/1100-6531437/">not even Pitchford knowswhat it will cost</a> when it arrives or if it'll be an $80 game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">upcoming Xbox Series X|S first-party titles</a>.</p>

                <p>Tati Gabrielle has already received misogynistic and racist backlash to playing the lead role in Naughty Dog's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. She said this in an interview, adding that Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann has been "bootcamp-ing" her about what to expect in this department.</p><p>She told <a href="https://ew.com/tati-gabrielle-of-the-last-of-us-about-to-go-intergalactic-exclusive-11732492" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EW</a> that she's aware of the attacks that people like Ashley Johnson, Laura Bailey, and Troy Baker received for their roles in The Last of Us game series, and she's now part of that club with her role as Jordan A. Mun in Intergalactic.</p><p>"I got a lot of love, but there was a lot of hate over me being a woman, me being a woman of color, me having my head shaved, all these things that I didn't even actually initially see--I'm out of the social media zeitgeist for that reason--but once I did, Neil was like, 'Ignore it. No matter what, me and you, we're going to make something beautiful. We're going to make something that we're proud of,'" she said.</p><p>Bailey, who played Abby, previously discussed the response to her playing the part, saying <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1ahe3jn/laura_bailey_discusses_the_death_threats_sent_to/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some people threatened the life of her newborn baby. </a></p><p>Intergalactic is expected to be a controversial game in part due to its subject matter focusing on faith and religion. But Intergalactic's story may not be what you might expect for a story about faith.</p><p>"The question of faith is not black and white," Gabrielle said. "When you initially think of faith, you think of religion, which is a part of it, but there's also faith in oneself. There's faith in your environment or your community. All that faith means is, 'What are your beliefs? What are the things that you hope for? Faith sounds flowery, but we all experience it day in and day out. What is your reason for waking up?'"</p><p>Gabrielle's history with Naughty Dog goes back to 2022's Uncharted movie, based on the Naughty Dog game, in which she played Braddock. She landed the role of Nora in HBO's The Last of Us after Druckmann saw her in that film, she said.</p><p>Outside of Naughty Dog projects, Gabrielle will play Jade in Mortal Kombat 2, which comes to theaters this October.</p><p dir="ltr">Intergalactic is Naughty Dog's first new IP in a decade. It's been in development since 2020 and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html">more than 250 people at Naughty Dog alone</a> have worked on it over the years, in addition to external development support. Druckmann is directing, and the cast also includes Kumail Nanjiani and Tony Dalton.</p><p dir="ltr">Intergalactic will be scored by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails fame. As for when it will be released, no one should expect to play the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-wont-be-released-until-2027-at-the-soonest-report/1100-6530386/" data-ref-id="1100-6530386">until 2027 at the soonest. </a></p>

      </div>
<p>That being said, Hawk said he'll make it his mission to "campaign all I can" to make it happen. But ultimately, Hawk said Activision will get to make the call. "I'm working with a much bigger company that's a lot smarter than me," he said.</p><p>Hawk added that there has been no talk as of yet about a remaster of Underground, adding that the success of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-release-date-trailer-songs-game-pass/1100-6529971/" data-ref-id="1100-6529971">Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> might dictate what happens with regards to the future of the series.</p><p>Activision already released remakes of Pro Skater 1 + 2 back in 2020. That game was a success commercially, and the next two games are coming out in a remake package this July.</p><p>Underground, meanwhile, was developed by Neversoft and mixed things up by allowing players to create their own character and walk on foot to explore levels. A sequel followed in 2004.</p><p>The skateboarding series is now owned by Microsoft, which itself owns Activision following its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-scores-key-victory-in-activision-acquisition-with-ftc-appeal-denied/1100-6531378/" data-ref-id="1100-6531378">blockbuster $75.4 billion acquisition of the company.</a></p>

                <p>PC is typically considered the go-to platform for strategy games, but in the case of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2</a>, XCOM creator Julian Gollop sees great possibility for the genre to expand on the new Nintendo console, thanks to Joy-Con 2s offering mouse-like controls. While we have seen several strategy games on console make use of a custom control scheme instead of the regular mouse and keyboard experience--Frostpunk 2 and Age of Empires 2: HD being prime examples here--fans of the genre typically prefer a more traditional approach to playing these games.</p><p>"I would never have guessed that as something they would add to the console, and it's a really interesting feature," Gollop said to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/the-creator-of-xcom-has-high-hopes-for-switch-2s-mouse-joy-cons-and-strategy-games-mouse-control-rts-might-work-really-well-here/" rel="nofollow ">GamesRadar</a>. "Interestingly enough, a traditional-style mouse control RTS might work really well here, and also you've got at least a reasonable number of Switches you can use to substitute keyboard commands. It could be quite interesting. That's probably something I would look forward to. That adaptation of the traditional mouse and keyboard RTS using the Switch 2 controllers might be pretty cool."</p>
