                <p>In 2022, Epic Games agreed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ftc-finalizes-order-making-fortnite-dev-pay-245-million-in-refunds/1100-6510151/" data-ref-id="1100-6510151">a massive $520 million settlement</a> with the Federal Trade Commission over allegations that Fortnite violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting info about players under the age of 13 without their parents' permission, as well as allegations that Epic "tricked" players into making unintended in-game purchases. The signup period for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-your-chunk-of-the-245-million-fortnite-ftc-settlement/1100-6517854/" data-ref-id="1100-6517854">the initial distribution of funds</a> ended in February 2024. But now, the FTC is once again opening the opportunity for players to claim their piece of the Fortnite settlement.</p><p>If players already claimed and received a payment from the FTC during the previous dispersal round, then they won't be eligible for any further claims. Everyone else has until July 9, 2025 to to file their claim with the FTC at <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the agency's official site</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/FTC/status/1937890559374291285" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">FTC sends $126 million in refunds to Fortnite players who were charged for unwanted items, reopens claims process. Players who have not already filed a claim will now have until July 9 to submit one: <a href="https://t.co/aISo5Nfa8Z" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/aISo5Nfa8Z</a></p>  — FTC (@FTC) <a href="https://twitter.com/FTC/status/1937890559374291285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>FTC payments will be sent to players either through PayPal or as a check. However, this refund is limited to US citizens. Players under 18 will need their parent or guardian to fill out the paperwork, but anyone older doesn't need any special permission to fill out the form. Domestic players can qualify for the refund if any of the following descriptions applies to them.</p><ul><li>You were charged in-game currency for items you didn’t want between January 2017 and September 2022</li><li>Your child made charges to your credit card without your knowledge between January 2017 and November 2018</li><li>Your account was locked between January 2017 and September 2022 after you complained to your credit card company about wrongful charges</li></ul><p>Outside of this settlement, Epic Games has done quite well for itself in legal conflicts. Last month, Fortnite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-finally-back-on-ios-in-the-us-heres-how-to-download-it/1100-6531696/" data-ref-id="1100-6531696">finally returned to the App Store</a> following a five-year legal battle with Apple. In this week alone, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-wins-legal-judgment-against-fortnite-cheater/1100-6532743/" data-ref-id="1100-6532743">Epic announced a very big judgment against a player</a> who sold illegal Fortnite software. Earlier this month, Fortnite launched a separate lawsuit against <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-is-suing-fortnite-cheat-makers-and-distributors/1100-6532371/" data-ref-id="1100-6532371">a cheat maker and several associates</a>. In other Fortnite news, it appears that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-looks-like-fortnite-blitz-royale-is-sticking-around/1100-6532735/" data-ref-id="1100-6532735"> Fortnite Blitz Royale will be remaining</a> through the winter, at least. There's even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-squid-game-crossover-skins-and-potential-prices-revealed/1100-6532679/" data-ref-id="1100-6532679">a Fortnite x Squid Game collaboration</a> launching on June 27.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">With Super Smash Bros. Ultimate now nearly four years removed from its final update, the Smash community has had to be creative in getting their fill of new Smash Bros. experiences. One savvy modding team has created Smash Remix--a gigantic content mod for the original Super Smash Bros. on Nintendo 64--and a new trailer has revealed many new features now available in Smash Remix's 2.0 patch.</p><p dir="ltr">The 15-minute trailer highlights two brand-new additions to the Smash Remix roster, as Princess Peach and Crash Bandicoot have joined the fray. A few other faces, like Slippy Toad, Dr. Luigi, and Lanky Kong, have been added to a designated "bonus" slot on the character select screen as well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-iLvy0w8hs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q-iLvy0w8hs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">New arenas are also coming with the 2.0 update, including the Crash Bandicoot-themed Time Twister, as well as Discovery Falls--themed after one of the levels from Dinosaur Planet, the Rare project that eventually became Star Fox Adventures. The patch also brings new items, new game modes like King Of The Hill and Tag Team, the voice acting of original SSB announcer Jeff Manning, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Smash Remix first appeared on the mod scene in May 2019 as version 0.5, with version 1.0 officially launching in September 2021. The mod has seen multiple updates between the 1.0 and 2.0 patches, including 1.1.0 in February 2022 which added Sonic, 1.4.0 in June 2023 which added Goemon, and 1.5.0 in January 2024 which brought Banjo and Kazooie to the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Smash Remix 2.0 is available to <a href="https://smash64.online/remix/" rel="nofollow ">download now</a> for free on the mod team's official website. <a href="https://github.com/JSsixtyfour/smashremix/releases/tag/2.0.0" rel="nofollow ">Patch notes</a> for the 2.0 update can be found on the website as well, with highlights seen below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Smash Remix 2.0 Patch Notes</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Characters  <ul><li dir="ltr">Crash added</li><li dir="ltr">Peach added</li><li dir="ltr">Roy added to "bonus" slot</li><li dir="ltr">Dr. Luigi added to "bonus" slot</li><li dir="ltr">Lanky added to "bonus" slot</li><li dir="ltr">Polygon Crash added</li><li dir="ltr">Polygon Peach added</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Stages  <ul><li dir="ltr">Discovery Falls &amp; Discovery Falls Remix added</li><li dir="ltr">Time Twister added; N.

                <p>Peak has officially become a sleeper hit with gamers. The co-op climbing game recently reached over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/co-op-climbing-game-peak-has-exploded-on-steam-with-huge-player-numbers/1100-6532633/" data-ref-id="1100-6532633">one million sales in under a week</a> and is in the <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">top 40 of the most-streamed games</a> of the past few months. The game was created as a partnership between Another Crab's Treasure developer Aggro Crab and Content Warning creators from Landfall, with most of the development taking place during a month-long jam session.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/peak-devs-say-the-hit-comedy-climber-was-pitched-in-a-swedish-hot-tub-and-developed-in-a-frantic-4-week-korean-game-jam-we-brought-our-computers-to-an-airbnb-in-hongdae-and-locked-tf-in-for-a-month/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Aggro Crab studio head Nick Kaman talked about the making of the game and being jealous of Landfall's whirlwind method with Content Warning that he felt "turned everything we know about game development upside-down."</p><p>At the time, Aggro Crab was about to launch its biggest game ever, Another Crab’s Treasure, an intense three-year-plus-long project that he felt burned out his team. "While it was a success, Content Warning was a much bigger one made in much less time," Kaman said via email. Lucky for Kaman's team, there was already an established friendly relationship between the studios, so when he asked if they could join the other team in Seoul, they got an enthusiastic yes.</p><p>"We brought our computers to an Airbnb in Hongdae and locked tf in for a month. As soon as we landed, we beelined straight for the nearest IKEA and spent the day assembling office chairs and desks," Kaman added.</p><p>It should be noted that Peak wasn't built entirely from scratch during those four weeks, as Aggro Crab creative director Caelan Rashby-Pollock had already pitched the idea a year ago in Sweden. "The concept was a lot more vague then and much closer to an open-world survival thingy, but we all quickly got excited about being a group of lost scouts on an island, and the macabre slapstick that can come from that." From there, it was all systems go.</p><p>"Basically, any given moment was either working on Peak or getting food while talking more about Peak," Kaman continued. "While it was pretty intense, it was also the most fun I've ever had working on a game. On a silly multiplayer game like this, the player experience often mirrors the development," Kaman said. "Most of the design was driven by the question: 'Wouldn’t it be funny if <em>this</em> happened?' And now every TikTok I've seen of a great moment in Peak reminds me of the great moment we had while implementing it."</p><p>Peak is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p>

News that developer Funcom would be making a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-pvp-heavy-endgame-is-about-to-get-a-huge-pve-shift/1100-6532645/" data-ref-id="1100-6532645">big shift to the survival MMO's endgame</a> came just a few days ago in a blog post from the game's creative director, Joel Bylos, who said Funcom's goal was not to "force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in." That news was followed by a public test client build for the game's 1.1.10.0 patch that listed the Deep Desert changes (among many others).</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dune: Awakening — Bene Gesserit Mentor Class Gameplay Trailer | Schools of the Imperium</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">However, a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1172710/announcements/detail/546739082808525244?snr=2___" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hotfix</a> released today makes it so the southern half of the Deep Desert is now open for PvE business, though there are still pockets of PvP to be found. Shipwrecks and control points found within the southern half of the region will still be PvP zones. Funcom notes that it rebalanced the distribution of Dune: Awakenings coveted endgame resources around this change, making it so that "loot overall is more valuable and plentiful in the northmost PvP zones." PvE players will still be able to find the highest tier of resources in the southern regions of the zone, just not as much of it.</p><p dir="ltr">"We will continue monitoring how this plays out and continue iterating when and if needed," Funcom states in the patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr">The hotfix also brings previously announced changes to Ornithopters, currently a menace in PvP despite having already been nerfed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-patch-notes-fix-frustrating-endgame-pvp-problems/1100-6532538/" data-ref-id="1100-6532538">no longer cause damage when ramming into other players</a> on the ground. Using a rocket launcher module for the Scout Orni now decreases its top speed by 20% (or 10% for those using the more unpopular Assault Ornithopter). Funcom states it has more changes planned around Ornithopters and PvP.</p><p dir="ltr">In one other major change as part of the hotfix, players can now visit other Sietches and claim land. Dune: Awakening's servers are broken down into Worlds, which are made up of multiple smaller servers called Sietches. While players can now claim land in other Sietches, the number of bases a player can have is still locked to three. The hotfix also introduces a player reporting feature, allowing players to report text chat or messages from other players.</p><p dir="ltr">You can read the full Dune: Awakening update 1.1.0.17 patch notes below. Funcom recently announced Dune: Awakening is already its fastest-selling game to date, having sold more than 1 million copies since its launch in early June.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening Update 1.1.0.17 Patch Notes</h2><h2>FEATURES AND CHANGES</h2><h3>Deep Desert:</h3><p>As outlined in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fduneawakening.com%2Fnews%2Fa-message-from-the-creative-director-on-pve-and-pvp%2F">A message from the Creative Director on PvE and PVP » Dune: Awakening</a>, this hotfix will see the first iteration of the changes to the balance between PvE and PvP in the Deep Desert. Rest assured that we will continue to listen to your feedback and make adjustments in the future.</p><ul><li>The PvE area has been adjusted to encompass the entire southern half of the Deep Desert map.  <ul><li>This means that players who have no interest in PvP should be able to find what they want without engaging in PvP. Imperial Testing Stations, caves, and so forth found in this area are thus now PvE.</li><li>Control Points and Shipwrecks will, however, continue to be PvP throughout the entire map, which means you will find localized pockets of PvP within the PvE section still. Similar to how Shipwrecks are PvP in Hagga Basin.</li></ul></li><li>To retain the Risk vs Reward setup for the Deep Desert:  <ul><li>The density of resources increases the further north you go. This includes high-density clusters of valuable resources.</li><li>The largest spice fields will also spawn in the north.</li><li>The majority of Control Points will exist in the northern part.</li></ul></li><li>As part of these changes, we have made some balancing adjustments in the Deep Desert:  <ul><li>The lower half of the Deep Desert now offers PvE loot that is balanced toward shared loot and PvE activities. You may find better loot in the more dangerous PvP area located further north on the map. In the PvE area, for example, each player gets their own loot and can expect to receive one schematic. In the PvP area, loot is distributed on a "first come, first served" basis, with higher quantities of everything. Players can expect to find 2–6 schematics there, which are among the rarest.</li><li>Plasteel plates can only be found in PvP zones. This line was inaccurate, since Plasteel plates can be obtained from crashing ships.</li><li>The amount of active medium spice fields has been reduced from 8 to 5.</li><li>The number of active small spice fields has increased from 20 to 22.</li><li>The spawn rate of Titanium and Stravidium has been reduced in the PvE areas so that large quantities only spawn in the far-out PvP areas.</li><li>The number of nodes in resource hotspots in the PvE part of the map has been reduced.</li><li>The respawn time of Titanium and Stravidium has increased from 30 to 45 minutes.</li></ul></li><li>Some Imperial Testing Stations are still in the PvP region, and players who want all schematics available each week will want to visit both the PvP and PvE Imperial Testing Stations. Keep in mind the loot in them rotates each week, so even if you're not interested in PvP, you could obtain it at a later date if you're not able to trade for it or buy it off the Exchange.</li></ul><h3>Vehicles:</h3><ul><li>We have begun work on the outlined changes to the Scout Ornithopters.  <ul><li>Equipping a Rocket Launcher Module will now decrease the top speed of your Ornithopter.  <ul><li>For Scout Ornithopters, the reduction is 20%.</li><li>For Assault Ornithopters, the reduction is 10%.</li></ul></li><li>Infocards for the modules now reflect this change.</li></ul></li><li>Exiting ornithopters mid-air will now cause them to drop straight down instead of gliding away. This should decrease the chance that you lose your ornithopter upon disconnecting from the game or exiting by accident your ornithopter mid-air (yes, we have seen the videos).  <ul><li>Known issue: There is an edge case that if your vehicle ends up in the quicksand you might not be able to interact with it if you are in the quicksand. The workaround is to try to get on top of the vehicle to interact with it. This will be fixed in the very next patch.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Visiting:</h3><ul><li>We removed the restrictions when visiting other sietches.  <ul><li>Before this change, players had their “home” sietches, and could visit other sietches in their world but couldn’t claim land. Now, any player can go to any sietch in their world and claim land wherever they want.</li><li>Players can also place respawn beacons on any sietch in their world.</li></ul></li><li>As a result of this change, the home icon on the server selection screen, which previously indicated your home server, now indicates on what server you have a base. Similarly, a vehicle icon shows where you have vehicles.</li></ul><h3>Technical and stability:</h3><ul><li>Increased game stability.</li><li>The latest NVIDIA driver was added to the GPU driver check at the game launch.</li></ul><h3>Other</h3><ul><li>We have introduced Player Reporting, allowing players to now report other players' messages from the text chat or report players from the Inspect menu on players.</li></ul><h2>FIXES</h2><h3>Technical and stability:</h3><ul><li>As a continuous effort, we have closed several exploit vulnerabilities.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a specific type of network issue would cause players to be stuck in an infinite loading screen.</li><li>Fixed an issue where some players could experience a client freeze when traveling between Deep Desert servers.</li></ul><h3>Combat:</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where players performing a melee attack could get obstructed by corpses lying on the ground.</li></ul><h3>User Interface:</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the guild faction alignment was not localized on the Guild Overview tab.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could encounter a black screen if they skipped the cinematic at “The Wreck of the Hephaestus”.</li><li>Fixed an issue where several Sandbike research schematics failed to mention the Imperial Testing Stations as the primary source.</li></ul><h3>Travel:</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where players could use an ornithopter pilot service to fly from the cities to Hagga Basin if they had arrived in a city with their ornithopter.</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous:</h3><ul><li>You will no longer lose learned emotes when respec'ing your skill tree.</li></ul>
