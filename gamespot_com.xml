                <p>2K Games has revealed a major change at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-ethos/" data-ref-id="5000-647673">Project Ethos</a> developer 31st Union, confirming that studio head Michael Condrey--known best for the Dead Space and Call of Duty franchises--is transitioning to an advisory role before an expected exit. Sources told <a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> that Condrey was fired, though 2K Games didn't use that terminology and maintains it is "very committed" to the game and the studio. </p><p>A 2K spokesperson told Kotaku that it is "grateful to Michael Condrey for the dedication, passion, and work ethic it took to build an incredible team and shape the vision of 31st Union." The statement went on to say that Condrey will be "transitioning his role in the short term" to become an advisor on Project Ethos. </p><p>"We remain very committed to the forward path for Project Ethos and the people and culture of the 31st Union studio," 2K said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5Y6b7nk0ZM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u5Y6b7nk0ZM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In November, 2K parent company Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-company-says-only-relying-on-sequels-could-spell-disaster/1100-6527627/" data-ref-id="1100-6527627">"couldn't be more proud"</a> of the team at 31st Union and Project Ethos. 31st Union held an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-games-unveils-new-hero-shooter-project-ethos-and-you-can-play-it-today/1100-6527220/" data-ref-id="1100-6527220">open test for the game at the end of 2024</a>, and Zelnick said the team has been "enthused" about the feedback. "So we're off to a great start, and there's more to come," he said.</p><p>GameSpot's hands-on preview of Project Ethos said 2K's first-ever live-service game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/project-ethos-is-delightfully-different-but-struggles-with-its-identity/1100-6527304/" data-ref-id="1100-6527304">had potential but suffers from an identity crisis.</a></p><p>This report came out just a day before Take-Two is due to report earnings on February 6. We will report back with new details on the situation surrounding Project Ethos if more information comes to light.</p><p>Condrey is best known for his work on the Dead Space and Call of Duty franchises. Condrey left Sledgehammer Games in 2018 to start the new 2K studio, while Sledgehammer's other co-founder, Glen Schofield, left in 2018 as well and eventually started Striking Distance Studios, but left the company following the disappointing launch of The Callisto Protocol. </p>

                <p>Between the giant creatures, multiple on-screen characters, and a large map to explore, there's no question that Capcom's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-played-monster-hunter-wilds-and-so-far-it-rules/1100-6526070/" data-ref-id="1100-6526070">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is going to demand a lot of power from PCs. Now, less than a month away from the game's release, Capcom has shared a PC benchmark tool to show players how their computer measures up to the system specs.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/benchmark/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds benchmark</a> is on Steam's site, and it requires players to have Steam installed and room to download the benchmark itself. The benchmark can rate the performance of your machine and give it a score up to 20,000. Any computer that hits 10,250 and up on the benchmark will be able to play the game. Everything that comes in underneath may take some changes in order to properly enjoy the experience.</p><p>The game's minimum <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/benchmark/#systemrequirements" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">system requirements</a> have also been released and can be seen below:</p><ul><li><dl><dt>Resolution</dt><dd>1080p（FHD）</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Frame Rate</dt><dd>60fps (with Frame Generation enabled)</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>OS</dt><dd>Windows®10(64-bit Required)/Windows®11(64-bit Required)</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Processor</dt><dd>Intel Core i5-10400<br>Intel Core i3-12100<br>AMD Ryzen 5 3600</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Memory</dt><dd>16GB</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Graphics</dt><dd>GeForce RTX 2060 Super（VRAM 8GB）<br>Radeon RX 6600（VRAM 8GB）</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>VRAM</dt><dd>8GB or more required.</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Storage</dt><dd>75GB　SSD</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Note</dt><dd>SSD required. This game is expected to run at 1080p (Upscaled) / 60 fps (with Frame Generation enabled) under the "Medium" graphics setting.

Once you see that, you'll understand why this game needs so much processing power.</p><p>Players who want to get an early taste of what's to come can join <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-another-cross-platform-beta-next-month/1100-6528691/" data-ref-id="1100-6528691">the second open beta test for Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, which will take place on two consecutive weeks: February 6-9 and February 13-16. Most of the content in the second beta will be identical to the first one that was held last November, as players will be able to get their hands on the character-creation tools as well as a story trial, and a Doshagma hunt. In the second beta, the Doshagma hunt is now the jumping-off point for further adventures that can pit players against the Gypceros and Arkveld. Everyone who plays the second beta will be given a Felyne pendant or Seikret, as well as a bonus item pack that will carry over to the main game upon its release.</p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds will arrive on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 28. But if players want to get some bonus items ahead of time, all they have to do is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-bonus-monster-hunter-wilds-items-by-playing-monster-hunter-now/1100-6528784/" data-ref-id="1100-6528784">play the mobile game Monster Hunter Now</a>.</p>

The online single player mode will be available as well, which lets players go solo without joining a lobby.
