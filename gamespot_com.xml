The visuals also received a significant overhaul, and the 23-year-old game looks nice on modern consoles. The graphical upgrades coupled with the chilling soundtrack help create a tense and unsettling atmosphere. That said, the combat system is rather repetitive, but if you're in the mood for a straightforward PS2-era shooter, The Thing: Remastered is worth checking out.</p><p>And if you'd like to watch the film first before playing, Amazon has the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thing-Blu-ray-4K-UHD/dp/B098Z28MSY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original horror classic on 4K Blu-ray</a> for less than $20.

Additionally, the publisher vaguely teases that the season is a "big moment" for Warzone and Black Ops 6.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, Call of Duty Season 2's in-game battle pass timer says that the season ends in 16 days, which usually indicates the start of a brand-new season immediately afterward.

Delays are unfortunate, but this means players should hopefully get more time than they originally expected to finish earning all the rewards in the Season 2 battle pass.</p><p dir="ltr">While Activision doesn't give any details on why Season 3 is being described as a big moment for Black Ops 6 and Warzone, speculation is high that this will be an OG-style season of content and the return of Verdansk.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision says more Season 3 details will be revealed following Warzone's 5th year anniversary on March 10.

But now, there's potentially cause for celebration among CoD fans as Phantom Overlay, one of the most prominent cheat developers, has announced that it is shutting down.</p><p>Via <a href="https://gamerant.com/call-of-duty-phantom-overlay-cheat-provider-shut-down/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Rant</a>, Phantom Overlay's <a href="https://t.me/PhantomOverlayAnnouncements/1052" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Telegram channel</a> states that it plans to "immediately" close its operations, with a caveat that it will remain online for at least another month to fulfill the 30-day keys that it has already sold players. Phantom Overlay went on to promise that anyone who bought lifetime keys would get a partial refund.</p><p>"This is not an exit scam and no external entity could ever compel me to exit scam my customers," wrote the creator of Phantom Overlay. "I'll keep everything updated, safe, and online for 32 days longer."</p><p>There was no information in the post about why Phantom Overlay is closing down, and <a href="https://x.com/Beyond_Dark_TM/status/1896214682727579879" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some players online are naturally skeptical</a>. Phantom Overlay successfully monetized CoD cheats, and the creator could theoretically try again with a different company or a new alias. As noted by one user on X, Phantom Overlay's cheats <a href="https://twitter.com/InsuredFrames/status/1896052805653426600" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were reputed to be undetectable</a>, while rival cheat-makers have struggled with that.</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/27000-call-of-duty-cheaters-were-banned-this-past-weekend/1100-6522492/" data-ref-id="1100-6522492">27,000 CoD cheaters were banned in a single weekend</a>. Activision's Call of Duty anti-cheat program, Ricochet, shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheaters-may-now-lose-their-parachutes-sending-them-plummeting-to-their-death/1100-6519058/" data-ref-id="1100-6519058">its ambitious anti-cheat CoD plans</a>, but Activision has previously apologized for not being able to kick cheaters out of Black Ops. 6 ranked play as quickly as promised. Activision has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-call-of-duty-cheat-makers-ordered-to-pay-3-million-to-activision/1100-6511845/" data-ref-id="1100-6511845">sued cheat developers in the past</a>, and successfully won a $3 million judgment against them. Regardless, the battle between Activision and the cheaters will likely continue well into the future regardless of whether Phantom Overlay makes a comeback under a new name. In the meantime, Activision has launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-recon-squad-announced-but-its-not-a-new-game/1100-6529557/" data-ref-id="1100-6529557">Call of Duty: Recon Squad</a> to get more feedback from players.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">It was a record-breaking weekend on Steam, propelled in part by Monster Hunter Wilds becoming the platform's No. 5 title of all time for concurrent players.

The new peak players online total for Steam now sits exactly at 40,263,524. Speaking of specific numbers, Monster Hunter Wilds hit 1,384,608 concurrent players on Valve's platform on Saturday, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2246340/charts/" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>.
