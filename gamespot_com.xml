                <p>In January 2026, it will be seven and a half years since the announcement teaser for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-483377">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. In that time, Bethesda has had remarkably little to say about it or even a trailer to show off. Now, Bethesda's Todd Howard has indicated that most of the Bethesda team is working on The Elder Scrolls 6.</p><p>"It's progressing really well," Howard told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>. "The majority of the studio's on [Elder Scrolls 6]. but I'll say this: We always overlap. So, we're very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it's a process. We all wish it went a little bit faster--or a lot faster--but it's a process that we want to get right."</p><p>Although the initial announcement came years ago, it's possible or even likely that development didn't ramp up on The Elder Scrolls until after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/" data-ref-id="5000-483376">Starfield</a> was released in 2023. Fans are so desperate for any kind of update that they're <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-think-a-skyrim-trailer-might-secretly-reveal-elder-scrolls-6s-release-year/1100-6536892/" data-ref-id="1100-6536892">reading things in the Skyrim Switch 2 announcement trailer</a> as if they're hidden hints about an Elder Scrolls 6 release window.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/1100-6536089/" data-ref-id="1100-6536089">recently as last month</a>, Howard said that The Elder Scrolls 6 is "still a long way off" and he expressed regret for announcing the sequel when he did. Earlier this year, Bethesda teamed up with Make-A-Wish for a charity auction to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-donate-to-make-a-wish-for-a-chance-to-design-an-elder-scrolls-6-character/1100-6529534/" data-ref-id="1100-6529534">design a creature in Elder Scrolls 6</a>.</p><p>Howard also held open the possibility of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-tv-series-is-possible-says-todd-howard/1100-6536747/" data-ref-id="1100-6536747">an Elder Scrolls TV series</a>, much like the hit Fallout show on Prime Video. However, Howard indicated that he's "willing to say 'no' for a decade" rather than rush into that.</p>

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian just recently launched its acclaimed previous game, Divinity: Original Sin II, on Switch 2, and studio boss Swen Vincke said he tried hard to cut one element in particular for the new release.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://mein-mmo.de/en/larian-ceo-swen-vincke-in-interview-i-hate-the-squirrel-and-the-great-freedom-for-divinity-after-baldurs-gate-3,1542810/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mein-MMO</a>, Vincke responded to the interviewer saying they are a big fan of the game's squirrel NPC, <a href="https://divinityoriginalsin2.wiki.fextralife.com/Sir+Lora" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sir Lora</a>. Vincke hates the little critter and wanted him gone for the re-release.</p><p>"It's funny that you like Sir Lora. I hate him. If there is one thing I regret about Original Sin 2, it's bringing Sir Lora into the game," he said.</p><p>Vincke went on to say that he "tried to remove him from the Switch 2 version," but Larian's QA team informed him that it was "too late."</p><p>"I really tried to get rid of him," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYWITWd1GJk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yYWITWd1GJk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Vincke added that his Head of QA informed him that the team undertook efforts to cut Sir Lora and the team "almost succeeded." But the problem was that removing Sir Lora led to an issue where "it works in one region and not in another."</p><p>"We couldn't figure out why. Sir Lora just wouldn't die. We lost several days debugging to find an answer to that. Now it's too late, so we have to keep him," he said.</p><p>Vincke also shared some Sir Lora lore, saying the publisher behind Original Sin II wanted to have free DLC for the game, so Larian created the squirrel NPC "as a joke that doesn't really add anything to the game."</p><p>"Later we regretted bringing Sir Lora in because it only happened due to publisher pressure. And now we just want to get rid of him. But it's okay; it makes me happy that you enjoy him. There are people who put a lot of effort into creating him," Vincke said.</p><p>Original Sin II just launched for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-releases-its-acclaimed-previous-game-on-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6536963/" data-ref-id="1100-6536963">free upgrade available</a> for people who already own the game on PS4, Xbox One, or Switch.</p><p>Larian's next game is a new Divinity title, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">will not have any AI-created content in it</a>. The developer used generative AI to create concept art and to help with other development processes, however.</p><p>"It's something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse," Vincke said, attempting to address the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">concerns raised by developers.</a></p>

While they're not the newest iteration of Sony's premium noise-canceling headphones (those are the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PT1VBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WH-1000XM</a>6), they offer impressive noise cancellation. Sound quality is excellent as well, and it can be further customized using the companion Sony Sound Connect app. They also offer up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, and quick charging support that can restore three hours of playback in just three minutes of charging.</p><p>As for the WF-C700N earbuds, they may not be as popular as AirPods, but they're still a great option, offering IPX4 water resistance, multiple silicone earbud tips, a built-in microphone for hands-free calling, and the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously.</p><p>If you're shopping around for other headphone deals, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PT1VBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM6</a> headphones are also on sale for $398 (was $460) ahead of the holidays. This matches the all-time low price from Black Friday, though it's still quite a bit more expensive than the older WH-1000XM5. Most shoppers will find the WH-1000XM5 bundle to be the best offer right now, but if you need the latest and greatest gear, it's nice to see the XM6 back down to the same price as they were in late November.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Pro-Personalized-Compatibility/dp/B0C8PR4W22?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beats Studio Pro</a> headphones are also quite cheap right now, with Amazon listing them for $180 (was $350). Offering up to 40 hours of battery life and a stylish design, they could be a nice alternative to the WH-1000XM5. Most colors are eligible for the discount, too, so it shouldn't be hard to snag something that fits your style.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1up-classic-se-arcade-machines-pac-man-ms-pac-man-mortal-kombat-amazon-deals/1100-6534472/">Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition Cabinets Get First Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-exclusive-lego-sets-best-deals-holiday-2025-sale/1100-6536986/">Target's Best Exclusive Lego Sets Get Rare Holiday Discounts</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controllers On Sale For Even Better Prices Than Black Friday Deals</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-anniversary-edition-pixel-remasters-nintendo-switch-playstation-best-amazon-deal/1100-6527670/">Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster Collection Is Back On Sale For Black Friday Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-nintendo-switch-2-wheel-set-for-mario-kart-gets-first-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536789/">Nintendo Switch 2 Racing Wheel Set Drops To $20 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-gets-110-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536577/">Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gets $110 Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-rosalina-storybook-nintendo-switch-book-deal/1100-6534724/">Super Mario Galaxy: Rosalina's Storybook Gets 30% Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>
