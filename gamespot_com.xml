                <p>Ahead of its full release on February 11, Civilization VII developer Firaxis has outlined plans to improve the game with post-launch fixes and new features. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-early-reviews-suggest-a-divisive-experience/1100-6529191/" data-ref-id="1100-6529191">Early reviews for Civilization VII have been mixed so far</a>, while Steam community feedback posts have also highlighted several areas that need to be addressed.</p><p>In a developer update, Firaxis revealed that its primary focus is on the user interface, as it wants to make this part of the game easier to use and read. "We need some time to digest all of your feedback, but some areas that we're already looking into include making UI interactions more intuitive, improving map readability, fixing areas of polish like formatting, and more," Firaxis explained in a <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a>. "We're committed to getting this right, and will share more details as soon as we can."</p><p>Firaxis will also be working on implementing several features requested by the community, adding these in via free future updates. While the timing for these has yet to be worked out, the developer says that Civilization VII fans can expect to see the following features added in time:</p><ul><li>Adding Teams to multiplayer games so that you can play cooperatively</li><li>Allowing full player counts in multiplayer in all three Ages through refinements to the Distant Lands system</li><li>Allowing you to pick your starting and ending Age to allow for single- or double-Age games</li><li>Providing a wider variety of map types</li><li>Enabling city and religion names to be customized</li><li>Hotseat multiplayer</li></ul><p>The studio added that is aiming to release Patch 1.1.0 in March, which includes quality-of-life UI adjustments, ongoing AI balance and improvement, adjustments to diplomacy and crises, and additional bug fixes. Currently available in early access on PC, Civilization VII will also be coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch.</p><p>The game is also expected to be on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/">Switch 2 via backwards compatibility</a>, and with rumors of the updated Joy-Con controllers having mouse-like functionality, Civilization VII executive producer Dennis Shirk recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-joy-con-rumored-mouse-feature-is-definitely-intriguing-civ-dev-says/1100-6529219/">commented that such a feature is quite intriguing</a>.</p>

                <p>Sports Interactive and Sega have announced that Football Manager 25 is canceled and will the developer will instead focus on their next release.</p><p>The developer provided a lengthy explanation as to why Football Manager 25 was canceled. While many of the game's areas hit the developer's internal targets, the overarching player experience and interface weren't up to standard. Through evaluations and playtesting, the development team was confident in a new direction, but the desired standards were ultimately still too far away. However, the team will take their learnings onto the next project.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1887691360217579847" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Sports Interactive regret to inform that, following extensive internal discussion and careful consideration with SEGA, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Football Manager 25. <a href="https://t.co/tLRbq8305K" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/tLRbq8305K</a></p>  â€” Football Manager (@FootballManager) <a href="https://twitter.com/FootballManager/status/1887691360217579847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>"Each decision to delay the release was made with the aim of getting the game closer to the desired level but, as we approached critical milestones at the turn of the year, it became unmistakably clear that we would not achieve the standard required, even with the adjusted timeline," Sports Interactive and Sega said in a <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>.</p><p>Football Manager 25 was already delayed twice from its original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/football-manager-25-delayed-cutting-some-features/1100-6526298/" data-ref-id="1100-6526298">early November 2024 release to later that month</a>, then again to <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-delayed-until-march-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">March 2025</a>. The developer considered delaying the game further and fixing it down the line via patches, but decided against that. Additionally, anything past a March release would've been too late into the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the same year, presumably Football Manager 26.</p><p>Those who've preordered the game are eligible for automatic refunds, which are expected to take place soon.</p><p>Football Manager 24 will also not receive an update with 2024/2025 data as that would take away development resources from the studio's next game.</p><p>Football Manager 25 isn't the only game to get canceled so far this year. The Celeste dev's next game, Earthblade, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/celeste-devs-next-project-earthblade-officially-canceled/1100-6528966/" data-ref-id="1100-6528966">was canceled last month</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">Sony has canceled two live-service projects</a>.</p>

Additionally, Rogue Company, Paladins, and Smite 1 will no longer receive major updates, but the servers will remain up for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Smite 2 is currently in early access, and looks to be Hi-Rez's sole focus going forward. The aforementioned message also stated that the reductions are meant to enable a steady flow of new content for Smite 2.</p><p>Hi-Rez already went through a round of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brutal-game-layoffs-continue-with-smite-developer-hi-rez/1100-6526876/" data-ref-id="1100-6526876">layoffs back in October</a>.
