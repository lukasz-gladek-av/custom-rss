                <p>Sucker Punch Productions co-founder Brian Fleming is leaving the gaming studio after working there since it opened 28 years ago in 1997. What's he doing next? Fleming says he does not know.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7406746502825660416/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on LinkedIn</a>, Fleming said, "I really don't know what's next."</p><p>He's staying with Sucker Punch through April 2026 to help with the transition efforts, and after that he said he plans to travel. He's also going to spend the time trying to "sort out which opportunities" he wants to pursue next. Fleming said he's considering a lot of different options for the future, including staying in games, moving to the wider technology space, getting into the "entertainment" business, and even working in the "advocacy/politics" areas.</p><p>"After 28 absolutely life changing years at the helm of Sucker Punch, I've decided it's time to shake up the snow-globe," he said.</p><p>Jason Connell (Ghost of Tsushima and Yotei co-creative director) and Adrian Bentley (technical director) will take over as co-studio heads on January 1. Nate Fox will continue his role as co-creative director. Fleming said he's leaving Sucker Punch "in the capable hands of the strongest leadership team we've ever had."</p><p>"They are all so capable and so READY for new challenges that I have nothing but confidence the studio will continue to flourish," he explained.</p><p>After releasing the N64 game Rocket: Robot on Wheels in 1999, Sucker Punch's first big hit was 2002's Sly Cooper, which became a franchise that spawned multiple sequels. In 2009, the studio released Infamous, which would also become a success. Sony acquired Sucker Punch in 2011.</p><p>Next up for Sucker Punch in 2026's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-is-getting-free-multiplayer-dlc-next-year/1100-6534104/" data-ref-id="1100-6534104">Ghost of Yotei: Legends</a>, which is free multiplayer DLC.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has reacted to a report that said the company is pushing Xbox to make more profit. In a statement to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/21/xbox-console-war-playstation-switch.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a>, the company said it has ambitious profit goals, but the specific 30% profit-margin figure was not correct. The statement was paraphrased and not attributed to any specific person at Microsoft, and GameSpot has followed up with Microsoft in an attempt to get more information.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">Bloomberg reported</a> that Microsoft pushed the Xbox team to increase profit margins starting in 2023, with the goal of rising to 30% (up from 12% in 2022). The industry average for profit margins is likely between 17% and 22%, analysts said in the Bloomberg piece.</p><p>According to the report, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new goals, and her team has "taken a larger role" in the company's gaming business recently.</p><p>The Xbox team undertook efforts to make more money in 2025, including raising Xbox console prices, hiking Game Pass membership costs, and releasing more of its games on rival platforms. Microsoft also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">laid off lots of people, canceled games, and closed studios.</a> Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">these cuts had to happen because of capitalism. </a></p><p>Microsoft was also planning to charge $80 for new games this year, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-reacts-to-dropping-plans-for-80-games/1100-6536931/" data-ref-id="1100-6536931">canceled those plans</a>. Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty said the Xbox team needs to run a "healthy business," but this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-reacts-to-dropping-plans-for-80-games/1100-6536931/" data-ref-id="1100-6536931">doesn't necessarily mean increases beyond $70 for new games.</a></p><p>"From our point of view, monetization just happens in so many different ways right now. So we're going to continue to listen to the feedback from fans. We're going to continue, to balance that with needing to run the healthy business. But right now, on the content side, we don't have any pricing updates," he said.</p><p>Next year is poised to be a big one for Microsoft, as 2026 marks the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/" data-ref-id="1100-6535992">25th anniversary of Xbox and Halo</a>. It's also the 40th anniversary of Bethesda, the 35th anniversary of Blizzard, and the 30th anniversary of the original Diablo. Some are expecting Microsoft to also divulge <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/" data-ref-id="1100-6534059">new information about the company's new console</a> in 2026, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>Microsoft will host an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-confirmed-for-january-2026-but-it-wont-have-everything/1100-6536932/" data-ref-id="1100-6536932">Xbox Developer Direct event in January 2026</a> where it will show off some of what's coming to Xbox in 2026, but not everything.</p>

                <p>Battlefield 6 players believe they have discovered evidence that the game features AI-generated art. People are theorizing that some of the art in player emblems in Battlefield 6 was created, at least in part, with the use of generative AI systems, though there is no concrete evidence of this as of yet or any comment from Electronic Arts or the game's developers.</p><p>People have pointed out some apparent irregularities with the art below. GameSpot has contacted EA in an attempt to get more details on the situation.</p><p>Back in October, DICE GM Rebecka Coutaz said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genai-is-very-seducing-battlefield-6-boss-says/1100-6535356/" data-ref-id="1100-6535356">EA's teams use generative AI in the early stages of development</a> "to allow more time and more space to be creative." But Battlefield 6 has no gen AI-created content, she said. She is optimistic about the technology overall, though. "If we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative," she said.</p><p>Developer Fasahat "Fas" Salim said people should not be afraid of generative AI in game development, adding that plans were underway to determine how to best implement the technology into future development pipelines.</p><p>"It's just a matter of how we can incorporate that productively into our workflows; how can we leverage that to take our games to the next level," he said.</p><p>Coutaz has also said using generative AI for making games is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genai-is-very-seducing-battlefield-6-boss-says/1100-6535356/" data-ref-id="1100-6535356">"very seducing."</a></p><p>To hear EA developers speak enthusiastically about AI is no big surprise, as the company's other key executives, including CEO Andrew Wilson, have said the tools will help EA in the long run. Wilson has said further adoption of AI technologies <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-help-its-teams-get-to-holy-grail-of-game-development/1100-6523265/" data-ref-id="1100-6523265">will lead to job losses, but it will ultimately create more jobs than it displaces over time.</a></p><p>Before this, EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a> Outside of EA, Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine-learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a></p><p>The developers working on Battlefield rival Call of Duty <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-uses-generative-ai-for-some-content-activision-admits/1100-6529691/" data-ref-id="1100-6529691">freely admit to using generative AI to aid in the development process.</a></p><p>The debate around AI in games was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-ceo-says-a-lot-has-been-lost-in-translation-amid-divinitys-ai-blowback/1100-6537085/" data-ref-id="1100-6537085">reignited recently with Larian boss Swen Vincke's controversial comments.</a> Additionally, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indie-game-of-the-year-award-stripped-from-clair-obscur-expedition-33-over-ai/1100-6537129/" data-ref-id="1100-6537129">had one of its Game of the Year awards revoked due to AI.</a></p><p>Battlefield 6 is 2025's best-selling game of the year so far in the US, even outperforming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>
