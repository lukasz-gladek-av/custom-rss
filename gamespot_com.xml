                <p>We're only a few weeks into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s Star Wars season, but since the season is only five weeks long, that means we're already getting close to the end. Once Star Wars season wraps up, things will be back to normal in Battle Royale and Zero Build--or maybe there's nothing normal at all about what's coming up next season.</p><p>Right now we've got a lot more questions (about 7,000) than we do answers (about 0) regarding what's in store for the Fortnite island once all these Star Wars people leave, but let's go through the rumors and guesswork we've got so far.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Is_the_upcoming_Fortnite_season_Chapter_6_Season_3_or_Chapter_6_Season_4_">Is the upcoming Fortnite season Chapter 6 Season 3 or Chapter 6 Season 4?</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_start_date">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 start date</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Star_Wars_season_s_live_finale_event">Fortnite Star Wars season's live finale event</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_season_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 season theme</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_battle_pass_skins">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 battle pass skins</a></li><li><a href="#Gameplay_changes_in_Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3">Gameplay changes in Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_OG_Season_4">Fortnite OG Season 4</a></li><li><a href="#New_Lego_Fortnite_Pass">New Lego Fortnite Pass</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_the_upcoming_Fortnite_season_Chapter_6_Season_3_or_Chapter_6_Season_4_">Is the upcoming Fortnite season Chapter 6 Season 3 or Chapter 6 Season 4?</h2><p dir="ltr">We don't have a confirmed answer for this question right now, but since the Star Wars season is designated in the game's metadata as Chapter 6 MS1 (mini-season 1), it stands to reason that next season will be called Season 3. It also implies, but <em>does not confirm,</em> plans for an additional mini-seasons in the future.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_start_date">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 start date</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortnite: Galactic Battle is currently scheduled to come to a close on June 7, with the new season slated to begin on the morning of June 8. But this season won't end in the middle of the night, as most Fortnite seasons do.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Star_Wars_season_s_live_finale_event">Fortnite Star Wars season's live finale event</h2><p dir="ltr">As promised by Epic when the season began, the Star Wars Galactic Battle season will conclude with a live event in which players will storm the Death Star and confront Emperor Palpatine in order to end the Empire's invasion of the island. This will be a true live event, like the ones that come at the end of each chapter, and it'll take place on Saturday, June 7 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_season_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 season theme</h2><p dir="ltr">It's rumored that the upcoming season of Battle Royale <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920308377025941969" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be superhero themed</a>, but in the more traditional capes-and-tights sort of way--with Midas running a school for superheroes, apparently. Word is that the new season will have a DC Comics bent, which makes sense with a new Superman film landing in July. And since Fortnite's only existing Superman skin is permanently locked behind the Chapter 2 Season 7 battle pass from 2021, the rumors about <a href="https://x.com/FNBRintel/status/1918704607083282696" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new item shop Superman</a> make perfect sense.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499942" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499942"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_battle_pass_skins">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 battle pass skins</h2><p dir="ltr">It's expected that the new season will have a normal battle pass that includes several Fortnite-original characters and one or two collab skins. It's very likely that a new corrupted version of Daigo will be on the pass, since the cinematic at the end of Season 2 showed Daigo entering the magic portal in the northeasern part of the island and transforming into a very different body. Beyond that, the only rumored collab skin for the battle pass <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920308377025941969" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is Robin</a>--yes, we're talking about Batman's pal here.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Gameplay_changes_in_Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3">Gameplay changes in Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3</h2><p dir="ltr">All the rumors and leaks about the upcoming season being superhero-themed also mention that <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1921999441885577714" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">superpowers will be a</a> key part <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920524099136467202" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">of your arsenal</a> in the new season. Not gadgets like we had in last year's Marvel season, but rather actual super-powered abilities--stuff like the mythic Jujutsu Kaisen and Dragon Ball items, or Avatar's elemental abilities.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_4">Fortnite OG Season 4</h2><p dir="ltr">Season 4 of Fortnite OG will also begin on June 8, and that may be because the original Season 4 also had a superhero theme. While Fortnite OG will certainly stick with the loot pool and map that the original Season 4 had, we can't help but wonder if there will be story connections between OG and standard Battle Royale given the simultaneous start dates.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Epic has seemingly been teasing the return of The Visitor, whose arrival with the meteor in the original Season 4 kicked off Fortnite's plot, with <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1920631430188568835" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this remix of an old Seven-related music track</a> that appears to have a modified version of The Visitor's head and shoulders on the cover art. The Visitor would have been a prime candidate for a remix even without that tease, so no one would be surprised if he appeared on the new OG Pass.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="New_Lego_Fortnite_Pass">New Lego Fortnite Pass</h2><p dir="ltr">The new Lego Pass will <em>also</em> begin on June 8, and we have no rumors or anything about what's in store. But given the date, we have every reason to expect it will tie in with this hypothetical superhero theme. Given DC's close relationship with Lego, it wouldn't be surprising at all for one of that brand's heroes to pop up here.</p>

                <p>One of the most intriguing developments with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is that the Joy-Con 2 controllers have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-supports-joy-con-mouse-controls/2900-6517/" data-ref-id="2900-6517">mouse-like functionality for certain games</a>. That's been a long-requested feature, but players who love using mice appear to have that option on Switch 2 as well.</p><p>During a demonstration for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nobunagas-ambition-awakening-announced-for-pc-ps4-and-switch/1100-6512819/" data-ref-id="1100-6512819">Nobunaga's Ambition: Awakening CE</a> on Switch 2 (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-supports-standard-usb-mice/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>), producer Michi Ryu plugged a wired mouse into the console and began playing with it. He also noted that when the mouse is plugged in, it takes priority control away from the Joy-Con 2 controllers. Ryu used the mouse around the 10:53 mark in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CstlgmcDgy0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CstlgmcDgy0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This doesn't necessarily mean that all Switch 2 games will be compatible with a standard mouse. It's also unclear if wireless mice are also usable on Switch 2. XCOM creator Julian Gollop recently suggested that Switch 2's mouse options <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-xcom-creator-thinks-switch-2-mouse-controls-have-big-strategy-game-potential/1100-6531445/" data-ref-id="1100-6531445">may lead to more strategy games on the system</a>.</p><p>Nintendo's upcoming 3v3 sports title, Drag x Drive, will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-drag-x-drive-a-switch-2-game-that-relies-on-mouse-controls/1100-6530555/" data-ref-id="1100-6530555">extensively feature the Joy-Con 2's mouse capabilities</a>. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will also incorporate the ability to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/" data-ref-id="1100-6530602">switch between Joy-Con 2's controller and mouse-like capabilities on the fly</a>. That may make aiming a lot easier in the upcoming sequel. Nintendo also recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-offers-a-first-glimpse-at-how-mouse-controls-work-on-switch-2s-home-menu/1100-6531454/" data-ref-id="1100-6531454">a better look at how the Joy-Con 2's mouse capabilities</a> will work.</p>

                <p>Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann has further discussed the company's upcoming new IP, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalatic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, saying it offers the "deepest" gameplay for any game the studio has made so far. Druckmann also briefly discussed the backlash from some people to the game's unveiling.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8tOTQhepAI&amp;t=3886s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last Stand Media</a> (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/just-stick-to-your-guns-neil-druckmann-isnt-phased-by-all-the-hate-intergalactic-got-theres-stuff-happening-with-media-right-now-that-you-just-have-to-ignore/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via PC Gamer</a>), Druckmann said he's "very, very excited" for Intergalactic, adding that "it's the deepest gameplay we've ever done." It's not exactly clear what he means by that, but we should find out in time. "I can't wait to show it off," Druckmann said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4499918" data-ratio="0.55225311601151" data-width="1043" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4499918"></a><figcaption>A scene from Intergalactic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg"></figure><p>The reveal trailer for Intergalactic showed main character Jordan A. Mun in a spaceship before she descended down onto a planet to fight a giant robot enemy with a red sword. The trailer cut out <em>just </em>as the action was set to begin, so we can only guess as to what happens next.</p><p>Also in the interview, Druckmann reacted to some of the controversy surrounding Intergalactic, and specifically the misogynistic and racist comments directed at Tati Gabrielle, who plays Mun.</p><p>"I don't know if there's much I could add to that conversation, to be honest," Druckmann said. "There's stuff happening with media right now that you just have to ignore for the most part, just stick to your guns, and do what you believe in. And I feel like that's how I want artists to carry themselves."</p><p>Gabrielle herself said she received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/intergalactic-star-reveals-the-advice-neil-druckmann-gave-her-about-facing-online-hate/1100-6531450/" data-ref-id="1100-6531450">"a lot of love"</a> about her playing the lead in Naughty Dog's new game, but there was also "lot of hate over me being a woman, me being a woman of color, me having my head shaved; all these things..."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItkWqN3nMHE" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ItkWqN3nMHE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>She said Druckmann told her to ignore it and have faith that Naughty Dog is "going to make something that we're proud of."</p><p>Intergalactic, which Druckmann is directing, is in the works now for PS5, but it doesn't have a release date. It's not the only game that Naughty Dog is currently building, as it's also making at least one other single-player game, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-director-neil-druckmann-is-working-on-a-second-unannounced-game-at-naughty-dog/1100-6531656/" data-ref-id="1100-6531656">Druckmann is also involved with.</a> It's unknown what this game is, but some are theorizing that it could be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">The Last of Us 3.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, HBO's The Last of Us TV series--which Druckmann is involved with--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-finales-intense-trailer-sets-up-a-dramatic-conclusion/1100-6531633/" data-ref-id="1100-6531633">wraps up its second season on Sunday, May 25</a>.
