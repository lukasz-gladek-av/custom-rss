In practice, what this meant was that developers were working in a "vibe-based" manner and getting stuff done even if it was outside of their specific job remit.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I like to just say, 'Get it done. Do it dirty. Do it the way we used to do it!" Weber said.</p><p>This development philosophy worked out for the studio, as The Witcher 3 sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#10" data-ref-id="2900-4814">more than 60 million copies</a> and is one of the top 10 best-selling video games of all time. For The Witcher 4, Weber said CD Projekt aims to "do justice" to the franchise's story history by trying to retain what made The Witcher 3's development special. But the Polish studio is also trying new things.</p><p>"There are [also] new questions we want to answer, because this is supposed to feel like a true sequel, not just redoing what we did before. And I think it's really [about] trying to have that healthy mix of moving forward and also trying out some new things," Weber explained.</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't have a release date yet, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/" data-ref-id="1100-6530369">not expected to launch until 2027 at the soonest.</a> It's one of multiple games in development now at CD Projekt. Some of the others include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">remake of the original Witcher</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-dev-partners-with-pokemon-go-owner-for-a-new-game-based-on-its-ip/1100-6530370/" data-ref-id="1100-6530370">a game produced in partnership with Saudi Arabia. </a></p><p>The Witcher 4 focuses its story on Ciri, and this has generated some amount of debate and controversy. Some people are calling the game "woke," but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-is-not-woke-for-starring-ciri-geralt-voice-actor-says/1100-6531680/" data-ref-id="1100-6531680">Geralt's voice actor has slammed these critics.</a> In other news, a new tech demo for the game debuted recently, and while it looked very impressive, the developers want people to know <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">it wasn't actually the game.</a></p>

                <p>Sony has shared a new report with investors that touts PlayStation 5's marketplace gains and the continued expansion of PlayStation Plus' subscriber base. The latter has been so successful at adding users to the highest subscription tiers that Sony is already considering a price increase for PS Plus "to maximize profitability."</p><p>Following the release of <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2025/GNS_E.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the report online</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Hideaki Nishino appeared on a <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fireside chat</a> and spelled out that the only direction for PlayStation Plus pricing is up.</p><p>"The PlayStation Plus service offers great value for our players, and we will continue to add more value and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximize profitability," said Nishino.</p><p>Currently, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS Plus</a>'s Premium tier costs $160 per year in the US, while the Extra costs $135 and the Essential costs $80.</p><p>Nishino's statement came after Sony's presentation indicated that 38% of all PlayStation Plus subscribers opted for the top two tiers, Premium and Extra. Furthermore, the percentage of PS Plus subscribers on the Extra tier increased from 16% to 22% from Sony's 2022 fiscal year to its 2024 fiscal year. In that same period, PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers rose from 13% to 17% of all PS Plus users.</p><p>Nishino noted that Sony would "add more value" to PS Plus subscriptions to justify increasing the price. It's unclear exactly what that might entail, especially since Sony has steered away from following Game Pass' path of dropping AAA games on the service on day one.</p><p>As recently as last April, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-prices-have-increased-in-certain-regions-but-not-the-us/1100-6530919/" data-ref-id="1100-6530919">Sony raised PS Plus prices</a> in several countries, while sparing the US from any immediate increase. Players in North America may not be so lucky next time.</p>
