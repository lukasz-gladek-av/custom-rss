                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/towers-of-aghasba/" data-ref-id="5000-589437">Towers of Aghasba</a> launches today on PC and PS5 as an early access game. Though that means the game isn't complete yet, it very quickly wears its Zelda inspiraitons on its sleeve thanks to the way you explore its fantastical open world often with a glider, can climb any surface, manage your stamina, and fight enemies with weapons that degrade. It's also inspired by Ghibli movies and features a former Ghibli artist on the development team. But it uses those major touchstones to present its big idea: a survival-crafting game that operates <em>in reverse</em>.</p><p>Most games of this sort--tree-punchers, I affectionately call them--task players with tearing down a local ecosystem to convert flora and fauna into homes and meals, eventually wiping out the natural landscape in favor of something that may be beautiful in its own way, but definitely paves over the world that was once on display.</p><p>Towers of Aghasba <em>does </em>ask you to pick apart some local resources to improve your own conditions, like making tools from trees and stones early on, but it's all done in service of nature, as you restore a brownish, barren landscape to a lush, healthy world full of critters and immaculate natural landmarks. In that way, it's almost like Spore, too, as you bring life to what is essentially a blank slate when you arrive.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j76LZRBEQ4I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j76LZRBEQ4I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If the typical survival-crafting gameplay loop has you ready for something different, you can check out Towers of Aghasba for yourself in the launch trailer or find it on PC and PS5 starting today.</p><p>As it's an early access game, the developers have already laid out a lengthy roadmap planned well into the future, so players jumping in now can come to expect these future updates. You can check out those updates below, which include features such as new regions to explore, photo mode, more quests and NPCs, and weather effects with which you'll need to contend.

                <p dir="ltr">If you're planning on traveling over the holidays, consider turning your smartphone into a portable gaming handheld with a controller case like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4V758R7?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA MOGA XP7-X Plus</a>, which is down to just $50 (normally $100) at Amazon ahead of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/blackfriday?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black Friday</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The PowerA MOGA XP7-X Plus is officially licensed by Xbox and features all the usual inputs you'd expect from a standard controller or handheld system, including two thumbsticks, face buttons, triggers, and a D-pad. It supports Android and iPhones up to 7.13 inches long in handheld mode and connects via Bluetooth. The controller has an integrated 2000mAh power bank and charging pad, so you can charge your phone while you play. It's perfect for playing games via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or other cloud streaming apps, or native Android/iOS games that support controllers. You can also collapse the controller down and use it separately with your phone, Xbox, or Windows.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4402348-poweracontrollerhero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4402348" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4402348-poweracontrollerhero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4402348"></a><figcaption>PowerA MOGA XP7-X Plus Bluetooth Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4402348-poweracontrollerhero.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for a more traditional form factor, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081C1DMZG?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA's MOGA XP5-A Plus</a> is also on sale for just $36 (was $70).

                <p>Destiny 2 players who were waiting to start their week after the reset might have noticed something different this time around. Alongside Tess' Eververse products--which include a sweet, new Blanka from Street Fighter mask--Guardians can visit Banshee-44 for some really good loot, but you have to have completed at least one dungeon and specific dungeons for certain weapons.</p><p>The Tower's gunsmith is brandishing top-tier weapons with really good roll perks attached to them on the second page of his menu. The Stasis-powered grenade launcher, VS Chill Inhibitor, is available but players need to have completed the Vesper's Host dungeon in order to nab. The same goes for the Indebted Kindness sidearm with the Warlord's Ruin dungeon.</p><p>As for the rest, the <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1858938507571720632" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Destiny 2 Team Twitter</a> account laid out the perks with the weapons available. They're pretty solid, and it sounds like a possible weekly feature.</p><ul><li>Rose - Fluted Barrel, Accurized Rounds, Slideshot, Explosive Payload, Smooth Grip, Handling MW</li><li>Multimach - Polygonal Rifling + Tactical Mag + Attrition Orbs + Kinetic Tremors + Reload MW</li><li>Indebted Kindness - Smart Drift Control + Tactical Mag + Loose Change + Voltshot + Velocity MW</li><li>Compass Rose - Corkscrew Rifling, Light Mag, Snapshot Sights, Slideshot, Handling MW</li><li>Hothead (Adept) - Hard Launch + Impact Casing + Tracking Module + Clown Cartridge + Reload MW</li><li>VS Chill Inhibitor - Countermass + Spike Grenades + Envious Arsenal + Bait and Switch + Reload MW</li></ul><p>"Starting Today, Banshee-44 has a small collection of weapons in the Tower with curated perk rolls. Our goal is to get you some perk combinations that were a bit harder to earn due to the RNG perk issue that was fixed in our previous update," the post read.</p><p>Just eyeballing the perk combinations, the build for that Compass Rose is really wild, stacking up the range and stability, especially with Slideshot attached. Same with Hothead and the Clown Cartridge feature, which randomly overfills the weapon from its reserves. </p><p>As of now, there's no end date for when these will be available, but it sounds as if these are different from the usual randomly rotating items Banshee offers each week. </p>

                <p>Starfield has crossed a new player milestone, reaching 15 million players, as developer Bethesda Game Studios also released a new update that includes the next land vehicle, a new quest, fixes, and more.</p><p>Starfield reached 6 million players on launch day--September 7, 2023--becoming the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-already-has-over-6-million-players-making-it-bethesdas-biggest-launch-of-all-time/1100-6517567/" data-ref-id="1100-6517567">biggest launch in Bethesda's history</a>, and a launch no doubt fueled by Game Pass. The game climbed to 13 million players as of December 2023, and has now added at least two million more.</p><p>"We're thrilled that so many of you have embarked on this journey with us, and we appreciate your feedback. We are always looking for ways to improve your experience playing the game," <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/article/mqjRpu4DgOPKOdHE20SC1/starfields-november-update-is-now-live?utm_source=Community&amp;utm_medium=Social" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bethesda said in a news release.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BotRDlQZYhw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BotRDlQZYhw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Starfield's November update is out now, introducing performance and stability improvements, along with the reintroduction of the uncapped frame rate option on Xbox Series X. Additionally, all Starfield Creations released through Bethesda's Verified Creators program will now work with achievements. Previously, select Creations blocked achievements, but this has now been fixed. However, achievements will not retroactively unlock.</p><p>Additionally, the newest land vehicle, the Deimog, is available now for everyone. "Built for speed and endurance, the Deimog features a fully enclosed cabin to keep you protected as you race through rugged landscapes," Bethesda said, noting that it has "exceptional handling."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urwankF0m64" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/urwankF0m64" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Then, in the spirit of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday in the US, Starfield has added what's called "The Perfect Recipe." This is a new quest where players meet a person, Harbhajan, who is a gifted mechanic with a passion for cooking.
