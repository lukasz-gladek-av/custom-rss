                <p>Late last month, the superhero work comedy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dispatch/" data-ref-id="5000-654979">Dispatch</a> was released by AdHoc Studio. Since then the episodic adventure game has sold 1 million copies in its first 10 days, and the fan response has only grown from there. So much so that AdHoc Studio co-founder Pierre Shorette has acknowledged that the game may not be one-and-done after this week's finale.</p><p>Shorette and his fellow co-founder Nick Herman were guests on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPqU5hSVA78" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Friends Per Second</a> podcast (Via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) when a question about Dispatch Season 2 came up.</p><p>"[I think] that we're going to have to at least think about Season 2 now," said Shorette. "That was a question mark three weeks ago, you know. So, it's a very cool problem to have."</p><p>Shorette reiterated that AdHoc already has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critical-role-is-developing-a-video-game/1100-6533327/" data-ref-id="1100-6533327">a video game project in the works with Critical Role</a>, which will be set in the fantasy world of Exandria. Critical Role's Travis Willingham has said that the game will feature a brand-new story, but characters from the Vox Machina, Mighty Nein, and Bells Hells campaigns could appear.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI2S4LITn8E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EI2S4LITn8E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The final two episodes of Dispatch Season 1 will premiere on November 12. Dispatch hit a new high on Steam last week <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2592160/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with over 131,000 concurrent players</a>. It's possible that the finale will carry the game past that benchmark.</p>

                <p>Next year, Refugium Games is sending players back to school with Agefield High: Rock the School. And you might actually like going to classes at this school, but the real action is off campus in this homage to the teenage sex comedies from the early 2000s. The influence of films like American Pie is very apparent in the first trailer for the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i7RLpcD_jU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0i7RLpcD_jU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game casts players as Sam Tatum, the new kid at Agefield High who quickly befriends Kale Baines and "wannabe rocker" Axel Philly. Sam and his new crew also a mutual enemy in Seth, one of the school's jocks. From the trailer, it looks like there will be plenty of chances to either pull a prank on Seth or physically fight him for high school dominance.</p><p>Now, you could sit in class for lessons in English, math, geography, German, and music; all of which are actually in the game. But you also have the freedom to skip class and explore the game's open world, which expands beyond the campus to include two neighborhoods, the town center, and the country side. Rebellion is encouraged, but adult authority figures like teachers and cops will chase players if they catch them breaking the law or skipping school.</p><p>According to Refugium Games, this title will have approximately 8-10 hours of gameplay spread across 32 primary missions and 15 side missions. Players can earn money to buy clothes, haircuts, and tattoos, as well as bikes, and other accessories. Dirty magazines are also available, because it just wouldn't be a teen comedy without them. This title may remind some fans of Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bully/" data-ref-id="5000-24303">Bully</a>, a game that's gone <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-rockstar-vp-talks-gta-6-explains-why-bully-2-never-happened/1100-6535080/" data-ref-id="1100-6535080">almost two decades without a sequel</a>.</p><p>Agefield High: Rock the School is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3562580/Agefield_High_Rock_the_School/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a> now. Refugium Games estimates that the game will be released in 2026 Q2.</p>

                <p>Nintendo is one of the longest-running and best-known gaming companies on the planet, but just how many games and systems has Nintendo sold over the years?</p><p>The company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251110046253/en/Nintendo-Announces-Holiday-Offers-for-Black-Friday-and-Cyber-Monday-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said today</a> that it's now sold more than 870 million systems and in excess of 6 billion games globally. Nintendo did not provide a breakdown by platform, but <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's public investor relations website</a> shows that the original Switch accounts for a whopping 1.452 billion game sales alone and 154.01 million systems sold. In fact, the Switch is just 10,000 units shy of passing the DS (154.02 million) to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-is-about-to-pass-ds-to-become-nintendos-best-selling-platform-ever-but-may-not-beat-ps2/1100-6535912/" data-ref-id="1100-6535912">become Nintendo's best-selling platform ever. </a></p><p>Behind the Switch and DS for hardware sales is the Game Boy (118.69), the Wii (101.63 million), and the Game Boy Advance (81.51 million) to round out the top five best-selling Nintendo platforms.</p><p>In terms of game sales, the Switch 1 ranks highest by a massive margin. The next closest to the Switch is the DS, which has accumulated 948.76 million game sales, followed by the Wii (921.85 million), Game Boy (501.11 million), NES (500.01 million), and then the 3DS (392.29 million).</p><p>The Switch 2, meanwhile, launched in June 2025 and has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/" data-ref-id="1100-6535903">surpassed 10 million unit sales in its first four months</a>; more than 20.6 million games have been sold for the system. Nintendo also recently boosted its sales projections for the Switch 2, raising the sales forecast for the console this fiscal year from 15 million to 19 million, an increase of more than 26%.</p>
