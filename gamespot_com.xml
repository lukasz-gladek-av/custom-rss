                <p>This week Steam made a small change to how it displays reviews and will now show a score for reviews in your language instead of an "all reviews" score. One game that has benefited from the change is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld</a>, which now shows Overwhelmingly Positive for all English reviews.</p><p>Palworld has been the source of some controversy since it first came to the public's attention, with some claiming the monster-collecting title is a direct rip-off of Pokemon--an opinion that seems to be shared by Nintendo, who eventually sued developer Pocketpair for patent infringement. The game has still proven popular with players, reaching <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-reaches-25-million-players-in-one-month/1100-6521294/" data-ref-id="1100-6521294">huge player numbers</a> in its first month of release.</p><p>While Palworld used to show an all-time review rating of Very Positive on Steam, the reviews update has given the game a small boost in English, granting it the coveted Overwhelmingly Positive rating. The upgrade was celebrated by Pocketpair's communications director and publishing manager John "Bucky" Buckley, who posted to X about the milestone. Bucky clarified in the comments that Palworld isn't rated particularly low in any language--it "just happens to be higher in English," he said in a <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1958048265720524913" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reply</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/bucky_cm/status/1958045103588569460?s=46" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Due to the Steam review change (it now shows the overall score in your language), Palworld is Overwhelmingly Positive! <br>Thank you so much to our overseas fans who continue to support us and enjoy the game! ‚ù§Ô∏è<br>As always, we‚Äôre so incredibly grateful for your continued support!üôá <a href="https://t.co/GswoERWfan" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/GswoERWfan</a></p>  ‚Äî Bucky | Palworld (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1958045103588569460?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Looking through the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Palworld reviews</a> by language, the survival-crafting game has by far the most reviews in English, which average out to Overwhelmingly Positive. The language with the second-largest number of reviews is Simplified Chinese, which have rated Palworld Very Positive -- making it likely that the Chinese reviews were dragging down the average when all review scores were collated. English and Chinese together make up over half of Palworld's total reviews, with all other languages also sporting a Very Positive or Overwhelmingly Positive score.</p><p>Palworld is well into its second year of early access, and continues to receive major updates. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-x-terraria-crossover-update-is-out-now-game-discounted-significantly/1100-6532715/" data-ref-id="1100-6532715">last big update</a> included a crossover with Terraria, while Pocketpair has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-update-adds-big-change-to-avoid-disruptions-amid-nintendo-patent-lawsuit/1100-6531394/" data-ref-id="1100-6531394">changed a few major systems</a> in response to Nintendo's ongoing lawsuit.</p>

The publisher has issued a takedown notice to Nexus Mods to remove a pair of custom nude mods that left the game's lead female character, Isabella Torrisi, without anything to wear.</p><p>Nexus Mods <a href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13520836-takedown-request-issued-by-take-two-interactive-software-inc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">acknowledged the request from Take-Two</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/take-two-lawyers-give-mafia-nude-mods-the-cement-shoes-treatment-dmca-projects-that-had-the-dons-daughter-parading-in-the-buff/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), and complied by removing the Nude Isabella mod and the Extended Textures for Nude Isabella mod, both of which were created by a user known as <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/norskpl/mods" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">norskpl</a>. PC Gamer speculates norskpl may have used Isabella's model from her love scenes in the game. Norskpl's non-nude mods created for The Old Country appear to have been left intact. That includes a few mods that let players assume the role of other characters from the Mafia franchise.</p><p>In the context of the game, Isabella is the daughter of Don Torrisi, the boss of the player's character, Enzo Favara. Although the Don is fiercely protective of Isabella and has his own ideas about who she should marry, she and Enzo have a clandestine affair behind his back. That's the primary romantic relationship in the game, and the source of inevitable conflict.</p><p>Getting rid of the nude mods may keep them off of Nexus Mods, but there's always the possibility that someone can create new mods and post them somewhere else. This may only be a temporary solution for Take-Two, and it only brought the issue to the forefront.</p><p>The Old Country developer Hanger 13 recently stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-will-expand-with-free-ride-mode-in-future-update/1100-6533987/" data-ref-id="1100-6533987">a future update will introduce a Free Ride mode</a> that will let players escape from the linear narrative of the primary story and allow them to explore the countryside around them. The game already has a free-roam mode through the Chapter Replay menu, but the background characters and their surroundings aren't as compelling to see in that mode.</p><p>Mafia: The Old Country is out now for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, 2K Games acknowledged <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-studio-laying-off-devs-as-diablo-boss-takes-over/1100-6534080/" data-ref-id="1100-6534080">a shake-up at Cloud Chamber</a>--the studio behind BioShock 4--following reports that the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-remake-cancelled-as-bioshock-4-reportedly-fails-a-review/1100-6533650/" data-ref-id="1100-6533650">failed an internal review</a>. Now, a new report suggests that the game could have come out as soon as next year if BioShock 4 had been more favorably received by the company.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, BioShock 4 was planned for a debut in either late 2026 or early 2027. However, the subsequent layoffs at Cloud Chamber will likely delay the next BioShock game even further. Bloomberg notes that 80 employees from Cloud Chamber were let go, leaving approximately 170 people remaining at the studio.</p><p>Studio head Kelley Gilmore was ousted from Cloud Chamber after the game's internal review, according to the report. In his place, 2K Games has hired Rod Fergusson to take over the studio following his own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-boss-departs-blizzard-after-five-years/1100-6533809/" data-ref-id="1100-6533809">departure from Blizzard</a>. In addition to leading the Diablo franchise for Blizzard, Fergusson previously worked on BioShock Infinite and helped get that game's production on track.</p><p>The initial reports about BioShock 4's status suggested that 2K Games was unsatisfied by the narrative. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-studio-laying-off-devs-as-diablo-boss-takes-over/1100-6534080/" data-ref-id="1100-6534080">a memo shared with GameSpot</a> by 2K Games, president David Ismailer said, "While we're excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we've made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game."</p><p>For now, there's no word about the release window of BioShock 4.
