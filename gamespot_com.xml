                <p>When Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles was released nearly 25 years ago, it featured a roster of heroes--and a few villains--from Lucasfilm's Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace. Jar Jar Binks was not among the playable characters in the game's original form, but he will be featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/24-year-old-star-wars-game-coming-to-modern-consoles/1100-6527092/" data-ref-id="1100-6527092">the game's upcoming release</a> on modern consoles. In the reveal trailer below, Jar Jar finally gets a chance to become an action hero.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQsFR66qYU4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rQsFR66qYU4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Jar Jar shows far more skill and fighting prowess in that trailer than he ever displayed in The Phantom Menace or any of his subsequent appearances. Regardless, Jar Jar's ridiculous side is also on full display when he runs away from a pack of charging animals on Naboo. Courage was never Jar Jar's strong suit, but it might be fun to play all the way through the game as this unsung hero.</p><p>Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn are the two primary controllable characters in Power Battles. However, the game will also allow players to use Mace Windu, Plo Koon, Adi Gallia, Queen Padme Amidala, Captain Panaka, Ki-Adi Mundi, a battle droid, and Darth Maul. It's also been tweaked by developer Aspyr to give the Jedi screen-accurate depictions of their respective lightsaber colors. For example, that means Mace Windu will be getting his purple lightsaber.</p><p>Players will be able to fight each other in Power Battles' Versus mode, or they can face the Trade Federation side-by-side in co-op gameplay. This release will also feature Big Head Mode and other cheats that can be used during the main game.</p><p>Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles will hit Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on January 23, 2025. If the game follows the same pattern as Aspyr's previous Star Wars games, there may eventually be a physical edition available through Limited Run Games as well.

"We know it’s not fun to see a 'fix' multiple weeks later for something that wasn’t bothering you in the first place, so we’re reverting the Directed Mode changes, giving Shadow Rift four new buffs, and scheduling a fix to allow speedrunners to safely use the Shock Charge tactic in Terminus again. The first two are live now, with the speedrun fix needing some extra testing before it goes live."</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post also thanks players for bringing attention to various bugs, including one that caused visual effects in Citadelle des Morts to display improperly and one that caused the game to crash if players wielded a sword while Aether Shroud is active with the Void Sheath augment. Activision says these bugs have been squashed as of the Season 1 update.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the changes to Zombies, the new update also includes general stability improvements, an increase in match bonus XP for Red Light, Green Light, and a fix for the bug that caused Maya's Joyride skin to become invisible at 70 meters and beyond. Various UI bugs and an audio issue affecting event milestone banners have also been addressed.</p><p dir="ltr">The patch notes are listed in full below.</p><h2>Thursday, January 9 Patch Notes:</h2><h3>GLOBAL</h3><h4>Characters</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue where Maya’s “Joyride” Operator Skin would not be visible past 70 meters.</li></ul><h4>UI</h4><ul><li>Addressed some visual issues with the Events tab.</li></ul><h4>Audio</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue where audio was not playing for Event milestone banners in-game.</li></ul><h3>MULTIPLAYER</h3><h4>Modes</h4><ul><li><b>Red Light, Green Light</b><ul><li>Increased XP awarded from match bonus.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Stability</h4><ul><li>Added various stability fixes.</li></ul><h3>ZOMBIES</h3><p><em>Hey everyone, let’s talk about those changes from January 3rd. The team is always focused on making Zombies fun and rewarding (it’s why we make video games!), but we don’t always nail it the first time.</em></p><p><em>Some fixes for bugs or exploits can become lower priority as more important issues come up, and some need to be held for an update further down the line. Last Friday’s changes to Big Game for Shadow Rift, the Shock Charge speedrun step for Terminus, and Directed Mode spawn delays after 5 looped rounds are prime examples of these.</em><br><em>We know it’s not fun to see a “fix” multiple weeks later for something that wasn’t bothering you in the first place, so we’re reverting the Directed Mode changes, giving Shadow Rift four new buffs, and scheduling a fix to allow speedrunners to safely use the Shock Charge tactic in Terminus again. The first two are live now, with the speedrun fix needing some extra testing before it goes live.</em></p><p><em>Thanks to everyone for the reports of visual FX not showing properly in Citadelle des Morts and crashes that can happen when you’re using a sword while Aether Shroud is active with the Void Sheath Augment. The team produced fixes for these bugs shortly after they popped up, and they’re live today.</em></p><h4>Maps</h4><ul><li><b>Citadelle des Morts</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where using the Void Sheath Augment for Aether Shroud with one of the Elemental Swords would cause the match to crash.</li><li>Addressed an issue where many visual effects would stop playing.</li><li>Directed Mode  <ul><li>Addressed an issue where guidance would be incorrect if a player disconnected with a stamp.</li><li>Addressed an issue where guidance would be incorrect each time a new stamp spawned.</li><li>Addressed an issue where picking up Solais after a stamp was spawned could prevent quest progression.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h4>Modes</h4><ul><li><b>Directed Mode</b><ul><li>Removed the extended time between rounds and the delay between spawning zombies after five looped rounds at the round cap.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Ammo Mods</h4><ul><li><b>Shadow Rift</b><ul><li><b>Activation Rates</b><ul><li>Normal enemy activation rate increased from 15% to 20%.</li><li>Special enemy activation rate increased from 5% to 7%.</li><li>Elite enemy activation rate with Big Game Augment equipped increased from 5% to 7%.</li></ul></li><li><b>Cooldown Timer</b><ul><li>Decreased cooldown by 25%.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><em>The Big Game Augment for Shadow Rift was never intended to one-shot Elites, but we know it worked like that for months and we heard you about this latest change taking too much away from Shadow Rift overall. So, we’ve added four buffs to make Shadow Rift activate more frequently, including a 25% cooldown reduction, to keep it powerful and fun to use.</em></p><h4>LTM Highlights / Adjustments</h4><ul><li><b>Dead Light, Green Light</b><ul><li>Added Liberty Falls to map selection.</li><li>Increased round cap to 20 before Exfil.</li></ul></li></ul><p><em>With the launch of Dead Light, Green Light, we wanted to ease players into the LTM with a single map and a 10-Round cap before Exfil to make sure the majority of players had a chance to be successful without feeling they needed GobbleGums to survive. Basically, a bite-sized experience that’s not too punishing. Looks like it was too easy and over too soon for a lot of you!</em></p><p><em>Starting today, we’ve added Liberty Falls to the map selection and extended the round cap to 20. After that, we’ll plan Week 3’s round cap extension based on how crazy the community wants the challenge to get.</em></p><h4>Stability</h4><ul><li>Various stability fixes.</li></ul><p><em>Sometimes bugs appear fixed in testing but turn out to still be an issue in the live game after the patch goes out. This sucks for everyone involved, and it can lead to inaccurate patch notes, which we never want. The Vermin double-attack bug is one of these, and like the Terminus speedrun fix, the proper solution for it unfortunately can’t be implemented as quickly as some of the other items listed above. Look for both of those fixes when Season 02 launches on Jan. 28.</em></p>

<section><p>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap created a new kind of magical fantasy by showing us an unseen side of Hyrule at microscopic scale.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, January 10, 2025. Below, we look back at how the team came up with a playful sense of scale as its central hook.</em></p><p dir="ltr">The Legend of Zelda series is filled with dynamics that stretch and alter the world of Hyrule. Whether it be going back in time or into a realm of darkness, these add a new element of exploration that you wouldn't see in a peaceful Hyrule. The goal with many of these design choices was to inspire wonder--to give players a reason to explore familiar areas they've seen several times before. The Minish Cap's shrinking feature is one of the best examples of The Legend of Zelda designers achieving that goal.</p><p dir="ltr">Recent games like Tinykin, It Takes Two, and Grounded have explored what it's like to explore the world while tiny, but few have created the dichotomy that The Minish Cap had with its shrinking feature. It encouraged fascination with the mundane--anything and everything could be hiding Link's next discovery.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we started thinking about what that gimmick could be for Minish Cap, first, we knew it couldn't be that far-removed or out-there from the world of Zelda," said The Minish Cap director Hidemaro Fujibayashi in a <a href="https://shmuplations.com/minishcap2/" rel="nofollow ">2004 interview</a> in Nintendo Dream magazine. "I started thinking, what feature[s] of these game worlds could we possibly expand on, what dimension could we explore? "Front and Reverse, Past and Future, Light and Darkness… we'd done all these before, but could some other pairing remain? I racked my brain until I realized--ah hah, if we make Link small, that would be like entering a whole 'nother world within his own."</p><p dir="ltr">The Minish Cap's hallmark shrinking feature led to an overworld that was absolutely packed with puzzles to solve. Its clever use throughout the game make it one of the best examples of The Legend of Zelda designers inspiring wonder, and it's an aspect of the game that still stands out 20 years later.</p><p dir="ltr">While individual dungeons and the overworld are packed with fascinating content to explore, the mere idea that an entire village could be hidden inside a tree or rock inspires a Breath of the Wild-like sense of wonder that was somehow accomplished with 2004 technology.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfEMNbjLd3Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UfEMNbjLd3Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In Capcom's The Legend of Zelda adventure, the world of Hyrule has tiny beings called the Minish packed into stumps, under rocks, and in dozens of other places across the kingdom. These Minish are everywhere, even under the snoozing nose of a shoemaker. Link and the rest of Hyrule have never heard of these creatures, making further discovery of how they live a wonderful story thread to pull on.</p><p dir="ltr">The Minish Cap lets you yank on that thread early on in your adventure, shortly after peril comes to Hyrule. Soon after the villain of the entry, Vaati, unleashes a horde of monsters across Hyrule, Link travels to The Minish Woods to find the Minish, retrieve four elemental stones, restore the sword of legend, and restore Hyrule and a Zelda, the latter of whom has been turned to stone.</p><p dir="ltr">Much of this is standard Zelda flare, although the leadup to discovering the Minish for the first time establishes the larger-than-life level design that will fill the rest of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Link's new sidekick, Ezlo, shrinks him down using a portal found in The Minish Woods, eventually leading him through logs, over drifting pondweed, and around life-size sticks and acorns to find the miniature race of people who would kick off the rest of his adventure.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking back, this moment doesn't seem incredibly impressive on its own, but its ingenuity is found in how it sets up the rest of the game. Navigating the small platforming section and keeping an eye out for areas that can only be explored while small is what, as Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma said, turns the entire overworld into something just as challenging as the series' trademark dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">"Dungeons have a certain limited format to them, right? Find keys, advance further, defeat the boss," Aonuma said. "In contrast, the outside world, the field map, can offer more multifaceted gameplay."</p><p dir="ltr">Kinstone fragments scattered across the overworld feel like standard collectibles at first, but they amount to more by unlocking other areas of the map. Find two of the same type, fuse them, and the classic Zelda discovery jingle will play--meaning a new path opens up, a chest is revealed, or something similar happens.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of these Kinstones are found within puzzles that require you to shrink down and climb a bookcase, run across bakery shelves, or even dodge gigantic raindrops: simple acts that give you an entirely new angle through which to view Hyrule.</p><p dir="ltr">"Collecting the fragments opens up areas far from your current location," Aonuma said. "In a sense, this makes the overworld map itself act like one big dungeon."</p><p dir="ltr">This sense of wonder came from Capcom's goal to shift away from their design approach on Oracle of Ages, Oracle of Seasons, and Four Swords. While they ended up building off of the Gnat Hat--an item that shrunk Link down in Four Swords--they wanted to replicate Nintendo's approach to Zelda by focusing on worldbuilding. In doing so, they just happened to create an amazing world that came from posing a simple question: What's hidden beneath and within all the familiar workings of Lake Hylia and Lon Lon Ranch?</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to make a 'mainline' traditional 2D Zelda game. Traversing overworld maps, exploring dungeons. The essence of Zelda," Fujibayashi said. "I see it as following in the steps of the Famicom Zelda and A Link to the Past, but a more powered-up version for today's hardware."</p><p dir="ltr">Exploring cracks in rocks and tiny holes in the side of cottages in 2004 is the equivalent of scaling the side of the mountain in Breath of the Wild in 2017. The biggest contrast is the technology, as Capcom worked within the parameters of Game Boy Advance hardware in order to instill a magic that could be felt through a 2.9-inch screen. That tiny, mystical world hidden amongst fantastic combat and puzzles makes The Minish Cap one of the most memorable Zelda games today,</p>

Later, however, Genki told <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/01/10/148376.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Spark</a> that its mockup was in fact based only on leaks, not from seeing the system first hand, and that it doesn't actually know what Nintendo is planning.</p><p>Genki also said at CES that it expects the Switch 2 to launch in April 2025. In addition to the leaks that stem from Genki, other reports claim to reveal the first details on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-switch-2-renders-grant-a-360-degree-look-at-the-console/1100-6528727/" data-ref-id="1100-6528727">Switch 2's new Joy-Cons, which could include a new feature and a more ergonomic design. </a></p><p>Nintendo has confirmed it will announce its next console by the end of March 2025, so a reveal could happen very soon. Many are expecting the console to then launch later in the year.</p><p>The Switch 2, or whatever the system may be called, has enormous shoes to fill, as the original Switch sold more than 146 million systems and 1.3 billion games.</p>
