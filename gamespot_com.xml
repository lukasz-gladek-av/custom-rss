                <p>There's just a few weeks remaining in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Chapter 6 Season 2, and it's increasingly looking like next season is going to represent a major change from the typical summer Fortnite schedule. Normally, the spring Fortnite season would run until late May or early June, but Season 2 is wrapping up weeks earlier. But there's a very big reason for the change--more on that in a moment.</p><p dir="ltr">Even as we wait for Season 3, there's still some work to be done before we get there. The final part of Season 2's storyline quests is now active, and they'll lead us into another end-of-season story event like the titanic battle between <a href="https://youtu.be/wId1oLFboy8?si=Iy5iKSimdfek-lbx" rel="nofollow ">Shogun X and Daigo</a> we had in Season 1.</p><p dir="ltr">Once that's done, it'll be full speed ahead toward Season 3, which reportedly has a theme that's going to get a whole lot of folks excited. Let's take a look at what we know so far.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Fortnite_Star_Wars_Season_start_date">Fortnite Star Wars Season start date</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 theme</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_reveal_event">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 reveal event</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Star_Wars_season_battle_pass">Fortnite Star Wars season battle pass</a></li><li><a href="#New_Fortnite_Star_Wars_skins">New Fortnite Star Wars skins</a></li><li><a href="#Lego_Fortnite_Star_Wars_updates_in_Chapter_6_Season_3">Lego Fortnite Star Wars updates in Chapter 6 Season 3</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Star_Wars_Season_start_date">Fortnite Star Wars Season start date</h2><p dir="ltr">The current battle pass is advertised to end on May 2 at 10:30 PM PT / 1:30 AM ET, which means the plan is for Fortnite to go offline at that time for maintenance and the season update. If all goes well, the new season will kick off during the morning of Friday, May 2.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 theme</h2><p dir="ltr">All signs indicate that Season 3 <a href="https://x.com/FNBRintel/status/1904930387219874285" rel="nofollow ">will be a Star Wars-focused season</a>, which will add Star Wars locations, weapons, and items to battle royale, like last year's Marvel-oriented Absolute Doom season. But it seems as though Epic has learned some important lessons from the way the last Marvel season wore out its welcome so hard that the company had to pull most of the Marvel items from battle royale before the season ended--this Star Wars season will reportedly <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1904931354669691269" rel="nofollow ">last just a month</a>.

Given the rampant rumors, it's expected that this is when the upcoming Star Wars season will be officially announced. It's unlikely we'll get a full battle pass reveal, since Epic usually likes to promote that stuff within a day or two of the season launch, but some sort of teaser is obviously happening.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Star_Wars_season_battle_pass">Fortnite Star Wars season battle pass</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4478345-fortnitelightvsdark.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478345" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4478345-fortnitelightvsdark.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478345"></a><figcaption>The Star Wars: Light vs Dark event took over Fortnite battle royale in May 2023.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4478345-fortnitelightvsdark.jpg"></figure><p>A Star Wars-themed season would mean a Star Wars-themed battle pass, but none of the skins have leaked yet. There are rumors and guesses based on code names, like Qui-Gon and C-3PO, but nothing real just yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that the season is expected to last just a month, it's likely the battle pass will be shortened as well--the 30-day OG and Remix passes included just four skins instead of eight. But it could be that this Star Wars pass <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1905351440748732912" rel="nofollow ">will have five skins</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="New_Fortnite_Star_Wars_skins">New Fortnite Star Wars skins</h2><p dir="ltr">While a Star Wars season would obviously include Star Wars skins on its battle pass, we'd also expect to see some new stuff in the shop, too.

If Star Wars season is indeed arriving in battle royale that day, it stands to reason the same thing will happen in Lego Fortnite Odyssey. Last year's Lego Pass (pictured above) included a Chewbacca skin and ushered in a major Star Wars storyline, and so it seems safe to assume that the next Lego Pass will include another Star Wars person, and that the Galactic Civil War will once again intrude upon your Lego Fortnite islands.</p>

Players must help Hello Kitty &amp; Co. collect Mystic Stones to restore magic to the Kingdom of Friendship.

It also includes a new feature in which players help Keroppi plant and maintain an orchard located on City Town's rooftops, allowing players to grow 13 new fruits. These new fruits can then be used to concoct new types of Fruit Sandos in the Imagination Cafe.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also includes a City Town newcomer and new visitor quests. Players can help decorate a cabin to serve as a home for Retsuko's new friend, Puko, and new quests for pre-existing City Town visitors have also been added.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, Fruitful Friendship is introducing a number of player-requested quality-of-life improvements, like a map to help players navigate City Town's Sewers and an updated tool wheel.</p><p>But even more seasonal content is on the way, according to developer Sunblink Entertainment, which directed players to "prepare for an <em>egg-cellent</em> island takeover of an iconic Sanrio pal." The developer added that "Players can look forward to exciting content update coming soon."</p><p>Hello Kitty Island Adventure is available to play via Apple Arcade, PC (via Steam), and Nintendo Switch.</p>

                <p>CI Games has revealed Lords of the Fallen version 2.0 and it comes with plenty of surprising features, including shared progress co-op saving and a Friend Pass. However, the Steam release has been delayed.</p><p>Co-op was one of Lords of the Fallen's standout features, but now the update lets both players save all main story progress. There are some caveats, though. Both players need to be on the same "New Game" and must have defeated a similar number of bosses. They will retain all loot and 100% vigor.</p><p>There's also a new Friend Pass that lets players invite another person even if they don't own the game. The invited friend gets to keep all loot and character classes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jQ3S2JzA9s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2jQ3S2JzA9s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new update adds a dedicated jump button and a refined lock-on function, as well as an overhauled character creator. The animations should look smoother and as a result, weapons and evasions should feel more responsive. The user interface has also been cleaned up, and the Umbral Lamp now can guide players to the next destination.</p><p>In a now-deleted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1501750/view/527592442371768492" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam blog post</a>, CI Games apparently stated that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-out-now-with-enhanced-combatmovement-and-free-friends-pass" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam release is seeing a small delay due to a technical issue</a>, but the 2.0 update should be live on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and the Epic Games Store.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lords-of-the-fallen-review-dark-slog/1900-6418133/" data-ref-id="1900-6418133">Lords of the Fallen review</a>, we said, "While Lords of the Fallen has all the right Souls-like elements, its disjointed pacing and painful checkpoint system make much of the game a slow and frustrating march."</p>
