Far from simply updating the game's visuals and adding some modern quality-of-life features, Blizzard is also taking a look at gameplay balance.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZ2jiW95qo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ryZ2jiW95qo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Most of the changes in the new <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/blizzard/t/warcraft-ii-remastered-patch-notes-101/52999" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Warcraft 2: Remastered patch 1.0.1</a> are related to resource costs and ability durations for various units. Archers and Axe Throwers have received some significant changes to their upgrades, which are now faster to research, deal more damage, and cost less gold and (in most cases) lumber to learn. Paladins have received some slight buffs, as have Death Knights.</p><p dir="ltr">One huge change players seem happy with is a nerf to the Ogre Mage's Bloodlust ability, long regarded as overpowered for those playing as the Horde and an ability without a good Alliance alternative. The ability doubles the damage and piercing damage of a selected unit for a set duration, allowing Bloodlusted units to cut through even heavily armored foes with ease.</p><p dir="ltr">Post-patch 1.0.1, Bloodlust has had its duration decreased, its mana cost increased, and had its double-damage buff applied after armor reduction instead of before. The ability will still be extremely valuable, but it's at least not quite as omnipotent as before.</p><p dir="ltr">These balance changes are the first major gameplay updates to the beloved RTS since the arrival of patch 2.02 for the 1999 Battle.net version of Warcraft 2. I wasn't able to find an exact date for when 2.02 released, but given the Battle.net version of Warcraft 2's October 1999 release, it likely came a few months later or sometime in 2000. That makes the Warcraft 2: Remastered balance changes the first for the RTS in roughly 24 or 25 years.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the balance changes, the update additionally re-adds the game's classic Victory/Defeat screens and animations, adds an Alliance menu for online multiplayer, introduces countdowns to matches when waiting in a multiplayer lobby, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Classic game storefront GOG recently announced Blizzard would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-1-and-2-delisted-on-gog-december-13-folllowing-blizzard-remasters/1100-6528156/" data-ref-id="1100-6528156">pulling the non-remastered versions of Warcraft 1 and 2 from sale on December 13</a>. Despite the fact they will soon be delisted, GOG said it would continue to provide tech support for both games to ensure compatibility for future versions of Windows.</p>

The game entered early access on Steam on July 15, 2015, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/333640?emclan=103582791436993571&amp;emgid=4542535021350562775" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Freehold Games stated that it had actually been 15 years</a> since development started.</p><p>The 1.0 version of Caves of Qud launches with the Dromad deluxe edition, as well as a tutorial and the last story quest with multiple endings. The Dromad deluxe edition includes some new features, including an enhanced soundtrack and the Pets of Harvest Dawn DLC pack that unlocks some in-game pets at the start of the game. For those who already own Caves of Qud, the soundtrack and the DLC pack can be purchased separately.</p><p>Unfortunately, save files prior to 1.0 will not be compatible with the full version of the game. However, players can continue playing their old saves on the 208.x legacy branch, which can be switched to from the Betas menu in Steam.</p><p>Caves of Qud will cost $30, but there's a 15% launch discount until December 12. Freehold Games is also holding a speedrunning contest for streamers today to celebrate the launch. Those who can beat the game as quickly as possible will be able to win Caves of Quid prize packs.</p><p>Freehold Games also said that it plans to keep supporting Caves of Qud with post-launch content after the release of 1.0, and will share those details in a future update.</p>

                <p>One of the year's most highly anticipated games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-collectors-edition-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6524003/" data-ref-id="1100-6524003">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, gets early access tonight at 4 PM PT / 7 PM ET for those who bought the Premium or Collector's Edition, but some players got their hands on an earlier release. Leaked gameplay first appeared on YouTube on Thursday, showing the game’s first three hours.</p><p>Even though the video, posted by YouTuber Lone Viking, was eventually taken down by ZeniMax, some of the game's plot points were revealed. Lone Viking said that he purchased the game from a local store, where he paid $80-$100 to get it three days early for the game's basic release on December 8. Official review embargos are expected to lift later today at 4 PM PT / 7 PM ET, the same time as the early access.</p><p>What we do know from the game is that Indy has split from his on-and-off-again companion, Marion Ravenwood, and finds himself on the trail of a great conspiracy that leads him through the Vatican, the Sukhothai temples in Thailand, the Egyptian pyramids, Shanghai, and the icy Himalayas.</p><p>Game Pass users can upgrade to the Premium Edition for $35 (or $100 for those buying the full game without Game Pass) to play early and score a few bonuses like a Temple of Doom outfit and a future story DLC, the Order of the Giants. PlayStation owners will have to wait a bit longer to punch Nazis and seek treasure as the game isn't headed to the console until Spring 2025.

He was hit by a truck and ultimately pulled under it as the driver kept going. "The Xbox in my backpack prevented me from hitting my head or worse, even dying. I wasn't gonna get shredded beneath the truck so I used my left leg to attempt to slow the truck," Brandon wrote.</p><p>"At this point my bike wedged my right leg so I couldn’t move it anywhere. Next thing I know my backpack was only hanging on by my left shoulder and was slammed into the curb along with me afterwards."</p><p>After this, Brandon said he felt the full weight of the front end of the truck begin to roll onto his ribs, going on to say he was dragged for about 12 feet. He was taken to the hospital and miraculously only had a single broken bone in his left foot, in addition to some road rash. Not only was Brandon mostly OK from the experience, but his Xbox didn't break either. He said it booted up normally and runs games despite the toll it took and the damage it sustained.</p><p>"If the Xbox wasn’t in my bag at the time a lot more could have happened…" he wrote. Brandon also shared a number of images to demonstrate the damage.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Jonzey8828/status/1864267929463988625" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>This Console Saved My Life Guys… <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xbox?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Xbox</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxSeriesS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XboxSeriesS</a></p><p> I was on my way home from my local GameStop with the Xbox in my backpack when I was struck by a truck while riding my bicycle.

                <p dir="ltr">It might not be arriving anytime soon, but Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has made clear that work is resuming on Haunted Chocolatier. The Stardew Valley creator has returned to the game after focusing on that title's 1.6 update.</p><p dir="ltr">Barone wrote <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2024/12/04/update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new blog post</a> on the Haunted Chocolatier website, acknowledging it's "been a while" since the last update.

"I'm coding it (mostly from scratch) in C#, and I'm working solo in all areas," wrote the developer. "Why? It's what I'm comfortable with, it's what I enjoy, and it worked well for Stardew Valley."

adventure, and mystery," the official description for Ananta reads.</p><p>As seen in the trailer above, it looks like there'll be some bizarre enemies to face off against, like sentient toilet armies, cars armed with chainsaw arms, and other forms of weirdness plaguing Nova City. You'll be able to get around the metropolis in a variety of vehicles, and judging by the trailer, it looks like the characters can also swing into action or sneak around enemies in a manner that looks heavily inspired by Insomniac's recent Spider-Man games.</p><p>When it comes to combat, Naked Science added that you can use your surroundings to defeat enemies, and between patrols, you'll also be able to take a break with various activities ranging from pub crawls to pumping some iron in a local gym. Ananta is in development for PC, PS5, and iOS, but it doesn't have a release date yet.</p>
