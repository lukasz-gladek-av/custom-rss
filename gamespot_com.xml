Unfortunately, Blackwell Fields is a large-scale area with a ton of open ground, causing players to voice their complaints about the map.</p><p dir="ltr">Blackwell Fields is set on a massive oil field in California, with lots of open ground for snipers and long-range combat. The map offers structures like oil wells, construction equipment, and small pieces of cover, but it doesn't feel like enough to cater to all playstyles. Close-quarter tactics are difficult to utilize here, and it can feel overwhelming to try and capture points.</p>

Now, two of the directors of MultiVersus have revealed that they are joining forces to launch a new studio, Airlock Games, which will be completely self-funded.</p><p>MultiVersus production director Justin Fischer and technical director Brock Feldman are the founding members of Airlock Games, and the duo previously worked on Disney Infinity and Medal of Honor. Rather than diving back into AAA games, Fischer and Feldman plan to focus on making smaller games more quickly.</p><p>"Weâ€™ve spent years working on high-profile AAA titles, but we missed the wonderful, reckless creativity of more focused games," said the pair in a statement. "It's a space where we can focus on providing new experiences that interest us both as players and developers. We're so excited to have the freedom to take creative risks, push boundaries, and tell stories that just aren't feasible for AAA productions."</p><p>Airlock Games already has its first title on the way.

                <p>Fans of roguelites and roguelikes will be happy to see two of the genreâ€™s standout titles--Vampire Survivors and Balatro--come together in a free collaboration today. Vampire Survivors, a game where players fend off endless waves of night creatures, now features jokers, planet cards, and artwork from one of 2024â€™s biggest hits.</p><p>"Now you can use Balatro characters in Vampire Survivors whilst using Vampire Survivors card skins in Balatro," the YouTube summary of the announcement trailer reads. "The ultimate indie game ship came true ðŸ’ž thank you to Reddit user mranonymous24690 for kickstarting this ship many months ago."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB0begpTOdQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gB0begpTOdQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The trailer showcases planetary cards and the banana joker Cavendish, among others, circling the main character and destroying enemies. The update, known as Vampire Survivors 1.14, or Ante Chamber, is out today on Steam, PlayStation 5, and mobile platforms. It will arrive on Nintendo Switch and the Epic Games Store on October 31.</p><p>Both games have collaborated with other major franchises in the past. Vampire Survivors has featured crossovers with games like Among Us and Contra, while Balatro has released cosmetic card designs featuring characters from Assassinâ€™s Creed, Fallout, Stardew Valley, and several other games.</p>
