                <p>Localizing video games can be challenging, and in the case of Animal Crossing, bringing the distinctly Japanese social-sim to the West in 2002 proved to be a Herculean labor. One of the big obstacles was renaming the game, as its Japanese title of D≈çbutsu no Mori had to be changed for its Western release.</p><p>The entire localization job took between six months and a year to complete, former Nintendo of America localization manager Leslie Swan said to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west" rel="nofollow ">Time Extension</a>, and one of the proposed titles was Animal Acres, a name that was inspired by the grids of the town. This was ultimately rejected by Nintendo, with the title of Animal Crossing being approved instead.</p><p>The late Satoru Iwata--who was the head of Nintendo's corporate planning division at that time--laughed when he heard that Swan and her team were working on the English localization. Game producer Takashi Tezuka had also warned the team about taking on the task, as they'd need to not only translate thousands of lines of text, but also rename characters, come up with new catchphrases for them, and figure out how to adapt Japanese-specific themes for Western audiences.</p><p>"I was in a meeting with Mr. Iwata and some other heads of the development group, and we were just kind of going around saying, 'Here's what we're going to be working on', and I just said, 'Well, Mr. Tezuka is asking us to work on Animal Forest' and he just burst out in laughter," Swan said. "He just laughed and said, 'I don't know how you're going to do this.' And it's true, just everything in that game was so specific to Japan."</p><p>The last Animal Crossing game, New Horizons, was released in 2020 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-switch-2s-launch-animal-crossing-new-horizons-gets-first-update-in-years/1100-6531857/">and it recently got a Switch 2 update</a>. The future of the franchise remains a mystery--even in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic helping to turn <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-huge-sales-figures-we/1100-6477018/">New Horizons into a massive hit for Nintendo</a>--but you can bring the game and your favorite villagers everywhere with you as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-crocs-let-you-bring-your-favourite-villagers-everywhere-now-available-to-order/1100-6534311/">Animal Crossing Crocs are now available to order</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Hollow Knight: Silksong's first patch has been announced, and it makes the game easier, at least somewhat. The new update includes a "slight difficulty reduction" for the early-game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter. Additionally, Sandcarvers will do less damage.</p><p>The new Silksong patch also includes a variety of fixes. Players should no longer get stuck floating after down-bouncing on certain projectiles, while Silk Snippers in Chapel of the Reaper could previously get stuck out of bounds but that should be fixed now.</p>

<p>This patch will arrive mid-next week. Team Cherry said it's already working on more fixes for the second patch. "If you have an issue and you don't see the solution in the list, we may be working on it," the developers said.</p><p>"All fixes will apply retroactively, so players who've hit a significant bug that prevents progress may want to switch over to public-beta to receive the fix," Team Cherry explained.</p><p>For those eager to play with the changes, or who might be relying on one of its progression bug fixes, the new update is usable by accessing the public beta branch on both Steam and GOG.

                <p>2017's Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus is one of the last decade's best first-person shooters, blending brutal combat with a Nazi-hunting story that sees protagonist BJ Blazkowicz come face to face with Adolf Hitler himself. For those who have played the game, you likely remember this pivotal scene, but according to the development team, it also could have been a penile scene.</p><p>That's right: If it weren't for higher-ups at Bethesda, the game would have shown Hitler's weird penis.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E189QG28rnE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noclip</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-poured-cold-water-on-hitlers-penis-appearing-in-wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), MachineGames studio director Jerk Gustatfsson revealed the (tiny) tidbit of information while discussing the creation of the game. It would have occurred when Hitler was urinating in a bucket (which did make it into the game) as Blazkowicz prepared to deliver his lines in a film audition.</p><p>Game director Jens Matthies added that he asked a production executive at Bethesda about this idea, and was advised not to do it--so we were left only seeing Hitler violently vomiting and peeing haphazardly into a bucket.</p><p>Perhaps that was for the best, as Hitler--whose role in WW2 ended with a big hole in his head--reportedly had a <a href="https://www.livescience.com/53818-hitler-micropenis.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">very weird wiener</a>, as well.

                <p>Microsoft has announced that it has collaborated with LG to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to select internet-connected vehicles. By using LG's webOS Automotive platform, passengers will be able to stream and play games directly from the Xbox app. Players will need to have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription and an automotive data plan to access their gaming library, but Microsoft says that it will give them instant access to hundreds of games via Game Pass as well.</p><p>A new video showed off how this works, with the footage specifically focused on people in the rear enjoying some games--just in case you were worried that this partnership could lead to some IRL Forza Horizon from the driver in the front.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPlEDcuirA4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GPlEDcuirA4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's not unsurprising to see Microsoft expand its cloud gaming initiative to cars, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/">as the company's marketing for its gaming brand in 2025</a> has been focused on how you don't need to own an Xbox console to play Xbox games. "This Is An Xbox" has been the primary slogan for this advertising campaign, which emphasizes how the Xbox ecosystem can be accessed through a wide variety of devices.</p><p>Next Generation at Xbox VP Jason Ronald also recently spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/">Microsoft's plans for its next-gen Xbox console</a>, explaining that the company envisions players having options to play games while they're out and about and then pick up from where they left off by using dedicated hardware. "It's really just focused on how players like playing games in the current environment and just designing and building a platform with them at the center," Ronald said.</p><p>While an LG car equipped with internet functionality and dedicated monitors will <em>probably </em>be more costly than an Xbox console, it does make the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X mobile gaming PCs a more palatable option in comparison. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-launch-date-set-for-october-features-steam-deck-style-compatibility/1100-6534120/">Set to launch on October 16</a>, pricing for them has not yet been revealed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wont-or-cant-reveal-rog-xbox-ally-x-price-yet-but-report-says-it-could-be-900/1100-6534122/">but it's rumored that the most expensive device</a> could cost up to $900.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
