                <p>In 2018, as part of the promotion for Avengers: Infinity War, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/thanos-arrives-in-fortnite-for-avengers-infinity-w/1100-6458760/" data-ref-id="1100-6458760">Thanos was added to Fortnite</a>, complete with the Infinity Gauntlet and some dance moves that would make John Travolta blush. But it may not have ever happened if Infinity War directors Anthony and Joe Russo hadn't directly lobbied Epic Games to bring Thanos into the world of Fortnite.</p><p>During <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/how-a-nearly-six-hour-phone-call" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business Live</a>, Pete Wanat--the president of interactive technology for the Russos' AGBO--revealed that Epic's former chief creative officer, Donald Mustard, wasn't initially on board with having Thanos in Fortnite. That's why Anthony and Joe Russo spent hours convincing him go forward with it.</p><p>"Originally it was like, 'No, we are not interested in putting outside characters into Fortnite,'" recalled Wanat. "And Joe and Anthony got together and had a phone call with Donald. It was supposed to be a half-hour call, but five-and-a-half hours later, they were still talking about it. And Donald basically changed his mind. He said, 'Hey, you know what, we're going to do this.' And after that, the world exploded about what kind of integrations you could have between film and TV and games."</p><p>Mustard ultimately went on to work directly for the Russos at AGBO, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-dancing-thanos-in-marvel-movies-is-better/1100-6458841/" data-ref-id="1100-6458841">dancing Thanos</a> became a meme that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-josh-brolin-responds-to-dancing-thanos-i-/1100-6458915/" data-ref-id="1100-6458915">confused his MCU actor</a>, Josh Brolin.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FldbEoG6fpo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FldbEoG6fpo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Once Thanos paved the way for outside characters to appear in Fortnite, it opened the floodgates. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-fortnite-john-wick-skin-and-event-leak-in-seas/1100-6466767/" data-ref-id="1100-6466767">John Wick</a> skin followed the next year, and the trend continued this year with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">a Darth Vader who can speak with the AI-generated voice</a> of the late James Earl Jones.</p><p>Starting Friday, June 13, Hank Hill from King of the Hill, Cleveland Brown from Family Guy, and Bob Belcher from Bob's Burgers will all be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-getting-some-famous-cartoon-dad-skins-for-fathers-day/1100-6532364/" data-ref-id="1100-6532364">added to Fortnite for Father's Day</a>.</p>

                <p>Charles Martinet--once the voice actor for one of gaming's most iconic characters and now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-will-no-longer-be-voiced-by-longtime-actor-charles-martinet/1100-6517020/" data-ref-id="1100-6517020">Nintendo's official Mario Ambassador</a>--has had to clarify his stance on voicing Mario for fans. After a viral post claimed Martinet was no longer allowed to do Mario's voice, Martinet posted to explain that he simply won't improvise lines for Mario.</p><p>After meeting with Martinet at a convention, YouTuber Ricky Berwick <a href="https://x.com/rickyberwick/status/1931740018596585814" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted to X</a> claiming the actor "wasn't even allowed to do the voice of Mario or any of his iconic character's voices." In the replies, another user <a href="https://x.com/MEBJR1001/status/1931859944938078582" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted</a> a similar story claiming Martinet couldn't do the voice because he was "under a contract." Berwick later clarified in a reply to his original post that Martinet did the Mario voice for him off camera, but "wasn't allowed to" on video.</p><p>While fans were concerned about the possibility of a restrictive contract with Nintendo, Martinet replied to the post directly, explaining that what he will and won't voice for fans at conventions is due to his own choices.</p><p>"I do the voice for every fan I meet," Martinet promised in a reply. "I just don't improvise non-Mario phrases or dialogue. That's my choice to be sure. I always maintain the integrity of the character."</p><p>Martinet first voiced Mario for 1996's Super Mario 64, and has reprised his role for countless games since. Martinet was replaced as the character's voice actor as of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-bros-wonder/" data-ref-id="5000-591688">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, but has been given the official--if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/charles-martinet-has-no-idea-what-a-mario-ambassador-does/1100-6517466/" data-ref-id="1100-6517466">somewhat vague</a>--title of Mario Ambassador. The role of Mario has now been taken up by voice actor Kevin Afghani, and Nintendo didn't make a big fuss about the recasting--telling fans they could find out who the new actor was in the end credits for the game.</p>

                <p>On June 15, 2018, Innersloth debuted Among Us on mobile before eventually bringing the game to consoles and PC.

The Skeld will also be adorned with festive decorations during that time.

Those rules will be posted on the Among Us blog on June 15.</p><p>The day after the anniversary, Innersloth will host a special live-stream on YouTube, starting at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET on June 16.

                <p>Epic Games has filed a lawsuit against the creator of cheating software used in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>, as well as multiple resellers of the software. The company says the lawsuit is part of its ongoing effort to keep Fortnite free from cheaters.</p><p>The lawsuit names an individual known as Sincey Cheats (real name Ediz Atas), who "develops, updates, and maintains cheat software" for Fortnite, according to Epic.

The lawsuit claims that one of the defendants even impersonated an Epic employee to get their promotional YouTube videos re-listed after a DMCA claim from the company took them down.</p><p>"Epic does not tolerate cheating and bans the use of cheat software in Fortnite," the lawsuit says, adding that Sincey Cheats constantly updated the Vanta cheat software to get around Fortnite's anti-cheat measures, and subsequently advertised the software as "undetected."</p><p>Epic is asking the defendants to turn over all materials related to the cheating software, including all domain names associated with selling Vanta.
