                <p>Electronic Arts--the publisher behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2024/" data-ref-id="5000-648934">Battlefield</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/" data-ref-id="5000-179949">The Sims</a>, and several popular sports series--has announced it is ending its remote work policies, and will be implementing a full return to office. CEO Andrew Wilson stated that this decision reflects the company's desire to foster "kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players."</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Wilson delivered the news to employees in a company-wide email sent out on Wednesday, May 14. In it, he explained that "hybrid work" will now be defined as a "minimum of three days a week in your local office," while "offsite local roles" will be gradually phased out.</p><p>EA Entertainment President Laura Miele then sent a follow-up email to employees, clarifying what employees can expect as the company moves from "a decentralized approach to a globally consistent, enterprise-wide work model." Below is the outline Miele included:</p><ul><li>These changes will not take effect immediately. Employees should continue working as directed by your Business Unit until further notice, regardless of where you live.</li><li>Work model transitions will come with a minimum 12-week notice period before any changes are implemented. The timing will vary by location and will be communicated locally with plenty of notice.</li><li>Hybrid work will mean working from your local office at least three days per week–this aligns with what’s outlined in Andrew’s EA Action.</li><li>We are introducing a new 30-mile/48-km radius around EA locations.</li><li>What this means:  <ul><li>Employees who live within 30-miles/48-km of an EA location will transition to a Hybrid work model.</li><li>Employees who live outside the 30-mile/48-km radius will be considered remote unless their role is designated as On Site or Hybrid.</li></ul></li><li>We will also sunset the Offsite Local work model. Depending on your location, this transition may take 3 to 24 months.</li><li>Any work model exception and future Remote hires will require a CEO Direct’s/my approval.</li></ul><p>As per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN's report</a>, employees within EA are "upset and confused" by the sudden policy change. Some employees will now face "hours-long" commutes, while other have expressed concerns regarding childcare and their ability to manage personal medical conditions. Two anonymous sources reportedly explained to IGN that, per Miele's email, existing remote workers will have their "exemptions" to return to office "sunset" sometime within the next "3 to 24 months."</p><p>EA now joins <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-reportedly-now-in-final-stages-of-development-as-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-plans/1100-6521477/" data-ref-id="1100-6521477">Rockstar Games</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-workers-in-france-urged-to-strike-over-return-to-office-mandate/1100-6526740/" data-ref-id="1100-6526740">Ubisoft</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-company-wide-meeting-reportedly-made-employees-feel-extremely-unimportant-and-unsupported/1100-6511643/" data-ref-id="1100-6511643">Activision Blizzard</a> in the growing list of companies doing away with remote work policies. All four have faced sharp criticism from within and without the organizations as a result of these actions, and have generally seen an increase in employee turnover and employee unionization efforts as well.</p>

                <p>Valve has confirmed that your Steam password, or other private information, did not leak. On top of that, Valve stated that the leak came from a different source than Steam, and does not provide info linked to your Steam account in any way you need to worry about.</p><p dir="ltr">In a statement sent to GameSpot, a Valve representative said "Yesterday we were made aware of reports of leaks of older text messages that had previously been sent to Steam customers. We have examined the leak sample and have determined this was NOT a breach of Steam systems."</p><p dir="ltr">The security company Underdark was the first to report the alleged leaks, writing on LinkedIn that information from 89 million Steam accounts was being sold on the dark web. However, Valve has corrected that, as the leak came from the SMS service that sends temporary two-factor login codes. Valve said that the phone numbers were leaked, but that any information related to your Steam account, including which account the phone numbers are tied to, was not leaked.</p><p dir="ltr">Valve continued the statement by saying that Steam users don't need to change their passwords or be concerned following this scare, but Valve will continue to investigate to determine the origin of the breach. The company does recommend that users activate the Steam Mobile Authenticator because it provides a more secure way to authenticate your account compared to SMS authorization.</p><p dir="ltr">You can read Valve's full statement to GameSpot below:</p><p dir="ltr">"Yesterday we were made aware of reports of leaks of older text messages that had previously been sent to Steam customers. We have examined the leak sample and have determined this was NOT a breach of Steam systems.</p><p dir="ltr">We’re still digging into the source of the leak, which is compounded by the fact that any SMS messages are unencrypted in transit, and routed through multiple providers on the way to your phone.</p><p dir="ltr">The leak consisted of older text messages that included one-time codes that were only valid for 15-minute time frames and the phone numbers they were sent to. The leaked data did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data. Old text messages cannot be used to breach the security of your Steam account, and whenever a code is used to change your Steam email or password using SMS, you will receive a confirmation via email and/or Steam secure messages.</p><p dir="ltr">From a Steam perspective, customers do not need to change their passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event. It is a good reminder to treat any account security messages that you have not explicitly requested as suspicious. We recommend regularly checking your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/authorizeddevices" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam account security</a> at any time.</p><p dir="ltr">We also recommend Steam users set up the Steam Mobile Authenticator if they haven’t already, as it gives us the best way to send secure messages about their account and that account’s safety."</p>

                <p>Nintendo has unveiled a new feature for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a>, and it's one you might not have expected: binoculars.</p><p dir="ltr">Revealed on the Nintendo Today app, where Nintendo regularly posts bits of news, will feature stationary binoculars you can find in specific locations around the open world. In a short video, Mario is shown approaching the binoculars before being sent up into the air, where you can look around in a zoomed in first-person view. This was done in the desert area shown off in the reveal trailer for the Nintendo Switch 2, with looks at the diner, parts of the track, and a plane flying overhead.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo did not provide any insight into why you would use these, but based on known information about Mario Kart World ,it seems like the binoculars would be handy to spot secrets and other points of interest you might want to drive to. There are secrets to discover in the open-world of Mario Kart World, and without knowing how the locations are conveyed to you--if at all--this might be Nintendo's solution.</p><p>This also seems like a way for Nintendo to reveal more about Mario Kart World ahead of its launch on June 5, alongside the Nintendo Switch 2. The video is titled "Binocular View of the World #1" which implies that Nintendo will roll out a few more of these, revealing new looks at the different tracks in the game. Nintendo typically posts a single update on Nintendo Today each day, so these might be spaced out.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding/" data-ref-id="5000-451575">Death Stranding</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid/" data-ref-id="5000-1362">Metal Gear Solid</a> creator Hideo Kojima is well-known for crafting games that speculate on what our collective future might entail. However, recent events have left the game director taking a deeper look at his own future, and what might become of Kojima Productions when dies.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/az-magazines/6936449/edge-magazine-subscription.thtml" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Edge Magazine</a> (later reported on by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-says-hes-left-staff-a-usb-stick-of-game-ideas-for-after-he-dies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), Kojima said that falling "seriously ill" during the pandemic inspired him to re-evaluate his career ambitions and how much time he has left as a creator. After recovering, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/death-stranding-2-screenshots/2900-6560/" data-ref-id="2900-6560">Death Stranding 2</a> director made the decision to give a "USB stick with all my ideas on it" to his personal assistant as a way to ensure the studio has new ideas to toy around with after he is gone. Kojima likened the storage device to a "will" of sorts.</p><p>"Perhaps they could continue to make things after I’m gone at Kojima Productions… This is a fear for me: what happens to Kojima Productions after I’m gone? I don’t want them to just manage our existing IP," Kojima said.</p><p>The game director--who turns 62 this August--said that the pandemic was ultimately more of a turning point for him than entering his 60s. After falling ill and undergoing an eye operation, he was left unable to "create anything." At the same time, he witnessed "lost of people around me passing away."</p><p>"Until then, I didn’t think I was old, you know? I just didn’t feel my age, and I assumed I would be able to create for as long as I live," Kojima said. "But then I became sick, and I couldn’t create anything. And I saw lots of people around me passing away at that time. I was confronted with death. Of course, I recovered, but now I was thinking, 'Wait, how many years do I have left to make game or a film?' Perhaps I have 10 years?"</p><p>Kojima added, however, that he has since put his ambitions to direct a film aside. He credits directors Guillermo del Toro and Nicolas Winding Refn--both of whom appear in the Death Stranding series--for this decision, as both encouraged him to stick to video games.</p><p>Kojima Productions' next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-and-i-cant-wait-to-do-it-all-again/1100-6531384/" data-ref-id="1100-6531384">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, is now only a month away. The second-ever "Strand game" is scheduled to release exclusively for PlayStation 5 on June 26, though players who order the Collector's and Digital Deluxe Editions of the games will gain access starting on June 24. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-and-i-cant-wait-to-do-it-all-again/1100-6531384/" data-ref-id="1100-6531384">preview</a> of the game, Dan Ryckert wrote that he can "confidentially say it's excellent."</p><p>"Like the first game, it can be meditative in the quiet moments as you traverse the environment. But when the game wants to get loud, it does not hold back. One chapter--titled 'Conflagration'--is one of the most visually stunning sequences I’ve ever seen in a game," Ryckert wrote. "Even running on a base PS5, it’s a spectacle that culminates in a boss encounter that rivals the best of Metal Gear Solid. Mechanically, it’s essentially a shootout with a boss and multiple soldiers, but tonally and visually, it’s Kojima firing on all cylinders and it’s truly jaw-dropping."</p>

Obsidian isn't resting on its laurels, however, as the studio has released a full roadmap for the rest of 2025 that includes some juicy additions to the open-world adventure.</p><p dir="ltr">The Spring update, Update 1.4, released today on Xbox and PC.

Today's patch also allows players to wait at the Party Camp to pass in-game time, view chests on the minimap, or perform a new cancel ability with Bow and Arquebus power attacks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4495798-avowed-roadmap-2025.png" data-ref-id="1300-4495798" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4495798-avowed-roadmap-2025.png" data-ref-id="1300-4495798"></a><figcaption>Avowed Roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4495798-avowed-roadmap-2025.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead to the rest of the year, the Summer patch will bring improvements to cooking and crafting, custom map markers, and new NPC abilities and behaviors throughout. The Fall update, meanwhile, will add New Game Plus, a Photo Mode, new character presets, and a new weapon type--though Obsidian's blog post on the roadmap doesn't go into specifics on what that new weapon type will be.</p><p dir="ltr">Avowed launched in February to critical acclaim, as it currently sits at an 81 average score on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/avowed/">GameSpot's sister site Metacritic</a>.
