          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fbc-firebreak/" data-ref-id="5000-647734">FBC: Firebreak</a> is Remedy's first multiplayer game, and it's jumping into the well-occupied space of co-op PvE shooters. That means it has the benefit of looking to predecessors in the genre to understand what works, what doesn't, and in what ways Firebreak can stand out from the pack. I always love learning about which games developers looked to when making theirs, so I recently asked Remedy's Mike Kayetta, game director on FBC: Firebreak, to talk about the games the team looked at to help guide the scope and style of Remedy's upcoming shooter.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> was a big help, which makes sense given its popularity. Remedy observed how the team at Arrowhead was able to navigate the ups and downs of the ludicrous third-person shooter to somewhat inform best practices for a game like FBC: Firebreak. Kayetta told me that it helped when Remedy asked, "What's working for them, what's not working for them?". But it was far from the only such game the team looked at. Kayetta name-dropped several games that the team would play together for "analysis" in the studio. Many of them make perfect sense as soon as you learn them.</p><p dir="ltr">"If it's a session-based co-op shooter, we've played it into the ground," he said, listing off a parade of recent co-op games including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-547394">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic/" data-ref-id="5000-460551">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/aliens-fireteam-elite/" data-ref-id="5000-527726">Aliens: Fireteam Elite</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-end-times-vermintide/" data-ref-id="5000-394441">Vermintide</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide/" data-ref-id="5000-516156">Darktide</a>. Like Helldivers 2, none of those were all that surprising, but one immediately stuck out the moment Kayetta said it. "We had some interesting additional reference points, too. We looked at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overcooked/" data-ref-id="5000-453001">Overcooked</a> quite a bit, because we wanted to see--like, that is such a fun type of chaos, where things get out of hand, but you still feel like you have meaningful agency despite things feeling out of hand."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4492663-fbc_firebreak_hotfix_ess_20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4492663" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4492663-fbc_firebreak_hotfix_ess_20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4492663"></a><figcaption>Remedy looked to the past of co-op successes and struggles to help shape its first multiplayer game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4492663-fbc_firebreak_hotfix_ess_20.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">His comments came after I'd played the game for quite a while that morning already, so I could see firsthand the shared DNA between Overcooked and Firebreak, but it was still surprising to hear the comparison out loud. Firebreak's elemental combat and class-based systems meant everyone had a role to play, and it was apparent when anyone in the group had broken that chain of responsibility--as apparent as leaving the burgers on the stove too long and starting a kitchen fire.</p><p dir="ltr">Funny enough, though the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/left-4-dead/" data-ref-id="5000-29417">Left 4 Dead</a>-like beats are clear, Kayetta said he doesn't recall the team ever playing that one together--for good reason, however. "Interestingly, it's one of those games that's so big and so famous that I don't feel like we actually played it as a team very often, because everyone just felt like they were already bringing the full wealth of experience and knowledge about it. And so I literally can't think of one time I played Left 4 Dead with anybody on the team. It's one of those games that's just in the DNA of gaming."</p><p dir="ltr">FBC: Firebreak arrives on June 17 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. It'll launch right on Game Pass Ultimate and PlayStation Plus Premium, too. Free updates will follow later this year, bringing more missions and cosmetics into the game, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-is-a-defiant-punk-rock-take-on-co-op-shooters/1100-6531475/" data-ref-id="1100-6531475">the game has taken some anti-FOMO steps</a> to keep players from feeling like the game is asking too much of their time.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're coming to Remedy's multiplayer game as a lore chaser, here's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-fbc-firebreak-fits-into-the-remedy-connected-universe/1100-6531477/" data-ref-id="1100-6531477">how FBC: Firebreak fits into the Remedy Connected Universe.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">When FBC: Firebreak arrives on June 17, it will be the latest game to add to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-alan-wake-2-every-game-remedy-is-working-on-right-now/1100-6514998/">Remedy Connected Universe</a>. It's inherently a Control spin-off, even being set in the same liminal bureaucratic maze known as the Oldest House, so there's no question whether it would contribute to Remedy's Marvel-like spider web of storytelling, but after speaking to the team, we now know a bit more about <em>how</em> it will contribute to that connected universe.</p><p dir="ltr">We know the game is set six years after the events of Control. Like the 13 real-time years between both the fictional events and releases of Alan Wake and Alan Wake 2, the time between 2019's Control and 2025's FBC: Firebreak will mirror the real world. In that span, the Oldest House has remained locked down and the Hiss did not let up.</p><p dir="ltr">That's meant anyone outside of the building hasn't been able to get in, apparently. Worse, it means the unfortunate agents who were inside the shapeshifting hub that day have spent more than half a decade stuck inside with the Hiss threat. In gameplay terms, this will see player-characters running low on standard-issue supplies, resulting in them improvising with unique weapons and gear for the three-player co-op game. Still, since the game is without cutscenes or heavy exposition, lore devotees like me might wonder what else the game can teach them about the RCU. Don't worry, game director Mike Kayetta told GameSpot; there's still material there to be investigated.</p><p dir="ltr">"We knew that we wanted to find ways to connect back to the [RCU] and expose things going on, especially about this time period and these people," he said, revealing that a lot of the lore will be found during loading screens. "You're not going to be able to collect documents in the game and view them--although we have talked about if that's something people want later, we'll look at doing that. But for now, we were like, 'Where are the places that we can fit things in?'</p><p dir="ltr">"And we identified the loading screens as one of these places where you can get snippets of information. So we're actually going to be introducing a bunch of additional Control lore through those screens. And we're randomizing it so that the more you play--even though you're not collecting them--the more hours you put into the game, the more you're going to actually start seeing more and more interesting things that may or may not connect to each other and to other events going on."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4492665-fbc_firebreak_groundcontrol_3ss_10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4492665" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4492665-fbc_firebreak_groundcontrol_3ss_10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4492665"></a><figcaption>Though I saw familiar locales during my hands-on time with FBC: Firebreak, Remedy confirmed the game will take players to brand-new corners of the Oldest House, too.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4492665-fbc_firebreak_groundcontrol_3ss_10.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Kayetta said additional lore will drip out through the things characters say, likening it to Left 4 Dead's way of doing things. "We talked about not doing a lot of direct storytelling for a lot of reasons. We believe this is very counter to the experience, just like Left 4 Dead. It's one of the reasons they chose zombies, because you just go in and you know what zombies are [...] One of the cosmetics that we're adding to the game over time is voice packs. And each of those voice packs has a custom script, all of the lines, not just a reaction like, 'Oh, there's an enemy over there,' but also all the idle or narrative-based lines that they say.</p><p dir="ltr">"And our goal right now is that you could be playing this for, like, 20 hours and still actually be hearing new things. So they're all small, right? Because we don't want to do cutscenes and big storytelling, but they do add up to something bigger and deeper and more interesting over time. So, if you are a lore guy, you're not going to get that wild canvas that is something like Alan Wake, but we're also not ignoring it. We're taking it very seriously, and Clay [Murphy], who wrote Control, is helping work on a lot of these things too."</p><p dir="ltr">Though Kayetta didn't say this explicitly, I expect some of what FBC: Firebreak reveals about the future of Control 2 will be there for the lore divers to parse through. To that end, I'd bet my last pack of legally distinct Alan Wake Remastered flashlight batteries that we'll see the name Chester Bless, or the Blessed Organization, appear in one or more of those loading screens. If that name is new to you, you might enjoy the deep dive that is our earlier <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-alan-wake-2-every-game-remedy-is-working-on-right-now/1100-6514998/" data-ref-id="1100-6514998">look-ahead on the RCU</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">FBC: Firebreak arrives on June 17 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.
