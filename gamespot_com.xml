                <p>Elden Ring Nightreign's newest patch, 1.01.2, is out now, and it's exclusively focused on bug fixes.</p><p>The new update fixes a bug that would prevent the Demon Merchant from appearing in some scenarios. It also addresses an issue where Libra, Creature of the Night, would "repeatedly perform some actions." Additionally, the patch fixes a problem that could cause stability issues with the game in the battle sequence against Adel, Baron of Night.

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo has hidden Mirror Mode in the Free Roam mode for Mario Kart World in a pretty awesome way. Players can flip the open world by driving into the stained-glass window of Princess Peach on her castle at the center of the map, though there is a catch: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-mirror-mode-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6532291/">Mirror Mode must already be unlocked</a> through the Grand Prix and Knockout Tour Cups--on top of some other requirements.</p><p dir="ltr">Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hides-mirror-mode-free-roam-behind-a-mario-64-easter-egg" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>, an <a href="https://x.com/Ninjinaut/status/1931248124208496810" rel="nofollow ">account on X called Ninjinaut</a> showcased the Mirror Mode Easter egg in Free Roam for Mario Kart World. The video sees Baby Rosalina jumping into the window, which is a direct callback to Super Mario 64's mechanic for accessing new worlds. The screen fades to white and then shows Princess Peach flipped. Baby Rosalina then shoots out of the window, with the open world now in Mirror Mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that Free Roam is only playable in single-player, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-is-missing-one-feature-people-really-wanted/1100-6532133/">as people realized co-op was missing for the mode</a> when Mario Kart World launched last week alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a>.

                <p>It's been five years since Naughty Dog released The Last of Us: Part 2, and with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-showrunners-tease-season-3s-new-direction/1100-6531811/" data-ref-id="1100-6531811">Season 3 of the HBO series in the works</a>, the anticipation and clamoring for a Part 3 has never been higher. However, showrunner Craig Mazin admittedly knows just a hint of the story for the potential game, but isn't sure if it'll ever happen.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__flfZc9JCc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BAFTA</a> about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-it-cant-be-for-nothing/1900-6418351/" data-ref-id="1900-6418351">Season 2</a> of The Last of Us, Mazin said game creator and co-showrunner Neil Druckmann told him some ideas he had for a Part 3, but would be okay if the game never came into fruition.</p><p>"I am familiar with some concepts that Neil has kicked around for a potential third game. I don't know if he's zeroed in on one of them. I don't know what will happen there," he explains, adding that although he'd like Part 3 to happen, he also thinks maybe less is more. "Sometimes I think, maybe you should just be happy. Don't be sad it's over--be happy that it happened at all! I think Naughty Dog is an incredible game studio. They make beautiful art, and their ability to convey what we can do in television through animation is pretty remarkable."</p><p>He continued with how he could be selfish and beg Druckmann to make Part 3, but feels as though he would rob the studio of other potentially great games it could make instead.</p><p>"It's not like what I want is going to matter. They will do what they do, and all I know is that I'll be there on day one to play Intergalactic. If there's another Uncharted, I'll play it. If there's another Last of Us, I'll play it."</p><p dir="ltr">The most recent comments about The Last of Us: Part 3 from Druckmann himself said he's not ruling it out, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-could-happen-if-the-stars-align-neil-druckmann-says/1100-6530741/">he's not confirming it either.</a></p><p dir="ltr">"Back at Naughty Dog, we're now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, which is something we've been working on for many years. That is taking up all of our time," he said. "I am treating these projects like it's the last thing I will ever work on. So my assumption is that there will be no more [The Last of Us games]. If the stars align, and everything comes into place, who knows?"</p><p dir="ltr">Naughty Dog is currently working on multiple games. Alongside Intergalactic, a mystery second game is in development.</p>

It doesn't appear to be a hardware problem either, as Switch 2 users have reported that the console isn't correctly registering how much of a battery charge is left, resulting in them being told that they're almost out of power after playing for only a short amount of time.</p><p><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68272/~/the-battery-charge-indicator-or-percentage-displays-incorrectly-on-nintendo" rel="nofollow ">According to Nintendo</a>, the quick fix for this problem is to enter the secret Recovery Mode on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>This should reset the console battery, and it can be done by following these steps:</p><ul><li>Make certain that your Switch 2 has the latest system update</li><li>Power off your Switch 2 completely</li><li>Press and hold down the volume up (+) and volume down (-) buttons, then press the power button <strong>once</strong> to turn the system back on</li><li>Keep holding down the volume buttons until the menu for Recovery Mode appears</li><li>Power off the console again by pressing and holding the power button until it turns off</li><li>Power the console back on</li></ul><p>Our testing confirms that this method does work--my Switch 2 would only charge up to 82% with the power-saving mode enabled but it now reaches a charging percentage of 89%--and there is a second solution here just in case this one doesn't work.</p><p>This requires a few more steps, as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/support/articles/the-battery-charge-indicator-or-percentage-displays-incorrectly-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo advises charging the Switch 2 to 100%</a> and then letting the battery drain until it is <em>almost </em>empty--a complete drain is harmful to overall battery life--and then charging it back up to 100% again. Doing this several times should "gradually" improve the battery charge indicator, Nintendo says.</p><ul><li>Ensure the console has the latest system update</li><li>Set all three Auto-Sleep mode settings to "Never"</li><li>Connect the AC adapter directly to the console</li><li>Allow the console to charge until the battery is 100% fully charged, or until the console has been charging for at least three hours</li><li>Leave the console alone and connected to the AC adapter for an additional hour</li><li>When an hour has passed, disconnect the AC adapter from the console and allow the console to display the Home menu for approximately three to four hours</li><li>The remaining battery life must be depleted as much as possible</li><li>Once the battery charge is almost depleted, power off the console and leave it alone for at least 30 minutes</li><li>Repeat these steps 3 several more times</li><li>The battery charge indicator will improve gradually by repeating this process several times</li></ul><p>If that's not enough to fix the problems on the Switch 2, Nintendo recommends sending it in to be serviced. With the Switch 2 now out, owners have discovered several tips for ensuring that the device runs in peak condition. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-improve-switch-2-battery-life/1100-6531649/">There are several ways to ensure that the Switch 2 battery has a long life</a>.

                <p>Get your Splattershots ready--Nintendo's beloved shooter series Splatoon is getting its first spin-off game. The Nintendo Today app shared the announcement of Splatoon Raiders, a spin-off featuring the Deep Cut idol band from Splatoon 3. It's coming out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive/2900-6628/" data-ref-id="2900-6628">exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2</a>, while Splatoon 3 is receiving a free Switch 2 update this week.</p><p>The Splatoon Raiders trailer depicted Deep Cut members Shiver, Frye, and Big Man on a helicopter, discussing their next treasure-hunting destination, the Spirhalite Islands. Their helicopter crash-lands, setting the stage for an island adventure. Players will take the role of a mechanic, exploring the mysterious new locale with Deep Cut.</p><p>While the Nintendo Today video showed some action, it didn't share any specific objectives or details about the gameplay loop of Splatoon Raiders. The video also lacked any details about a release window.</p><p>Watch the announcement video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7ve2zWmkEA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d7ve2zWmkEA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Meanwhile, the upcoming Splatoon 3 update, scheduled for June 12, will freshen the game up for Nintendo Switch 2. Along with improved visuals and performance, especially in hubs like Splatsville, which were capped at 30fps on the original Switch. More importantly, this version 10.0.0 update for Splatoon 3 includes new weapons.</p><p>The Splatlands Collection of 30 weapons features familiar ink-splatting artillery but with different loadouts of sub- and special weapons, along with unique visual designs. And for the more hardcore competitive players, the upcoming patch includes a new stat in the ranked Anarchy Battles called Series Weapon Power, which tracks win/loss ratios per weapon and matches players with others with similar ratings.</p><p>The Splatoon 3 update is a welcome surprise, considering Nintendo only planned to add new content to the game for two years after its September 2022 launch. It's also another fun addition to the growing list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">Switch 1 games getting a free update</a> for the new hardware. And while Splatoon Raiders isn't necessarily a proper fourth installment, the spin-off may satisfy Splatoon players, especially all those Big Man fans out there.</p>
