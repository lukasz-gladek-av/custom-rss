While fans will eventually get to revisit Night City, Mike Pondsmith--the creator of the Cyberpunk franchise--has hinted that the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel will include a second city.</p><p>Pondsmith appeared at Digital Dragons 2025 (Via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-features-a-second-city-that-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong-reveals-creator/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>) and indicated that he's not heavily involved with the Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up. But he has been shown the scripts and he's been kept in the loop about some fresh additions to the game's universe, including a new city.</p><p>"I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place… because there's another city that we visit," said Pondsmith. "And I'm not telling you anymore than that. But there's another city that we visit. Night City is still there."</p><p>"I remember looking at it and going, 'I understand the feel that you’re going for, and this really does work,'" added Pondsmith. "'It doesn't feel like Blade Runner, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong.' And I said, 'Yeah, I can see this working.'"</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-4/" data-ref-id="5000-561041">The Witcher 4</a> may be getting the majority of CD Projekt Red's attention, but the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel is currently in development at the publisher's Boston studio ostensibly to give the game a more authentic American experience than the first one. A recent job posting for the game suggested that the devs want to create "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-wants-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-to-have-most-realistic-crowds-ever/1100-6529613/" data-ref-id="1100-6529613">the most-realistic crowds ever</a>."</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-cd-projekt-acknowledges-development-challenges/1100-6531129/" data-ref-id="1100-6531129">Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition</a> will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">a launch title for Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

                <p>Bethesda has announced that Doom: The Dark Ages has become developer id Software's "biggest launch" in the company's 34-year history dating back to 1991.</p><p>The game reached 3 million players, and did so seven times faster than Doom Eternal. Bethesda did not share any sales numbers, however, nor do we know how much was spent on development, marketing, and other expenses. Developers are known to closely guard these kinds of details, which makes it challenging to unpack the overall success of a given game.</p><p>Another key thing to consider here is that Doom: The Dark Ages launched on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a>, whereas the previous games in the trilogy, Doom (2016) and Doom Eternal (2020) did not. <a href="https://x.com/thegamebusiness/status/1925099149965275234" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Ampere Analysis</a>, of the 3 million total players for Doom: The Dark Ages, 2 million came from Game Pass.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Thank you for making DOOM: The Dark Ages the biggest launch in id's history - 7x faster to 3 million players than DOOM Eternal. <a href="https://t.co/c0SKR97FO8" rel="nofollow  ">pic.twitter.com/c0SKR97FO8</a></p>  — Bethesda (@bethesda) <a href="https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1924921261253075244?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2025</a></blockquote>

                <p>The second series of Naughty Dog's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-460201">The Last of Us</a> has been critically acclaimed since it debuted on HBO Max earlier this year, and with the TV adaptation earning rave reviews, fans are wondering if this could result in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">third game being made</a>. The Last of Us creative director Neil Druckmann says that he'd be keen to revisit the post-apocalyptic series, provided that certain conditions are met.</p><p>One of the primary requirements for Druckmann is that he'd want the threequel to have a story that's "worthy" of being set in The Last of Us series. The creator says that he aims for quality over quantity, an artistic vision that has extended to other projects he has worked on.</p><p>"While I am the caretaker of this franchise, whatever the title is that Sony has entrusted me with, it's important for me that everything is of high quality. I don't want to just make a lot of it. I want to just be very thoughtful about everything that we make," Druckmann said in an interview with Sacred Symbols.</p><p>"When we did the show, now we've teamed up with, I feel like, the best TV-makers, with HBO. We're making the best version of it. If we were ever to come back to it, I want to make sure that it's a story worthy of The Last Of Us. I love that world. I love these characters. With the right opportunity, yeah, I would totally jump at it."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8tOTQhepAI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O8tOTQhepAI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>So far, there have been only two games set in The Last of Us series. Both of these titles have been remastered--the first game has been remastered <em>twice</em>--and there was even a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-went-wrong-with-the-last-of-us-online-according-to-an-ex-sony-exec/1100-6529585/">live-service spin-off game in development before it was canceled</a> as Naughty Dog decided to focus on single-player games instead.
