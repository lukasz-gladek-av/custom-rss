                <p>The topic of AI is already clouding the outlook of various industries, including video games. No one knows what that will mean for the future of game development, but Remedy--the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alan-wake-2-review-a-miracle-illuminated/1900-6418143/" data-ref-id="1900-6418143">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/control-ultimate-edition-cloud-version-review/1900-6417600/" data-ref-id="1900-6417600">Control</a>--has clarified its stance on the topic while revealing that the company has utilized it for years.</p><p>"AI is a very wide topic," said chief technology officer Mika Vehkala during <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Remedy's recent financial presentation</a>. "Remedy has been using various AI models and techniques before the recent emergence and interest towards [it] happened. We are constantly working with our partners to look for opportunities that this can give. We are actually using some of these tools that are more popular and suit our needs at the moment."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7o3vvH49IM" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I7o3vvH49IM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Vehkala and chief product officer Markus MÃ¤ki also stressed that Remedy isn't using AI to replace creative jobs or actors. Instead, the company is using the technology to handle the "dull" parts of game development like tracking movements through motion-capture performances. Vehkala also disclosed that Remedy has a dedicated person at the company whose job requires them to keep an eye on the emerging tech. But he added that Remedy is not rushing into it.</p><p>In October, Remedy shared the first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedys-control-multiplayer-game-revealed-as-fbc-firebreak/1100-6527233/" data-ref-id="1100-6527233">FBC: Firebreak</a>, the upcoming spin-off from Control that will be released in 2025. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-dlc-has-a-teaser-for-control-2/1100-6527341/" data-ref-id="1100-6527341">Alan Wake 2's DLC</a> was recently revealed to have a teaser for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-2-will-lean-more-into-rpg-mechanics/1100-6527864/" data-ref-id="1100-6527864">Control 2</a>. That game doesn't currently have a release window. But those aren't the only titles among <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-alan-wake-2-every-game-remedy-is-working-on-right-now/1100-6514998/">Remedy's future games</a> that could be affected by the company's use of AI.</p>

The November 19 patch notes include the return of legacy XP tokens to Black Ops 6 and a fix for overpowered shotguns in Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the main highlights of the update is the return of the legacy XP tokens, which were tokens players earned in Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone prior to Black Op 6's launch. These XP tokens were originally added in with the Season 1 update, but the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-2xp-token-issue-after-fan-outcry/1100-6527821/">developer removed them shortly after</a>, claiming that they were connected to a UI bug with potential risk to game stability. Now players can once again activate those old MW3 tokens to level up faster in Black Ops 6.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2091411205" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

                <p>Fourteen years is a long time to wait between sequels, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-4-everything-we-know/1100-6485774/" data-ref-id="1100-6485774">Fable</a>--the first game in the action-RPG series since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fable-iii-review/1900-6314980/" data-ref-id="1900-6314980">Fable 3</a> in 2010--was finally unveiled earlier this year during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-trailer-shows-first-gameplay-coming-2025/1100-6524087/" data-ref-id="1100-6524087">Summer Game Fest</a>. While we haven't seen a new trailer since then, a new report says the upcoming sequel will have combat mechanics similar to CD Projekt RED's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-next-gen-update-review-winds-howlin/1900-6416135/" data-ref-id="1900-6416135">The Witcher 3</a>.</p><p>Windows Central's Jez Corden recently disclosed that he was shown alpha footage of Fable that had "CD Projekt RED DNA" in the way the main character handled herself in battle. He also noted that the combat flowed smoothly from melee weapons like swords to magical attacks, not unlike the way Geralt fights in The Witcher 3. Corden said it wasn't one-to-one like Geralt, but it was enough to impress him.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ZakkenKloot/status/1858632263761883513" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">âBREAKING NEWS ð¨<br>Jez Corden recently saw Alpha-footage of FABLE.<br>-CDProjekt RED dna.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a> is the follow-up to the highly successful RPG of the same name that was released in 2013. With the original being released over a decade ago, it's no surprise that it's still missing some modern features that we expect in games today. One of those features is cross-play, which has never been brought to the original Path of Exile. Fortunately, the developers at Grinding Gear Games have confirmed that Path of Exile 2 will feature cross-play support.</p><p>You can learn all about how the feature works and what you need to do to access it in the guide below.</p><h2>How cross-play support works in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Grinding Gear Games is going in the opposite direction in Path of Exile 2 compared to the original. The upcoming sequel will feature total cross-play support. This means you'll be able to play with any other player, regardless of the platforms you'll be playing on.</p><p>For example, if you're on PC and you want to play with someone on Xbox One, you can easily party up with them. The same works for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S users and any other platform combination. Path of Exile 2 is being initially released on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. However, if future platforms are added to the mix, cross-platform support will likely include those platforms, as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4401884-poe22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4401884" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4401884-poe22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4401884"></a><figcaption>Path of Exile 2 launches in early access on December 6.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4401884-poe22.jpg"></figure><p>When you find a friend you want to play with, all you have to do is add them in Path of Exile 2 through their username. If the friend is on the same platform as you, they can join you through your system's friends list, in addition to the game's friends list. Once your friend is added, you can invite them to your party, or you can join theirs. <strong>Path of Exile 2 supports up to six players per party</strong>.</p><p>Cross-play support in Path of Exile 2 also means trading can be done across different platforms. So you don't have to worry about another player being on a different platform if you want to trade an item with them.</p><h2>Is there cross-save progression in Path of Exile 2?</h2><p>While cross-play support is terrific, what about cross-save support, also known as cross-progression? This is another feature that Grinding Gear Games has confirmed will be included in Path of Exile 2 during its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-early-access-delayed-still-releasing-in-2024/1100-6527447/" data-ref-id="1100-6527447">early access launch</a>.</p><p>Cross-progression support means players can log into their Path of Exile 2 account on any platform and keep all of their saved data. For example, if you mainly play on PlayStation 5 but need to swap over to PC, you can do so without having to worry about losing your account's progress.</p><p>Path of Exile 2 is set to hit early access on December 6, but if you're looking for something to play sooner, check out our gallery of November's biggest games.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/control/">Control 2</a>, the sequel to developer Remedy Entertainment's eerie game will be an action-RPG. This was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/remedygames.com/post/3lbch2m27ot2a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared</a> during Remedy's Capital Market day on November 19, alongside additional details to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/control-review-an-action-packed-paranormal-portal/1900-6417278/" data-ref-id="1900-6417278">Control's</a> Mac support and an upcoming free update.</p><p>Action-RPG might conjure the image of a game like Diablo, but it doesn't sound as if Remedy is straying greatly from the formula of the first Control. In a statement to GameSpot, the developer expanded on the news: "Let people speculate, but suffice to say, Control 2 is a natural continuation to the first game, holding on to key tenets of storytelling and spectacle, but leaning even further into player agency, exploration and RPG mechanics."</p><p>Elsewhere in the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">investor video</a>, Remedy said that the sequel is being made to appeal to a wider audience, but didn't elaborate exactly on what this means for the game. In addition, Control will receive a free update in early 2025, which will unlock "some previously released content."</p><p>The previously released content could refer to a few existing exclusive and paid DLC outfits--the Extradimensional Suit available through the AWE DLC, the Tactical Response outfit as a preorder reward, the Astral Dive Suit as a day-one bonus for PS4, and the Urban Response outfit as a goodie included in the Control Digital Deluxe edition for PS4.</p><p>Lastly, Control Ultimate Edition will be available on Mac on February 12, 2025. While the sequel doesn't have a release window, the multiplayer spin-off, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedys-control-multiplayer-game-revealed-as-fbc-firebreak/1100-6527233/" data-ref-id="1100-6527233">FBC Firebreak</a>, should ease the wait when it launches next year. If you want a closer teaser, there's a glimpse of the sequel in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-dlc-has-a-teaser-for-control-2/1100-6527341/" data-ref-id="1100-6527341">Alan Wake 2: The Lake House DLC</a>, which is an additional chapter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2s-the-lake-house-expansion-is-both-an-epilogue-and-prologue/1100-6527270/" data-ref-id="1100-6527270">you shouldn't miss</a>.</p>

                <p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard had fans waiting a decade, and it seems so far <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the wait was worth it</a>, but the latest entry isn't a return to the franchise--it was a return to the Golden Age of BioWare. Along the way in its development, Dragon Age: The Veilguard originally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-boss-discusses-ditching-live-service-and-multiplayer-focus-for-the-veilguard/1100-6527540/" data-ref-id="1100-6527540">included multiplayer elements</a> until EA and BioWare changed course.</p><p>The massive decision for the overhaul was supported by EA and has seemed to have been the right call. Speaking on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/corinne-busche-john-epler-game-directors-dragon-age/id1665581266?i=1000677429520" rel="nofollow ">My Perfect Console</a> podcast, The Veilguard directors Corinne Busche and John Epler described taking the game back to its roots and going against the stream with some gaming trends.</p><p>"I felt very supported through this by BioWare and EA," Busche said (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chasing-live-service-and-open-world-elements-diluted-biowares-focus-dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says-discussing-studios-return-to-its-roots" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>). "And I'll tell you, it's intimidating to buck the trends in an era where it feels like almost every game must be an open world."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1669697952" data-promo-id="0"

from the studio.</p><p>"You know, I personally love Mass Effect Andromeda but there was also, we had open-world that was a big thing in the industry at the time and that starts to dilute your focus," Epler said. "We had Anthem-live-service dilutes your focus. So for us, it was really understanding what it is that people come to the studio to do--they work here for a reason, they want to make big stories that allow you to be a big hero of your own creation, but also a focus on characters, a focus on that experience of living in a different world."</p><p>When the decision was called for the change, Epler said he looked at the things that made the studio what it was known for: storytelling and epic single-player RPGs.</p><p>"For The Veilguard we just wanted to get back to those things that made the studio what it was, that contributed to what I would call the Golden Age of BioWare, when there was hit after hit being turned out," he added. "The Veilguard was a very conscious return to that with a focus on characters, storytelling and being just this really bombastic single-player RPG."</p><p>For more info on BioWare's latest fantasy RPG, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard review-in-progress</a>.</p>
