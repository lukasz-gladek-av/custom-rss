                <p>Pokemon fans are known to be passionate, especially as Pokemania nears its 30th anniversary in 2026. Sometimes, fans are even willing to pay shockingly high prices for unofficial Pokemon items, including--of all things--a Flamin' Hot Cheeto that bears more than a little resemblance to Charizard. "Cheetozard" recently went up for auction, and the highest bid has already cleared four figures.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/culture/526839/cheeto-charizard-auction-pokemon-collectibles" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, this Charizard-shaped Cheeto is currently available to anyone with a large amount of expendable income <a href="https://goldin.co/item/cheetozard-pokemon-charizard-shaped-cheeto-370g3p?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiOTEzN2RlNjJiOWFiM2Y0ZmFjNzQxODkyYzFkZmI1ZWMiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjd9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Goldin auctions</a>. At press time, the highest bid is $2,100, and there are still eight more days before the auction comes to a close.</p><p>According to the auction description, Cheetozard was "discovered and preserved sometime between 2018-2022 by 1st &amp; Goal Collectibles." It comes with a custom-made Cheetozard card inside of a clear storage box. It's a very amusing novelty item, but probably not for everyone.</p><p>Next week, The Pokemon Company will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-presents-livestream-announced-for-february-27/1100-6529609/" data-ref-id="1100-6529609">be hosting a Pokemon Presents Livestream</a>, and fans have already speculated that the franchise's next Switch title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a>, will be featured. Meanwhile, Pokemon Go developer Niantic is reportedly in negotiations <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-in-talks-to-sell-games-division-to-saudi-arabias-savvy-for-3-5-billion-report/1100-6529586/" data-ref-id="1100-6529586">to sell its gaming division to Saudi Arabia's Scopely</a>. This weekend, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-gos-unova-tour-in-la-will-go-on-but-niantic-is-monitoring-wildfires/1100-6528751/" data-ref-id="1100-6528751">Pokemon Go Unova Tour - Los Angeles event</a> is being held in Pasadena, CA. Prior to the start of that event, The Pokemon Company and Niantic pledged a collective donation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-pokemon-company-and-niantic-pledge-1-million-for-los-angeles-fire-relief/1100-6529506/" data-ref-id="1100-6529506">$1 million for Los Angeles wildfire relief</a>.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I've long appreciated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/state-of-decay/" data-ref-id="5000-151353">State of Decay</a> as the exciting middle ground between an approachable zombie game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/days-gone/" data-ref-id="5000-455389">Days Gone</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-rising/" data-ref-id="5000-24405">Dead Rising</a>, and unforgiving survival sims like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dayz/" data-ref-id="5000-146913">DayZ</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-zomboid/" data-ref-id="5000-115308">Project Zomboid</a>. No series or game that I know of has found that same middle ground--<em>harsh</em>, but <em>digestible</em>. But maybe that's no longer true. While I impatiently await more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/state-of-decay-3/" data-ref-id="5000-516152">news for State of Decay 3</a> from Undead Labs and Xbox, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days/" data-ref-id="5000-578185">Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days</a> is giving me a similar experience with some welcome twists on the formula.</p><p dir="ltr">Into The Dead might be a name-brand undead devotees already know. Previous to now, it's been the name of a first-person auto-runner series on mobile. They're neat games, but they really aren't trying to do too much other than being a gritty, scary, first-person take on something like a Jetpack Joyride--a fun, albeit one-note, time-filler for bus rides or lunch breaks. Our Darkest Days is far from that and more in line with what a console or PC player might expect of a zombie game.</p><p dir="ltr">Presented in a 2.5D art style, Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days is essentially a side-scrolling State of Decay, and if that series isn't already unforgiving enough, it seems like Our Darkest Days also looked to This War of Mine for inspiration. I recently checked out a demo for the upcoming game on PC--<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239710/Into_the_Dead_Our_Darkest_Days/" rel="nofollow ">a demo you can now play yourself</a>, by the way--and the best thing I can say about it is that I was so impressed that I actually stopped playing at a point when I could've gone further, because I want to preserve as much of the experience as I can for when the game is out and my save data will carry over. But I saw enough to know this game is worth that deeper look.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448326"></a><figcaption>Stealth is key because just a zombie or two could be your undoing.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Each game starts with you picking a pair of characters chosen as a duo. There's a white-haired high school coach and one of his student-athletes looking for his family, an unexpected couple--an animal rights activist and the rodeo man she once meant to protest--with an even more unexpected baby on the way, a therapist and her anger-managing patient, and more. This surely sounds a lot like State of Decay if you know that series. It, too, gives you a few groups of characters to choose as your starters, albeit a trio in that case.</p><p dir="ltr">The comparison goes beyond that. Like in Undead Labs' excellent series, each character has stats--in Our Darkest Days, they get two passive buffs and a debuff--for you to consider before starting a new game. Also like State of Decay, permadeath is an everpresent threat, and more than just a single zombie or two can spell certain doom for a novice player or a character who may be overtired, injured, or starving.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to keep your earliest characters alive, you'll need to manage your time and their wellbeing. For example, the day-night cycle dictates that you'll assign characters to tasks, then advance time to have them unfold. If you have a very tired character, you should send them to bed while the other may be called upon to head out into levels that seem to be procedurally generated to a degree, as loot drops and zombie density tend to vary. It only took me a few nights before both my characters weren't at their best. Darrel, the coach, was a lousy cook, but Leo was too tired to do the cooking himself, so I chose to send Leo to bed while Darrel went on a scavenging run at less than 100%. That was my first mistake.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448327"></a><figcaption>Set in the eighties in the U.S., the environments reject the drab look of The Walking Dead in favor of some style and flair.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In a level, the goal is to explore as much as you want within its horizontal limitations and then get home safely. You could spend a while filling your pockets to their maximum capacity, or you could ditch the deathtrap in a hurry after you've found that one particular healing, cooking, or crafting item you hoped to find. But whatever you choose to do with your time in the danger zone, it's much easier said than done, especially when your character isn't at their best. Weapons degrade quickly, and if you don't pull off a stealth kill, combat is loud enough to probably stir any other undead lingering nearby.</p><p dir="ltr">You can find other survivors in your travels too, though you don't necessarily have to help them. Like the games that clearly inspired this one, another unlucky survivor is another mouth to feed. Each stranded person becomes a cold cost-benefit analysis. Can you spare the resources needed to maintain another member of your community? Then again, having an extra pair of hands to cook, build, or stab a few squishy zombie skulls might be exactly what you need when folks back home are hanging by a thread as it is.</p><p dir="ltr">In the pre-alpha demo I played anyway, it seems that discovered (and explicitly invited) survivors make it back home even if you don't. I know this because, after Darrel found a new lost soul, Rahul, he later died before getting back to base himself. Though I didn't know Darrel long, I felt the effects of his death back at the base, as those who mourned him, Leo and Rahul, suffered a grief debuff for having experienced the loss. Things were only going to get harder in the days to come for my wounded stragglers in a land the dead had taken like a horrific coup of throat bites and flesh tears.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448328"></a><figcaption>Splitting the game into both home and away sections gives every decision weight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My initial reaction when I first saw Our Darkest Days was one of wishing it were more expansive, but after trying the demo, I've found there's a ton of hidden depth for me to explore in what is shaping up to be a familiar--and yet still fresh--zombie saga. Though I generally favor a 3D open-world setting to the more restrictive 2.5D perspective seen here, I also find that, in a world that is already expected to get State of Decay 3 <em>eventually</em>, this different take on many similar ideas is a welcome alternative in the meantime.</p><p dir="ltr">Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days feels like it may have all the pieces in place to be a strong emergent story generator, and in my zombie-obsessed opinion, that's the connective thread that brings all of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-zombie-games-of-all-time/2900-4873/">best zombie games </a>together. Whether it's State of Decay, DayZ, or even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/left-4-dead/" data-ref-id="5000-29417">Left 4 Dead</a>, the all-time greats tend to offer systems that give me the latitude to tell stories of despair or heroism, community or chaos.</p><p dir="ltr">The full game is due out later this year. As of now, only a PC launch has been confirmed, but I suspect that may change in the future.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 had an update that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-new-update-is-apparently-teasing-a-tony-hawks-pro-skater-reveal/1100-6529622/" data-ref-id="1100-6529622">teased the return of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>. In a skate park map called The Grind, there is a banner with the THPS logo and the date "03.04.25." Now, <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> has a countdown clock to March 4, 2025, which may mean an announcement is imminent.</p><p>The very first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game was released by Activision in September 1999. Although the 25th anniversary has come and gone, Hawk revealed last year that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-says-he-has-been-talking-to-activision-ahead-of-the-pro-skater-25th-anniversary/1100-6526442/" data-ref-id="1100-6526442">he has been in contact with Activision</a> about doing something to celebrate that quarter century milestone. Hawk later confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-pro-skater-series-will-continue-to-skate-on/1100-6526791/" data-ref-id="1100-6526791">the long-running franchise will continue</a>.</p><p>If there's news coming soon regarding the future of THPS, there are two likely options. The first is another remake like 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/1900-6417555/" data-ref-id="1900-6417555">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a>, which helped revitalize interest in the games. There have been some predictions that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 could follow. However, a more enticing prospect would be a brand-new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The last fully original game in the series to hit consoles was 2015's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5. Additionally, there was a previous report that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-to-launch-this-summer-report/1100-6529575/" data-ref-id="1100-6529575">the next Tony Hawk game could arrive as soon as this summer</a>. Given the timing of the announcement, that seems very plausible.</p><p>Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick recently stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-was-living-in-his-car-when-he-was-offered-300k-for-thps-former-activision-ceo-claims/1100-6529395/" data-ref-id="1100-6529395">Hawk was living in his car</a> when he made his deal for the first Pro Skater game. Hawk has obviously moved on to better accommodations since then, but we're eager to see where the video game series can go with the full power of the current gen consoles.</p>
