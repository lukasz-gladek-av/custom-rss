                <p dir="ltr">PlayStation has revealed this month's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. All PS Plus members will be able to claim several freebies starting June 3: <strong>NBA 2K25</strong>, <strong>Alone in the Dark</strong>, <strong>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</strong>, and <strong>Destiny 2: The Final Shape </strong>(the Destiny 2 expansion will be available starting May 28). If you haven't claimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-may-2025/1100-6531161/" data-ref-id="1100-6531161">May's PlayStation Plus free games</a> yet, make sure to do so before next Tuesday.</p><p dir="ltr">The next era of Destiny 2 kicks off in June, but in case you missed it last year, you can grab <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">The Final Shape</a> to experience the end of the Light and Darkness saga for yourself. The Final Shape was a thrilling adventure that wrapped up the first decade of Destiny, introduced the new Prismatic subclass, and dropped a ton of new weapons into the game's loot pool. You will need Destiny 2 to play it, but the base game is free-to-play.</p><p dir="ltr">Sports fans can shoot some hoops in NBA 2K25, but you might want to watch out for some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-2k-play-will-let-you-join-tournaments-for-real-money-from-your-couch/1100-6530099/" data-ref-id="1100-6530099">especially egregious microtransactions</a> in this year's edition. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k25-review-luxury-taxed/1900-6418281/" data-ref-id="1900-6418281">The core experience still looks and feels great</a>, but it is tarnished by various pay-to-win systems.</p><p dir="ltr">For something more nostalgic, check out Bomb Rush Cyberfunk. A spiritual successor to Jet Set Radio, the game has a 2000s-inspired vibe, a killer soundtrack, and cel-shaded visuals to make your trip across the city of New Amsterdam feel <em>extreme</em>.

In order to redeem the free Burnoff skin, all players have to do is log in to Fortnite on mobile, whether that's on Android or iPhone.</p><p>The new skin is a red and black motorbike outfit with flame motifs called Burnoff, which looks to be a reskin of the all-white Whiteout skin. To redeem the freebie, players will have to log in on Fortnite Mobile on either Android or iOS--though once the skin is acquired it can be used in all versions of Fortnite. The skin is available from now until June 17.</p><p>Despite Epic Games' recent win against Apple, which saw Fortnite reinstated on the App Store in the US by order of a California district court judge, the game still isn't available on iOS outside of the USA and the EU. It's unlikely that the legal drama between the two companies will end here, but for now fans can enjoy the spoils of Epic's victory.</p><p>Fortnite players can also grab the Iridia Vayne skin for free for a limited time, though that new skin requires <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-this-free-fortnite-skin-before-you-have-to-pay-for-it/1100-6531735/" data-ref-id="1100-6531735">a bit more work to earn</a> than just logging into the game.</p><p>Fortnite's current Star Wars season has just under two weeks left to go, with a dramatic live event scheduled to finish up the saga on Saturday June 7. While nothing has been officially announced yet, there are rumors that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-whats-next-after-star-wars-season-ends/1100-6531797/" data-ref-id="1100-6531797">next Fortnite season will be superhero themed</a>.</p>
