                <p>Out of the all the side quests you can embark on in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>, Forged of the Star-Stuff has the longest, but arguably most rewarding payoff. This quest begins whenever you find a Fragment of Starmetal and requires you to reach the final map of the game to complete it. The Fragments of Starmetal are difficult enough to find, but having to potentially wait dozens of hours to find out what the metal does can be agonizing.</p><p>Fortunately, the quest is worth the wait, as you can score yourself an incredible weapon in Avowed with the Starmetal. The question is, how do you find Fragments of Starmetal and complete the quest?</p><p><strong>Be aware this guide naturally contains some light spoilers.</strong></p><p>First and foremost, once you find a Fragment of Starmetal, the Forged of Star-Stuff quest is automatically triggered in Avowed. You can view the quest in your journal but the game offers nothing in the way of an explanation for what to do with the metal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445586-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-23.28.41.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445586" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445586-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-23.28.41.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445586"></a><figcaption>One of the Fragment of Starmetal pieces</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445586-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-23.28.41.73.png"></figure><p>You can find a Fragment of Starmetal as early as Dawnshore, but unfortunately, you have to go through every single map in the game until you can use it. If you speak to certain vendors across the three maps of Dawnshore, Emerald Stair, and Shatterscarp, you can ask about the Starmetal. Specifically, asking blacksmiths about the metal will yield the most answers.</p><p>Regardless of who you speak to about the Starmetal, though, you'll get told the same thing: The Starmetal can only be worked by a smith in Solace Keep. Solace Keep is the main hub city in the final map of Avowed, called Galawain's Tusks. You can only reach this map by progressing through Avowed's main story. So, if you happen to find the Fragment of Starmetal in Dawnshore, you'll have to go through the events of Dawnshore, Emerald Stair, and Shatterscarp before you're finally able to do something with the item.</p><h2 id="How_to_get_into_Solace_Keep_and_complete_Forged_of_Star_Stuff">How to get into Solace Keep and complete Forged of Star-Stuff</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445585-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.13.42.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445585" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445585-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.13.42.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445585"></a><figcaption>Talking to Forgemaster Dela in Solace Keep</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445585-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.13.42.06.png"></figure><p>When you finally reach Galawain's Tusks, you need to travel all the way north to Solace Keep. Solace Keep is extremely well-guarded and doesn't let outsiders in, however, so you have to speak to the guards at the drawbridge before entering the city.</p><p>You are able to persuade the guard to let you in through a few methods. I was able to tell him I got the clear water running by completing an earlier side quest in Galawain's Tusks, but you can also use persuasion checks and certain background dialogue to convince the guard to let you through.</p><p>Once inside Solace Keep, head straight through the mess hall until you reach a pathway that leads downstairs. This goes into the forge, where Foregmaster Dela is standing in front of a statue. Talk to Dela and show him the Starmetal you have in your inventory. He'll start to clamor over the metal and offer to make you a unique weapon from it. You have the choice between a Starmetal Sword or an Arquebus.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445584-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.15.15.66.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445584" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445584-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.15.15.66.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445584"></a><figcaption>The unique Moonstrike arquebus weapon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445584-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.15.15.66.png"></figure><p>The unique sword is called Meteor Blade while the unique arquebus is called Moonstrike. Both are fantastic weapons, but the Moonstrike is a little bit better and more useful, in my opinion. However, if you find more Fragments of Starmetal, you can bring them back to Dela and he will make you more weapons with them, allowing you to possess several unique Starmetal weapons. You can also bring more Starmetal to Dela so he can upgrade your existing weapon.</p><p>Forged of Star-Stuff doesn't end until you find the location of every Fragment of Starmetal in Avowed, but once you have one weapon, the quest is essentially completed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445583-avowedscreenshot2025.02.12-01.36.39.17.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445583" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445583-avowedscreenshot2025.02.12-01.36.39.17.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445583"></a><figcaption>One of the Fragment of Starmetal pieces</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445583-avowedscreenshot2025.02.12-01.36.39.17.png"></figure><p>So far, we know of four different Fragment of Starmetal locations, but there are certainly more on the map that have yet to be discovered. Here are the four locations we know of:</p><ul><li><strong>Galawain's Tusks</strong>: Right beside the Ash Forest in a meteor pit where the Revenant bounty is located (northwest of Solace Keep)</li><li><strong>Dawnshore</strong>: At the Godless Altar directly south of the gate to Emerald Stair on the eastern side of the map</li><li><strong>Shatterscarp</strong>: In the Abandoned Mines directly across from Ruanga's house (seen during the One Last Drink side quest)</li><li><strong>Emerald Stair</strong>: Right underneath the Damp Burrow text in the northern part of Emerald Stair on a rock (to the east of the Abandoned Farms and Rolling Crags)</li></ul><p>We'll update this guide with more fragment locations if they are discovered. All you really need is one to complete the Forged of Star-Stuff quest in Avowed, but like we said, a few more overpowered weapons surely don't hurt, right? Well, they don't hurt <em>you</em>, anyway.</p><p>Obsidian is no stranger to crafting compelling RPGs.

Sanza is missing one last cartographer somewhere in the fiery region and it's your job to find out where they are. Unlike the other cartographers in Mapping the Living Lands, however, the one in Galawain's Tusks is alive and well, and you have a decision to make regarding their fate.</p><p>To see where the Galawain's Tusks cartographer is located in Avowed and how to finally complete Mapping the Living Lands, keep reading the guide below.</p><h2>Galawain's Tusks Cartographer location in Avowed</h2><p>Unfortunately, the cartographer in Galawain's Tusks is just about as far as possible from the starting position in the region. You have to travel all the way north to Solace Keep and then find a jail tower where the cartographer is being held prisoner. This jail tower is called "Soreena's Mercy" and it's located to the northwest of Solace Keep.</p><p>You don't have to enter Solace Keep or complete any additional story missions in Avowed to reach the cartographer. You don't even have to actively track the new Mapping the Living Lands quest.

At the very end of the prison cells, you'll see an NPC standing outside of one of the cells. There's a person inside named Renato, who you can speak to through the cell.</p><p>Renato is Sanza's missing cartographer, and he was arrested by the Wardens at Solace Keep for stealing supplies so he could stay alive to complete his mission for Sanza. As you continue speaking with him, you'll be able to make a choice regarding his fate. You can either convince the Warden to release Renato, which isn't too difficult, or you can say you're going to take his map and leave him to rot in the cell for his crimes. The alternative is to fight the Warden and free Renato yourself, but that's mostly unnecessary unless you're playing a more aggressive character.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445558-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.05.32.60.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445558" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445558-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.05.32.60.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445558"></a><figcaption>Choosing to free Renato or leave him in the cell. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445558-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.05.32.60.png"></figure><p>If you choose to free Renato, he will end up giving you his cartography map anyway. If you take his map and make him stay in the cell, the outcome is the same, as you can take the map back to Sanza in Paradis to complete the Mapping the Living Lands quest.

The mid-season update will also add The Thing and Human Torch, along with a new map and balance update.</p><p dir="ltr">Shared in the <a href="https://youtu.be/FMPCzylKgc8?si=jxolri2w_qBGMha6&amp;t=189" rel="nofollow ">Marvel Rivals Dev Vision</a>, leftover Chrono Tokens, the battle-pass currency, will be exchanged for Units, an in-game currency used to buy cosmetics from the store, like hero skins. While the exact ratio wasn't revealed in the video, this exchange will be available to players who have purchased the premium version of the battle pass and redeemed all of the rewards in the battle pass. If you meet those two requirements by the end of the season, whatever tokens you have left will be exchanged at whatever the ratio is. It wasn't stated if the ratio will be revealed along with the patch notes for the mid-season update, or if it will be revealed towards the end of Season 1.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPCzylKgc8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FMPCzylKgc8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Chrono Tokens are earned exclusively from challenges--daily, season, or event--so players cannot earn them endlessly. However, in Season 0 there were certainly far more tokens that could be earned than needed to unlock every item in the battle pass, and the Season 1 battle pass is tracking to be similar. Marvel Rivals battle passes don't expire, so this exchange offers a reward for players who finish a battle pass within the same season it's released.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals Season 1 mid-season update drops on Friday, February 21, bringing a new Duelist and Vanguard to the roster, along with a new map and balance updates, like some much needed nerfs for certain Strategist ultimates.</p>

                <p>The arrival of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> at some point later this year remains one of the biggest stories in gaming. It's not a question of whether it will be one of the biggest releases of 2025; it's about how big it can be at launch and in the years to come. Now, a new report suggests that Rockstar Games is going to expand GTA 6 even further by turning the game into a platform for user-generated content.</p><p>According to <a href="https://digiday.com/media/rockstar-games-talks-with-top-metaverse-creators-with-an-eye-on-making-grand-theft-auto-the-next-creator-platform/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digiday</a>, Rockstar is in talks with experienced Roblox and Fortnite creators in addition to GTA mod creators about creating customized experiences in Grand Theft Auto 6. It's not that far of a conceptual leap, since there are already numerous <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> mods, and because Rockstar purchased FiveM, which lets players take part in modified versions of the game with hundreds of other users.</p><p>The belief among some industry insiders is that Rockstar will follow the example of Fortnite and allow users to create customized locations and items that could be purchased by other players or accessed via subscriptions. Any money earned from these creations would likely include a sizable share for Rockstar itself, while also giving modders the chance to make money as well.</p><p>"It is my firm belief that is the reason that they purchased FiveM is exactly that--to spin up a metaversal universe of custom-built experiences, and potentially UGC items, with an attached UGC creator economy," said WPP agency Wavemaker's global and esports lead Pete Basgen in the Digiday report. "It will essentially occupy that adult-enumerated space at the top of the ecosystem; there's a very natural place there for people that graduate from Roblox and Minecraft."</p><p>While GTA 6 user-created content could be extremely lucrative, GTA Online players have been concerned that the game will be discontinued after Grand Theft Auto 6 launches. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick recently hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-suggests-that-current-gta-online-could-continue-after-gta-6-releases/1100-6529517/" data-ref-id="1100-6529517">GTA Online could continue to exist</a> alongside GTA 6, but he declined to outright confirm that. Zelnick also noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/" data-ref-id="1100-6529346">a PC port for GTA 6 won't be released at launch</a>. The game itself still doesn't have a firm release window, but since Take-Two has set <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-announced-coming-in-september/1100-6529459/" data-ref-id="1100-6529459">Borderlands 4</a> for a late September release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-might-be-coming-into-focus/1100-6529480/" data-ref-id="1100-6529480">the drop date for GTA 6 may be coming into focus</a>.</p>

Currently scheduled to be released on PC in Summer 2025, the game pits humans against Martians in a battle for supremacy over our corner of the cosmos.</p><p>Like Nintendo's Advance Wars games, you'll get to pick from several commanders to lead Earth's military forces, with each battlefield leader having unique abilities that you can make tactical use of.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445810-ss_01539425e2e7e094af34efeb79242c4c404faba3.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445810" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445810-ss_01539425e2e7e094af34efeb79242c4c404faba3.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445810"></a><figcaption>Earth vs. Mars</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445810-ss_01539425e2e7e094af34efeb79242c4c404faba3.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445811-ss_2b4190c8e5bd865324d1508f90ed4ffff20d6853.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445812-ss_93d7927f2cbbb6d4e7178b4af8d535dba2f2432f.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445813-ss_98516de2fe2d223a89cb76be00aaaa84259cd6c6.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445814-ss_e0fa73eb13957db32e41b1ab3de28a2690501be4.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445815-ss_fec0af8affd7c44f830c08a25b0f36053eee8fe3.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445811,1300-4445812,1300-4445813,1300-4445814,1300-4445815" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4445811-ss_2b4190c8e5bd865324d1508f90ed4ffff20d6853.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4445812-ss_93d7927f2cbbb6d4e7178b4af8d535dba2f2432f.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4445813-ss_98516de2fe2d223a89cb76be00aaaa84259cd6c6.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4445814-ss_e0fa73eb13957db32e41b1ab3de28a2690501be4.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4445815-ss_fec0af8affd7c44f830c08a25b0f36053eee8fe3.1920x1080.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445811-ss_2b4190c8e5bd865324d1508f90ed4ffff20d6853.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445812-ss_93d7927f2cbbb6d4e7178b4af8d535dba2f2432f.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445813-ss_98516de2fe2d223a89cb76be00aaaa84259cd6c6.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445814-ss_e0fa73eb13957db32e41b1ab3de28a2690501be4.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445815-ss_fec0af8affd7c44f830c08a25b0f36053eee8fe3.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>While you'll have access to military hardware like tanks and artillery, the real secret weapon here is the Splice-O-Tron that can be used to transform "volunteers" into powerful super-soldiers when you add some animal DNA to the mix.

                <p>It's been over 5 years since Rare's in-development project <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everwild-everything-we-know/1100-6503918/" data-ref-id="1100-6503918">Everwild</a> was announced by Xbox, and details have been thin on the ground ever since. In a recent interview, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said that Everwild is proceeding well.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/16/xboxera-podcast-episode-250/#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a>, Spencer mentioned a few games in passing that he's excited for. Everwild was one of those games, with Spencer confirming that Rare is making "progress" on the project. "I do think the work that Double Fine's doing and how [Double Fine founder Tim Schafer] kind of solicits feedback from the team," Spencer said in part. "And the other one, I'll say because I was recently out at Rare. It’s nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they're making."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Spencer also mentioned State of Decay 3 as part of the same section, with the Xbox boss calling the series "one that I love." Later in the interview, Spencer said that studios like Rare are allowed more time to make long-in-the-oven games like Everwild because Xbox's current slate is already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-has-more-games-slated-for-ps5-this-year-than-sony-so-far/1100-6529489/" data-ref-id="1100-6529489">packed with games</a>. He also indicated that the next studio he's going to visit is The Coalition, the stewards of the Gears of War franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Everwild is one of those "missing games" that it's easy to forget about, given that it was first announced in 2019, even before the start of the current console generation. A 2022 report suggests that the project was internally rebooted following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everwild-boss-resigns-from-rare-marking-another-high-profile-xbox-departure/1100-6483926/" data-ref-id="1100-6483926">the departure</a> of the game's creative director Simon Woodroffe back in 2020. Everwild's current director is Gregg Mayles, a Rare veteran who worked on games like Sea of Thieves, Viva Pinata, and Banjo-Kazooie. We still have no word on a potential release date for Everwild.</p>
