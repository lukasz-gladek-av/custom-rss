                <p>If you've decided to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> on PC, then you'll have access to a couple of menus in the settings that console players won't have. From the first time you launch the game, you can find and alter the keybinds and mouse settings menus, which, of course, both have a massive impact on your gameplay.</p><p>While you could leave the default options as they are and not customize any of the settings, that might put you at a disadvantage against other PC players with dialed-in settings. To ensure you're using the best keybinds and mouse settings in Arc Raiders, take a look at the guide below, which is just one of several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-tips-15-things-to-know-before-you-play/1100-6535635/" data-ref-id="1100-6535635">Arc Raiders tips</a> we recommend.</p><h2>Best keybinds in Arc Raiders</h2><p>Let's start with the keybinds, as this is one of the first menus you'll see after heading into the settings (it's labeled "Controls"). Unlike some other extraction games or multiplayer shooters, Arc Raiders keeps things fairly straightforward when it comes to your keybinds. There are only a few crucial keybinds that you'll want to change, but these can play a huge role in whether you live or die during a gunfight with an enemy.</p><p>Below, you can see all of the keybinds and our recommended settings for each one in Arc Raiders:</p><ul><li><strong>Move Forward</strong>: W</li><li><strong>Move Backward</strong>: S</li><li><strong>Move Left</strong>: A</li><li><strong>Move Right</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Fire / Throw / Display</strong>: Left Mouse Button</li><li><strong>Aim</strong>: Right Mouse Button</li><li><strong>Jump</strong>: Space Bar</li><li><strong>Sprint (Hold)</strong>: Left Shift</li><li><strong>Crouch (Hold)</strong>: Left Ctrl or C</li><li><strong>Crouch (Toggle)</strong>: Left Ctrl or C</li><li><strong>Dodge Roll</strong>: Mouse Button 4/5 or Left Alt if you have no mouse buttons</li><li><strong>Walk (Toggle)</strong>: V</li><li><strong>Interact</strong>: E or F (depending on preference)</li><li><strong>Reload Weapon</strong>: R</li><li><strong>Shoulder Swap</strong>: X</li><li><strong>Weapon 1</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>Weapon 2</strong>: 2</li><li><strong>Melee Weapon</strong>: 3</li><li><strong>Unarmed/Holster Weapon</strong>: 4</li><li><strong>Next Weapon</strong>: Mouse Wheel Up</li><li><strong>Previous Weapon</strong>: Mouse Wheel Down</li><li><strong>Items</strong>: Q</li><li><strong>Flashlight</strong>: E or F (depending on your Interact keybind)</li><li><strong>Access Inventory</strong>: Tab</li><li><strong>Map</strong>: M or Caps Lock</li><li><strong>Ping</strong>: Middle Mouse Button</li><li><strong>Emote</strong>: G</li><li><strong>Push to Talk</strong>: T</li><li><strong>Push to Talk (Proximity Chat)</strong>: B</li><li><strong>Ping Heard By/Emote Loudness</strong>: H</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594104-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.32.43.99.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594104" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594104-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.32.43.99.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594104"></a><figcaption>The keybinds menu in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594104-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.32.43.99.png"></figure><p>We didn't alter too many of the default keybinds in Arc Raiders, but we did offer you some choices with a few of those we did change. For example, the dodge roll mechanic works great if you have a mouse button on the side of your mouse, but Left Alt also works perfectly well. We also swapped the "unarmed" keybind to "4," as that's easier to remember given that you can bring out your other weapons with the previous three number keybinds.</p><h2>Best mouse settings in Arc Raiders</h2><p>Now, let's cover your mouse settings in Arc Raiders, which boil down to your sensitivity options. If you want to customize your mouse and sensitivity further, you should head into whatever mouse software you have installed on your PC. This allows you to fine-tune your DPI, disable mouse smoothing/acceleration, and set up hotkeys if you wish.</p><p>Below, you can see our recommended mouse settings in Arc Raiders:</p><ul><li><strong>Invert Vertical Look Input</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>Horizontal Sensitivity</strong>: 65-70</li><li><strong>Vertical Sensitivity</strong>: 50</li><li><strong>Zoom Sensitivity Multiplier</strong>: 75%</li><li><strong>Scoped Zoom Sensitivity Multiplier</strong>: 85%</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594103-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.36.29.43.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594103" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594103-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.36.29.43.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594103"></a><figcaption>The mouse settings in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594103-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.36.29.43.png"></figure><p>We decided to scale the horizontal sensitivity up by 15-20 from the default value. Having a higher horizontal sensitivity allows you to spin around faster if you're being shot by an enemy behind you, or maybe to catch the spider hurdling at you before your quick and sudden death.</p><p>Moving on, the Zoom Sensitivity Multiplier has been reduced by 25% to allow for more precise aiming, while the Scoped Zoom Sensitivity Multiplier has also been reduced, but not as drastically. You still want to be able to move relatively quickly while using a large scope, but you also don't want your sensitivity too fast so that you skip right over a target when aiming down sights.</p><p>Of course, these sensitivity values will likely need to be changed depending on your mouse's core DPI. You'll want to make sure you dial that in before trying to mess around with the mouse settings in Arc Raiders. If you already have your mouse DPI in a good spot, then try to use our sensitivity values as a baseline and work your way up or down from there.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> is in its self-care era. At least, that was the major takeaway from a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2s-latest-update-had-too-many-issues-developer-admits/1100-6535407/">frank Q&amp;A</a> with the game's director Mikael Eriksson, where he discusses, among other things, a new schedule for patches that the team hopes will lighten Helldivers 2's technical debt.</p><p dir="ltr">The critically acclaimed live-service shooter, which tasks players with grouping up and tackling hordes of alien foes in overwhelmingly hostile environments, has fallen on especially hard times lately. Frequent updates to the game since its launch in February of 2024--including fixes, balancing patches, and content drops--has caused Helldivers 2 to suffer from balance and performance issues and settle into an unsteady ebb and flow.</p><p dir="ltr">This instability has only hurt the game's diehard playerbase, who have spent months now fighting against crashes, increasingly untenable performance issues, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-explains-why-the-game-takes-up-so-much-space-on-pc/1100-6535217/">growing file sizes</a> (at least, on PC) and more wonkiness than is generally acceptable of Helldivers 2's sometimes slapstick action.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, Arrowhead Studios, the developer working on Helldivers 2, recently announced that it would be pumping the brakes on content updates and the game's planned roadmap for a while. The goal of the temporary hiatus is to give the team the ability to diagnose and work on Helldivers 2's multiple issues, which stem from the game's hazardous live environment, its developers nonstop cadence of content drops, and years of technical debt adding up.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAzmBlEFhYw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dAzmBlEFhYw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">To that end, Eriksson revealed that Arrowhead's plan moving forward is to deploy patches every two weeks for the next few months in order to reduce the number of critical bugs impeding players' ability to enjoy Helldivers 2. In the latest Q&amp;A, Eriksson cited the game's most recent patch as an example of what it intends, claiming that it fixed about 200 of Helldivers 2's bugs. Arrowhead hopes to keep hitting these patches before resuming with Helldivers 2's content roadmap around December.</p><p dir="ltr">Elsewhere, Eriksson was also probed about the game's tremendous file size on PC, where it sits above 140 GB. He claims that the team is aware of how "unacceptably large" this is and that the issue stems from the team optimizing for hardware that uses mechanical HDDs, mentioning that they introduce hurdles that the team overcomes by duplicating files.</p><p dir="ltr">Per Eriksson's comments, Arrowhead is working on ways to cut down the file size, including potentially finding ways to push updates to PCs that use one of these drives over the other, but it is currently still looking for the best possible answer to this problem.</p><p dir="ltr">The rest of the interview dives into more of Helldivers 2's issues including the potential causes of crashes, whether the game's anit-cheat could be responsible for bricking PCs, and justification for the studio's usage of the Stingray engine. It's a meaty and honest interview, even if Eriksson does sidestep some of the game's more pressing problems, like weapon balance.</p>

Not only can the game's dangerous enemies put an end to you quickly, but groups of other raiders can be roaming the wasteland, ready to take you down and steal all of your loot. Having a good team can help ensure that you extract safely. But what if your friends don't play on the same hardware as you? Let's take a look at whether ARC Raiders offers cross-play and cross-progression.</p><h2>Does Arc Raiders have cross-play?</h2><p>If you're looking to play with friends on other platforms, you're in luck. <strong>Arc Raiders offers cross-play with every platform</strong>, allowing you to team up with your pals even when they're in a different ecosystem. To play together, simply add your friend's Embark ID in the Friends menu by selecting Add Friend. This ID will include four unique numbers at the end, so be sure to include those, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4593137-arcraiders_16-9_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593137" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4593137-arcraiders_16-9_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593137"></a><figcaption>You can brave the conditions together using Arc Raiders cross-play.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4593137-arcraiders_16-9_04.jpg"></figure><p>Cross-play is enabled by default, meaning you won't need to turn on any additional settings when you're ready to team up. To disable crossplay, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Gameplay &gt; Cross-play</strong> and toggle it off. This will ensure you only play with players that are within your ecosystem. As such, you'll need to turn this back on again if you decide to play with friends on another platform.</p><p>Once you're ready to go on with your pals by your side, don't forget to take our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-tips-15-things-to-know-before-you-play/1100-6535635/" data-ref-id="1100-6535635">Arc Raiders tips</a>, too.</p><h2>Does Arc Raiders have cross-progression?</h2><p>There's more good news for those setting out into a post-apocalyptic Earth: <strong>ARC Raiders has full cross-progression support</strong>. This means that you can carry your progress across every platform. If you start on PS5, for instance, you'll be able to use the same save on PC or Xbox so long as you're signed into the same <a href="https://careers.embark-studios.com/connect/login" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Embark account</a>.</p><p>However, it's important to note that playing across different platforms will require you to purchase the game multiple times. If you've bought the game on PS5 and want to play on PC or Xbox, be prepared to dish out an additional $40 to transfer that save over. Luckily, you can swap between these platforms at any time with no issues, so you'll never have to worry about losing your progress.</p>
