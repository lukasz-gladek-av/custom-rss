                <p>Ubisoft's Far Cry multiplayer extraction shooter game has reportedly been rebooted as the game--once intended as part of Far Cry 7--has had developers shifted over to the latter game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Ubisoft moved developers from working on the multiplayer game, called Project Maverick, over to Project Blackbird, which is Far Cry 7. This was reportedly done in December in order to make sure the development of Blackbird stayed on track.</p><p>The decision to reboot Maverick remains unclear, but it was reportedly due to Ubisoft's recent initiative to streamline development <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-and-tencent-could-create-a-new-venture-as-part-of-major-change/1100-6528824/" data-ref-id="1100-6528824">as it deals with its financial issues</a>. Ubisoft Montreal, the studio leading Maverick and Blackbird, will reportedly take the former back to Ubisoft Sherbrooke for more prototyping.</p><p>Another branch, Ubisoft Berlin, was also reportedly helping out with Maverick, but has seen more of its developers moved over to Blackbird as well as a different project.</p><p>It's unclear when Maverick will be ready for launch. However, some developers reportedly feel confident that Blackbird could still launch in 2026. Playtesting for Blackbird has reportedly already begun, and the feedback was positive, with testers reportedly saying that the game "played great" and apparently changed the traditional Far Cry formula in some ways, including its movement mechanics.</p><p>Maverick was reportedly set in Alaska, at least initially, with players having to survive against harsh weather, wild animals, soldiers, and other players.</p><p>Ubisoft is going through a tumultuous time as it has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">closing studios and conducting multiple rounds of layoffs</a>. Ubisoft is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/1100-6529497/" data-ref-id="1100-6529497">doubling down on open-world and live-service games</a>, and it sounds like Blackbird and Maverick both fit these templates.</p>

The Springtime Celebration--which is live now on all platforms--allows players to join Kitty White (and her friends) to collect sakura petals, which can be found all over the island.</p><p dir="ltr">But with winter's chill still in the air, the game has also dropped a new content update for Apple Arcade players: Update 2.4: Snow &amp; Sound.

Tuxedosam's Shop and My Melody's Gift Shop will also be stocked up with unique Spring-themed clothing and furniture for players to peruse and purchase.</p><p dir="ltr">Update 2.4: Snow &amp; Sound is now live on Apple Arcade, but developer Sunblink Entertainment says the update will be "coming soon" to players on Nintendo Switch and PC. Players who have access to the Snow &amp; Sound update will notice something new atop Icy Peak: houses! Players can work to repair Snow Village, building warm little cabins and discovering new collectible critters, fish, and furniture.</p><p dir="ltr">The Snow &amp; Sound update is also introducing some changes to City Town, including new quests from Usahana, the ability to open a music store, and opportunities for players to increase their friendship with Usahana, adding more light and color to City Town. Players can also decorate the cabins they build, which will provide them with a chance to meet new friends like Ganta, Kyorosuke, Noberun, and Washimi.</p><p dir="ltr">Sunblink has not yet announced an official Snow &amp; Sound release date for players on PC and console.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Today marks the 25th anniversary of PS2, the best-selling video game console of all time. Sony released the home system in Japan on March 4, 2000, and one Redditor flew over to Tokyo at that time to buy one.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1j395wt/25_years_ago_i_flew_to_japan_to_buy_a_playstation/" rel="nofollow ">On Reddit</a>, user YomReddit shared a post with four pictures showing his adventure to Akihabara in 2000 to pick up a PS2 at launch. The Redditor added that they waited 26 hours in line outside a Tokyo store to grab the Sony system. Previously, YomReddit celebrated the console's 20-year anniversary in a similar manner <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fd96pg/on_this_day_20_years_ago_i_queued_for_26_hours_in/" rel="nofollow ">on Reddit</a>. In the comments, the Redditor noted they were from England and played Japanese games since the PS2 was region-locked.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS2 was originally unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show in September 1999, according to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/playstation-history/2000-ps2-psp/">the PlayStation website</a>. A couple of the first games showcased for the system included Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec (though it wasn't named this at the time) and Eternal Ring, developed by Elden Ring studio From Software.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS2 didn't launch in North America until October 26, 2000, while the European release was even later on November 24, 2000. Worldwide launches were not common for consoles or games at that time. Ultimately, over 160 million PS2 systems were sold globally, a record that still stands today. Nintendo DS ended its lifecycle with more than 154 million units sold, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-nintendo-platforms-of-all-time-and-how-many-units-they-sold/2900-5124/" data-ref-id="2900-5124">Switch sits at 150 million consoles sold</a>, so Nintendo's hybrid system still has a chance to topple the PS2.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-30th-anniversary-kicks-off-with-nostalgic-ps5-themes-and-the-cranberries/1100-6528157/" data-ref-id="1100-6528157">Sony has also been celebrating PlayStation's 30th anniversary</a> recently. For instance, PS5 users got a PS2 theme along with other PlayStation menu looks for a limited time. The original PlayStation launched in Japan on December 3, 1994, with the North American release happening on September 9, 1995.</p>
