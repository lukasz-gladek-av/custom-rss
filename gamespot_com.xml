                <p>The PlayStation 5 dominated Black Friday sales in the US, according to new data shared by Circana, which tracks gaming sales in the US.</p><p>Circana's Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7du6uaaec2p" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> Sony's console made up 47% of total Black Friday week hardware unit sales, outpacing the Switch 2 (24%) and Nex Playground (14%). He didn't share any data about how Xbox performed.</p><p>"So, yeah, Black Friday week is extremely promotional for video games. Stuff that does not price promote (generally speaking, here) does not see much of a seasonal lift at all from the prior week (usually none). BF Week performance can correlate closely to what's being promoted and by how much," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7gjdbqz7s2b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piscatella said</a>.</p><p>He <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7gjfbjdb22b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">added</a>: "On the hardware side, PS5 saw the most extensive discounting. So, it got a big sales lift. Wouldn't take much more away from the week than that, tbh."</p><p>Indeed, the PS5 was discounted substantially for Black Friday, with Sony selling the consoles for about $100 off. Retailers offered discounts on Xbox consoles and the Nex Playground as well. For anyone unaware, the Nex Playground is an AI-powered console similar to Kinect, featuring a camera to track bodies for interacting with games. The Nex Playground <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-probably-wont-guess-what-just-outsold-every-ps5-and-xbox-console-model-in-the-us/1100-6536701/" data-ref-id="1100-6536701">outsold every PS5 and Xbox model</a> the previous week in the US.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thegamebusiness.com/post/3m7cl2uibp227" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In the UK</a>, the PS5 dominated as well, making up 62% of all console sales. By comparison, Switch 2 made up 23% of sales, with Xbox following with 10%. The PS5 Pro in particular was a big hit in the UK for Black Friday, recording its best week for sales since launch in November 2024.</p>

                <p>Microsoft originally rejected a pitch to bring Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to PlayStation consoles, but the company eventually agreed, and this led to a "whole avalanche" of Xbox games on PlayStation. That's according to Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann.</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XDA-Developers</a> that it was his own idea to bring Flight Simulator to PlayStation consoles, culminating with the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 today, December 8, on PS4 and PS5.</p><p>The 2020 Flight Simulator game eventually grew to become 300 GB in size, and there was so much content planned that Neumann said the game could grow to become 1 TB. So instead of doing that, the team made a new game, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and the game now only has 8 GB of space for a requirement, with everything else sent to the cloud. This way of packaging the game allowed the game to come to other platforms, Neumann said.</p><p>"So I proposed, probably two and a half years ago, to go to PlayStation," he said. "It was probably a little bit before its time because I was told no. Then, somebody from Sony who grew up with flight simulation thought it would be a great addition to the Sony portfolio. They reached out proactively to our president, who then came back to me and said, 'Hey, remember when we talked about the PlayStation thing a year ago? Sony is also interested.'"</p><p>It was this very conversation that Neumann believes "kicked off a whole avalanche of Xbox titles coming to PlayStation," even if Flight Simulator wouldn't end up being the first.</p><p>Microsoft started bringing more of its games to PlayStation (and Switch in some cases) earlier in 2025, including Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 5. Microsoft also brought Doom: The Dark Ages to PS5 this year, along with The Outer Worlds 2.</p><p>Looking to 2026, Microsoft will release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/" data-ref-id="1100-6535992">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> on PS5, representing the Halo franchise's debut on a rival console platform. It will launch day-and-date with the Xbox edition of the game next year.</p><p>For its part, Microsoft has said it decided to bring Xbox games to PlayStation and Switch because it wanted to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/02/21/new-platforms-new-players-xbox-games-switch-playstation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">meet players where they are</a>. The PS5 has sold considerably more units than the Xbox Series X|S, so bringing Xbox games to that platform is a boon for Microsoft's business.</p><p>Microsoft CFO Amy Hood has reportedly mandated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">Xbox make more money</a>, which may help explain the push for more multiplatform releases, along with the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">Game Pass price increases</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">Xbox console price increases</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">layoffs, studio closures</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-doom-devs-confirm-romero-games-is-not-closed-despite-game-cancelation/1100-6533006/" data-ref-id="1100-6533006">publishing deal cancellations of late</a>.</p>
