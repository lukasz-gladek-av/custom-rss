While there won't be any new announcements, attendees will be able to check out and grab limited edition prints, Phantasy Arcade Cabinets, God of War-themed donuts from Moonbridge, and a Kratos beach towel.</p><p>Sony Santa Monica has been silent on what it's been working on since it launched God of War Ragnarok in 2022. However, the studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-developer-sony-santa-monica-is-reportedly-working-on-a-new-ip/1100-6525531/" data-ref-id="1100-6525531">reportedly working on its first new IP</a> since the debut of God of War back in 2005.</p><p>There are rumors that the games in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-god-of-war-remasters-for-ps5-could-be-revealed-in-march/1100-6529692/" data-ref-id="1100-6529692">original God of War trilogy</a> are being remastered and that the reveal would occur around the franchise's anniversary, but Sony has now confirmed that there won't be any planned announcements during the exhibition. However, it's possible that there could be announcements outside of the event.</p><p>Bluepoint Games, the studio behind the Demon's Souls remake, was also reportedly working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">God of War live-service game that was ultimately canceled</a>.</p>

The set can be displayed flat or at a drifting angle with the included, buildable display stand.</p><p dir="ltr">Like other Nintendo display models, Mario &amp; Standard Kart comes with a physical instruction booklet and support for an interactive guide in the Lego Builder app on iOS and Android.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Xbox representatives have suggested that the console brand is due for a shake-up in recent months, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer stating that the next Xbox should be "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-should-be-more-innovative-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529067/">more innovative</a>." A new report claims that the next console from Xbox might not be a traditional console at all, and that it might be targeting a 2027 launch rather than 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">On a recent episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAOt7CKUEFY">Xbox Two podcast</a>, reporter Jez Corden said that Microsoft's plans for the new Xbox are more akin to a gaming PC. He describes the machine as a "PC in essence, but with a TV-friendly shell that also has a specific set of specs in mind." He further suggested that similar to existing consoles, developers will know what these specs are, so they'll be able to optimize their games accordingly.</p><p dir="ltr">Corden also poured cold water onto the rumors that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2026-could-drop-last-gen-systems-and-make-other-big-changes-report/1100-6529841/" data-ref-id="1100-6529841">Call of Duty 2026 is being developed</a> with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-rumored-to-launch-in-2026-with-new-call-of-duty/1100-6528636/" data-ref-id="1100-6528636">next-gen Xbox in mind</a>, stating that he's heard that the new hardware is targeting a 2027 release, not next year. "The devkit talk is more about what kind of specs they've been told to target for the next Xbox," he said. "I'm pretty sure the new hardware is not 2026, it's 2027."</p><p dir="ltr">As always, these rumors should be taken with a grain of salt. It's unclear if this hypothetical PC-like Xbox would feature the more extensive non-gaming functionality that you get with a PC, such as work apps, productivity software, and more. However, this is far from the first inkling that Xbox is considering a drastic change with its next console. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfdz5alCu8g">a recent interview</a>, former Xbox executive Peter Moore went so far as to suggest that the console war is essentially over, and if given the choice, Microsoft would stop making hardware entirely.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty: Warzone launched five years ago this month, and to celebrate the anniversary, Activision is going back to where it all began. On April 3, Warzone will bring back the OG map: Verdansk.</p><p>Ahead of this, Activision released a nostalgia-themed trailer set to "Unforgettable" by Nat King Cole. The CG trailer calls back to Warzone's earliest days, showing off some of the locations that are set to return. It ends with a soldier looking directly into the camera, with a tear streaming down his face as he smiles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX2LeqDlkBg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OX2LeqDlkBg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Warzone follows in the footsteps of other popular battle royale games Fortnite and Apex Legends, which also brought back their OG maps. In the case of Fortnite, this was extremely popular, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-og-breaks-its-all-time-player-records-at-launch/1100-6518929/" data-ref-id="1100-6518929">helping propel the game to its highest player count ever.</a></p><p>The arrival of Verdansk in Warzone could be a pivotal moment for the game. A report said if the arrival of this map fails to retain existing players and/or bring lapsed players back, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2026-could-drop-last-gen-systems-and-make-other-big-changes-report/1100-6529841/" data-ref-id="1100-6529841">there will be no "Warzone 3."</a></p><p>With Warzone going back in time with the arrival of Verdansk, many fans are wondering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-10-best-guns-we-hope-return-with-verdansk/2900-6307/" data-ref-id="2900-6307">what weapons might return as well</a>.

                <p>EA and DICE recently conducted the first public test for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, and while participants were prohibited from sharing their gameplay footage online, the participants shared their gameplay footage online anyway. Some of the latest clips to emerge reveal that Battlefield 6, or whatever the new game is called, features the ability to drag a downed teammate to safety.</p><p>This would be a brand-new feature for the series, but it's not confirmed for the game, of course, as the Battlefield Labs test is not necessarily representative of gameplay and features that will be in the final product. In any event, you can see this new feature in action in the clip below.</p><p>Another piece of footage shows a player getting thumped by a bolt-action sniper, with the player flying backwards in response to the hit. It looks pretty devastating in action, but again, it's not necessarily confirmed for the final version of the game. As you can tell from these gameplay clips and others--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-playtest-gameplay-shows-whats-next-for-the-franchise/1100-6529982/" data-ref-id="1100-6529982">which have highlighted gunplay and destruction</a>--Battlefield 6 is still very much a work in progress.</p><p>It's not too late to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> for a chance to get into a future test. Battlefield 6 has been rumored to release in Fall 2025, but EA has only confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-battlefield-game-releasing-by-march-2026/1100-6529243/" data-ref-id="1100-6529243">it'll be out by March 2026</a>. CEO Andrew Wilson recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-sounds-like-battlefield-6s-release-date-will-avoid-gta-6/1100-6529258/" data-ref-id="1100-6529258">EA could shift the game to potentially avoid a clash with GTA 6.</a></p><p>In addition to multiplayer, the next Battlefield game will have a single-player component developed by Motive and an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">unannounced mode from Ripple Effect that is rumored to be the return of Portal mode.</a></p>
