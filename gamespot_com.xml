                <p>In case you've been wondering, Ubisoft is indeed working on a new entry in its long-running Ghost Recon series. The news, which had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-ghost-recon-is-in-development-report/1100-6502229/" data-ref-id="1100-6502229">heavily rumored</a> for a while now, was confirmed by Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot in what sounds like a heated shareholder meeting last week.</p><p>First reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, the confirmation of the the untitled Ghost Recon game came from a question about Ubisoft's history with live-service titles. Touting the company's success with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</a>, Guillemot added, "In addition to the flagship game that I just mentioned, our objective is to also make strong progress in the growing market, generally speaking, by continuing to enhance our current experiences that we offer--and capitalizing on upcoming launches, such as The Division and Ghost Recon."</p><p>Later on, Ubisoft's CFO Frederick Duguet specifically called out the upcoming Ghost Recon title as one of the company's "first-person-shooter-type games," seemingly also confirming that the next entry will be an FPS. Though multiple titles in the franchise have offered first-person perspectives, the Ghost Recon games have largely been presented as third-person shooters since 2006's Advanced Warfighter, making this a significant shift for the series.</p><p>A new first-person live-service Ghost Recon game is not an entirely unprecedented thing. Ghost Recon Wildlands was a huge success for Ubisoft back in 2017, one which the company built upon by quickly following it up with a worse-received sequel, Breakpoint. Despite the difference in their receptions, both of these titles enjoyed a great deal of post-launch support. Ubisoft, in a controversial move, even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-first-nfts-are-like-steam-marketplace-on-the-blockchain/1100-6498699/" data-ref-id="1100-6498699">added NFTs</a>, a form of digital collectible rooted in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, to Breakpoint back in 2021.</p><p>Despite the confirmation of a new Ghost Recon game, neither Guillemot nor Duguet provided any timeframe, suggesting that the title is still a ways out. In the meantime, Ubisoft is keeping busy, spinning off many of its core franchises into a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">new division</a>--which is being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-new-spun-off-division-is-being-led-by-yves-guillemots-son-and-he-loves-genai/1100-6533205/" data-ref-id="1100-6533205">co-led by Guillemot's son</a>--as part of its terms with Tencent, and finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-assassins-creed-tv-series-moves-ahead-with-halo-sons-of-anarchy-veterans/1100-6533232/" data-ref-id="1100-6533232">greenlighting a Netflix adaptation</a> of its popular Assassin's Creed games.</p>
