                <p>Warhorse Studios has announced that hardcore mode will come to Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 next week. The studio took to Twitter to share the announcement, as well as a picture of 10 perks that protagonist Henry can seemingly inherit:</p><ul><li>Numbskull</li><li>Somnambulant</li><li>Bad Back</li><li>Bashful</li><li>Picky Eater</li><li>Sweaty</li><li>Menace</li><li>Heavy Footed</li><li>Punchable Face</li><li>Hangry Henry</li></ul><p>While their effects haven't been revealed, they all have negative connotations within Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and will have adverse impacts on Henry as he moves around the world. For example, Picky Eater could mean that Henry might reject certain kinds of food, which can be troublesome when players are trying to refill his hunger meter.</p><p>Like the first game, navigation tools are strictly limited in Hardcore mode. For example, Henry's compass is gone, and his position on the map is no longer shown. Players will have to rely on traditional ways of going from place to place, like looking at surroundings.</p><p>One developer even said that they added an <a href="https://x.com/SirTobi28?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1895203949701144829%7Ctwgr%5Ec0f430aeece823145981c4725ee6c3bf3a7e6515%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fkingdom-come-deliverance-2-star-map-data-night-sky-navigation-hardcore-mode%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">accurate star map</a> of early summer 1403 and implemented it into the game, which could help players navigate around.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-new-hardcore-mode/1100-6528915/" data-ref-id="1100-6528915">game's roadmap</a>, a paid expansion is due in Summer 2025 with a quest called Brushes With Death, in which Henry goes on a new adventure with a mysterious artist. In Autumn 2025, another paid expansion called Legacy of the Forge sees Henry explore the legacy of his adoptive father, restore Kuttenberg's forge, and become a master blacksmith. The roadmap ends in Winter 2025 with Mysteria Ecclesia, where Henry explore the Sedletz Monastery and goes on a covert mission to stop the spread of a deadly illness.</p>

                <p>Nitrome, the developer behind Shovel Knight Dig, has announced a new game called Mouse Work. It is exclusively built around the use of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-joy-cons-have-mouse-like-functionality/1100-6530529/" data-ref-id="1100-6530529">Nintendo Switch 2's mouse controls</a>.</p><p>Mouse Work really embraces the "mouse" idea. It's a party game in which players use Joy-Con 2s in mouse mode to control mice and complete minigames. We see a few of these minigames in action in its debut trailer, such as ones where players pick up and stack boxes, paint the lines that appear on a canvas, close annoying pop-up ads on a PC desktop, shoot asteroids in space, guide rock climbers up a wall, and more.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdhvAqS4bjA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RdhvAqS4bjA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In Mouse Work, each of these minigames is billed as a job that players must complete to earn Cheddar, the game's in-game currency. Players can then use Cheddar to buy new cosmetics for the mouse cursors that players control. The official description reveals that the whole game can be played in either solo or co-op. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/part-time-ufo/" data-ref-id="5000-479012">Part-Time UFO</a> is the title that most immediately comes to mind as a comparable game.</p><p>Mouse Work is notable for being the first built-for-Switch-2 indie game announced in the wake of the system's reveal last week. It fills the same niche as a game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together/" data-ref-id="5000-461292">Snipperclips: Cut It Out Together!</a> as a kid-friendly, cooperative launch window game where players can get a grip on one of the Nintendo system's core hardware concepts. Where Snipperclips emphasized easy cooperative play, Mouse Work takes advantage of the mouse capabilities of the Joy-Con 2 controllers.</p><p>Nitrome has yet to confirm a release date for Mouse Work, simply saying that it "will release hot on the tail of the Nintendo Switch 2." The new system will come out on June 5 with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">launch lineup</a> that includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> and more.</p>
