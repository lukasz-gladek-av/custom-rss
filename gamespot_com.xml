                <p>Swedish studios 10 Chambers announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-payday-dev-reveals-sci-fi-heist-game-den-of-wolves/1100-6519810/" data-ref-id="1100-6519810">Den of Wolves</a> at last year's Game Awards, so it's only fitting that The Game Awards hosted the debut of the first gameplay trailer this year. As touted in the trailer below, Den of Wolves is being produced by Payday co-creator Ulf Andersson, and it already looks like a wild ride.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlKiBVO1GLE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RlKiBVO1GLE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This game is a co-op first-person shooter that doubles as a heist game. With your teammates in tow, Den of Wolves allows players to mount stealth operations and other "unauthorized errands" on behalf of their clients while navigating the futuristic Midway City. But sometimes, plans are just going to go off the rails and you'll have to shoot your way out of trouble.</p><p>Den of Wolves isn't an open-world game, but the the mythology and history of Midway City will drive the narrative. According to 10 Chambers' Simon Viklund, it's meant to be "a believable city of the near future where late-stage capitalism has gone rampant, and corporations set the rules." Players begin as a blank slate before diving into the criminal underworld and making alliances in addition to taking jobs on the black market.</p><p>The teaser stopped short of announcing when early access will arrive, but Den of Wolves is already available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818140/Den_of_Wolves/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">to wishlist on Steam</a>. In the meantime, we've rounded up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">all of the winners from The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p>
