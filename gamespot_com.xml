                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii/" data-ref-id="5000-644699">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> introduces itself as a spinoff in the vein of Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. Meaning that, instead of looking at a mammoth of a story that can take well over 30 hours at minimum, it's a far smaller slice, this time placing Goro Majima as the main character.</p><p>Despite the absurdity of its premise, Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is indeed canon, the story taking place after the events of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. Majima has amnesia, however, which leads to a fresh start for a standalone tale that is progressively intertwined with the usual swings and roundabouts of a Yakuza story.</p><p>If you're wondering how much there actually is in the game, both from a main story and side activity standpoint, this guide covers how long Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is and what you can expect to find.</p><h2>How Long is Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii?</h2><p>Defining the length of a Yakuza or Like a Dragon is a tough endeavor due to how many side activities there usually are, as well as the usual length of the main story. <strong>For Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, you're looking at around 15 hours to tackle the main story and some side activities</strong> along the way, structured in five chapters. For reference, Yakuza games usually have around 13 or so chapters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443350-20250206034231_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443350" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443350-20250206034231_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443350"></a><figcaption>Optional islands and valuable treasure await on the high seas.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443350-20250206034231_1.jpg"></figure><p>Now, playing one of these games by only focusing on the primary storyline would be a disservice. Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is packed with lots of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-best-skills-to-unlock/2900-6255/" data-ref-id="2900-6255">skills to unlock</a> optional activities to tackle, some of which are:</p><ul><li><strong>Substories</strong>: In usual Yakuza and Like a Dragon fashion, there's an array of smaller stories to tackle. Some are introduced as you progress through the main story, while others require you to go off the beaten path to discover them. You'll either get a new mechanic, minigame, or at least a funny and endearing side story as a result.</li><li><strong>Pirates Coliseum</strong>: Commanding your own ship is a big part of the game, and the Pirates Coliseum is the perfect place to test your current crew and ship loadout. Yes, you can both upgrade and customize the ship, which will come in handy as you confront increasingly harder enemies, both in the coliseum and elsewhere while navigating.</li><li><strong>Crew building and treasure hunting</strong>: Speaking of which, recruiting crew members is a key activity. Most of them have special requests, from gathering items to reaching a specific Pirate Rank level, a reputation system of sorts. Building a good team is crucial to sailing the seas, especially if you're exploring optional islands in search of treasure, which are essentially bite-sized dungeons with a shiny chest waiting for you at the very end.</li><li><strong>Bounties</strong>: Whether you're low on cash or just looking for a challenging smackdown, there are over a dozen fights available to tackle, netting you hefty sums of money in return.</li><li><strong>Honolulu and the usual minigames</strong>: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii places a big focus on the pirate side of things, introducing a new hub called Madlantis as well as waters to navigate and explore. But this is all combined with the existing foundation of Honolulu, Hawaii that was first presented with Infinite Wealth. You get to explore the city at your own leisure and take part in familiar minigames. Most rewards are intertwined with new features like crewmembers and your pirate reputation, making for a great synergy overall.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443340-20250206020423_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443340" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443340-20250206020423_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443340"></a><figcaption>Photo Rally is one of the returning activities from Infinite Wealth. As for the mascot, I promise you he's fine. I think.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4443340-20250206020423_1.jpg"></figure><p>As such, the answer to how long Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will depend entirely on what you're interested in doing and for how long. Playing on PC, I have over 26 hours logged in, but the in-game time is lower. Since I played for guides, this meant leaving the game open while I took notes and organized screenshots, for example.</p><p>I also played some minigames through completion, which added time, and there were some activities that I barely took part in, which I'm sure would have added at least another dozen hours to the overall count. Regardless of what you choose to do, the high seas of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii are yours for the taking.</p>

                <p>Going forward, Microsoft will be showing PlayStation and Nintendo logos along with the Xbox logo during its future gaming showcases.</p><p>"But I just want to be transparent with people, for shipping on Nintendo Switch, we’re gonna put that [logo]. For shipping on PlayStation, on Steam," Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciB8M2zcdaI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Era</a>.

He also reiterated Xbox's multiplatform strategy, as it allows Microsoft to create bigger games while also supporting its own hardware and platform services.</p><p>Gaming showcases from platform holders like PlayStation, Nintendo, and Xbox typically only show their own logos along with the trailers they're presenting, even if the games are multiplatform. For example, PlayStation's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256">latest State of Play presentation</a> only showed PS4 and PS5 logos at the end of trailers, while Nintendo Directs only show the Switch logo.</p><p>During Xbox's most recent showcase, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-all-the-big-announcements/2900-6159/" data-ref-id="2900-6159">January 2025 Developer Direct,</a> Microsoft mentioned other platforms that the games it presented were going to, including PS5 and PC.

                <p>Nintendo has officially announced that its Gold Points rewards program will soon be discontinued, as the loyalty service will end on March 25, 2025.

This includes digital purchases and preorders made on or before March 24, and physical games can still be registered for Gold Points rewards so long as the game is released by March 24. </p><div

replace the outgoing service. As for why Nintendo is discontinuing the loyalty program, it hasn't given a concrete answer yet in its official announcement.</p><p>One possible reason here could be the upcoming launch of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2 console</a>, as Nintendo might be looking to gain as much financial momentum as possible when its Switch successor arrives. The Switch 2 is already generating an impressive amount of hype, so it's likely that Nintendo doesn't need to incentivize people to purchase games for the system during this initial launch period.</p><p>For a closer look at the console, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/now-we-know-exactly-when-switch-2-nintendo-direct-is-happening/1100-6529256/">Switch 2 Direct is scheduled for April 4</a> and Nintendo will also host global <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-to-try-the-switch-2-before-its-released/1100-6528849/">Switch 2 Experience events</a> to give people hands-on time with the device.</p>

All the proceeds go to Make-A-Wish, so your money is going to a good place and you'll have a chance to make a character alongside Bethesda, and many would agree that's a pretty incredible opportunity."</p><p>Whatever character this turns out to be, it could be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-may-feature-skyrim-grandma-see-new/1100-6465961/" data-ref-id="1100-6465961">joined by Skyrim Grandma, who is rumored to appear in The Elder Scrolls 6.</a></p><p>"With this exclusive experience, you'll work with the developers to create a custom character that will appear in the game, leaving your mark on the legendary franchise," the charity auction page says.

In fact, the wait for the RPG recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-wait-for-elder-scrolls-6-just-reached-a-sad-milestone/1100-6528679/" data-ref-id="1100-6528679">passed a sad milestone.</a></p><p>Bethesda boss Todd Howard has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-talks-elder-scrolls-6-and-retirement-i-want-to-do-it-forever/1100-6517168/" data-ref-id="1100-6517168">questioned whether it was right to announce The Elder Scrolls 6 so early</a>. Former Bethesda veteran Bruce Nesmith, meanwhile, said Bethesda announced the game so early because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-announced-elder-scrolls-6-so-early-because-fans-came-with-pitchforks-bruce-nesmith-says/1100-6518603/" data-ref-id="1100-6518603">fans were coming with pitchforks</a> demanding to know about the next Elder Scrolls. Nesmith has also said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-may-not-be-able-to-live-up-to-the-hype-skyrim-designer-says/1100-6526572/" data-ref-id="1100-6526572">The Elder Scrolls 6 cannot be expected to live up to the hype.</a></p><p>Bethesda announcing The Elder Scrolls 6 so early was a change in form for the company. Many may recall how Bethesda <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-officially-confirmed-for-pc-xbox-one-ps4/1100-6427776/" data-ref-id="1100-6427776">announced Fallout 4</a> (following many leaks) in June 2015 and released it just a few months later in November 2015.</p><p>The Elder Scrolls 6 isn't the only upcoming game from Bethesda, as the studio has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">discussed Fallout 5. </a></p>
