                <p>Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">delayed to 2026</a>, and parent company Take-Two's stock price is tanking today following the announcement. Shares of Take-Two have slid by about 8% so far today to around $219, wiping out billions of market cap for the video game publisher.</p><p>Take-Two anticipated investors having questions about the delay and its impact on the company's financial outlook, so it released a statement reiterating that the company still expects "sequential increases in, and record levels of" net bookings (i.e. revenue) for Fiscal 2026 and Fiscal 2027.</p><p>GTA 6's new release date of May 26, 2026 falls in Take-Two's Fiscal Year 2027 (April 1 2026-March 31 2027). Previously, the game was scheduled to release in Fall 2025, which fell in Take-Two's Fiscal Year 2026 (April 1, 2025-March 31, 2026).</p><p>While GTA 6 is no longer coming this year, Take-Two's labels still have Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4 coming this year, in addition to its roster of sports titles.</p><p>Take-Two will release its next earnings report on May 15, and it's expected the company will face numerous questions about the impact of GTA 6's delay on Take-Two's earnings outlook.</p><p>While Take-Two's share price fell today, it's still up around 80% in the past five years. In February 2025, Take-Two's share price <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-parent-companys-stock-reaches-all-time-high-and-this-could-be-why/1100-6529336/" data-ref-id="1100-6529336">reached a record high</a> following Take-Two's announcement that GTA 6 remained on track for release in 2025 and that the company had exceeded earnings expectations. Now that GTA 6 has been delayed, the stock price is moving in the other direction, at least for now. Stock prices tend to fluctuate significantly during a major news event and then moderate soon after.</p><p>For its part, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said Take-Two "fully" supports Rockstar's decision to take additional time to "realize their creative vision for GTA 6." Reporter Jason Schreier said the delay was in part to help Rockstar's developers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">avoid a "brutal crunch" period</a>. Rockstar <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">previously came under fire for its working conditions</a>, and the company later spoke out to say it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-exec-responds-to-crunch-cont/1100-6463106/" data-ref-id="1100-6463106">addressed some workplace concerns</a> pertaining to lengthy work days and weeks.</p><p>GTA 6 is expected to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">40 million copies and drive $3 billion in revenue in the first year alone</a>, and workers at Rockstar are likely to share in the game's success. Rockstar has an employee bonus program that can lead to big payouts. In addition to an annual bonus, developers are paid performance-based bonuses in the years of game launches. For the original Red Dead Redemption, for example, Rockstar workers earned five-figure bonuses, <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Kotaku.</a></p><p>For Take-Two's latest reporting period, running October-December 2024, <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4d81f3f6-cf24-44fa-892b-8ace44767349" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Take-Two paid out more than $100 million in bonuses to developers</a>, referred to as "internal royalties" by the company's accounting.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest on GTA 6.</p>
