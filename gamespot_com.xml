                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has discussed two hot-button issues in the video game industry, sharing his thoughts on rising video game prices and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://playstationinside.fr/interview-shuhei-yoshida-playstation-inside-english-version" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Inside</a>, Yoshida said he expected video game prices to go up, but he was surprised to see Nintendo be the first-mover in the push to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">$80 games with Mario Kart World</a>. After Nintendo confirmed a higher price point for the next Mario Kart, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">Microsoft followed by announcing $80 games, too.</a></p><p>"It was going to happen eventually. We live in contrasting times, where inflation is real and significant, but people expect games that are ever more ambitious and therefore expensive to develop to cost the same. It's an impossible equation," he explained.</p><p>"Everything" related to video game development today is "more advanced and more technologically demanding than ever before," Yoshida added.</p><p>"Each publisher or manufacturer sets the price of its games, of course, but in the end the heart of the matter lies in production costs. And that's why industry actors are so keen to diversify their revenues, in order to continue producing the AAA games that the public buys before anything else," he said.</p><p>Due to these rising costs, Yoshida said it makes sense to see a "proliferation of remasters and remakes" due to their relatively lower cost. Companies are not remastering or remaking games just for the sake of giving older games a fresh coat of paint and a chance to reach a new audience, he believes. It's because remakes and remasters are "a kind of 'easy' solution to bring in profits," Yoshida said. These profits can then help fund new games, Yoshida said, and the same way of thinking applies to PC ports of older titles.</p><p>Yoshida went on to say he's not sure if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-100-could-reward-players-too-analysts-argue/1100-6529948/" data-ref-id="1100-6529948">Rockstar Games will price GTA 6 at $100</a> as some think the company might. That would indeed be the biggest step up so far in terms of a price increase for a new AAA game. When GTA 5 was released in 2013, it cost $60 to buy; that same $60 is about $80 today when factoring in inflation.</p><p>Whatever the case, Yoshida said "a balance must be found" between production costs and the the price of a game. He cited Expedition 33 as a "way forward" for the video game industry, mentioning how the game was developed by a relatively small team and sold for $50 (it also launched into Xbox Game Pass). Expedition 33 is an example of how a studio "can make excellent games with tighter teams and budgets without compromising quality."</p><h2><strong>"AI will become a very important tool"</strong></h2><p>On the subject of AI, meanwhile, Yoshida said he expects generative AI in game development to be "used creatively to improve games," but the first step is understanding how to best use the technology.</p><p>"The possibilities offered by AI are tools, not ends in themselves. AI will become a very important tool in the future if developers learn to use its good features. We're already seeing this today, and in any case it should be seen as a simple continuation of what has always been done in video games, because AI has been used in video games for as long as they have existed in reality," he said.</p><p>Some have cited concerns about potential job losses due to the rise in AI technologies. For his part, Yoshida said human developers themselves must stay "at the heart of the project," with AI systems and technologies deployed to "speed up processes and tedious tasks that don't impact on the artistic aspect of games."</p><p>Also in the interview, Yoshida praised the recent viral trend of people using AI systems to create "Studio Ghibli-style" versions of things, saying it was "very well done" and funny. Yoshida said he doesn't necessarily agree that AI systems could encourage plagiarism, but he does believe "imitation" issues are a genuine concern.</p><p>"I'm actually more worried about the imitation aspect of AI, because beyond plagiarism, AI can now imitate a work at a lower cost. Fortunately, these imitations never reach the level of the original games," he said.</p><p>Yoshida left Sony earlier this year after 30 years at the company. He's now advising publishers, including working with Bokeh Game Studios on Slitterhead. He also advises for Annapurna and Expedition 33 publisher Kepler Interactive.</p>

That process included dozens of user studies and thousands of component iterations geared toward finding the most comfortable controller for as many players as possible. Ergonomics are subjective, but the difference between the Backbone Pro and Backbone One is immediately noticeable. The Pro model is by no means bulky, but the more rounded, chunkier handles feel more natural.</p><p>The redesign is especially beneficial for longer play sessions. If you, like me, find the Backbone One to be somewhat uncomfortable when playing for longer than 30 minutes to an hour, the Pro's form factor is much friendlier in this regard. It caters better to those with larger hands without sacrificing the compact design that many people love. My four-year-old son tested the Backbone Pro with several Apple Arcade games without any issues with the larger size.</p><p>When I picked up the Backbone Pro for the first time, my ring fingers rested naturally on the M1 and M2 back buttons. Depending on your hand size and how you hold the controller, it might be more natural for you to use your middle fingers instead. Back buttons are no longer novel features like they once were, but it's a meaningful addition nonetheless.</p><p>The presence of back buttons spurred a substantial improvement within the Backbone App. If you want to remap your controls on the Backbone One on iPhone, you have to exit the app and use Apple's dedicated game controller settings menu. On Android, the only official option is Backbone's TouchSync feature, which is restricted to Backbone+ subscribers. Thankfully, the Backbone Pro supports input customization within the official app. You can quickly set up as many custom profiles as you want, remap buttons, adjust trigger and stick sensitivity, and create deadzones for both.</p><p>Speaking of the sticks and triggers, it's worth reiterating that while the Backbone Pro has Hall Effect triggers, it does <em>not </em>have Hall Effect sticks. The Backbone Pro's full-sized sticks are certainly nicer than the shorter ones found in the original. They offer a smooth range of motion and feel precise, but these are still ALPS sticks. Though ALPS remains the most widely used analog stick technology--Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony all use it in their controllers--ALPS sticks are susceptible to drifting issues. The anti-friction thumbstick ring should act as an extra layer of protection, but it's still disappointing that a $170 pro-style controller doesn't have Hall Effect sticks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488226-backbonebuttonmapping.png" data-ref-id="1300-4488226" data-ratio="0.456" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488226-backbonebuttonmapping.png" data-ref-id="1300-4488226"></a><figcaption>Remapping buttons in the Backbone App</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488226-backbonebuttonmapping.png"></figure><p>Like the original, the Backbone Pro's greatest asset is its ability to turn your phone into a Switch-like gaming handheld. The ability to use the Backbone Pro as a wireless controller for other devices via Bluetooth is an interesting bonus. I tested the Backbone Pro on my PC, MacBook, iPad, Steam Deck, and Meta Quest 3S. From a pure performance perspective, the Backbone Pro works well as a wireless controller. The app remembers your devices, and you can swap between them almost instantly. Customization and game-specific profile support could make using the controller as a traditional gamepad enticing for some. As an Apple Arcade subscriber, it's neat to have control profiles that can be used for the same game across iPhone, iPad, and Mac</p><p>If you already have a pro-style wireless controller for PC and mobile, the Backbone Pro probably won't replace that. Without a phone attached, it feels a bit too light as a standalone wireless controller. Plus, if you're like me, you might have a hard time getting past the visual aesthetic of the Backbone Pro without a phone between each half.</p><p>At $170, the Backbone Pro is one of the most expensive dedicated mobile controllers around. It's $70 more than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-iOS/dp/B0CCT2TJW4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One ($100)</a> and $20 more than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Gaming-Controller-Android-iPhone-Smartphone/dp/B0CXGMPLWK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Kishi Ultra</a>, a high-end mobile controller that released last year. For Android users, it sounds even more expensive when you consider that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Console/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</a> costs $50 and is equipped with Hall Effect sticks/triggers and back buttons. But Backbone's mobile gaming experience remains unmatched thanks to the Backbone App, and the Pro takes notable strides forward in software utilization.</p><p>If you use your Backbone One at least a few times each week, you will likely appreciate the Pro's upgrades. And if you've avoided the Backbone One purely because you thought it was too small, you should give the new Pro model a look.</p><p>Existing Backbone users can also take advantage of one of the most exciting new features in the Backbone App: a built-in emulator on iOS and Android for NES, SNES, and Game Boy games (GB, GBC, and GBA). It's currently in beta, but I tested homebrew games for each platform and found the experience to be as smooth as other retro emulators on iOS.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488234-backbone_emulator_beta.png" data-ref-id="1300-4488234" data-ratio="0.461" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488234-backbone_emulator_beta.png" data-ref-id="1300-4488234"></a><figcaption>Backbone Emulator plays NES, Super Nintendo, and Game Boy ROMs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488234-backbone_emulator_beta.png"></figure><hr><p><em>Backbone provided GameSpot with a pre-launch sample for testing.</em></p>

this content!</p></div><p>During the day, players have a number of options for how they want to prepare for the fights ahead--they can take on enemies to level up, search for powerful loot and weapons, infiltrate enemy strongholds in search of information, or challenge more dangerous enemies and dungeon-like lairs to unlock unique items. In all of this, players can choose to travel together, or split up and try to cover more ground. Throughout the day, players may encounter random events or be interrupted by unexpected enemies.</p><p>When night falls, the focus shifts to survival--an ever-contracting ring of fire pushes the player-characters towards a boss fight, which on the final night will be the challenging Nightlord. Whether players triumph against the Nightlord or fall short, they will be able to return to the hub world, the Roundtable Hold, with relics and currency to upgrade and equip their character for the next run.</p><p>Players can pick from one of eight classes, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-trailer-news-everything-we-know/2900-6095/" data-ref-id="2900-6095">four of which</a> were available to try in the Nightreign network test--Guardian, Duchess, Recluse, and Wylder. The gameplay overview goes into more detail about two more classes--a ranged archer known as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-new-ironeye-class-is-an-agile-archer-that-deals-death-from-afar/1100-6530523/" data-ref-id="1100-6530523">Ironeye</a>, and a heavy-hitting melee fighter called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/elden-ring-nightreign-raider-character-gameplay-trailer/2300-6465900/" data-ref-id="2300-6465900">Raider</a>. Two more Nightfarers are shown in the trailer, but are not detailed. The Executor's name is briefly revealed in a clip of the character selection screen, but not much else has been revealed about the katana-wielding warrior. The final Nightfarer is shown to be a pale woman with a harp, but not much is known about this final character, including her abilities or even her name.</p><p>Players will be able to customize their Nightfarers to a degree with skins--including some based on other From Software games, with Faraam, Solaire, and Leonhard-inspired skins shown off in the gameplay video. There will also be a narrative aspect to the Nightfarer, with players undertaking a journey to recover their characters' lost memories.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign releases on May 30 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC via Steam.</p>
