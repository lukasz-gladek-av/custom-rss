                <p>Despite prominent Disney-owned Marvel heroes like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-2-review-web-warriors/1900-6418134/" data-ref-id="1900-6418134">Spider-Man</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/" data-ref-id="1100-6516081">Wolverine</a> having long-term deals on Sony's PlayStation 5, Xbox has deals for a few Disney properties of its own including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blade-game-announced-by-deathloop-dev-arkane-lyon/1100-6519805/" data-ref-id="1100-6519805">Marvel's Blade</a> and Lucasfilm's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has previously expressed his wariness towards licensed games, but he recently praised Disney and Lucasfilm for being strong partners on their upcoming projects together.</p><p>"I feel great about our partnership with Lucas and Disney," Spencer told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/phil-spencer-xbox-indiana-jones-call-of-duty?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=151716114&amp;" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>. "They've been good partners. We're obviously doing Blade with Arkane Lyon with them. I was just out there visiting with that team."</p><p>During the same interview, Spencer explained that one of the reasons he dislikes dealing with licensed titles is that the licenses can expire, which leads to games being delisted over time. Instead, he prefers to focus on IP owned by Microsoft's umbrella of developers and studios. But for games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Spencer is willing to make some exceptions in part because the developer--MachineGames--has such an intense passion for the property.</p><p>"I think what you see in Indiana Jones is a team that really loves Indiana Jones and that world," related Spencer. "The story is, to me, one of the strongest parts of that game--the way you feel like you're Indiana Jones from a first person perspective. So it's clear that's something they wanted to do. But, for us, given the [intellectual property] that we have that we own, I'm a big fan of us using the IP that we haven't even revisited."</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9, while PlayStation 5 fans will have to wait until Spring 2025. In the meantime, Microsoft and IHOP are launching <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-themed-menu-coming-to-ihop-as-custom-xbox-series-x-revealed/1100-6527736/" data-ref-id="1100-6527736">an Indiana Jones-themed menu</a> starting today, November 18. Members of IHOP's International Bank of Pancakes will also be able to use their receipts to earn "PanCoins" that can be redeemed for Xbox prizes or even a new line of limited-edition cups featuring Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Halo Infinite, and Sea of Thieves designed by Xbox artist Matt Taylor.</p>

                <p>Devoted fans of Pokemon should be well aware that 25 years ago this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-gold-silver-review/1900-2536200/" data-ref-id="1900-2536200">Pokemon Gold and Silver</a> debuted in Japan before coming to the U.S. nearly a year later. The game added over 100 new Pokemon to the lore and it's widely regarded as one of the best titles in the franchise. Now, The Pokemon Company is honoring the 25th anniversary of Pokemon Gold and Silver with some new merchandise that may make you want to "catch 'em all."</p><p>The announcement was shared on <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/goods/2024/11/241115_to01.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site for Pokemon</a>, and for now at least, the merch appears to be exclusive to the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooixSl118ptVAz_Muj67LRmyAGy-hkGhr3M20XUPPFL4uHcvzjX" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Japanese Pokemon Center</a>. The most eye-catching examples of the new products are the plushes for the games' mascots, Ho-Oh and Lugia, as well as some really cool jackets that come with reversible designs that feature the Johto region--which was introduced in Pokemon Gold and Silver. There are also picture-changing cups, plates, backpacks, bookends, and more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400912-pokemonanniversarymerch1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400912" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400912-pokemonanniversarymerch1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400912"></a><figcaption>Ho-Oh and Lugia plushies from the upcoming Pokemon Gold and Silver merch</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400912-pokemonanniversarymerch1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400913-pokemonanniversarymerch2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400914-pokemonanniversarymerch3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400915-pokemonanniversarymerch4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400916-pokemonanniversarymerch5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400917-pokemonanniversarymerch6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400913,1300-4400914,1300-4400915,1300-4400916,1300-4400917" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4400913-pokemonanniversarymerch2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4400914-pokemonanniversarymerch3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4400915-pokemonanniversarymerch4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4400916-pokemonanniversarymerch5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4400917-pokemonanniversarymerch6.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400913-pokemonanniversarymerch2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400914-pokemonanniversarymerch3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400915-pokemonanniversarymerch4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400916-pokemonanniversarymerch5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4400917-pokemonanniversarymerch6.jpg"></figure><p>The bad news is that there don't seem to be any plans for Nintendo or The Pokemon Company to bring this merchandise to America despite the intense fanbase that is still going strong in this country. It's almost certain that scalpers will pick up these items and resell them on American auction sites for exorbitant amounts of money. But until Pokemon's parent companies decide to rectify that situation, there aren't many options for fans outside of Japan.</p><p>Pokemon was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-gets-denied-entry-to-toy-hall-of-fame/1100-6527729/" data-ref-id="1100-6527729">denied a place in America's Toy Hall of Fame</a>. However, we strongly suspect Pokemon will eventually find its way in. The franchise's enduring popularity has already led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-pushes-past-30-million-downloads-tops-app-store-chart/1100-6527660/" data-ref-id="1100-6527660">30 million downloads</a> for the mobile game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-out-now/1100-6527486/" data-ref-id="1100-6527486">Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> on the App Store and Google Play in its first week alone. That's not even counting the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sales-reach-99-million-units-on-switch-alone/1100-6527600/" data-ref-id="1100-6527600">99 million units</a> Pokemon has moved on Nintendo Switch.
