                <p>By the end of February, players will get their hands on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> after sampling the open beta earlier this month. While anticipation for the sequel seems to be high, Wilds will have a long way to go to match the sales numbers put up by its predecessor, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world-review-deadliest-catch/1900-6416842/" data-ref-id="1900-6416842">Monster Hunter World</a>. In the last quarter alone, Monster Hunter World added another 1 million units sold, and it hasn't shown any signs of slowing down.</p><p>Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/monster-hunter-world-sold-over-a-million-copies-just-in-the-last-3-months-despite-being-7-years-old/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Capcom has shared the <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2024/3rd/explanation_2024_3rd_01.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">financial results for its last fiscal quarter</a> ending in December 2024. According to that report, Monster Hunter World's latest numbers have pushed it to 28.1 million copies sold. It was already Capcom's best-selling game of all time, and a very consistent performer over the past year. From the numbers provided in Capcom's <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/result/2023/full/result_2023_full_01.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">March 2024 financial results</a>, Monster Hunter World has been selling approximately 1 million copies every three months.</p><p>Monster Hunter World's DLC expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review-a-very-ice-ti/1900-6417288/" data-ref-id="1900-6417288">Iceborne</a>, also sold 900,000 units during the final months of 2024. Those numbers may have been helped by holiday discounts for both Iceborne and its parent game, as well as the ongoing hype for Monster Hunter Wilds. Regardless of the cause, Monster Hunter has become one of Capcom's most successful franchises with 108 million units sold, which is only behind Resident Evil's 167 million units.</p><p>Capcom will almost certainly add a significant amount to Monster Hunter's lifetime totals when Monster Hunter Wilds arrives on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 28. Earlier this week, Capcom also debuted an early look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-first-post-launch-update-already-revealed/1100-6529474/" data-ref-id="1100-6529474">Monster Hunter Wild's first post-launch update</a>, which will include the return of Mizutsune, a Leviathan-class monster.</p>

                <p>Amazing Seasun has confirmed that an open beta for its multiplayer mecha shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mecha-break/" data-ref-id="5000-612139">Mecha Break</a> will begin on February 23. It will be the most comprehensive one for the game yet, featuring most of what players can expect in Mecha Break at release.</p><p>The Global Storm Open Beta begins at 2 AM PT / 5 AM PT on February 23, while no end date has been confirmed yet. Global Storm will contain the 6v6 Operation Verge and 3v3 Ace Arena modes that have been in previous Mecha Break betas, but it will be the first to feature full cross-play across PC and console and include Mashmak. Mashmak is Mecha Break's PvPvE extraction mode, where teams of players work together or fight each other over an element called Corite.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UbY_bPQ-9I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-UbY_bPQ-9I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Mashmak gets its name from the map on which this mode takes place. An evil organization called Theia's Vanguard has taken over the Mashmak Isles and its massive supply of Corite. That serves as the narrative backdrop for why players explore, collect resources, and fight each other before extracting. From a gameplay perspective, Mashmak stands out because players can equip themselves with special mode-exclusive equipment to enhance their suits' abilities.</p><p>Mecha Break will launch for PC and Xbox Series X|S sometime in Spring 2025 before coming to other platforms later in the year. The PC version of this open beta can be pre-loaded <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam</a> from 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET on February 20.</p>
