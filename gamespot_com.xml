          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a> got its first--and very impressive--cinematic trailer during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6077/" data-ref-id="2900-6077">The Game Awards</a>. Among other things, we learned the game will focus on Ciri as the main character. The developers at CD Projekt Red have now discussed why they wanted to have Ciri be the star and have confirmed that, as suspected, Geralt will appear in the game in some fashion.</p><p>Game director Sebastian Kalemba told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-was-always-going-to-be-about-ciri-even-when-we-were-doing-the-wild-hunt-actually-but-dont-worry-about-geralt-definitely-hes-going-to-appear/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> that it was a "natural choice" for The Witcher 4 to tell its story from Ciri's perspective, building off the narrative in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p><p>"There's plenty of room for her and for us, also, to build on top of [her]. There's so much room for exploration, and because she's such a nuanced character, the beginning of her journey gives us freedom and so many opportunities to be able to dig in and use [that] for good," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c1rokekgnY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4c1rokekgnY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ciri was a playable character in some parts of The Witcher 3, and executive producer Gosia Mitręga said she is "less defined as a character," which gives the developers opportunities for storytelling.</p><p>Geralt, the hero of CD Projekt's previous Witcher games, will appear in The Witcher 4 as well. Kelamba said Geralt is important to the developers and to Ciri, so he's "definitely" going to appear. His voice was heard at the very end of the game's recent trailer, but that's it so far.</p><p>"I can't tell you more, but I think the promise is enough. But we believe that this journey, this new saga, this new trilogy is definitely for her," he said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415232-witcher.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4415232" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415232-witcher.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4415232"></a><figcaption>Ciri in The Witcher 4's cinematic trailer.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415232-witcher.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415233-witcher1.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415234-witcher2.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4415233,1300-4415234" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4415233-witcher1.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4415234-witcher2.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415233-witcher1.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415234-witcher2.jpeg"></figure><p>As Kelamba said, The Witcher 4 kicks off a new trilogy of Witcher games, which are in development alongside CD Projekt's other games, including a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel and a Witcher remake.</p><p>Recently, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle walked back his comments about Geralt appearing in The Witcher 4 after the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-actor-says-on-second-thought-hes-not-sure-if-geralt-is-actually-in-witcher-4/1100-6528324/" data-ref-id="1100-6528324">"slapped" him for talking about it.</a></p><p>The game's impressive CG trailer at The Game Awards was created by Platige Image and was pre-rendered in a custom version of Unreal Engine 5 running on an "unannounced Nvidia GeForce RTX GPU." The trailer uses assets and models from the game, but is more meant to be a mood piece that aims to show "the kind of experience the game is aspiring to provide."</p>

The union has been recognized by parent company Microsoft, which acquired ZeniMax and it subsidiaries in 2021.</p><p>The union is called ZOS United-CWA, and like the previous unionization efforts within ZeniMax Media, has been formed with the Communications Workers of America (CWA). The new union consists of web developers, designers, engineers, and graphic artists, with an announcement on Bluesky identifying union members as "a majority of video game workers at ZeniMax Online Studios and the workers behind ESO."</p><p>"We are thrilled to be joining thousands of other tech and video game workers in building solidarity across the industry with CODE-CWA," the new union said in an announcement on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zosunited.bsky.social/post/3ld5jhqijg226" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, tagging the CWA's campaign for unionization within the tech, gaming, and digital industries. "With a union, we are looking forward to collectively pushing for improvements to the workplace, including job security, protections against AI, better pay and benefits--in an industry that we’re so deeply passionate about."</p><p>In June this year, Microsoft signed a labor-neutrality agreement with the CWA, agreeing not to interfere with any unionization efforts within ZeniMax Media, and making it easier for workers within ZeniMax to unionize. Shortly after, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-is-now-unionized-across-the-board-recognized-by-microsoft/1100-6525206/" data-ref-id="1100-6525206">Bethesda workers</a> announced the formation of their own union, making it the first Microsoft game studio to be unionized across the board. Prior to that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/qa-workers-at-zenimax-studios-have-become-the-gaming-industrys-largest-union/1100-6510268/" data-ref-id="1100-6510268">QA workers across ZeniMax studios and Bethesda</a> formed the largest certified video game union in the US in January 2023.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld</a>'s next major update is arriving on December 23, bringing with it a brand-new island to explore. The update will also add new Pals, a new faction leader, weapons, buildings, new mechanics, and more.</p><p>Pocketpair has said that the new island explorable in Feybreak is "the largest and harshest" yet, at six times the size of Sakurajima, which was added in June. In a trailer that debuted at The Game Awards, the developer gave a look at the upcoming Palworld update, featuring a character who may be the new faction leader, as well as some of the new Pals and other new content coming to the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI_0U7-7hRA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mI_0U7-7hRA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Despite teasing a bunch of new content in the update, Pocketpair hasn't been forthcoming about what that new content is, leaving it to fans to analyze what's been shown in the trailer. As well as some unfamiliar Pals, the trailer appears to showcase a new base in a traditional Japanese building style, and it hints at some new mechanics that may include Pal-cloning vats.</p><p>Palworld has found itself in legal trouble over its similarity to Nintendo's long-running Pokemon franchise, with the two companies currently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-shares-more-details-about-nintendos-lawsuit-against-the-game/1100-6527664/" data-ref-id="1100-6527664">embroiled in a lawsuit</a> over Pocketpair's alleged infringement of some of Nintendo's patents. Despite the legal challenge, the studio is continuing to release new content for the game, and has also teased a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-x-terraria-collaboration-is-coming-in-2025/1100-6528087/" data-ref-id="1100-6528087">Terraria collab</a> due out sometime next year</p>
