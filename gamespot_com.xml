                <p>There are well over 200 individual <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grow-a-garden/">Grow A Garden</a> seeds you can plant in your plot of land in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/" data-ref-id="2900-6830">Roblox game</a>. Each one has a different rarity and value, and depending on the type of plant, they can either be harvested once or will keep growing new fruits indefinitely after you sell the ones you pick. However, with such a high turnaround for events and their exclusive seeds, you may wonder if there is another way to get them.</p><p dir="ltr">Luckily, with recent changes to the game’s structure, there is now a way to get some older plants that were available during the Spring and Summer. Of course, once you get the high-value plants, you’ll want to have them grow, then expose them to as many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grow-a-garden-weather-events/2900-7058/">Grow A Garden weather events</a> as possible to increase their value with multipliers added to them via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-grow-a-garden-mutations/1100-6534388/">Grow A Garden mutations</a>. Here are all the ways you can get your hands on Grow A Garden seeds and seed packs, including those you can only find during events.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_get_Grow_A_Garden_Seeds">How to get Grow A Garden Seeds</a><ul><li><a href="#How_to_get_Grow_A_Garden_seed_packs">How to get Grow A Garden seed packs</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#All_Grow_A_Garden_seeds_you_can_buy">All Grow A Garden seeds you can buy</a><ul><li><a href="#Craftable_Seeds">Craftable Seeds</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#All_Grow_A_Garden_Seed_Packs">All Grow A Garden Seed Packs</a></li></ul></div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4601032-grow-a-garden-seeds.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4601032" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4601032-grow-a-garden-seeds.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4601032"></a><figcaption>The Seed Shop has a wide variety of seeds you can purchase, though its stock is widely variable.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4601032-grow-a-garden-seeds.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_Grow_A_Garden_Seeds">How to get Grow A Garden Seeds</h2><p dir="ltr">The first way to get Grow A Garden seeds is to buy them from the Seed Shop. The catch is that there are varying odds on which plants will be available whenever the shop restocks, with the more common seeds restocking more often than those of higher rarity. As such, Transcendent rarity plants, such as Crimson Thorns, will seldom ever see a natural restock.</p><p dir="ltr">If you are following the directions in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-and-tips/1100-6535055/">Grow A Garden beginner’s guide</a>, you should try to get Mythical or higher rarity plants to start with, as they’ll give you a good return for your investment. Then it’s a case of getting as many multipliers as possible on them, which many of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grow-a-garden-pets-tier-list/2900-7008/">best Grow A Garden pets</a> can help you with.</p><p dir="ltr">While the shop used to have tiered stocks dependent on the friendship level with the store owner, Sam, there is now a new Daily Deals tab in its place. This now stocks previously available plants from older updates, which you can buy for a limited time. While they don’t restock on their own, you can spend some Robux to automatically refresh these Daily Deals if you find a plant you want more of. The varieties will change constantly, but have so far included Cauliflower, Brussels Sprout, Green Apple, Avocado, Rafflesia, Banana, and Pineapple, among many others.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_Grow_A_Garden_seed_packs">How to get Grow A Garden seed packs</h3><p dir="ltr">Seed packs are another way to get rarer seeds, though which one is up to chance. When you open it, you’ll see a roulette wheel that eventually lands on the seed you’ll get from the pack. Rarer seeds tend to have lower odds.</p><p dir="ltr">You can reliably get some seed packs via the in-game achievements section. Head into the Guide and select the Achievements tab to look at the first segment and find out what you need to do to obtain these packs.</p><p dir="ltr">Another way you can obtain seed packs is to complete the Daily Quests found in the Season Pass tab, which will earn you XP towards progressing to the next level. Rewards include the Prime Seed pack, which you can also buy from the Pass Store tab for 100 Pass Coins whenever they’re in stock.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, there are exclusive seeds and seed packs tied to the current event. You can find out all about how each event works in the central hub area by speaking to the NPCs, and we also have all the info about both the current and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-grow-a-garden-update-and-events/1100-6534922/">next Grow A Garden event</a>. Sometimes they’re available in shops for Sheckles or in-theme currency (such as Candy Corn for the Halloween Market), while other times they’re drops in Chests. These work just like seed packs in almost every way, but can also include rare pets.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4600997-grow-a-garden-seeds-shop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600997" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4600997-grow-a-garden-seeds-shop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600997"></a><figcaption>The one place that will always have seeds is the Seed Shop, but it only replenishes some of its stock at any given time.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4600997-grow-a-garden-seeds-shop.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="All_Grow_A_Garden_seeds_you_can_buy">All Grow A Garden seeds you can buy</h2><p dir="ltr">To keep things simple, we will only update this list with the currently available Seeds in the shop at all times. Plenty more have been previously available as part of event shops, including one or two limited-time seeds, but these are tied to their subsequent events. We’ll also omit any Daily Deals seeds as the range changes constantly. It’s better to look for yourself which ones are on offer. Season Pass plants and craftables will be documented here as they’re available for a lot longer.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Seed Name</th><th scope="col">Seed

                <p>Which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grow-a-garden/">Grow A Garden</a> fruits are of the prickly type? Each one of the hundreds of available plants has a type associated with it. Blueberries are, well, berries, while the invaluable early-to–mid game Bamboo plants are classified as woody. One of the more uncommon types is the prickly plants, and that’s an issue if you’re trying to turn in plants for a limited-time reward.</p><p>Another thing you should be aware of is that fruits can have multiple types at once. For example, though the Rose is classified as a prickly fruit in this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/" data-ref-id="2900-6830">Roblox game</a>, it’s also both a flower and a leafy-type plant.

                <p>Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada has announced that he'll be departing from the fighting game series and its publisher Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. Harada--who has worked on every Tekken game since the series first debuted in 1994--said in a social media post that the death of close friends in his life had led to him to consider how much time he had left as a creator, and after consulting PlayStation icon Ken Kutaragi, he decided to leave the publisher after spending 30 years working on the Tekken franchise.</p><p>"With the Tekken series reaching its 30th anniversary--an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to--I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close," Harada wrote in an online post. "In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect. Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator.' During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi--whom I respect as though he were another father--and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.<br>With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.<br>My roots lie…</p>  — Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Harada added that he'd been gradually preparing the Tekken team for his departure, and he was grateful to have worked on the series and on several other games, such as Pokken Tournament and SoulCalibur. While Harada is leaving Bandai Namco, he mentioned he would share his next steps at a later date. In a separate post, Bandai Namco said it remains committed to future development and content for Tekken 8 and expressed gratitude to Harada for his decades of work.</p><p>Despite a strong launch and 3 million sales in its first year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tekken-8-negativity-can-seem-bigger-than-it-is-dev-says/1100-6533921/" data-ref-id="1100-6533921">Tekken 8 has faced an uphill struggle throughout 2025</a>. Longtime fans have received recent gameplay updates, and character changes have been poorly received. Many players have also criticized the game's microtransaction system.</p>

                <p>As 2025 winds down, the new biggest potential acquisitions of the year appear to be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">$55 billion deal</a> for EA by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and other investors and the more recent proposed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-announces-purchase-of-warner-bros-for-over-82-billion/1100-6536717/" data-ref-id="1100-6536717">$82 billion agreement</a> for Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Studios. Now, a new report suggests that Netflix once considered buying EA and two other movie studios before the Warner Bros. negotiations came together.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-07/netflix-co-ceo-ted-sarandos-wooed-trump-personally-ahead-of-warner-bid" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Netflix executives previously debated whether the streamer should place bids for EA, Fox, and Disney. However, the management team reportedly couldn't agree on a deal and feared that its interest in those companies would hurt its standing with investors.</p><p>The report doesn't include the details about when Netflix considered these acquisitions, especially since Disney is usually the company that buys other studios including Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. Disney purchased Fox's entertainment assets in 2019 following an extended approval process from government agencies around the world.</p><p>Neither the Warner Bros. nor the EA deals are guaranteed to go forward, since both of them have to win regulatory approval after facing heavy scrutiny. Both, however, have major implications for the video game industry. If the EA deal is completed, Saudi Arabia's PIF will reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/majority-control-of-ea-could-shift-to-saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-report/1100-6536660/" data-ref-id="1100-6536660">gain majority control of the company</a>. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren have raised their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-saudi-deal-draws-scrutiny-from-us-senators-over-foreign-influence/1100-6535453/" data-ref-id="1100-6535453">concerns about "foreign influence" on EA</a>. In a regulatory filling last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-acknowledges-risk-of-selling-to-saudi-arabia-claims-it-will-retain-creative-control/1100-6535894/" data-ref-id="1100-6535894">EA claimed it would retain creative control</a> of the company.</p><p>As for Netflix and Warner Bros., the deal would leave the former in charge of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/" data-target="true">Mortal Kombat, Batman, and Harry Potter</a> video game franchises. The streamer demonstrated greater ambition for the gaming industry until 2024, when it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">shut down a AAA multiplayer shooter</a> from a team that included Halo and Destiny veteran Joe Staten. In October, Boss Fight--the studio behind Netflix's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/squid-game-unleashed/" data-ref-id="5000-652368">Squid Game: Unleashed</a> mobile game--was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-closes-its-squid-game-studio/1100-6535709/" data-ref-id="1100-6535709">closed by the streamer</a>.</p>

Now, Bethesda's Todd Howard has weighed in on the issue while promoting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-release-date-schedule/1100-6536675/" data-ref-id="1100-6536675">Fallout Season 2</a>, and he confirmed that his company does use AI, but only as a tool guided by real artists.</p><p>"I view [AI] as a tool," said Howard via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-and-elder-scrolls-boss-todd-howard-defends-ai-in-game-development-but-aims-to-protect-artistry-and-human-intention-in-his-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "Creative intention comes from human artists, number one. But I think we look at it as a tool for, 'is there a way we can use it to help us go through some iterations that we do ourselves faster?'"</p><p>Howard indicated that Bethesda isn't using AI to create assets, and instead compared using it to another iteration of Photoshop.</p><p>"We are always working on our toolset for how we build worlds or check things," related Howard. "I think if you go back 10 years ago, that version of Photoshop, you wouldn't want to go back to that version of Photoshop. That's our view on it. But we want to protect the artistry. The human intention of it is what makes our stuff special."</p><p>EA has reportedly told its developers to treat AI as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">thought partners</a>," while Sega has said that it will implement AI tools "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-says-it-will-leverage-ai-in-game-development-when-appropriate/1100-6536698/" data-ref-id="1100-6536698">when appropriate</a>."
