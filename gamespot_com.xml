                <p>Now that Krafton Inc. is becoming an "AI-first" company, the South Korean <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/" data-ref-id="5000-462692">PUBG</a> publisher is offering employees a "growth direction" opportunity through voluntary resignations, effectively reducing human jobs.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Business Korea report</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spotted by Eurogamer</a>), Krafton internally began a voluntary resignation program on November 12. Based on tenure, employees who signed up were offered the following packages: six months' salary for those with one year or less; 12 months' salary for two years or less; 18 months' salary for five years or less; 24 months' salary for eight years or less; 30 months' salary for 11 years or less; 36 months' salary for more than 11 years. The company said this resignation "support" assistance isn't a means to slash its workforce, but to offer its employees the opportunity of "embarking on new challenges" as AI tech booms.</p><p>"The core purpose is to support members in proactively designing their growth direction and embarking on new challenges both inside and outside the company amid the era of AI transformation," a company representative said." The company plans to support members in autonomously deciding whether to continue the direction of change internally or expand externally."</p><p>Krafton Inc. CFO, Bae Dong-geun, explained during an earnings announcement on November 4 that the company has stopped hiring. He said that "individual productivity must increase" across the company amid its investment in artificial intelligence.</p><p>"Excluding organizations developing original intellectual property (IP) and AI-related personnel, we have frozen hiring company-wide," Dong-geun said. "Rather than reducing costs through AI First, individual productivity must increase at the company-wide level, so we are stopping hiring for now, and we will organize and disclose later whether there will be changes to the five-year franchise IP strategy announced earlier this year."</p><p>In October 2025, Krafton Inc. announced plans to become an "AI-first" company, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653">investing $70 million into AI</a> to "accelerate mid- to long-term corporate value growth." According to the November 4 earnings announcement, Krafton Inc. posted its highest quarterly performance in the third quarter of this year. The company reportedly brought in 2.407 trillion won ($1.6 billion) in recorded revenue and 1.052 trillion won ($718 million) in operating profit. It said this cumulative operating profit marked "the first time since the company’s founding" that it exceeded 1 trillion won ($682 million) for the third quarter.</p><p>Not every Krafton Inc. subsidiary is buying into the "AI-first" investment. Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds Entertainment claimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-devs-claim-theres-no-genai-in-game-after-publishers-ai-first-shift/1100-6535799/" data-ref-id="1100-6535799">AI is a tool it won't use</a> in the upcoming action-adventure survival sim.</p><p>"It is very unlikely that that will change," community manager Donya Abramo said. "We already have a lot of our teams, pipelines, and systems set up. But, ultimately, our relationship with Krafton is the same as it has always been. They provide us access to valuable tools and resources, and we choose which are the right fit for our projects."</p>

                <p>During the final week of October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">Rockstar Games fired more than 30 employees</a> across offices in the United Kingdom and Canada. Rockstar subsequently claimed that the staff members were let go for "gross misconduct," but the employees contend that they were terminated for attempting to organize with a union. Now, the battle over those labor moves may be heading to court.</p><p>Over 200 Rockstar employees have signed letters demanding that their colleagues be reinstated to their jobs. The fired workers were all members of the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain, and the organization has called Rockstar's actions "the most ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry."</p><p>The fired staff members have been joined by current employees and other supporters for protests outside of the offices for Rockstar and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive. Additional protests are planned for the company's offices in London and Paris later this week.</p><p>IWGB representatives have pushed back against Rockstar's claims that the ex-employees leaked sensitive information about the company or its games in the union's Discord channels. Additionally, the IWGB has filed formal legal claims against Rockstar that may be a precursor towards a long battle in court.</p><p>"It's heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account--during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss's door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down," wrote one of the former employees, whose real name was withheld. "It's clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out."</p><p>Rockstar has already made the prediction that its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> launch will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-to-have-largest-game-launch-in-history-rockstar-says/1100-6534732/" data-ref-id="1100-6534732">the biggest video game debut in history</a>. The release date was recently pushed back to November 19, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Rockstar is estimated to be on the hook for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-could-cost-rockstar-60-million-as-insiders-report-game-is-content-complete/1100-6536115/" data-ref-id="1100-6536115">$60 million in losses</a> due to the game's delay.</p>

                <p>Grand Theft Auto V's multiplayer game, GTA Online, is available for free, but only for a limited time.</p><p>Rockstar Games has announced that GTA Online for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S is free to download and play now through November 17. Additionally, there is no PS Plus or Game Pass Essential requirement to play online, the developer said in a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/3921419k23a552/lay-a-proper-foundation-in-new-listings" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>.</p><p>GTA Online became a standalone game in 2022, and it normally costs $20. To be sure, after this free week wraps up, people will have to buy the game to keep playing. Alternatively, they can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-is-now-included-with-gta-membership/1100-6535997/" data-ref-id="1100-6535997">subscribe to GTA+ ($8/month) to get GTA Online</a>, Red Dead Redemption, and a bunch of other games, along with GTA Online perks, for as long as their membership stays active. GTA 5, meanwhile, was recently <a href="https://gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-plus-extra-premium-games-for-november-2025-include-chilling-horror-and-monster-trucks/2900-7252/" data-target="true">re-introduced to PlayStation Plus.</a></p><h2><strong>Next big GTA Online update in December</strong></h2><p>Rockstar has steadily updated GTA Online over the years, and the next big update in December will add mansion properties that people can buy.</p><p>"There's a new entrant in the Los Santos high-end real estate scene, and they're making moves into some of the most exclusive neighborhoods. Prix Luxury Real Estate has ambitious plans, bringing new unrivaled mansion properties to this lucrative market in December," Rockstar said.</p><p>Prior to the December update, people can take on three new missions related to the update that will pay out double GTA$ and RP, or quadruple those rates for GTA+ members. People who complete the missions will be able to buy the new mansion properties for a discount of GTA$ 2 million off what they will cost for people who don't do the missions.</p><p>People who complete all three missions also get a cash injection of GTA$ 1 million, along with cosmetics for their character. And anyone who simply logs in to GTA Online between now and December 7 will earn "Black Tier VIP" status, which entitles them to a free Ubermacht Revolter car.</p><p>The GTA Online freebie offer comes just after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">Rockstar delayed GTA 6 to November 2026</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill F Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Silent Hill f system changes all sound like they're making the game a bit easier across the board. Along with quicker stamina recharging and fewer enemies, the patch notes state that "unskippable combat encounters" have been skimmed down. Plus, even the Hard action difficulty is reducing damage a tad to Hinako.</p><p dir="ltr">Launching in September,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-fs-launch-sales-higher-than-silent-hill-2-remake/1100-6535077/"> Silent Hill f sold over 1 million copies</a> in just 24 hours. That means the game hit the sales milestone faster than the Silent Hill 2 remake, developed by Bloober Team. Speaking of which, Bloober Team is now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-remake-seemingly-teased-by-bloober-team/1100-6532382/">working on a remake of the original Silent Hill</a>. There is also a new movie adaptation for the franchise coming in the next couple of months: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-movie-teaser-brings-back-an-iconic-monster/1100-6534296/">Return to Silent Hill</a>, based on Silent Hill 2, is planned to premiere in theaters on January 23.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-spirited-away/1900-6418411/"> Silent Hill f review</a>.
