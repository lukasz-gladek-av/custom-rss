                <p>Activision is making a key change to Call of Duty HQ, the launcher that houses the latest Call of Duty games. As of today, July 29, Activision is removing Modern Warfare 2 (2022) and Modern Warfare 3 (2023) from Call of Duty HQ, and they will become standalone downloads that are available outside the main launcher.</p><p>Players will need to redownload them, Activision said in a statement. The company added that "legacy content related to MW2 and MW3 modes" within Call of Duty HQ will be removed on August 7 to help free up storage space.</p><p>MW2 and MW3 operators and weapons for Call of Duty: Warzone will not be impacted by the change, Activision said.</p><p>This change is being made ahead of the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> later this year. It's expected there will be a Black Ops 7 beta ahead of launch, and that would seemingly exist within CoD HQ.</p><p>Black Ops 7 will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-set-for-gamescom-in-august/1100-6533147/" data-ref-id="1100-6533147">unveiled in greater detail during Gamescom in August</a>, so keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest news.</p><p>The game is set in the year 2035 and aims to be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/" data-ref-id="1100-6532238">"most mind-bending" Black Ops game yet</a>. Black Ops 7 is also notable because this is the first time Activision is releasing Black Ops games in back-to-back years. Treyarch and Raven Software are the main co-developers for Black Ops 7, and these two studios also co-developed 2024's Black Ops 6.</p><p>In addition to Black Ops 7, it's expected that Call of Duty: Warzone will get new updates in the future tied to Black Ops 7. In fact, the Black Ops 7 trailer concluded with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/possible-new-call-of-duty-warzone-map-teased-in-black-ops-7-trailer/1100-6532265/" data-ref-id="1100-6532265">possible tease for a new Warzone map</a>.</p><p>Black Ops 7 stars Milo Ventimiglia (This is Us, Gilmore Girls) as David Mason. The celebrity cast also includes Kiernan Shipka (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) as Emma Kagan, with Guardians of the Galaxy's Michael Rooker reprising his role as Mike Harper from Black Ops 2.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches later this year for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. There was no announcement about a version of the game for the Switch 2, but Activision and Microsoft have said they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/" data-ref-id="1100-6532276">remain committed to bringing Call of Duty to Nintendo systems.</a></p>
