                <p>Humans aren't exactly on the top of the food chain in Squanch Games' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/high-on-life-2/" data-ref-id="5000-681576">High on Life 2</a>. This first-person shooter takes place in a universe where aliens came to Earth to use humanity as ingredients for intergalactic pharmaceutical drugs. Now, a new trailer for the game facetiously markets itself to alien consumers as it encourages them to use Humanzapro, a new wonder drug made from humans.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkTG28-CZbI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KkTG28-CZbI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The trailer is done in the style of pharmaceutical ads that typically run on American TV. All of the tropes of those ads are present, including the footage of happy aliens after they've taken the drug. Intriguingly, the ad warns humans that they shouldn't be taking Humanzapro because of side effects. That makes us wonder if this particular drug will be a power-up during the game.</p><p>High on Life introduced players to the Rick and Morty-esque talkative sci-fi weapons, which was fitting since the first game was produced by Rick and Morty co-creator--and Squanch Games co-founder--Justin Roiland, who also voiced a sentient alien weapon. Roiland was forced out of Squanch Games and Rick and Morty following <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/justin-roiland-abuse-allegations-what-we-know-1826967" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a series of allegations</a>.</p><p>The sequel is introducing a new feature that will let players skateboard into battle and incorporate it into their offensive moves. Alternatively, players can use the boards to perform tricks.</p><p>High on Life 2 will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on February 13, 2026. It's also slated to be a day-one Game Pass Ultimate release for PC and Xbox Series X|S. Outside of the game, it was reported that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-success-story-high-on-life-getting-a-tv-show-with-one-of-its-hilarious-voice-actors/1100-6525587/">High on Life animated series</a> is in development.</p>

                <p>Industry leaders in Japan recently gathered to honor Tomonobu Itagaki, the creator of Dead or Alive and the 3D Ninja Gaiden series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legendary-dead-or-alive-and-ninja-gaiden-creator-tomonobu-itagaki-has-died/1100-6535478/" data-ref-id="1100-6535478">who passed away in October at age 58</a>. The memorial venue was filled with heartfelt tributes, including copies of his games, artwork, swords, and pieces of his iconic clothing. Photos shared by attendees showed just how much he meant to the gaming community.</p><p>Itagaki was a major figure in Japanese game development. He founded Team Ninja in the late 1990s and helped shape modern action and fighting games. At the memorial, Koei Tecmo executive Yosuke Hayashi shared memories of meeting him in 2001. Hayashi recalled being assigned to Itagaki's team and being told there was no work for him.</p><p>"I was assigned to your department as a game planner. You told me you had no work for me. That’s what you told me. Two weeks after I was assigned, I really had no work, haha. At the time, I lamented my bad luck, thinking it was the worst possible encounter," he said (via a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/comments/1p8ttbe/yosuke_hayashis_eulogy_about_itagaki/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Redditor translator</a>).</p><p>Hayashi's strongest memory was developing Ninja Gaiden for the Xbox between 2003 and 2004. He said the project felt chaotic and sometimes impossible, but Itagaki never gave up. "The two of us spent 12 hours every night checking every adjustment to the game," he said. When talking about his former mentor, Hayashi added, "You were so pure and cool," showing how much respect he still held for him.</p><p>Itagaki left Tecmo in 2008 after legal disputes, though he had been declared <a href="https://gamespot.com/articles/itagaki-and-tecmo-settle-lawsuit/1100-6252501/" data-target="true">innocent of harassment charges</a> in court the year before. He <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itagaki-and-tecmo-settle-lawsuit/1100-6252501/" data-ref-id="1100-6252501">later reached a settlement</a> with Koei Tecmo over unpaid bonuses for Dead or Alive 4 and went on to create Devil's Third at Valhalla Game Studios. Before leaving Tecmo, he told Hayashi, "Don't change the logo," a message Hayashi remembered for years.</p><p>Hayashi also shared the final message he received from Itagaki: "Thank you for remembering our promise. Times have changed ... selling a million copies doesn't earn you much recognition anymore. Please keep making great products from now on."</p><p>After his death, a final note appeared on Itagaki's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tomonobu.itagaki" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook page</a>. "My life was a continuous battle which I kept winning. I caused a lot of trouble for others too," it read via Facebook translation. "I take pride in having fought to the end, and having followed my convictions. I have no regrets, but I am deeply sorry that I could not deliver new works to my fans. I'm sorry. So it goes."</p>

The two-minute reel featured animations from games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">GTA 5</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/max-payne-3/" data-ref-id="5000-20383">Max Payne 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2/" data-ref-id="5000-458780">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, and, as spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-development-footage-leaks-online-before-being-scrubbed-from-the-internet-but-it-didnt-reveal-much-at-all-and-weve-even-seen-part-of-it-before-in-an-official-screenshot" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-rockstar-animator-has-included-gta-6-animations-in-their-demo-reel/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, three clips from what appears to be pre-alpha GTA 6 footage. The reel was quickly scrubbed off the internet, but Redditors found and posted mirrors of it. And as viewed by GameSpot, the clips do look like early GTA 6.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> History of Grand Theft Auto</p>
      </div>
<p>One clip shows a male character detach a "LomBike"--likely a parody of the IRL LimeBike rental service--from its docking station, turn it around, and sit on it. Seconds later, that same character returns the bike to its dock.</p><p>The other two clips show a female character getting off a pick-up truck in two different ways. In the first, she swings her legs out from inside the bed and jumps down. The second sees the same female character, standing atop the roof of the same pick-up truck, jump down into the bed before vaulting over and landing on the ground.</p><p>This isn't anything new for GTA. You can hijack and drive cars, so of course Rockstar Games would be creating multiple animations for how you get in and out of them, or climb onto and jump off of them. You can also ride bikes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/" data-ref-id="5000-18357">GTA: San Andreas</a> and other games in the franchise, and as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-development-footage-leaks-online-before-being-scrubbed-from-the-internet-but-it-didnt-reveal-much-at-all-and-weve-even-seen-part-of-it-before-in-an-official-screenshot" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN noted</a>, "LomBike" made a small appearance in <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI/_next/image?url=%2FVI%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FVice_City_03.9b0e117a.jpg&amp;w=1024&amp;q=75" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an official screenshot</a> from earlier this year. So, it's very likely that you can rent and ride bikes in GTA 6, and that's maybe the most fascinating part of this leak: It suggests what we could expect from the game when it comes out.</p><p>This seemingly real leak comes not long after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-generated-gta-6-gameplay-leaks-are-going-viral-following-delay/1100-6536534/" data-ref-id="1100-6536534">AI-generated leaks of the game went viral</a> on social media. The creator, an X user named Zap Actu GTA6, has since admitted to trolling everyone with the "entirely generated by AI" gameplay videos and took them all down, vowing to stick to GTA 6 news and theory-based content.</p><p>GTA 6 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">recently pushed back</a> from May 26, 2026 to November 19, 2026, with experts believing the delay could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-and-next-xbox-may-not-release-until-2028-due-to-gta-6-delay-expert-says/1100-6536134/" data-ref-id="1100-6536134">impact the release of the next PlayStation and Xbox consoles</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-could-cost-rockstar-60-million-as-insiders-report-game-is-content-complete/1100-6536115/" data-ref-id="1100-6536115">potentially cost Rockstar Games $60 million</a>. Meanwhile, Rockstar Games has found itself at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-fired-rockstar-devs-and-the-messages-they-shared/1100-6536482/" data-ref-id="1100-6536482">the center of controversy over the firing of staffers</a>.</p>
