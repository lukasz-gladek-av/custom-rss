		<p>I don't know how much we'll be talking about new games on Remap Radio this week, so if you, like me, are looking for something to pluck at while waiting for next month's avalanche of big games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2671230/BLADE_CHIMERA/?ref=remapradio.com">I can highly recommend <em>Blade Chimera</em>. </a>Imagine a <em>Symphony of the Night</em>-style game with sick guns, cool swords, and the pixel aesthetic of a 90s arcade game. The hours I've spent with <em>Blade Chimera </em>have been "sick." Good stuff. Also good stuff: The Chicago Fucking Bears hiring Ben Fucking Johnson as their head coach. The Bears are (once again) back!!!!</p><p>-pk, who did a full room VR thing at a mall and it was super cool</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Sports! </em>– The NFL playoffs are well underway. Of course, the  Bears are not involved, so for once, we'll have to talk about...other teams? <em>Fine</em>. (We finished recording this ahead of the Ben Johnson news, by the way!)</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>HauntedPS1 Demo-Disc: Flipside Frights</em> – I'm not sure what to expect from this one, but I'm not gonna complain about lo-fi horror games.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Xbox Developer Direct + Infinity Nikki </em>– We'll see what Microsoft's up to, and if there's time, take another adventure into dressing up.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – Another trip through game of the year. It's possible this is the second and final podcast, it's possible we'll stretch to a third podcast? We're not putting a cap on the discussions, so we'll just have to see!</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series </em>– We got halfway through last week's exchange before Rob's stomach exploded, but we'll finish that up and you'll read it this week.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
