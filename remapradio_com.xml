Still fun, though.</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>HOA</em> – If you listen to this podcast and wonder "hey, why did Patrick get so quiet and not talk as much for nearly an hour?" It's because Rob's internet was literally dying in real-time and it was basically impossible for us to have a real exchange. We kept thinking it would get better, but instead, it was mostly me nodding my head to Rob while he told me stories about his house.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>RV There Yet?</em> – We have a mountain ahead of us. Maybe it's a nightmare, maybe Rob just hits the gas and finds his way to the top while we're all stranded behind. Anything could happen.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Remap Recommends</em> – One last set of things we've been up to that we aren't actively talking about on a podcast. </li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Wheel of GeForce NOW</em> – One last spin. Can we really top <em>Artifact</em>?</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio </em>– We'll get our homework for the rest of the crew into a microphone, before signing Remap Radio off for the remainder of 2025. (You will, however, get a special Hallmark-related podcast before it's all over.)</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong>Letter Series – One last exchange. See you then!</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a></p>
