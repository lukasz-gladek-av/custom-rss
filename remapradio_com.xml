		<p>I can't believe I let them do it to me again. A lost season, fine. That means I can check out, focus on hanging out with family and friends, and not let the scoreboard dictate my feelings. And yet. And yet. AND YET. That's exactly what happened on Sunday afternoon, as the Chicago motherfucking Bears suckered me into caring about the outcome of a sports outing again, only for it to all end in disaster. </p><p>I present to you, friends, with a video of my reaction in real-time.</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://remapradio.com/content/media/2024/11/IMG_6791-2_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

Sports! has been on the back burner a for the past few months, because we couldn't find the right window to check back in on our favorite team that makes us want to crawl into a hole, but losing to the Packers in a heartbreaker is absolutely the right moment. Sadly, my oldest kid has a stomach bug, so we can't go overly long on this one, but after Thanksgiving, we'll take a longer look at the NFL in advance of the playoffs.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Creating Patrick's Office</em> – Do I buy an iMac or a Mac Mini? What size should my L-shaped standing desk be? Where do I have to put that bar in the ceiling that's going to hold my lighting right? What kind of "normal" light should we put up there? Come watch us shape an office space in real-time.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Wheel of GeForce Now</em> – Frankly, maybe we should just let Rob try to navigate the seas a second time. As long as we don't get another overly sexualized MMO, though, maybe that will make for a successful stream.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em> – Oh shit, it's here. Join Rob and Cado (and me, if I have some extra time) as they venture into the Zone to see what's hiding.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> – You'll get something on Friday. I'm waiting to see if Rob wants to tackle some brief thoughts on the election results, or if we punt to something else. Stay tuned.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
