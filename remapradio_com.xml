		<p>It is often said there is no ethical consumption under capitalism but come dream with me of a better world. A world where we could buy something that makes ourselves and society better for having undertaken the transaction, a world where the act of consumption <em>creates </em>riches and resources. A world where I buy a 98-inch television.</p><p>I can see you are puzzled and dare I say even a bit offended? You are perhaps stuck on the apparent contradictions of this stance. Don’t worry, I am not judging you. I merely ask that you grant my ideas a fair hearing before you decide that me possessing a 98-inch TV is contrary to our shared egalitarian values and commitment to leaving a better world than we were given.</p><p>First, let me be very clear about something: I am sensitive to the offensive price of a 98-inch OLED TV and under no circumstances would I buy such a thing unless we made the kind of progress as a society that granted me the $25,000 required to purchase such a thing. It is in the spirit of shared sacrifice that I am proposing to forego the infinite contrast ratios, perfect blacks, and incredible image accuracy that OLED TVs offer in favor of a more democratic or rustic LED panel. Likely produced by a Chinese company in Vietnam by our revolutionary comrades under what I am confident are excellent conditions and offered at a price that is accessible to all, from the highest to the lowest.</p>
