		<p>Please pray for my immune system, folks. Both of my kids are ill, though thankfully, it's not COVID. But that doesn't mean I'll be absolved from feeling like absolute garbage in the next 48 hours, and somehow, it'll have nothing to do with the impending election. But I've been fortunate when it comes to dodge illnesses in the house before, and I'm hoping luck will be on my side, given that we're all (plus some fun guests) gathering in New York this weekend for another Save Point.</p><p>Join us, won't you? </p><p>-pk, who can't believe the Bears are back (derogatory)</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST –  </strong><em>My Turn (Bram Stoker's Dracula)</em><strong>: </strong>The movie wheel turns, and while it's early November, in my heart of hearts, it's spooky season all year round, right? What a weird movie, man. It's stuck with me since watching it, though. It wouldn't hurt to spend a little money on a 4K disc of it, would it?</li><li><strong>STREAM</strong> – <em>Save Point</em>: The big one, with nearly three days of shenanigans. We've got some really fun ideas planned, but these things tend to take on a life of their own, so who knows what we'll be doing this week, truly.</li><li><strong>PODCAST</strong> – <em>Remap Radio</em>: Several of us have been playing <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, and I've had a chance to beat <em>Life Is Strange: Double Expsosure</em>. Lots of charged thoughts on both. Also, my PlayStation 5 Pro will show up while we're streaming, but I'm sure to have some thoughts on it next week.</li><li><strong>OTHER</strong> – Not much. The election is this week. Godspeed to your anxiety.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
