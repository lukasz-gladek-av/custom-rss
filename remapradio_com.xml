		<p>I genuinely don't know what to say. I'm still trying to process what happened, and the only reason we didn't try to process it sooner over a set of microphones is because I went to bed late on Saturday night unsure if I was going to wake up hungover or not. (I got lucky, despite dabbling in the devil's poison known as malort.) I'm hoping to put what happened into words for an essay later this week, because the catharsis that was experienced during that game was borderline spiritual. You spend an entire lifetime chasing highs like that. I'm not trying to say it was worth all the suffering the Bears have had over the years, but I am trying to say that suffering gave birth to euphoria amongst a house full of friends and family.</p><p>-pk, who is, uh, going to the next game</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>A look at the week ahead for Remap.</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Detours </em>– We realized last week how often we have cutting floor discussions that happen during the pre/post show while recording R<em>emap Radio</em> and during streams that go on for hours. Maybe some of those conversations could be podcasts, especially if you don't keep up with streams? This week is our experiment with that format. Please let us know if you like it!</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Sports! </em>– Holy hell. We had intended to record a quick emergency podcast, but you know how that goes. Two hours later, Rob and I tried to process the latest extraordinary moment in an extraordinary football season.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Baby Steps</em> – It's been too long since Patrick tried to put one foot in front of the other, but we're going to give it another go this week.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Remap Recommends</em> – Another set of things we're enjoying coming up. </li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – It's game of the year time. When will this lengthy podcast series finish? Only lord knows, but we need to start it to finish it!</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Terra Invicta</em> – It's time for Rob and Chia to head into space.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – Topic tbd. Might even just be my essay.</li></ul><p>You can send questions <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCmFdOKpzkbsvUndEv-I2DeVZhpqWPBzXAURIlbGQIqur4gQ/viewform?ref=remapradio.com"><u>for this part of the newsletter, right here</u></a>.</p>
