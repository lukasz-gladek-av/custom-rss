		<p>I did it, I beat <em>Silksong</em> over the weekend. Well, "beat." I did not unlock the true ending for <em>Hollow Knight</em>, instead taking what the game gave me (credits) and moving on. I was tired. Satisfied, sure, but also tired and ready to be done with the game. <em>Silksong</em> has given me a similar exit path, but I don't think I'm ready to part ways just yet. I know there's a secret third act/ending that people say is worth chasing down, which I'll probably do. But it was also so god damn relieving to watch those credits roll. It felt like a genuine accomplishment. Once again, tired but satisfied. What a video game.</p><p>-pk, who decided to swim in a semi-cold lake this weekend because he refuses to give up on summer, despite all evidence otherwise</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>My Turn (feat: The Bear) </em>– We've tried to record this podcast a few times over the past year and change, but eventually it seemed weird to record a podcast about a year-old season of television. We were at risk of sliding too far away from the fourth season, too, but once Rob got around to wrapping the show up, it turned out we still had many thoughts on <em>The Bear</em>.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Baby Steps </em>– We're doing this in the morning because, uh, I got invited to attend one of the Cubs playoff games this week and, buddy, I am not passing that up. So we'll sneak in a few frustrating hours of video game before I'm inevitably frustrated by a few hours of my favorite baseball game. (Actually, I think they have a pretty decent shot.)</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Wheel of GeForce NOW</em> – I think this is the last of this batch? Hopefully, we'll get Rob to play <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em>. (We don't actually know what games are going to be added until close to the stream.)</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio </em>– Well, I've beaten <em>Silksong</em>. I'm also hoping to put a few hours into the game <em>Consume Me</em> before we record, too. There is also that completely wild news about EA going private thanks to, uh, Jared Kushner? Fuck.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a></p>
