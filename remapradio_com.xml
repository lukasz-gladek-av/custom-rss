		<p>We've snuck in a bunch of extra podcast recordings in anticipation of my departure and while I won't be on Remap Radio or livestreams for a minute (though you'll hear and see me this week!), I will haunt you from afar while navigating the tube. A huge thanks to the many folks who have reached out with recommendations on what to do while my family is in London and Paris. I'm now in that weird period where I keep putting devices into my backpack, because even though the trip isn't for a few days, it feels weird to put it back into a drawer? What if I forget my Switch?? Which would never happen?? But what if???????</p><p>A preview of what's coming:</p><ul><li>Sports! âœ…</li><li>My Turn: Big Fan (feat: Austin Walker) âœ…</li><li>The State of Nintendo (feat: Kat Bailey) âœ…</li><li>HOA Mailbag âœ…</li></ul><p>-pk, who managed to get access to <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound </em>early ðŸ˜ˆ</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>The week!</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong><em> Sports!</em> â€“ Folks, the Chicago Cubs are <em>really good</em> right now. Which is why we had to invite 404 Media's Jason Koebler on to talk about how much it sucks to be a fan of his team, the disappointing Baltimore Orioles. In the first half of the podcast, though, we talk about 404 Mediaâ€™s excellent reporting on techâ€™s takeover of politics, the rise of Silicon Valley on the right, the newfound obsession over the R-word in those circles, and, eventually, if the pitch clock was a good idea.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Peak</em> â€“ We've done a few <em>Peak</em> streams, and the key to doing another one is having to mix up the lineup. Knock on wood, we should have myself, Rob, and Chia together to see if we can make it to the end again. (lol)</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends</em> â€“ The crew weighs in on what they've been watching, playing, listening to, reading, etc.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Timberborn</em> â€“ While I'm gone for a hot minute, Chia will also be off for a few days. At my insistence, I think Rob's going to try solo streaming some time with <em>Timberborn</em>, the city building game with beavers he's obsessed with.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> â€“ I'll have spent more time hours with <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, I've now finished <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> (spoiler cast coming when I'm back from my trip!), and besides first impressions of <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>, Janet and I will be able to read to finishing<em> And Roger</em>.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> â€“ Topic TBD. I've gotta write my opener tonight.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a></p>
