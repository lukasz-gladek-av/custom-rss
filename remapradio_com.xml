		<p>PAX East also approaches! If you're there, we'll be drinking beers in the bar of the <strong>Westin hotel attached to the convention center on Saturday afternoon from 3 to 5 pm</strong>. It's the one right smack dab in the middle of the lobby. If you're there, please say hi! We're not formally renting a venue, just looking for a place to vibe and chat with folks. A bunch of people showed up last year and it was a real highlight!</p><p>-pk, who is happy he's getting <em>May</em> Boston weather this time</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>My Turn (80 For Brady)</em> – Nope, we weren't joking. This podcast was Janet's idea, so naturally, we asked Janet to host this, too. It's great. We'll probably take a few weeks off from My Turn before hitting up <em>Big Fan </em>next.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <a href="https://www.ludonarracon.com/?ref=remapradio.com"><em>LudoNarraCon Demos</em></a> – LudoNarraCon is this week, and once again, we've partnered to host a series of interviews, panels, and streams. We're going to kick that off with a demo stream with me and Cado tomorrow. The interviews/panels will stream as part of LudoNarraCon, then become podcasts on <em>Remap'</em>s various feeds, starting next week. Good stuff coming your way!</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Wheel of GeForce Now</em> – The last spin of the wheel, until we inevitably spin the wheel again. What can I get Rob to play this week?</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – Folks, Janet and I have both gotten very, very into <em>Clair Obscur</em>. Expect a lot of French RPG chat coming your way this week.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> – As usual, topic TBD.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
