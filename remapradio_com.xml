		<p>It's nice when you have some extra time to do things that aren't that important but would make you 0.0001% happier knowing they are no longer around. Take my PC desktop, for example. In backing up my old <em>VICE</em> email, it built a bunch of weird files on my desktop and made it cluttered. I like a clean desktop. Put that shit into folders, you know? But I only use my PC desktop to stream games, having moved into a Mac for most of my writing and admin work. But I still hate that cluttered desktop!!!! Every time I turn on the PC!!! But given that I'm almost immediately booting into a game, does it matter? No. Does it mater 0.0001%? Yes, yes it does, and when I had a few hours to myself on Friday ahead of family stuff, I finally turned on the PC, figured out why the weird files were there, and got rid of them. I now have a clean PC desktop. It is inconsequential, but I am genuinely 0.0001% happier.</p><p>-pk, who is spooked about seeing <em>Bring Her Back </em>later this week</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MEMORIAL DAY: </strong>A day off where I realized part of my deck is falling apart, thanks to an animal. Is it <em>good</em> if a squirrel finds a way to rip through part of a post and make it their home? It's not a terribly fun way to spend the final hours of a day off, scrambling to send photos to contractors and wondering "how much is this gonna cost?" Something to chat about on a future <em>HOA</em>, I guess.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Hopshot</em> – The last stream did not go well. A bad jump sent me spiraling, forcing the kindest version of a rage quit, where I realized I just did not have the energy to center myself back into place. Sorry. I think we're going to give this <em>one</em> last go before I give <em>Hopshot</em> a break? I do want to finish it, and I promise I will finish it on camera, but there might be logic to doing one of two things: 1) playing for an hourish once per day, letting me walk away without feeling fully defeated or 2) coming back in a month.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio </em>– Rob is out, but Rob is now back. </li><li><strong>VIDEO: </strong>An opportunity came up that'll make sense when the video goes live. Should be fun, though. It's not a way we usually cover a video game, but Chia is out on Friday, forcing us to be a little more creative on pulling this one off.</li><li><strong>LETTER SERIES:</strong> Once again, topic TBD. Any ideas?</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
