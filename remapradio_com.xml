		<p><em>Fortnite</em> really does come for everyone eventually, huh? At least, that's what I learned when my nine-year-old scrolled through a video promoting <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em> coming to <em>Fortnite</em>, at which point she asked a fated question: "What's <em>Fortnite</em>?" Fast forward: most of the weekend was spent tell me she'd played enough and needed to find something else to do. (I'll probably be writing about this a fair bit on <a href="https://www.crossplay.news/?ref=remapradio.com"><em>Crossplay</em></a> in the future lol). Also, while it was nice to have a weekend where the Chicago Bears didn't stress me out, it just became a weekend where the Chicago Cubs did more than stress me out: they smothered my hope. Ah well.</p><p>-pk, who doesn't like losing a game in the first inning</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@tierramallorca?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Tierra Mallorca</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>HOA</em> â€” The legend of Robâ€™s house and all its gifts only grows. Whatâ€™s inside the hot tub? What happens when part of the reason you bought the house was assuming you could sell your previous place?

All thisâ€”and surely much, much moreâ€”on the latest episode of HOA.<ul><li>We have already recorded a third episode of this lol</li></ul></li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Baby Steps</em> â€“ Did I really commit to playing this entire game on stream? Did I realize how long this game really was? Well, nevertheless. </li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends</em> â€“ This has nothing to do with this, but I am going to try and put together a Shocktober list for you. It'll be a little late tho.</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> â€“ It will take everything in my power to not just play <em>Super Mario Galaxy 2 </em>and yap about it for an hour. I still might do that. On the plus side, we'll be joined by our old friend Danika Harrod!</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> â€“ Topic TBD!</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Coffee Shenanigans </em>â€“ This stream was prompted by Rob sharing this message with us: "I smashed our glass French press carafe through reasons not my fault." ðŸ¤”</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a></p>
