		<p>I'm writing this introduction before the Super Bowl has happened, but if you'll recall, one of my annual traditions is having my oldest daughter bet on the coin flip. She had a multi-year run of taking an L, before making a huge recovery last year. We're hoping, much like the Kansas City Chiefs, to repeat. So I'm just putting the correct degenerate energy into the world that my child will choose wisely.</p><p>-pk, who is writing in advance so he can take a half day on Monday, because he took a half day for his birthday and in total, that's a full day!</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Interview</em> – It's nice to chat with other folks running independent media outlets, so when <em>Rascal</em> reached out about a podcast to help promote their pledge drive, I said yes, even though I know [checks notes] nothing about tabletop RPGs. Fortunately, Cado came along for the ride.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Civilization VII</em> – Can Cado and Rob build an empire, one stream at a time? Surely, it can't go any better/worse than their attempts at racing teams.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>PS1 Horror Demo Disc</em> — Well, it turns out there's a meta narrative on that disc—and we intend to see it to the end. Come find out what's hiding.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – It feels so good to be back to numbers. Also, I can talk about the time that I've spent playing <em>Avowed, </em>a game that finally got me to fully figure out (successfully!) getting my PC streaming to both my PC and Steam Deck, depending on whether the Steam Deck is docked. It's beautiful.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – Time to start talking about turning 41 next year.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
