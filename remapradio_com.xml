		<p>Thank you to everyone who said hello at PAX East. Once again, we had a wonderful meetup over the weekend, even if we discovered the hours for the bar had changed since last year. Oops! Then again, who <em>doesn't</em> like hanging around a hotel bar that won't serve you a beer? (I'm sorry, I will double check next year.) It was also a delight to be in the audience to hear <em>Giant Bomb</em>, at one point an independent gaming publication, will once again be an independent gaming publication. Difference this time, of course, is that it's worker-owned. In last week's weekend newsletter, I said my piece about that prior to knowing what would unfold and I stick by it: I don't care if "your" <em>Giant Bomb </em>died years ago, be happy <em>Giant Bomb</em> is still alive<em> </em>for those who want it.</p><p>-pk, who is getting excited to set up the pool in the backyard soon</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>HOP. SHOT. FROG. COSTUME. LET'S. DO. THIS.</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>HOA</em> – My wife and I needed a long minuteafter the passing of our longtime dog, Pixel. She'd been with us for nearly as long as we'd been together, and the closing months of having her were...well, unpleasant. It was a rough stretch for everyone. But enough time has passed that we're considering moving into the getting-a-family-dog phase, which prompted a discussion between Rob and I about what goes into picking out a dog.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Hopshot [The Finale?]</em> – I said I'd buy a frog costume if I didn't finish Hopshot last week, and by god, I have stood by that promise. If you'd like to see what it's like to play a super hard platformer about a gay frog with a gun while wearing a costume that barely lets you see, join us tomorrow morning.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends </em>– We were at PAX East last week, so it seemed like a good time to chime in with some cool stuff we saw <em>at</em> the show.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – We'll get Janet back into the mix, try not to talk about <em>Clair Obscur</em> for another two hours, pick up on some loose threads from PAX (i.e. <em>Giant Bomb</em>), and more. My interviews from PAX will hit next week.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Civilization VII</em> – War is over. Unless we want more, as a treat?</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> – Topic TBD, as per usual. Maybe I'll debate Rob further on the merits of the crab cake. </li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
