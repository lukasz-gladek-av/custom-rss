		<p>Fall is here, which means a big moment is approaching: the end of sandal season. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm going to be wearing those things as my primary  non-running transport until there's literal snow on the ground, but I can tell its days are numbers. I've found myself putting on "normal" shoes with some regularity, while the sandals pout in the corner. "It's going to be 68 tomorrow, don't worry." Or "I can't take the kids to school in sandals, friend. Doing so when it's so chilly would be <em>scandalous</em>." The days are also numbered for the above ground pool, though stubbornly I'm using last year's surprise 80s days in September as reason to keep that chilly bad boy filled up.</p><p>-pk, who was somehow not spoiled on <em>Bananza</em>'s fun endgame reveal!</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>SUBSCRIBER POD:</strong> A little tease of a three-hour travel pod for next week, which hopefully is a nice incentive to think about becoming a subscriber!</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Co-Op Corner (feat: Popucom)</em> – Over time, it's become clear that Chia and I really get a kick out of playing games with one another, especially when we can fuck with each other, too. <em>Popucom</em> really struck us when we played a demo earlier this year, and I gotta admit, last week's stream kinda cemented Popucom as a dark horse game of the year contender. Gotta play this!</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Wheel of GeForce NOW</em> – We're back, baby! Of course, we don't know what games we can throw at the wheel until we're closer to the date, but between now and this stream, I'll update the wheel with everything that's new. (<em>Hell is Us</em> is supposed to be on the service; that's the game I'm rooting for!)</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – We are not anticipating Rob coming back for this, though that largely depends on what happens as Rob plugs all the wires back into his setup. Maybe we'll get lucky, but it's probably going to be another week.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong><em> Letter Series</em> – Either way, we'll get back to yapping at each other.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a></p>
