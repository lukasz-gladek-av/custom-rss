		<p>How about that episode of <em>The Last of Us </em>last night, huh? It's been interesting watching the show alongside my wife, who has no attachment to the video game story. (She was crushed, obviously, and had to sit in silence for a few minutes afterwards.) Instead, I get to experience this like how it must've been for <em>Game of Thrones</em> readers. It's also curious because at this point in the video game, I was so fucking invested in what happened next. I still have fond memories of that semi-open area in Seattle. Then, the rest of the game happens.</p><p>-pk, who is covering the show, if you're curious, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decoding-tv/id1163344992?ref=remapradio.com">at <em>Decoding TV</em></a></p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Sports!</em> – We're recording this later than we wanted due to a scheduling snafu on my side, so this might slip into publishing on Tuesday. But the NBA playoffs are here, even if most of the games have felt like upsetting blowouts, so it felt like a good time to revisit the wide world of sports.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Hopshot</em> – Look, I've put this off long enough. I need to see more of this game, I want to beat this game, and Cado is going to join my journey.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends</em> – More of what we're playing, watching, reading—you know the deal.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Wheel of GeForce Now</em> – We've gone to some weird places with the wheel lately, and I cannot wait to see where it dumps us off next.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – It might be another week before Janet and I have a chance to  dig into <em>Lost Records</em>, sorry! But hopefully I'll start it this week.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Civilization VII</em> – Why not lean into the warming temperatures by joining Rob and Cado as they continue trying to control the world?</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – Perhaps something less serious this week.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
