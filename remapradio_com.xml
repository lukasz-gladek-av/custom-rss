		<p>The end of last week got weird between 1) Danika unexpectedly contracting norovirus and becoming extremely ill 2) My kids handing over their my first cold of the season and 3) Chia traveling back from an overseas trip. This week will end up swinging in the exact <em>opposite</em> direction, with way more streams and articles than usual. Blessed. Plus, I'm happy to report that after discovering some dirtbag teenagers knocked over my 12-foot skeleton as I was headed to bed this past Friday night, I was able to repair enough of Jackson Bones to get him back up. I don't think he'll survive another hit, though.</p><p>-pk, who was also somewhat of a dirtbag teenager during a notably regrettable stretch but it never veered into actual property damage</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <a href="https://remapradio.com/podcasts/episodes/hoa-the-double-dog-conundrum/"><em>HOA</em></a> – A new house means new neighbors, and new neighbors can mean new neighborhood drama.
