		<p>We're back! Slowly. Surely. Truly, there was no better way to kick off 2025 than to message Rob on a sleepy Monday morning and ask "hey, do you want to record a podcast?" Which, naturally, turned into a discussion of Sports! or HOA, which, naturally, ended with us going "why not both?" You'll hear the trials and tribulations of contract work next week. (I have since mostly built out my new office, and while I touch on that in this episode, we'll mostly unpack in the next HOA, where we'll probably do some questions, too.) I hope your holiday was restful. Mine was mostly not? The holidays fell on weird times, which means my plan in previous years to have my kids stay at cdaycare a few times blew up in my face. They were fine...mostly. The whiskey helped.</p><p>-pk, who watched the sappy Zemeckis film <em>Here</em> over the holidays, and while he would not argue it was good, he did cry many, many times</p><p>P.S. GOTY isn't forgotten. We start recording/publishing next week.</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>A Sports! Minisode</em> – The Bears beat the Packers for the first time in [DELETED], which prompted us to talk a bit about where our terrible team stands as the playoffs begin to unfold. I promise the next Sports! will talk about other teams. Austin promised to come on if the Eagles either a) make it to the Super Bowl or b) lose in the Playoffs. But we'll record an episode before then.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Return of Infinity Nikki </em>– Look, I had more fun with this one that I'm willing to admit, and when the stream was ending, my thought was "you know, if we have a sleepy January, maybe I need to return to this one."</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>K.L.E.P.E.K.S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> – I'm turning my homework from Rob into content. The last time I tried S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was when it came out, and, uh, it didn't leave a great impression? I can't tell if it was the intro, if it was me, or something else. Whatever the case, let's head into The Zone together.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio 78</em> – Back at it. No, this will not be a game of the year episode. We decided to punt GOTY recordings to January to ensure people could sneak in extra time with games over the holidays. This proved fruitful, because all of my free time in the holidays, when I wasn't dealing with actual holiday stuff or children or office rebuilding, was spent playing <em>Indiana Jones.</em></li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – Who can say? I need to write an intro after I send this newsletter. See you later this week, with thoughts on...something!</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
