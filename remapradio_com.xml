		<p>That wind I was worried about for the skeleton? It never showed up on Friday. Instead, it was a very pleasant day spent, as predicted, drinking beers on a friend's porch. It ruled. But then I came back home, nodded off on the couch, and woke up to <em>a goddamn nightmare</em> outside of my house. The winds were terrifying, and I saw my skeleton swaying like he was about to taken to Oz. So, at 2AM, I rushed outside and ripped my boy down to the ground. I ended soaking wet, but Jackson Bones is thankfully safe, and he's happy upright now in St. Patrick's Day gear.</p><p>-pk, who started watching <em>Adolescence </em>on Netflix and is worried</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>HOA</em> – This one is a doozy, and features our old friend/colleague/boss, Emanuel Maiberg. If you like <em>Remap</em>, <a href="https://www.404media.co/?ref=remapradio.com">you'll like <em>404</em></a>. But you might not want to buy a house after you hear this harrowing story.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Remap Recommends</em> — Apologies, this came together late last week, and now that we're publishing more articles lately, it made sense to push this back a few days. But you'll get to hear about what we've been watching.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Steam Vent</em> – It's time to load up Steam again, see what we find in the "new releases" category and go on a journey. </li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>The Wheel of GeForce Now</em> – The final batch of this series (I think!), but can we really top Rob trying to use a charge blade in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> and then being forced to speed run <em>Crusader Kings III</em>? Let's try!</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – I've been playing a lot of <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, having not played an Assassin's Creed meaningfully since <em>Origins</em>.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Civilization VII</em> – For Rob, at least, war never changes.</li><li><strong>OTHER ARTICLES:</strong> Yes, more! Rob has thoughts on the new <em>Suits </em>show, while Matt Weiss considers the ripple effects of <em>Half-Life</em>'s profound influence. I've also got an interview article banked but need to actually write it.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
