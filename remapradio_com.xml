		<p>When the clock struck noon on Sunday, the latest season of NFL football kicked off in earnest. It was at this point that my wife called from across the room "are you okay?" The Chicago Bears were not playing. In fact, I wasn't paying attention to the multi-game stream on my nearby iPad. No, instead, I was swearing like a sailor at the TV while trying to survive a particularly brutal room in <em>Silksong</em>. The kids had already departed down the street for the spot we usually camp out on Sundays for football, prompting me to respond to my wife: "The kids are gone. I'm going to swear loudly while I die over and over in this fight, knowing full well I will not be punished and have to put money in our swear jar." She laughed, then went back to finishing up a snack plate for the afternoon's activities. I did not win the fight, friends.</p><p>-pk, who, of course, beat the fight on his first try later that evening</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Euro Patrick Simulator</em> – After spending two weeks in London and Paris with his family, Patrick returns to Rob and Chia with stories of spending hundreds of dollars to drive a fancy BMW across French Iowa, why his oldest daughter has decided to ditch her family and become a painter in Paris, whether the whole “everyone smokes” thing is really true, and finally, deciding to become an espresso guy.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Co-Op Corner (feat: Popucom) </em>– I'm not sure we'll put this one to bed just yet, but we opened up the third area. What a great game.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Wheel of GeForce NOW</em> – I gotta admit that I'm tempted to just play more <em>Hell Is Us</em>, which I was distracted from because of <em>Silksong</em>. </li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – The return of Rob! I'm sure we'll touch on the last two weeks of house madness with Rob, but you'll want to tune into next week's HOA for a moment that was so flabbergasting I almost turned off my mic. I have been playing a lot of <em>Silksong</em> and have many, many <em>Silksong</em> thoughts.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> – This got punted due to some last minute schedule issues last week, but you'll hear some house anxieties from us very soon.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a></p>
