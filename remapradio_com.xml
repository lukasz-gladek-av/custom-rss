		<p>The end of 2024 is nigh, which means we're crossing 18 months running <em>Remap</em>. <em>Waypoint</em> was the longest I'd ever been at the same job, and it was easy to track how long I'd been there because it was the same age as my oldest child. That  system broke when <em>Remap</em> started, because my oldest daughter is now eight years old, <em>Waypoint</em> lasted seven, and <em>Remap</em> is approaching an opportunity to be rounded up towards two. Strange times, but I remain eternally thankful for this situation, given how things are unfolding elsewhere. I've been hoping for some kind of bounce back in games media, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-gamesindustrybiz-humble-buyouts?ref=remapradio.com">but...how, exactly?</a></p><p>-pk, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/memes/i-like-my-suitcase-barron-trump/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">whose children were into the "I Like My Suitcase" meme</a> until I told my oldest that it was Donald Trump's son's voice in the video (something I was not initially aware of) and she told me to turn it off lol</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>After Dark</em> – We know that people have been asking for thoughts on what Old Waypoint thinks about New Waypoint, and as you've seen, we've been a little cautious. But on both last week's episode of Remap Radio and this episode of After Dark—well, we're tearing the band-aid off. Though our thoughts might land a little different than you might think. </li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Infinity Nikki</em> – I've been curious about this one for a hot minute now. Whether to not I'll actually end up liking it remains to be seen, but I gotta know. (Side note: No, I haven't forgotten about doing monthly horror streams.)</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Hot Frosty</em> – Yes, we're doing it. You'll hear this during the break.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Space Marine 2</em> – I don't know if we can finish the game, but we'll do our best to get as far as we can before the holiday season kicks off for us. (If we don't beat it on stream during this season, we'll do it in the new year.)</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – Chance I'm sitting this one out due to the way we're going to shift recording schedules on this one, but remains to be seen. Rob'll be back in the host chair!</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
