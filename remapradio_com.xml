		<p>Phew. The sprint is over. Six days with my wife out of town, six days with the kids on my own. It's simultaneously a joy, a rush, and an exhaustion to have both of my kids by myself for a trip that long. I felt all of it hit me on early Saturday evening, when I was reaching for a beer to celebrate the kids going to sleep and decided it was simply time to sleep myself, instead. I tossed <em>Hell House LLC: Lineage </em>on my iPad (a regrettable decision, what an awful movie) and almost immediately zonked out. My wife being gone did not stop me from playing every single possible episode in <em>Dispatch</em>, though. I'm fully caught up for this week's finale.</p><p>-pk, who was legitimately sad when he realized he was caught up!</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>HOA</em> – Crack open a cold one and light your designer charcoal, it's gonna be a beefy one! Special guest Emanuel Maiberg joins Rob to check back in on what has happened since his <a href="https://remapradio.com/podcasts/episodes/hoa-the-philly-flood/" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooded home horror story</a>. They discuss the emotional rollercoaster of finding a new house, HVACs and how to maintain them, and toss in a bit of home theater talk for good measure.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Escape Simulator 2</em> – We had a blast playing <em>R.E.P.O.</em> last week, so it's time for Chia, Danika, Janet, and myself to try another co-op adventure.</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – Fingers crossed for no migraines this week!</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Wheel of GeForce NOW</em> – No, we will probably not decide to fail to play <em>Europa Universalis V</em> again, but boy I'm awfully tempted to lmao</li><li><strong>BABY STEPS?: </strong>We have not forgotten about this game. We'll get back to it eventually, promise. Just wanted to let folks know that it's still on my brain, and I have so far resisted the impulse to try making progress in my spare time.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a></p>
