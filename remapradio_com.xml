		<p>To All Beavers of Slatsville Who May Have Been Affected by Recent Events:</p><p>It has come to my attention that the past several months have been difficult for our <em>Timberborn </em>settlement, and some of you have not felt seen by the management of Slatsville. This could not be further from the truth, but words are cheap and actions speak louder so as your manager I am personally extending this apology.</p><p>I am sorry. I need to do better and I will do better, and that process starts with taking accountability.</p><p>I am sorry that I did not notice the food warehouses and water tanks were slowly emptying well before the Cycle 4 Drought. I am sorry that apparently my first response to learning of the resulting food shortage was that “this will self-correct, don’t worry about it.” While true, obviously a devastating famine is not the mechanism by which any of us would like to handle these issues.</p><p>I regret that the Great Reservoir I built to address future drought issues was overtopped by the radioactive runoff of the Cycle 7 Badtide which killed all our crops and forests and led to the Second Great Famine of Cycle 8.&nbsp;</p><p>I do feel I must point out, purely for the sake of fairness, that this led to meaningful reforms and an attempt to prevent recurrences of this issue. The flood and famine prompted construction of the Badtide Diversion Runoff Channel so that never again would our drinking water and arable farmland be inundated by radioactive floodwaters.</p><p>However, the fact that the Great Badtide Diversion Runoff Channel did not have enough capacity to channel all the runoff into the river was regrettable. As was the backwash of radioactive waste that flooded the Industrial Canyon District as well as most of our farmland (again). I have heard your stories and felt your pain over this incident. But all this was also completely unforeseeable, and I am comforted by the fact that nobody could have prevented this disaster.</p>
