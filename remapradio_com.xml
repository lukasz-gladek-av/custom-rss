		<p>Sigh. My wife and I always joked about my rambunctious younger daughter being the one who would inevitably break a bone, and sure enough, after falling off a backyard water slide thing at a weird angle, she busted her arm in a few places. It wasn't even a clean break, either; she's got pins and the whole nine yards. <em>Sigh</em>. She has been a trooper, but c'mon, it's the worst possible time for that to happen—the start of summer? Here's hoping the miraculous healing powers of being young kick in as soon as possible. Otherwise, we might all lose our minds.</p><p>-pk, who's only broken his collarbone but that definitely sucked</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Summer Game Fest Interviews [Part 1] </em>– There was a hot minute where I wasn't going to attend Summer Game Fest at all. An important family wedding overlapped with the event, the kind of wedding where you cannot send your partner in your place, you gotta show the fuck up. It was a blast, but could I really justify spending two days in Los Angeles? Fortunately, I made it work, and in addition to playing tons of games, I also spoke with eight different developers. You're hearing the first wave of those interviews now, and you'll hear the next wave of those next week, too. But...</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Sports!</em> – We haven't been able to check in on the NBA because of schedule stuff, and fortunately, the NBA Finals won't be over before Rob and I hop on a microphone with one another on Tuesday afternoon. We'll react to everything that's happened so far, and you'll hear it ahead of game six. We will probably try to sneak in some small house updates into this one, too, for those of you following along at home and wondering if Rob's house plan fell apart.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Steam Next Fest</em> – I'm so bummed to have missed out on last week's stream, but hey, I get to be around for this week's stream, so that's great. Those demos are disappearing off Steam as I'm typing this, though, so go download them now if you want to grab some for yourself! (Most stay up.)</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends</em> – We've gotten off our regular rotation on these, but I want to bring them back, so look forward to this later this week.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Wheel of GeForce Now</em> – What do I have to do convince Rob to play two more hours of <em>MindsEye</em>? (I'm not going to do that. But I'm tempted.)</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> – I wonder if Rob has broken any bones?</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
