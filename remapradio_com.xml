		<p>I did it. I made it through the week with the kids! Honestly, it was a blast. I've made a habit of taking a picture of the three of us before my wife arrives back home whenever we have weeks like this, and now it's turned into this really beautiful timeline of my kids growing up. It makes me feel a lot better than re-watching <em>Interstellar</em> did over the weekend. (The <em>tears.)</em> Great movie, nonsensical plot, who cares? The score, the acting, the worlds, the heart—it all worked for me.</p><p>-pk, who was inspired to rewatch <em>Interstellar</em> <a href="https://x.com/TheCinesthetic/status/1897214249878892886?ref=remapradio.com">because of this</a></p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>My Turn (Hoosiers)</em> – Well, it looks like Sports! x My Turn is going on a bit of a bender, because watching Hoosiers means we're also going to watch Rudy. We're making some questionable choices, but come join us.</li><li><strong>ARTICLES:</strong> <em>How Half-Life Ruined FPS Games + Rob Has Thoughts about Suits (the TV show)* </em>– Rob finished <em>Remap</em>'s tax forms, and the result has been Rob delightfully getting back into writing and freelances pieces.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Onimusha</em> – The audience didn't lie to us! There were no more block puzzles! But we do have one more area in front of us before finishing this.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>The Wheel of GeForce NOW</em> – Spin, friend, spin!</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends</em> – Back into the media mines. This is probably where I tell everyone they should watch <em>Daredevil</em>'s third season.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – I can't talk about playing <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> yet, but I do think I can talk about <em>Wanderstop</em> when we record this.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
