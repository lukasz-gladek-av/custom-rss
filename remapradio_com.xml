		<p>I write this from a hotel across the street from the local Buffalo airport a few hours before my flight. The last 36 hours have a whirlwind of breweries, terrific conversations, too much light beer, learning local football cultural customs, and so much more. It has been a delight. Buffalo, <em>thank you</em>. I'm sorry that our meetup didn't come together sooner, which I know meant some folks couldn't make it because the plans were solidified late. (We even had to move the venue last second, because it could not accommodate everyone who was coming, and some folks slipped through the cracks that way, despite my best efforts.) In truth, this trip wasn't going to happen. I didn't think Rob could make it for personal reasons, the government shutdown was making air travel increasingly hairy, and so I figured: well, maybe next year. While the planning could have been tighter, I'm so glad we pulled it off anyway, because I can absolutely <em>guarantee</em> you that we're going to do more of this in the future. </p><p>P.S. We talked about going to Philly next fall. </p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Sports!</em> – I brought my recorder for interviews with me, and along the way, recorded a few brief travelogue entries about my (short) time in Buffalo, alongside an hourlong conversation with Rob after the game was over.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>RV There Yet?</em> – Look, Danika and I had so much fun that it's time to get an even bigger group going in this game. Current plan is me, Danika, Rob, and Chia. Danika didn't have to deal with the nightmare that is piloting that RV, so I am very much looking forward to Rob and Chia getting upset.</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – God willing, all of us will be back together again. (I will say that I do not think the five-person format will continue to be this common in the future. We'll probably use the extra folks as a way to give people an opportunity to, say, do some extra writing that's been tough to get together.)</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Wheel of GeForce NOW </em>– No clue what's coming out this week, so we'll be rolling the dice (or the wheel?) on what we're playing on Thursday.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> – Pretty good chance we talk about Buffalo!</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a></p>
