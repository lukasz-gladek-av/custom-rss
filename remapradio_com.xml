		<p>I'm not sure what to do with myself. The Chicago Bears looked...good? Excellent? Yes, yes, I know the Cowboys defense is notoriously bad and yes, yes the Bears nearly gave up a franchise high amount of points to the Lions just one week ago—but let me have this moment. Let me hold onto it, before it slips away a week from now. We'll probably do exactly that on a podcast I'm about to record with Rob, but if you're also wondering "Hey, I wanna hear more about stuff going horribly wrong at Rob's house," don't worry, we have an entire HOA in the bank that you'll hear in the near future. I'm told that even in the weeks since recording that, there's more to talk about it. Somehow, I should not be surprised. And yet?</p><p>-pk, who keeps thinking he'll get tired of <em>Silksong</em> but has not</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Sports!</em> – What exactly did you think was going to happen when the Chicago Bears have a kick ass win in a year where we're desperate for hope? (I also suspect we'll end up talking about the very weird Charlie Kirk moments.)</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Baby Steps </em>– Look, the moment Chia and I played this demo, we knew that we were signing up for a video game that we needed to play together on stream with you. Come join us for what's sure to be a fucked up journey.</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – We'll probably tamp down the <em>Silksong</em> talk after this week, but I think I need to let everyone off the leash one last time lol. But I have also been putting time into <em>Silent Hill f</em>. There sure, uh, is a lot of combat.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Wheel of GeForce NOW</em> – There is a co-op firefighter game we almost played two weeks ago that I might try to convince everyone on now.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> – Somehow, this was almost about the Chicago Bears last week. That would've been funny. We'll figure out the topic soon, though. We should make Rob play <em>Silksong</em>.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a></p>
