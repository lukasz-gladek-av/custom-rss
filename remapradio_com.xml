		<p>The goal of spending nearly two weeks across London and Paris—though specifically Paris—was to spend enough time in one place that you could get the sense of actually living in that place. In that way, among many others, the trip was a great success. Often, we simply strolled out of the house, hung out at a park, and improvised the rest. It's a testament to Paris' great transportation that you can wrap from one end to the other in about 30 minutes without breaking a sweat. It was a wonderful place, a wonderful city, and my oldest daughter asked to avoid sitting at the window seat on the way home because she was worried it'd cause her to cry. Over the course of the trip, she was convinced she would come back as a painter, selling her work on the street to tourists like us. It's a beautiful dream, and I hope it happens.</p><p>-pk, who only really played <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound </em>while gone, then went  hogwild because he kept waking up at 5 in the goddamn morning</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>HOA</em> – We recorded this a few weeks back, banking podcasts ahead of me being gone, but I'm pretty sure we spent most of this podcast answering questions from the bucket. A surprising amount of time was spent talking about the nature of recommendations for things to buy in your hope, and the relationships people have built with places like <em>Wirecutter</em> and reddit.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Keighley Heads to Gamescom</em> – Actually, Janet's headed to Germany, too. She's attending on behalf of the good folks at MinnMax, which means she won't be joining us for Remap Radio this week, but we can vibe with her adventures by talking over a brand-new Battlefield 6 trailer, instead. The one time I went to Gamescom, I took a shot of absinthe, being promised I would briefly hallucinate, and all I did was take a shot that only tasted okay.</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – Excited and interested to dig into both S<em>word of the Sea</em> and <em>Herdling</em>, games I've finished in my failed attempts to transition back to the sleep rhythms of home. The transition to Europe was no big deal, but sheesh, coming back has resulted in a few painfully early mornings so far.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Madden NFL 26</em> – The last time we tried this, it was a disaster. I called plays, Rob threw interceptions, and Chia slowly figured out how football strategy worked. Why not try this again? (Chia will be out of town for this one!)</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – We're back! Well, for a week. Rob's doing a lot of moving next week, so you'll likely get a solo essay from me after this. I wonder how many words we can get out of me (seriously) trying wine for the first time?</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a></p>
