		<p>18 hours and 49 minutes. I cannot remember the last time I spent so much time on a single game this fast. It's just not how my life is built these days. I realize the phrase is overused, but when I am not playing <em>Silksong</em>, I am thinking about playing <em>Silksong</em>. When I loaded up the game to check my hour count for this post, I thought about playing a few minutes. (I did not.) As the Chicago Bears spat in my face for the millionth time this weekend, I joked to a friend that we should just both grab our Switches and play <em>Silksong</em> instead. It would have been a better use of my time, time that would have been respected by such a lovingly crafted hellworld.
