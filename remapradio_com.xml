		<p>No, probably not. And why would you? </p><p>Technically speaking, we announced these <a href="https://dogfish-seadragon-f2ms.squarespace.com/?ref=remapradio.com">new additions to <em>Remap</em>’s merch store</a> during Save Point, where we donated any profits to Save Point’s donation total, but didn’t actually publish anything on the website. Or share details on social media. We are, in theory, a business.</p><p>But it’s true!</p><p>We have two new items in the <em>Remap</em> store, and think they're awesome. Every time we add an item, we use it ourselves before you can buy it. It'd be easy to flood our store with junk—but we try not to.</p><p>How can you engage in a little capitalism with us? Glad you asked:</p><figure></figure><h3 id="shaker-pint-glass-aka-beer-storage-%E2%80%94-2350"><a href="https://dogfish-seadragon-f2ms.squarespace.com/store/p/shaker-pint-glass?ref=remapradio.com">Shaker pint glass (aka beer storage)</a> — $23.50</h3><blockquote><em>Enjoy your refreshing drinks in this shaker pint glass! It can hold up to 16 oz and will be a durable, high-quality addition to your glassware collection. What’s more, you can even use it as a mixing glass for cocktail evenings.&nbsp;</em></blockquote><figure></figure><h3 id="gaming-mouse-pad-aka-desk-mat-%E2%80%94-3995"><a href="https://dogfish-seadragon-f2ms.squarespace.com/store/p/gaming-mouse-pad?ref=remapradio.com"><strong>Gaming mouse pad (aka desk mat)</strong></a><strong> — </strong>$39.95</h3><blockquote><em>With its large size and quality edge stitching, this gaming mouse pad turns your gaming setup into a professional gaming station ready for Dota, CSGO, and more. Don’t worry about jerky mouse movements ever again, as the under layer features a reliable non-slip surface that keeps the entire mat firmly rooted to your table.</em></blockquote><p>You’ll still be able to buy these after the end of 2024, of course. </p><p>But why not now?</p>
