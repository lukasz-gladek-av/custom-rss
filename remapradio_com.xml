		<p><strong><em>Reminder: Remap meetup at PAX East this weekend! If you're there, we'll be drinking beers in the bar of the Westin hotel attached to the convention center on Saturday afternoon from 3 to 5 pm. Come hang!</em></strong></p><p>We attended PAX East as "Remap" for the first time last year, and while I'm excited to attend, hang out with folks, see my colleagues, etc., I am so glad it's happening under different circumstances this year lol. I flew directly from a week in Disneyland with my family, giving hugs and saying goodbye as they soaked in a final few hours at the pool, while I headed towards Boston. That trip took on this outsized importance because it felt like the culmination of something my wife and I had been building to the entire time we'd been together—a picture perfect trip with the family we'd wanted for the entire time we'd been together. And then I left them! I put my sunglasses on in the cab, while trying to hide my tears from the taxi driver. This year, thankfully, is full of less drama. I'm mostly upset that I cannot bring my PlayStation 5 with to play a few hours of <em>Clair Obscur</em> on the road.</p><p>-pk, who will be testing his PlayStation Portal playing remotely</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><a href="https://remapradio.com/podcasts/episodes/remap-interview-davey-wreden-the-stanley-parable/"><em>Remap Interview (feat: Davey Wreden)</em></a> – This one is a delight!!! I have known Davey for a very long time, stretching back to my earliest days in San Francisco. Davey was a fan of <em>1UP</em>, which means he was following my work before I started following <em>his</em> work. We hadn't spoken in a moment, but in short time, it felt like catching up with an old friend, even if we touch on some sensitive topics. The hour flew by, so I hope you enjoy our conversation.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Hopshot! [Part 2]</em> – That fucking frog is going to hop the fuck up, friends. You'll want to be there when it happens, because I'm going to scream.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Civilization VII</em> – Rob and Cado are nearing the end of their Civilization arc—there are rumblings of playing co-op <em>Myth</em> and returning to motorsports in the near future—before we all descend on PAX East.</li></ul><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYIUfvalJnI?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Is Already a GOTY Candidate"></iframe></figure><ul><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – A string of complications and meetings pushed back our letter series, but you'll see it this week. I'm asking Rob about the early days of playing video games, when you didn't know what you liked, you didn't know <em>how</em> to play games, and the fun was just making it up as you went along.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – This one won't hit in the morning, because we're going to record it <em>at</em> PAX in someone's hotel room. Chia will produce the podcast on Friday. I expect it's show up in your feeds in the afternoon.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
