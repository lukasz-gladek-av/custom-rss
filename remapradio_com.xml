		<p>Send good vibes, friends. My wife is out of town for the next week, which means ol' Patrick is solo parenting until her return. But it does mean my evenings are free once the children are in bed, which will result in an indulgent mixture of beer, shotgunning the third season of <em>Daredevil</em> ahead of the new season, and maybe—just maybe—finally rewatching <em>Interstellar</em>. I've been worried about watching <em>Interstellar</em> because it moved me at the time of release, long before I had kids. I expect to turn into a pile of dust and tears if I'm brave enough to revisit that one.</p><p>-pk, who expects most of his time will be taken by <em>Avowed</em></p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>HOA</em> – We start by sharing a few thoughts on a dearly departed friend, my Costco hot tub, before life updates on paint, contractors, and more.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Onimusha</em> – Barring any fuckin' sliding block puzzles, there's a decent chance we're able to beat this game before the stream is over.
