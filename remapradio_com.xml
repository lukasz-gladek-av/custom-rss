		<p>I have upsetting news. Some months back, I had electrical work done on my office to install ceiling lights. In trying to figure out a problem with the grounding of an outlet, we reset some breakers around the house to diagnose the issue. In doing so, my tiny Costco hot tub was turned off. It does not have a fancy app to tell me it turned off, and so, instead, it just slowly got colder and colder, until the heating pump broke, and simply beeped instead of working. It is now a brick of ice on my patio, waiting for the spring to unthaw it, so I can throw it out. RIP.</p><p>-pk, who is too sad to consider buying another one</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Hotline</em> – Welcome to the first Remap Hotline of 2025!
