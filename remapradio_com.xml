		<p>Release me. <em>Release me</em>. This is what I'm hoping for this week, as Chia joins me for another entry in <em>Hopshot</em>. I was <em>so damn sure</em> we were gonna be done last week, but here I am, staring down the barrel of several more hours of <em>Hopshot</em>. It's a terrific game. I know it will be on my game of the year list. But much like the MRI I went through recently, I want this to be fucking over. The pressure of playing this on a stream, which I try to keep behind a mask, is intense. My hands really do get sweaty and it's not because of the costumes! <em>Release me, game</em>.</p><p>-pk, who is happy to report his MRI scans came back negative!</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>PAX East Interviews</em> – I don't always have time for appointments and interviews at PAX, but that wasn't the case this year! No promises for PAX West, where I usually have my family with me, but that was the case here. It ended up a little horror-coded in a way that was an accident, but I think you'll get something out of these conversations, regardless of jump scare interest.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Hopshot</em> – Can this be the final stream? Who can say. What I can tell you: I have purchased another costume change for this tone. Stay tuned.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Steam Vent</em> – Rob is taking a few days off this week, so Chia and I are headed back into the Steam mines to figure out what's hiding in there.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – Once again, Rob will be out, but I'm glad to announce that former <em>Polygon</em> reporter Nicole Carpenter will be joining us!</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – We whiffed on this last week, sorry. But you'll have one this week, as we head into Memorial Day weekend.</li><li><strong>MEMORIAL DAY: </strong>Speaking off, we're taking Monday off. No premium pod—we're supposed to record our My Turn of <em>Big Fan</em> next week—but I'm going to see if Chia can turn around the other panel I hosted at LudoNarraCon for you.</li><li><strong>YOUTUBE:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@remapradio?ref=remapradio.com">We're now publishing regular segments on our YouTube channel</a>, if that's something that interests you. The idea is to be posting one video per day, with excerpts from our podcast discussions taking up the non-stream days.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
