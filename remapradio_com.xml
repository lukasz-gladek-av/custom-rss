		<p>Here we go again. Yet another run-based tactics game trying to wring the last dregs of novelty from the increasingly exhausted formula of <em>FTL </em>and <em>Into the Breach</em>, functioning like a cut-down version of other strategy and tactics games and using skill trees, loot, and item builds to add complexity to an otherwise simple tactics game.</p><p><em>Master of Command </em>takes this concept to… wait, this game is about Frederick the Great? It's a horse-and-musket real-time tactics game set in the Seven Years' War? You can customise each regiment's uniform and colours?</p><p>Hang on. Forget all that stuff I said before. Let's take this from the top.</p><hr><figure></figure><p>"History says don't hope," wrote poet Seamus Heaney, "But then, once in a lifetime, the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up, and hope and history rhyme." <em>Master of Command</em> arrives on PC to redeem Haney's prophecy, bringing overdue justice to the underrepresented and ignored Seven Years' War.&nbsp;</p><p>Years from now, children not yet born will sharing memes about how they wish they had it as good as people living in 2025, and you'll fruitlessly try to correct them. "I know you think it was all powdered wigs and bearskin mitres but there were some bad things happening in 2025 too, kiddo."</p><p>"There's bad things happening now too," they'll point out sadly. "But at least you had <em>Master of Command</em>."</p><p>Then they'll run off to make a video titled "POV: It's 2025. You make seven figures having AI write emails. You just met the love of your life in the Christopher Duffy section of Barnes and Noble."</p><figure></figure>
