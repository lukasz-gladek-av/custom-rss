		<p>You can tell things have taken a turn for your favorite sports team when you've decided a trip to Home Depot for an hour is a better use of your time. (I had to pick up some dollies to move a couch. I highly recommend buying two flat dollies, man. They're  cheap and <em>very</em> useful for moving things.) And while I'll get into this more on the podcast, I must speak it into existence now: uh,<em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle </em>is<em> good good</em>. It's an immersive sim? A game made with a ton of friction that'll likely piss some people off but enthrall others?</p><p>-pk, who watched the remake of <em>Speak No Evil</em>, and while it's unnecessary, James McAvoy is tremendous and made it worthwhile</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: HOA </strong>– We recorded this one a few weeks ago before "sports" and "bad football" and the "Chicago Bears" took over, but if you want to hear us make an argument for why you should make ridiculous, personalized changes to your house that have nothing to do with adding "value" or "money" to it, have a listen.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Wheel of GeForce NOW</em> – Because we couldn't play with Japanese trains <em>or</em> the major releases last week, we're doing the next installment early. Time for Rob to figure out his main for <em>Path of Exile 2</em>?</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – I think we're talking about social media usage and habits this week, now that I've completely made the transition to Bluesky. </li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>The Game Awards</em> – We do this every year, why not again? I have to watch and put my kids to bed that night, so I might be hopping in and out of the stream, but everyone else will be keeping down the fort. Janet's actually attending in person, I think.</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – Rob is (likely) out again, so we'll see who we can wrangle together as a guest. Stay tuned.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong>The holidays approach, but thankfully, we're going to get another round of <em>Volgarr the Viking </em>in with Nextlander and co. I think there's a chance I might be able to beat the game? I made a ton of progress on the last stream.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
