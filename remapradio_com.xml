		<p>Is it possible to feel better <em>and</em> worse about your favorite sports team at the same time? We're on winning streak and yet I'm not sure if my quarterback knows how to throw the ball. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRt-eMZWmm4&amp;ref=remapradio.com">Surely, nothing could go wrong after having a 4-2 record, right?</a> Also, I realize this is very petty, but I took absolute <em>delight</em> in watching the Brewers get swept by the Dodgers <a href="https://larrybrownsports.com/baseball/brewers-curse-cubs-l-flag-photo-dodgers/722813?ref=remapradio.com">after they were petty to us.</a> The Dodgers repeating might end up in a baseball lockout, but I'll take it for now.</p><p>-pk, whose new 3D printer is mostly printing accessories for dolls</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <a href="https://remapradio.com/podcasts/episodes/remap-hotline-your-dad-will-enjoy-it/"><em>Remap Hotline</em></a> – Gex vs. Salazzle. Robert Redford vs. Will Ferrell. A one-story garage vs. a two-story garage. What does it all mean? Patrick, Rob, and Chia dive into the subscriber question bucket to ponder things like dad movies, typewriters, video game lizards, and much more.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2596804332?ref=remapradio.com"><em>Road to Empress [Part 4]</em></a> – We actually just wrapped this stream up, and the YouTube archive will be up later. Wild, <em>wild </em>stuff happened here.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Steam Next Fest Demos</em> – We'll see if Chia is up for this; it will only be a day after coming back from their overseas trip. And yes, I know that Next Fest is ending today, but we've nabbed a bunch of games to check out anyway.</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – Lineup TBD! Mostly we're waiting to see if Janet is coming back.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – Subject TBD.
