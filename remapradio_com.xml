		<p>There was a moment over the weekend, huddled up in rural Wisconsin, where it became clear we weren't heading home anytime soon. The snow plows had come by once or twice for the streets directly outside our place—and then stopped. I mean, they had better places to be, roads where more people would be traveling. But it also was the strongest signal that maybe we shouldn't rush back and instead spend the day largely indoors. It was delightful, honestly, with my wife and I reading on the couch, college football humming in the background, while my two children spent hours doing holiday crafts with their grandma. Who's got it better than us? I hope your holiday, if you chose to celebrate, was nearly as pleasant as that.</p><p>-pk, who also beat <em>Constance</em> over the holiday break</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Hotline</em> – Do you want to learn about the time that Danika was legitimately struggling with an addiction to a mobile game? </li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Escape Simulator 2</em> – We wanted to head back onto RV There Yet?, but Rob has a scheduling conflict, so instead it'll be me, Danika, and Chia figuring out some puzzles in Dracula's castle. Hopefully, this time Chia isn't coming down with a terrible sickness in the midst of solving said puzzles.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Wheel of GeForce NOW</em> – Wheels await!</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – Full crew, full of games, can't lose. (Well, my brother is expecting a child this week, so I might get pulled temporarily out of commission, depending on when everything goes down. Fingers crossed.)</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – Topic to be determined, as always. I presume we will not be talking about Buffalo again, though, as much as I might like to.</li><li><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a></li></ul>
