		<p>A strange dynamic lately, where I'm still spending many hours in my evenings plucking away at video games, even though the podcasts I'm recording where I'm talking <em>about</em> video games will <em>not</em> include my thoughts on those games. Now, to be fair, several games I'm playing are straight up under embargo, so I can't chat about them <em>anyway</em>, but I'm thinking we might have to sneak in a bonus "what we've been playing" episode before our game of the year stuff wraps up. We'll see. Depends on how much progress we do/don't make on this week's podcast. Hope you're enjoying them!</p><p>-pk, who is also setting up a bunch of future interview pods, too</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>A schedule for the next week of Remap.</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>HOA</em> – Rob has inherited a home full of inscrutable cable runs, a haunted DIY home-network environment, and venomous predators. His NAS isn’t speaking to his Roon client, and the whole thing is being powered by ISP-issued routers. In his darkest hour he turns to Brad Shoemaker and Will Smith of <em>Brad and Will Made a Tech Pod</em> for advice on fixing a home networking nightmare versus adapting to the nightmare, the right tools for the diagnostic jobs that lie ahead, and what should form the backbone of a modern smart home. Will also hard-sells Ubiquiti equipment, while Rob soft-pedals the Roon Nucleus.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>RV There Yet?</em> – Look, at least we made it past a single goddamn checkpoint in the last stream. What more do you want from us??</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Motorsport Manager</em> – I have no idea where Rob and Chia are at in their journey at the moment, but hey, why is that <em>F1</em> movie nearly three hours?</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – The game of the year podcasts continue, as we move into the upper half of everyone's lists, starting with number five.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – Fuck ICE, and fuck having to explain to my nine-year-old why there's a video of a guy getting shot on the house television.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a></p>
