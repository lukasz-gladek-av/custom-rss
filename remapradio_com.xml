		<p>Brother, I am exhausted. Apologies this is late. I'm writing this on the floor of LAX, crossing my fingers the slight delay on my flight does not become a big delay. (I think it'll be OK.) I'm glad I made time for half of Summer Game Fest, despite a family wedding overlapping, and you'll hear about what I played, saw, and, uh, <em>experienced</em> while in Los Angeles. It was, of course, ominous to get a push notification saying "Trump has sent in the National Guard to Los Angeles" when my flight was landing in Los Angeles. It only became more distressing when the protests themselves were being felt—and having consequences on—Summer Game Fest itself. And that's all without talking about how some dipshits shot me with a paintball gun while I walked home to my hotel. (It was very scary and my arm started bleeding but I'm alright.)</p><p>-pk, who will try to unwind on his flight with the new <em>Predator</em> film</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>The upcoming schedule for Remap</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Steam Next Fest</em> – Sad to be missing this, but I'll be downloading a whole bunch of demos to check out this week, I'm sure. Cado and Janet will hold this down. One strange part of Summer Game Fest was finishing a demo and being told "if you want to play more, our demo's on Summer Game Fest!"</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Wheel of GeForce NOW</em> – You know the deal.</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio </em>– Our big SGF reaction/decompression episode, including the many games that Janet and I saw and played at the event. There is probably enough that we'll also be doing about SGF stuff next week, too.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:<em> </em><em>Letter Series</em></strong> – I want to come up with a better prompt than "well, I got shot with a paintball gun at SGF" but I'm not sure I'll have a better one.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
