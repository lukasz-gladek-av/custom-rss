		<p>It's game of the year week! When Rob and I were reflecting on last year's game of the year pods, we had two thoughts. One, we really enjoyed the round robin format, where we only meaningfully discuss a video game when we've reached its status at the top of someone's top ten list. It prevented the issue I've encountered on other game of the year discussions, where you say everything there is to say before, inevitably, the game in question is someone's favorite from the year. Two, we both ended up playing games over the break that would've ended up in our game of the year list, but because we recorded in December, they weren't part of it. So this year, we decided to punt the discussions until January, and given how my list is shaping up, it was a very good decision to keep the conversation until then.</p><p>-pk, who is curious about this buzzy new game, <em>The Roottrees Are Dead</em></p><hr><figure></figure><p><em>Attention: We're recording a new Remap Hotline. Send questions to </em><a href="mailto:questions@remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>questions@remapradio.com</em></a><em> with the subject "SUBSCRIBER&nbsp;QUESTION." (The questions for Remap Radio are in their own special bucket.)</em></p><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>HOA</em> – This is the podcast that Rob and I were recording when we took our Sports! detour. Since we last recorded, I've had a front door installed at great cost, Rob's gotten himself into a paint pickle, and we both encounter revelations about poor decisions made by previous owners of our places.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Motorports Manager</em> – Rob and Cado return to...wait, where did we leave off? I'm sure it was somewhere good. Those two are always winning.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Remap Recommends </em>– The holidays are a great time to spend time with stuff you've been meaning to listen to, watch, or read. We're just like you!</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – Game of the year begins. One of two podcasts. (If they reveal the Switch 2 this week, we'll make sure to have some commentary.)</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – Maybe I'll be less sad when starting this one.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Volgarr the Viking (feat: Nextlander)</em> – Is this the finale?
