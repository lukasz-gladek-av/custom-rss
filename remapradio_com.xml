		<p>About halfway through yesterday afternoon, my usual Sunday ritual of having a few beers while watching the Chicago Bears implode was mixing with the conclusion of three days in front of a camera raising money for charity: sleepy Patrick. Heck, after I dropped my kids off at school, I poured out the cup of coffee I had in my hand and, instead, went to bed. I'm trying to ignore the mild headache that's bouncing around my skull, which, right now, I'm attributing to sleep debt. </p><p>But briefly: thank you. We've been hesitant to bring back Save Point for a number of reasons, but the stars aligned this weekend and, for a brief moment, it felt like the old days. That we've been able to keep that fire burning bright within this new era is special, and that translated into raising a ridiculous amount of money for a good cause. My great thanks to everyone who watched, donated, and supported us.</p><p>-pk, who is absolutely loving the new season of <em>Arcane</em> so far</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>HOA</em> – I'm rebooting my home office, and brought in the full crew to talk through what we should do with the tiny white room I call my office. We'll be doing a stream soon, where we use some fancy software to try and build the office in real-time, so that I can start buying the equipment for it.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends</em> <em>— </em>The response to the first one was so great that we're doubling up on the idea. In the middle of the month, though, we'll be opening the field to whatever we're watching/reading/listening to. Video game recommendations will still come at the end of the month. And yes, I know people have asked for a podcast version of this article. I'm thinking about it.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Wheel of GeForce Now</em> – It's back, baby!</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – We'll  debrief on Save Point a bit, but I've also gained access to a PlayStation 5 Pro. Here are brief impressions from setting it up in my family room: well, it looks smaller. (I haven't played anything.)</li><li><strong>ARCHIVE:</strong> Cado will soon split up the Save Point segments into individual video archives, but in the meantime, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTbM52Fro5pvPGsc59Ex56h8GQWb4AOBL&amp;ref=remapradio.com">we do have first two full days up, complete with timestamps</a>. We learned over the course of this stream that YouTube has a hard cap of 12 hours, which means we're making a part one/part two of the third day. It'll be available sometime in the next 24 hours, worst case scenario.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
