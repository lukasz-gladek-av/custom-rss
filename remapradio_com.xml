		<p>The last things you want to hear from one of your friends and colleagues is "hey, I'm in the ER." This happened to <em>me</em> a few weeks back when my five-year-old broke her arm—which, thank <em>god</em>, we're nearly over with—and then today, as Rob informed Chia and I that he had, quoting a Discord message, "tripped on a fucking ottoman." Simultaneously, Chia said they had<em> sun sickness.</em> (It's been extremely hot in many places over the past few weeks.) So, we're a little battered and bruised at <em>Remap</em> this week. So, look: thanks for the patience.</p><p>-pk, who is trying to decide whether to take his kids to <em>Superman</em> this weekend, a movie they claim they want to see but may be too scary</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Hotline</em> – I had to sit this one out, because a weekend family reunion in Minnesota became a friend reunion in Wisconsin, which also lead into...well, it was a lot. I had a good time, but I also really enjoy these question bucket episodes, so my thanks to Rob and Chia for holding it down.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Peak</em> – This was supposed to be Chia, Janet, and I, but now it's going to be me playing <em>and</em> producing, so wish me luck. The setup looks right, but I won't know for sure until we're hitting the big red button, you know?</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends</em> – This will probably just be me and Rob this week, as Chia continues to recover. </li><li><strong>STREAM</strong>: <em>TBD</em> – This kinda depends on how everyone feels in the next 24 hours lol</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – We missed the Xbox news. Time to dive in. I might have to track down a breakfast burrito before we record, though.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series </em>– Often, these prompts are driven by what Rob and I are talking bout privately. In this case, we were talking about the fanciful delight of a 2nd bed, aka the bed you go to when you're having a bad night sleeping and don't want to disturb your partner. Suddenly, we had a prompt.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
