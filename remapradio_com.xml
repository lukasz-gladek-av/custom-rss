		<p>My children do this funny thing now where they know that I root for the Bears, so they troll me by rooting for the other team. Given that I'm someone who used to walk into bars and dump $20 into the jukebox to play things like the long end credits music to <em>E.T. </em>or a purposely bad keyboard rendition of <em>The X-Files </em>theme, it feels thematically appropriate. But it didn't mean anything until the final minutes, when the Bears finally did what the Bears have been doing a lot lately, which is convince you that they have a chance, then step all over your heart. Fortunately, I have a podcast to work out my feelings.</p><p>-pk, who, despite it all, thinks Caleb Williams looks great</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Sports!</em> – You asked of for it, so it's happening. Our hearts are broken (again), and the only way to understand it all is to speak into a microphone. Also, there are a lot of really fuckin' good teams this year. How about that Josh Allen?</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends, Volume III </em>—<em> </em>This time, we're back to games. Over the holiday, I played all sorts of weird ones, including finishing <em>Arco</em>, starting and finishing <em>1000xResist</em>, starting and finishing <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, and then finally in the wee hours of Sunday, as I should've been sleeping, starting <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em> – How much longer can Cado and Rob survive the wastes?</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Wheel of GeForce NOW</em> – You know the drill.</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – Because Rob has some construction going on at his place, making recording a challenge this week, we should have an excellent guest hopping on with us. I don't want to jinx it, but it's a familiar face.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series </em>– You can tell Rob is on one when I suddenly get sent a shared document with several hundred words about football camera angles. I wouldn't have it any other way.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
