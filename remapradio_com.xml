		<p><a href="https://remapradio.com/articles/the-future-of-these-game-developers-rests-on-a-visa-application/">Look, ma, I published an article</a>! I've been feeling the itch to spend more time reporting for <em>Remap</em>, but I've been struggling to figure out how to accomplish it, what the scope of those pieces are, etc. Am I trying to be timely? Am I being indulgent? I don't know. Questions for another time. What I want to do is publish, because much like the exercise and reading habits I talked about in the last subscriber-only weekend newsletter, when I do not publish a story that I have written, I feel weird. Empty, even. And writing blogs or introspective pieces does not scratch the same itch. Reporting is in my bones, and I'm happy to be doing more that doesn't exclusively end up being about the (important!) state of Roblox parental controls.</p><p>-pk, who today interviewed Edmund McMillen for a story/podcast</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <a href="https://remapradio.com/podcasts/episodes/can-a-podcast-help-a-visa-application/"><em>Can a Podcast Help a Visa Application?</em></a> – In January, Patrick was contacted by a developer with a unique request. They were applying for a Visa application that would have a better chance of approval if there were articles (or podcasts) about their work. Patrick hopped on a call with designers Luke Li and Cindy Fan of BROKENCIGS to talk about their journey from China to the US, why they’re taking a unique route to try and stay here, and why New York spoke to them.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><a href="https://remapradio.com/articles/the-future-of-these-game-developers-rests-on-a-visa-application/"><em>The Future of These Game Developers Rests on a Visa Application</em></a> – A small indie group from New York, a mixture of creatives from China and the United States, need the U.S. government to believe they should stay here.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Baby Steps </em>– One more step. ONE MORE STEP. Please, though, do not put me into first-person as a "cute reward" for doing something really hard.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>The Sims</em> – Danika, Chia, and Janet are going to click "play" on a stream in which they all play The Sims. I cannot be held responsible for what happens next. (We'll get back to <em>RV There Yet?</em> again, but Rob has some extra tax-related business that's keeping a little busier than usual this week.)</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio </em>– Hell or high water, we're finishing game of the year this week. Please do not make me eat these famous least words!!!! (Plus, 2026 is already off to a strong start; there are cool video games to talk about.)</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> – Topic TBD.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a></p>
