		<p>It's, uh, <em>hot</em> out. Hot enough that one shouldn't be outside. Hot enough that we're not streaming on Tuesday because Rob's afraid he would begin to melt. I kept telling my children they needed to hustle out the door this morning a few minutes earlier than usual, because every second that passed was a chance for the temperature to rise before I had a chance to mow the lawn. (It was still hot, but mustering all my fatherly energy, I got the job done. ðŸ’ª) I also installed the father's gift I got a few weeks back: <a href="https://poolhacker.com/products/poolside-bar-for-aboveground-pool?ref=remapradio.com">a poolside bar attachment for our above ground pool</a>. I'm going to put it to good use almost immediately, folks. But if I enter that pool in 100-degree weather, I might not leave it, either.</p><p>-pk, who's now browsing all sorts of other goofy pool accessories</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>SGF Interviews [Part 2]</em> â€“ At the end of the day, reporting is what makes me enjoy this job the most. It's one of those things I need to figure out with <em>Remap</em>'s future: how can I find ways to fuse this with <em>Remap</em>'s day-to-day more often? The bandwidth to do long articles isn't really there, but I'd like to find a format that's beyond me chatting with developers at the few events that I make it to every year. I've long kicked around doing a more timely interview-y show that was focused on a topic, i.e. an hour podcast talking with a Monster Hunter expert when <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> comes out. (That idea came to mind because of <em>Death Stranding 2</em> reviews hitting. How do we cover, or find our way into, games we're not all playing? We know lots of people.)</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>FGC: Firebreak</em> â€“ We're skipping a Tuesday stream because of the heat wave that's moving through the Midwest and East Coast. My house can manage those temperatures pretty well but that's not the case in Rob's spot, which turns into a sauna. Playing a Remedy game in a literal sauna would be kinda funny, but we'd also like Rob to still be with us after the stream was over.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Wheel of GeForce NOW</em> â€“ I think this is our last one in this batch? I'm not sure how much I'll be around for this one, because I'm prepping for a long drive for a family reunion that day. I'll try to pop my head in, though.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> â€“ I've had a pretty good idea where these were going the last few weeks, but that's just not true this week. In this essay, I will tell you what it's like to melt in the heat.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio </em>â€“ Been really enjoying our podcasts lately, feels like we've been in a real groove. Hope you've been enjoying them, too. (There's a chance I'm missing next week, which would be funny, because it's the 100th episode of the podcast. I also missed the <em>first</em> episode while attending SGF. Alas!)</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
