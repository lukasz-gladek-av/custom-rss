		<p>I had a moment last night where it became clear that without intervention, I would not stop playing <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. This intervention came in the form of imagining the personal shaming that would be directed my way if I did not beat <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>before leaving for Europe, as I'd promised Janet. The zingers she would send me way if I broke that covenant? I dread it. So I put down a game I was <em>reallyreally </em>enjoying and started another game I am <em>reallyreally </em>enjoying. That said, the endgame of <em>Clair Obscur</em> is a mess, something I hope to get deeper into during a spoiler podcast that we'll record when I return from that trip. BTW, Rob is on the mend but doing better and should be present in some stuff this week. Send him all the vibes!</p><p>-pk, who will likely play a lot of <em>Bananza</em> on his flight to London</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Interview: Mystical</em> – Well, this was a delight. When we logged on for the interview, it became clear it would be deeply silly of me to not conduct the interview in my own frog costume. It's not quite a Vtuber setup, but it as pretty close. You don't have to care about <em>Hopshot</em>, btw, to enjoy this interview. We do talk a fair bit about the platformer, but it's a broader convo.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Rematch</em> – Me, Janet, and Cado are going to head onto "the pitch" and try to "win." I'm sure it'll turn out fine.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>TBD</em> – Rob wants to do a stream, but we're going to put in on the schedule for Friday to provide maximum flexibility and rest to make it happen.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – [Two hours of Patrick trying to tell everyone how interesting <em>Bananza</em> is, but how it gives him great concern about how far Nintendo, as a company, has distanced itself from traditional platformers]</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> – Topic TBD!</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a></p>
