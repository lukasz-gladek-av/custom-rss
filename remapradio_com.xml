		<p>So we'll have more formal details on this ASAP, but the short version is that we're going to be getting together in person in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=872_7q9tqxw&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">New York City</a> next week for another in-person stream. Nearly three full days of streaming across Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. And all for a good cause, because we're bringing back Save Point. It's going to be a lot of fun, a lot of things are coming together last minute, but as soon as a few of those things work out, I promise we'll have more concrete info. </p><p>-pk, who scheduled his flight back home just in time for football</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Interview (Home Depot's Skeleton Daddy)</em> – Well, this is it. The big time. I'm so glad I managed to get this interview before I turn 40 next year, because it means I haven't wasted the last four decades. I haven't been able to record as many interviews as I would've liked in recent months, but look, sometimes you make up for all of it in one go. Hope you enjoy this!</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Space Marine 2</em> – We'll probably play a few hours of<em> Space Marine 2 </em>at the live show, too, but we're going to dip our toes back into our favorite co-op game that we love to complain about at the end because of the gear grind.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommend</em>s – OK, I'm excited about this one. The idea of a "staff picks" article came up some weeks back and it hasn't left my head, so we're going to pilot a new regular series where, every month, we recommend a game that's lingered in our minds and hearts as the month ends. (Yes, I still want to do a proper Steam Curator thing, too. Stay tuned.) I think there's a possibility we do one that involves what we're watching/listening/reading, too.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Horror Games</em> – We're still figuring out the <em>what</em> part of this stream, but basically Rob, Patrick, and Cado are gonna get together and get a lil' spooky. Because of my family Halloween obligations, I won't have time to do another nighttime horror stream, but I promise we'll get back to that again.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio </em>– Janet has finished the new<em> Life Is Strange,</em> and according to the review she wrote, uh, it does not finish well. Welp. No thoughts on the new <em>Dragon Age</em> just yet, but I'm going to start it this week.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Rob &amp; Patrick's Letter Series </em>– Still figuring out the topic for this one, because we tend to write it as the week goes on, but we'll have somethin'.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
