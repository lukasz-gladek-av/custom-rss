		<p>The first week of June is a big week for <em>Remap</em>, between quietly hoping that everyone wants us to keep doing this, while also preparing to head to Los Angeles for several long days and nights. I'm doing my best to avoid thinking about attending a wedding on Saturday, one likely to end late at night, before waking up ass early to catch a flight to Los Angeles. I can't even check into my hotel by the time I land, but will have to immediately scoot over for an appointment. SGF is always an odd event, because it's not always clear how many interviews I can book, but I'm sure I'll come away with something for y'all. And I know I do this sappy thing every year, but thank you for supporting us and getting us this far. I hope it's just one of many anniversaries to come.</p><p>-pk, who recommends that you double check your <em>Remap</em> membership to make sure the correct credit card is being charged</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>HOA</em> – I learned about Rob buying a house the same way you learned about Rob buying a house: live on last week's Remap Radio. But I get it. Buying a house is often full of disappointments, especially these days, because there are a million reasons for it to fall apart. Even Rob is hardly over the finish line here. Literally as I'm typing this he's at an inspection for the house. That stuff is scary!</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Remap's 2nd Anniversary</em> – Come join as we spend a day streaming  to celebrate making this adventure last two years! It feels like just yesterday that I learned I'd accidentally been laid off because an executive misread an organizational chart, but here we are, folks. We'll start in the morning and go until sometime late in the afternoon/early evening.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> – One of the first lines in Rob's opening to me this week is "let’s see how far we get in this before this turns out to be about aging or the Chicago Bears."</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – I'm heading to a all-encompassing family wedding this weekend, before heading to Los Angeles for a few days to cover Summer Game Fest, but we'll be together for Remap Radio before all that.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Summer Game Fest</em> – I'll be attending wedding festivities when this is all happening. (If I'm lucky enough to have a spare moment, I'll pop in!) But you can expect Rob and Chia, at least, to hold things down for Keighley's event.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
