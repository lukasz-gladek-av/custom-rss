		<p>Goodbye, football! You were wonderful to me this year. I'd also like to congratulate my nine-year-old for once again calling the coin flip in the Super Bowl again—she's on a three-year streak at the moment. We put $50 on the coin flip every year, with me joking about how it'll pay for her college. The funny part is a week ago, we set her up with a debit card, after a trip to the mall resulted in two stores that would not let her pay with cash. The app lets us reward her with money for doing chores—and we no longer have to stress about where she put her wallet. Anyway, when she won the coin toss, she turned to me and said: "hey, how much of that do <em>I </em>get?" </p><p>I promptly opened my phone and sent her $25. Damn shark!</p><p>-pk, who mostly found the Super Bowl pretty boring </p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Content!
