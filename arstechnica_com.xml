<p>In the descriptions for those videos, though, Coincident acknowledged some of the reasons that Okuplok's level has been "deemed impossible to beat in one segment" on Ultra Violence difficulty. Even if you have a perfect strategy mapped out for each segment, "some of the later fights are a pure RNG grind," he wrote. "Losing multiple 5-hour-long [Ultra Violence] runs over and over again that late into the map would drive me insane."</p>

      Coincident's strategy videos for the slaughter map highlight just how tough even the "easy" sections are to complete.

<p>The slaughter level's "wildly varying levels of difficulty between each fight" are "extremely frustrating as a challenge, especially when you die to a difficult fight, after having cleared several easy (and borderline boring) fights for 3 hours," Coincident continued in another video description. "Some consider that the only reason why no one has single-segmented Okuplok on UV yet is because no one even wants to try. I wouldn't be surprised."</p>
<h2>“It’s over!”</h2>
<p>Nonetheless, over the weekend, Coincident proved he was willing to try what he once considered an "impossible" task. His grueling, six-hour-long marathon isn't actually that fun to watch at many points. The occasional moments of intense, close-quarters combat are punctuated by long segments where Coincident circle-strafes endlessly around large hordes, waiting for enemies to hurt each other with incidental damage so he can conserve ammunition. He also kills many <a href="https://gamicus.fandom.com/wiki/Kiting">kited enemies</a> one by one in corridors or through small gaps to keep things as safe as possible.</p>
<p>Even if you're not willing to sit through six hours of that kind of meticulous gameplay, it can be thrilling to jump around the stream and revel in the portions where Coincident shows off some extremely precise, near-perfect dodging through arenas filled with projectiles and floors littered with pixelated corpses. The drama gets especially intense near the end, when Coincident's breathing becomes noticeably heavy before finishing the run with a flashy rocket to the face just as he hits the exit panel.</p>
<p>"Yes! Fuck yes!" Coincident exclaims after the run is finally over. "Okuplok is done! Done, done, done, done, done! ... Oh my god, what a ride, this was quite the ride... It's done, I don't have to run this again! It's over!"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[You can play the Unreal-powered The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster today]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-can-play-the-unreal-powered-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-today.1170456/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/you-can-play-the-unreal-powered-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-today/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>That said, Virtuos has also made changes on that front. Most notably, today's announcement revealed that the remaster will have a completely overhauled leveling system, which is described as combining elements from <em>Oblivion</em> and <em>Skyrim</em>.</p>
<p>That will be welcome news for many players. In many ways, <em>Oblivion</em> feels like a modern game, but its leveling system—which incentivizes players to delay leveling up to grind certain skills—was controversial even when it launched. It's not completely clear what the new one will look like, but this is likely a case where most fans will consider any change a good one.</p>
<p>Other aspects of the game that are a bit odd and anachronistic are still in place, though, like the persuasion system for conversations with NPCs. Oblivion's appeal is largely about its jazzy gameplay systems, so the team likely didn't want to compromise that too much. Lockpicking is the same as before, too.</p>
<p>On the presentation side, Virtuos has added a much more robust lighting system than before, and the game looks hyper-detailed. NPC faces and talking animations have been overhauled for the better, but there are still some wacky-looking people. (Would we really have it any other way?)</p>


<p>All told, the stream made it look like we're getting a promising new coat of paint on a game that made an enormous impact when it first arrived in 2006 but which was overshadowed by <em>Skyrim</em> a few years later.</p>
<p><em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em> is still in development, and <em>Skyrim</em> was much closer in time to Oblivion than it is to today. So apart from <em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>, fans of the franchise have been experiencing a historic drought.</p>
<p>A remaster certainly isn't the same as a new game, but if Bethesda and Virtuos pulled it off, this release is sure to be popular.</p>
<p>The game is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2623190/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Remastered/">PC (Steam)</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S for $50 today. It’s also on Game Pass.</p>
