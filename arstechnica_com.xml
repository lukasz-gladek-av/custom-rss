<p>It's once again that special time of year when we give you a chance to do well by doing good. That's right—it's time for the 2024 edition of our annual Charity Drive!</p>
<p>Every year <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/11/the-opposable-thumbs-childs-play-giveaway-you-donate-we-give-you-stuff/">since 2007</a>, we've encouraged readers to give to <a href="https://childsplaycharity.org/">Penny Arcade's Child's Play charity</a>, which provides toys and games to kids being treated in hospitals around the world. In recent years, we've added&nbsp;the <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> to our charity push, aiding in their efforts to defend Internet freedom. This year, as always, we're providing some extra incentive for those donations by offering donors a chance to win pieces of our big pile of vendor-provided swag. We can't keep it, and we don't want it clogging up our offices, so it's now yours to win.</p>
<p>This year's swag pile is full of high-value geek goodies. <strong>We have dozens of prizes valued at over $4,000 total</strong>, including gaming hardware and collectibles, computer accessories, apparel, and more. In 2023, Ars readers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/ars-readers-gave-nearly-40000-in-our-2023-charity-drive/">raised nearly $40,000 for charity</a>, contributing to a total haul of <strong>more than $506,000 since 2007.</strong> We want to raise even more this year, and we can do it if readers dig deep.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Donating is easy. Simply <a href="https://childsplay.salsalabs.org/Donate/index.html">donate to Child's Play</a> using a credit card or PayPal or <a href="http://eff.org/AT2014">donate to the EFF</a> using PayPal, credit card, or cryptocurrency. You can also support Child's Play directly by using <a href="https://my.onecause.com/fundraiser/organizations/8534d777-53ce-4d94-a537-c8e0cbb7acb0/fundraisers/fundraiser:ae0c129c-94ac-4e63-a265-20b71ac4bd03">this Ars Technica campaign page</a> or picking an item from the Amazon wish list of a specific hospital on <a href="https://childsplaycharity.org/get-involved#hospital-map">its donation page</a>. Donate as much or as little as you feel comfortable with—every little bit helps.</p>
