<p>GT Sophy can now race at 19 tracks, up from the nine <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/almost-unbeatable-ai-is-now-a-permanent-feature-of-gran-turismo-7/">that were introduced</a> in November 2023. The AI agent is an alternative to the regular, dumber AI in the game's quick race mode, with easy, medium, and hard settings. But now, at those same tracks, you can also create custom races using GT Sophy, meaning you're no longer limited to just two or three laps. You can enable things like damage, fuel consumption and tire wear, and penalties, and you can have some control over the cars you race against.</p>


<p>Unlike the time-limited demo, the hardest setting is no longer alien-beating. As a <em>GT7</em> player, I'm slowing with age, and I find the hard setting to be that—hard, but beatable. (I suspect but need to confirm that the game tailors the hardest setting to your ability based on your results, as, when I create a custom race on hard, only seven of the nine progress bars are filled, and in the screenshot above, only five bars are filled.)</p>
<p>Having realistic competition has always been one of the tougher challenges for a racing game, and one that the <em>GT</em> franchise was never particularly great at during previous console generations. This latest version of GT Sophy does feel different to race against: The AI is opportunistic and aggressive but also provokable into mistakes. If only the developer would add it to more versions of the in-game Nürburgring.</p>
