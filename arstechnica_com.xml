          <p>Last month saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki1RQF0-jyk">the release of Project Misriah</a>, an ambitious modding project that tried to re-create the feel of <em>Halo 3</em> inside Valve’s <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>. That project has now been taken down from the Steam Workshop, though, after drawing a <span id="_b3hAae3XHNOj0PEPoYS8uA4_97">Digital Millennium Copyright Act </span>complaint from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Modder Froddoyo <a href="https://x.com/Froddoyo/status/1990243094311424022">introduced Project Misriah on November 16</a> as “a workshop collection of <em>Halo</em> ported maps and assets that aims to bring a <em>Halo 3</em> multiplayer-like experience to <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>.” Far from just being inspired by <em>Halo 3</em>, the mod directly copied multiple sound effects, character models, maps, and even movement mechanics from Bungie and Microsoft’s popular series.</p>
<p>In the weeks since, Project Misriah has drawn a lot of praise from both <em>Halo</em> fans and those impressed by what modders could pull off with the Source 2 engine. But last Wednesday, modder Froddoyo <a href="https://x.com/Froddoyo/status/1998833996395053070">shared a DMCA request from Microsoft</a> citing the “unauthorized use of <em>Halo</em> game content in a [Steam] workshop not associated with <em>Halo</em> games.”</p>

<p>In a social media post sharing that DMCA text, Froddoyo ruefully said that players should “make sure to give your thanks to Microsoft” for the project’s fate. But in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki1RQF0-jyk&amp;lc=UgyYC9fQkPIh-iWt6454AaABAg">a comment on Project Misriah’s YouTube trailer</a>, Froddoyo noted that, following the takedown, the project “will not be worked on or uploaded in the future. But hey, it was fun while it lasted. Thank you to all of the players and supporters of [the] project. We will use the knowledge and skills obtained from this to cook up something else!”</p>
