          <p>When Nintendo took the wraps off the Switch 2 in early April, it announced that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/some-original-switch-games-will-run-better-on-switch-2-some-wont-run-at-all/">around a dozen first-party Switch games</a> would be getting free updates that would add some Switch 2-specific benefits to older games running on the new console. We could safely assume that these updates wouldn't be as extensive as the $10 and $20 paid upgrade packs for games like&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild</em> or&nbsp;<em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>, but Nintendo's page didn't initially provide any game-specific details.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/">updated its support page</a> with more game-by-game details about what players of these older games can expect on the new hardware. The baseline improvement for most games is "improved image quality" and optimizations for the Switch 2's built-in display, but others include support for GameShare multiplayer, support for the new Joy-Cons' mouse controls, support for HDR TVs, and other tweaks.</p>
<p>The most significant of the announced updates are frame rate improvements for&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>, the main-series <em>Pokémon</em> games released in late 2022. Most latter-day Switch games suffered from frame rate dips here and there, as newer games outstripped the capabilities of a low-power tablet processor that had already been a couple of years old when the Switch launched in 2017. But the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> performance problems were so pervasive and widely commented-upon that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/nintendo-is-working-on-improvements-to-latest-pokemon-games-after-buggy-launch/">Nintendo released a rare apology</a> promising to improve the game post-release. Subsequent patches helped somewhat but could never deliver a consistently smooth frame rate; perhaps new hardware will finally deliver what software patches couldn't.</p>
