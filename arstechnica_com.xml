<h2>What now?</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2383614433">a follow-up stream on Monday</a>, Nico called his latest gaming achievement "by far the most difficult run I have ever completed. We did the same run leveled, but it is not even close to as difficult as the level 1 run. The level 1 run, the difficulty level is just insane."</p>
<p>Aside from being an incredible individual achievement, Nico's level 1 God Run helps put FromSoft's reputation for difficulty into perspective. While these games can punish failure very harshlyâ€”and require lots of arcane knowledge to play wellâ€”Nico shows that they're also designed to be fair to players with the steely nerves to attack and dodge with perfect timing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">After almost 2 years of attempts!<br>
IT'S FINALLY DONE!<br>
7 Games, 0 Hits, Character Level 1!</p>
<p>WE DID IT!</p>
<p>Here is the last fight! (and sorry that it is cinder again) ðŸ˜…<a href="https://t.co/0g24MY4wRy">https://t.co/0g24MY4wRy</a></p>
<p>â€” Nico (@dinossindgeil) <a href="https://twitter.com/dinossindgeil/status/1891230190291788237?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With his ultimate FromSoft achievement now complete, Nico said he's "going to take a vacation now. And by vacation, I mean I'll continue doing hitless runs, I will continue being live every day... but we're going to do some smaller ones for now." In the longer term, Nico hinted that he is "going to work on one really big project again," but wasn't willing to provide details just yet.</p>
<p>If you want to follow in Nico's hitless FromSoft footsteps, he puts out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svsAMPM9Pzc">instructional videos</a> laying out the specific paths and strategies needed to get through specific games (Pro tip: It involves a lot of well-timed rolling and memorizing attack and stagger patterns). Nico also took the time to recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzQ2o0pejVQ">rank how hard he finds each game in the God Run</a>, putting <em>Elden Ring</em> in the easiest tier and <em>Dark Souls II</em> in the hardest.</p>
