<p><strong>AI learning was used for <em>2024</em>'s world mapping</strong>. It allowed for a (possibly hyperbolic) "4,000 times more" detail in textures and terrain meshes, Wloch told TechRadar. Players will see this mainly when they're closer to ground, with the terrain generating detail on demand. Machine learning is run against tens of thousands of tiles of Earth terrains, and it does picture analysis to generate, say, wet gravel or nighttime grasslands during winter. Data generated from a player is streamed into other pilots' games, Neumann told Rock Paper Shotgun.</p>

<p><strong>You can fly a balloon and a "Flydoo,"</strong> <strong>the latter of which is a balloon with a tiny engine.</strong> Aircraft and airports you customized or purchased are carried over from <em>2020</em> into <em>2024</em>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-planes-helicopters-aircraft-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">EuroGamer has a list of every aircraft in the game</a>, which includes <a href="https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/fly-joby-aircraft-new-release-microsoft-flight-simulator/">a Joby VTOL air taxi</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A new Career</strong> <strong>Mode</strong>, <strong>with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/15/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-creating-career-mode-for-all-players/">26 different paths</a>, adds some structure to the pre-existing challenges and rewards.</strong> You can start out as a rookie and work through up to 54 training courses. You then decide exactly what kind of ace you want to be. You can be a regional airline pilot, a global specialist in VIP helicopter rides, a cropduster, a firefighter, or some other kind. You can own a fleet and expand your business or stick to being a jockey for hire.</p>
<p><strong>There are many animals with realistic behavior, ported in from <em>Planet Zoo</em>.&nbsp;</strong>Neumann previously worked at Frontier, the company behind <em>Planet Zoo</em> (and&nbsp;<em>Elite: Dangerous</em>). Wanting some of that old "animals doing things" energy, Neumann said he called Frontier's CEO and said, "Can I have your animals?" <a href="https://www.si.com/videogames/features/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-animals">Neumann told Sports Illustrated</a>. So now sheep head inside when it's raining, birds migrate, and elephants will finally be impressed with your low-level flybys—maybe.</p>
<p><em><strong>Flight Simulator</strong></em><strong><em> 2020</em> will continue to get support, according to <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-faq/">a FAQ on the developer's site</a>.</strong> It's a valid question of what "support" will look like after <em>2024</em> is released and if it matches up with the initial promise of "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-continue-to-support-flight-simulator-2020-after-launch-of-2024-sequel">10 years of support</a>."</p>
