          <p>Spotify has lost all enthusiasm for the little music devices it sold for just half a year. Firmware hackers, as usually happens, have a lot more interest and have stepped in to save, and upgrade, a potentially useful gadget.</p>
<p>Spotify's idea a couple years ago was a car-focused device for those who lacked Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, or built-in Spotify support in their vehicles, or just wanted a dedicated Spotify screen. The <a href="https://carthing.spotify.com/">Car Thing</a> was a $100 doodad with a 4-inch touchscreen and knob that attached to the dashboard (or into a CD slot drive). All it could do was play Spotify, and only if you were a paying member, but that could be an upgrade for owners of older cars, or people who wanted a little desktop music controller.</p>
<p>But less than half a year after it fully released its first hardware device, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/pleas-for-open-sourcing-refunds-as-spotify-plans-to-brick-car-thing-devices/">Spotify gave up on the Car Thing</a>&nbsp;due to "several factors, including product demand and supply chain issues." A Spotify rep told Ars that the Car Thing was meant "to learn more about how people listen in the car," and now it was "time to say goodbye to the devices entirely." Spotify indicated&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/spotify-wont-open-source-car-thing-but-starts-refund-process/">it would offer refunds</a>, though not guaranteed, and moved forward with plans to brick the device in December 2024.</p>
<h2>It was always open source, just not publicly</h2>
<p>Enter Dammit Jeff, a YouTuber who dove into his device and shows off some alternative software ideas for it (as we first saw <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/11/12/what-to-do-with-the-spotify-car-thing/">on Adafruit's blog</a>). He even likes the little thing, noting that its wheel feels great, and that the four buttons on the top—originally meant for favorite playlists—present a lot of possibilities.</p>
