<p>AMD didn't provide much by way of performance comparisons, but it's promising that the cards have the same number of compute units as AMD's last-generation RX 7600 series. AMD says that RDNA 4 compute units are much faster than those used for RDNA 3, particularly in games with ray-tracing effects enabled. This helped make the Radeon RX 9070 cards generally as fast or faster than the RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT series, despite having around two-thirds as many compute units. Sticking with 32 CUs for the 9060 series isn't exciting on paper, but we should still see a respectable generation-over-generation performance bump. The RX 7600 series, by contrast, provided<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-amds-269-rx-7600-is-a-good-1080p-card-but-the-rtx-4060-looms/"> a pretty modest performance improvement</a> compared to 2022's Radeon RX 6650 XT.</p>


<p>AMD says that the cards' total board power—the amount of power the entire graphics card, including the GPU itself, RAM, and other components—starts at 150 W for the 8GB card and 160 W for the 16GB card, with a maximum TBP of 182 W. That's a shade higher than but generally comparable to the RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti, and (depending on where actual performance ends up) quite a bit more efficient than the RX 7600 series. This partly comes down to a more efficient 4nm TSMC manufacturing process, a substantial upgrade from the 6nm process used for the 7600 series.</p>
<p>It's unusual for a GPU maker to define a TBP range—more commonly we're just given a single default value. But this is in line with new settings we observed in our RX 9070 review; AMD officially supports a range of different user-selectable TBP numbers in its Catalyst driver package, and some GPU makers were shipping cards that used higher TBPs by default.</p>
<p>Higher power limits can increase performance, though usually the performance increase is disproportionately small compared to the increase in power draw. These power limits should also generally mean that most 9060 XTs can be powered with a single 8-pin power connector, rather than using multiple connectors or the 12-pin 12VHPWR/12V-2x6 connector.</p>
