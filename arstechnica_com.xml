          <p>Rockstar's highly anticipated <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will finally launch on May 26, 2026, Rockstar Games said in <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">a Friday morning announcement</a>.</p>
<p>That means the game will miss the "2025" release window that the developer announced alongside <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-confirms-many-things-including-its-florida-vibes/">the game's first trailer in late 2023</a>. That delay is needed, Rockstar said, so the company can use "this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve."</p>
<p>"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected," Rockstar wrote in its announcement. "The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game."</p>
<h2>A long wait gets longer</h2>
<p>While disappointing for franchise fans, today's official announcement of a delay hasn't exactly been unexpected. Insider sources have been reporting that the 2025 release target looked unlikely <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-development-2026-delay-rockstar-office-release-1851359831">for well over a year now</a>.</p>
<p>"Nobody Iâ€™ve talked to at Rockstar has believed Fall 2025 was a real window for a very long time now," Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x">wrote on Bluesky</a> this morning. "Too much work, not enough time, and what appears to be a real desire from management to avoid brutal crunch. GTA VI slipping to 2026 has seemed inevitable for months if not longer."</p>
<p>The new planned launch date of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> now falls a full 4,634 days after the Sept. 17, 2013 launch of <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. By contrast, there was just a 1,967-day gap between the release of <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and the prior release <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em>, which <em>also</em> launched on the PS3 and Xbox 360 on April 29, 2008.</p>
