<p>In <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/housing-development-notes-updated-december-9/2207508/5">a forum post</a> formally announcing the official UI change, Community Manager Randy “Kaivax” Jordan noted that the team “quickly” got to work on enabling the floating house UI after seeing the community “almost immediately” embrace the glitch. But Kaivax also notes that the undersides of houses were never intended to be visible, and thus “aren’t modeled are textured.” Players who make floating houses “may decide to hide that part behind other things,” Kaivax suggests.</p>
<p>Players with houses that float too high may also have problems positioning the camera so they can click the door to enter the house. For this problem, Kaivax suggests that “you might want to consider building a ramp or a jumping puzzle or a mount landing spot, etc.”</p>
<p><em>WoW</em>‘s floating houses join a long legacy of beloved game features that weren’t originally intended parts of a game’s design, from <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-street-fighter-ii-i-designer-opens-up-about-the-cancelling-bug-"><em>Street Fighter II</em>‘s combo system</a> to <a href="https://docs.momentum-mod.org/tags/rocket-jump/"><em>Doom</em>‘s “rocket jump.”</a> Now if we could only convince Blizzard to make <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/05/blizzard-fixes-diablo-iii-gold-duplication-bug-but-the-damage-may-be-done/"><em>Diablo III</em> gold duplication</a> into an official feature.</p>
