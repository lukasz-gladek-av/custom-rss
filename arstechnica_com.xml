          <p>In 2018, we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/sorry-the-switch-isnt-getting-wii-style-virtual-console-downloads/">lamented</a> as Nintendo officially replaced the Virtual Console—its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2006/11/8124/">long-running line</a> of downloadable classic games on the Wii and Wii U—with time-limited access to a set of games <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/welcome-to-nes-flix-testing-nintendo-onlines-new-8-bit-library-on-switch/">through a paid Nintendo Switch Online subscription</a>. Now, Hamster Corporation is doing what Nintendo no longer will, by offering downloadable versions of retro console games for direct individual purchase on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>As part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ym9SCKFpc">today’s Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a>, Hamster <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DOKyJJV8rQ">announced a new Console Archives line</a> of emulated classics available for download starting today on the Switch 2 and next week on the PlayStation 5 (sorry, Xbox and OG Switch fans). So far that lineup only includes the original PlayStation snowboarding title <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/console-archives-cool-boarders-switch-2/"><em>Cool Boarders</em> for $12</a> and the NES action platformer <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/console-archives-ninja-gaiden-ii-the-dark-sword-of-chaos-switch-2/"><em>Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</em> for $8</a>, but Hamster promises more obscure games, including <em>Doraemon</em> and <em>Sonic Wings Special</em>, will be available in the future.</p>

<p>If the name Hamster Corporation sounds familiar, it’s because the company is behind <a href="https://www.arcadearchives.com/en/">the Arcade Archive series</a>, which has repackaged individual arcade games for purchase and emulated play on modern consoles since 2014. That effort, which <a href="https://x.com/HAMSTER_Corp/status/2004228644785607017">celebrated its 500th release in December</a>, even <a href="https://www.arcadearchives.com/en/title/?s=nintendo">includes some of Nintendo’s classic arcade titles</a>, which the Switch-maker never officially released on the original Virtual Console.</p>
<p>Now Hamster’s says it is expanding its efforts “with the concept of faithfully reproducing masterpieces released on various home game consoles, allowing players to easily enjoy them on the latest hardware.” While these new offerings are more bare-bones than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/tetris-forever-includes-15-classic-versions-alongside-documentary-footage/">the full-fledged interactive museums released by the likes of Digital Eclipse</a>, they still include a few modern features, such as customizable button layouts, screen settings, and the ability to save and load at any time.</p>
