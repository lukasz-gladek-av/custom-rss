          <p>Among the many surprises during <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">last week's wider unveiling of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> was the pricing: $450 for the console itself and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/psa-mario-kart-world-is-50-bundled-with-a-switch-2-but-80-by-itself/">$70 to $80 for many first-party games</a>. Now, in a set of interviews posted today (but conducted during last week's unveiling event), Nintendo executives are explaining and defending those prices, even as Trump's tariffs are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-to-assess-trump-tariff-effects/">apparently forcing the company to pause and reassess its whole launch strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svRmWFAGLJg">speaking to CNBC</a> just as Trump's tariffs were being announced, and said in the moment that "we're still all trying to really understand [the tariffs] better and understand what possible impacts may rise from that." At the same time, he said that the company "didn't consider tariffs into that equation" when choosing the Switch 2's $450 price and instead went with what "we felt that was going to be the right price point for our consumers and the right value proposition if you will for the device that we're creating."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in that CNBC interview, Bowser suggested that Nintendo isn't following the Wii U example of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/08/nintendo-wii-u-still-being-sold-at-a-loss/">selling hardware at a loss</a> in order to gain more potential software customers. Instead, Bowser said the company is "trying to find a way to maintain... margins on the hardware even though they may be more slim than they are on software," and then "to make sure that they're seeing the value in their investment in one of our devices" through software.</p>
<p>Those hardware margins might be hard to maintain in the United States if Trump's tariffs add to the cost of importing consoles manufactured in Vietnam or China into the country. That said, Bowser added that "we've had some time to build up inventories on a global basis," and that "some" Switch 2 units are "landed already... in the United States," which could help delay the financial pain of any tariffs on Nintendo's part.</p>

<h2>Things just cost more now</h2>
<p>In justifying the $450 price of the Switch 2, Nintendo executives predictably pointed to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/nvidia-confirms-the-switch-2-supports-dlss-g-sync-and-ray-tracing/">the system's upgraded hardware specs</a>, as well as new features like GameChat and mouse mode. "As you add more technology into a system, especially in this day and age, that drives additional cost." Nintendo Vice President of Player &amp; Product Experience Bill Trinen <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553517/price-interview-tariffs">told Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>That said, Trinen also pointed toward rising prices in the wider economy to justify the $150 jump between Switch and Switch 2 pricing. "We're unfortunately living in an era where I think inflation is affecting everything," Trinen said.</p>
<figure>
    <div>
            <p>
              The Switch never saw a nominal price drop, but inflation still ate away at its total cost a bit over the years.

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Trinen isn't wrong about that; the $299 early adopters paid for a Switch in 2017 is worth about $391 in today's dollars, according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">the BLS CPI calculator</a>. But for customers whose own incomes may have stayed flat over that time, the 50 percent jump in nominal pricing from Switch to Switch 2 may be hard to swallow in a time of increasing economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>"Obviously the cost of everything goes up over time, and I personally would love if the cost of things didn't go up over time," Trinen told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen">IGN</a>. "And certainly there's the cost of goods and things that factor into that, but we try to find the right appropriate price for a product based on that."</p>
<h2>Is $80 the new $70?</h2>
<p>Talk of inflation extended to Trinen's discussion of why Nintendo decided to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/psa-mario-kart-world-is-50-bundled-with-a-switch-2-but-80-by-itself/">sell first-party Switch 2 games for $70 to $80</a>. "The price of video games has been very stable for a very long time," Trinen told Polygon. "I actually have an ad on my phone that I found from 1993, when <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> released on the SNES at $59. That’s a very, very long time where pricing on games has been very stable..."</p>

          
                  </div>

        <div>
          
          
<p>Cherry-picking <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>'s price from near the end of console gaming's cartridge era might be a little misleading. But Trinen is correct that $80 in today's money is not out of line with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/the-return-of-the-70-video-game-has-been-a-long-time-coming/">historic inflation-adjusted prices for console games</a>, even in the disc era.</p>

<p>Speaking to CNBC, Bowser said that Nintendo is "not really looking to establish a [new] benchmark for pricing" with <em>Mario Kart World</em>'s $80 price tag. He echoed the same sentiment <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/04/07/mario-kart-world-price-nintendo-doug-bowser/">to The Washington Post</a>, saying that the game's higher-than-normal price is "less about representing the industry... this is really about Nintendo deciding the right thing to do for its products or what the pricing should be for its products overall."</p>
<p>Instead of flat top-end game pricing, Bowser told CNBC "we look at every game and every experience and determine what we believe is the right price point based on that experience." It's a talking point Trinen echoed, telling Polygon that "we take an approach of looking at: What is the experience, and what are players going to enjoy out of this game? What is the length of the game—what’s the volume of the experience? How in-depth is it? And then we price appropriately based on what we think the value of that experience is."</p>
<p>That said, Nintendo of America Senior VP of Product Development and Publishing Nate Bihldorff <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/inside-the-smile-factory-nintendos-quest-to-save-the-switch-2-from-reality/#dt-heading-a-dose-of-reality">told Digital Trends</a> that game pricing is still as much an art as a science. "There isn’t an Excel sheet up here where you’re checking boxes, and each time you add $5," Bihldorff said. "It’s a number of factors that probably can’t be easily quantified for each one. And that’s why you’ll see a fairly different set of prices for different pieces of software."</p>

<p>Nintendo's barrage of Switch announcements over the last two weeks have also come with changes to the way Nintendo treats physical and digital copies of games.</p>
<p>Digital games can now become "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/">virtual game cards</a>," facilitating slightly more flexible sharing of digitally purchased games between multiple Switch systems owned by the same person or family of people. And physical copies of games can now be either traditional game cards—little bits of plastic with the game stored on a flash memory chip inside—or "Game-Key cards," which look the same from the outside but don't actually have any game data stored on them.</p>
<p>A Game-Key card has a "key" stored on it that prompts a download of the game data from Nintendo's servers the first time you insert it. From then on, the game behaves like a cross between a digital download and a physical game—all of the game's content has to be on the console's internal storage or a microSD Express card, but you <em>need</em> to have the Game-Key card inserted before the game will launch.</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> the same as the download code printed on a digital game card, which can't be used again once it's been claimed—as explained on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/Nintendo-Switch-2-Game-Key-Cards-2785635.html">a Nintendo support page</a>, a Game-Key card will work the same way in any other Switch once the game data has been downloaded. It's not tied to any particular Nintendo Account, as a digital-only game download is.</p>
<p>In that way, a Game-Key card is a bit like playing certain DRM-protected PC games in the days before Steam or installing a disc-based PlayStation or Xbox game to local storage. The game isn't actively loading any content from the physical media but is instead using the physical media to confirm that you own the game you're trying to play.</p>
<h2>Game-Key cards aren’t ideal</h2>

<p>People on the Internet have gotten mad about Game-Key cards, just like people on the Internet have gotten mad about many aspects of the Switch 2 launch ($70-to-$80 games, relatively few brand-new first-party launch games, a $449 base price that may end up getting raised <em>again</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-to-assess-trump-tariff-effects/">because of Donald Trump's disruptive and unpredictable tariff program</a>).</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>And there are real concerns and annoyances that will come with Game-Key cards. Normally, the physical copy of a game is playable right out of the box—or, at most, after downloading patches that are a fraction of the size of the entire game. This saves time, and it saves internal storage space. That'll be particularly important if you're trying to stretch the console's 256GB of internal storage and avoid buying a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/what-is-microsd-express-and-why-is-it-mandatory-for-the-nintendo-switch-2/">new microSD Express card</a>.</p>
<p>Now, every time you put the game into a new console, you have to download the whole game again. That's true if you have multiple Switches in your family, or if you're passing the card to a friend to play, or if you delete the game to make room for a new one. And you lose the it-just-launches flexibility of downloadable titles since you need to insert a game key card to be allowed to play the game you've downloaded.</p>
<p>And then there's the (very) long-term argument. In 2023, Nintendo shut down the online servers for its Wii U and 3DS consoles. At that point, it had been years since either console had seen a new game, and it's almost certain that the vast majority of them are spending most of their time gathering dust or tucked into a drawer. But for game preservationists, it meant that a whole lot was breaking: online play for either system, game update distribution for either system, and downloadable games and DLC for either system.</p>
<p>In a hypothetical future where the Switch servers are also shut down, a "real" game card is still a playable game. A Game-Key card becomes a hunk of plastic.</p>

<h2>... but I prefer this to the alternative</h2>

      </figure>

<p>But let's be honest with ourselves. Physical game releases have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/fewer-and-fewer-console-games-are-seeing-a-physical-release/">dying out gradually for years</a>, a product of the natural evolution of technology and the fact that it costs more to manufacture and ship a physical object than it does to provide server bandwidth for a game download.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>At this point, game companies probably aren't choosing between shipping either a regular-old game card or a Game-Key card—they're likely deciding whether to ship a Game-Key card or <em>nothing</em>. Digital-only has become the default model for most independently developed games and smaller releases from big publishers. When some of those games get physical releases at all, it's handled through a specialty retailer like <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/">Limited Run Games</a>, which will package up a small handful of them to satisfy physical game dead-enders.</p>
<p>I count myself as a member of that group, by the way, partly because I like having Things To Look At On A Shelf. But mostly because a game cartridge is a useful object to me in a way that a downloaded game is not. I can pass a game card to a friend so they can see if their kids like the game without having to spend money on it first. I can go halvsies with a friend on a game we both want to play but don't want to pay $60 for. I can sell a game card when I'm done with it for some portion of its original value—and occasionally, for particularly rare out-of-print games, for significantly more than I paid for it in the first place.</p>
<p>This is called "sharing things," and it's how owning stuff has worked for as long as people have owned stuff. I can lend or borrow a book; I can lend or borrow a tool; I can lend or borrow a phone charger. But it's something that's being steadily eroded in the streaming and digital download age, when companies and a certain kind of Internet commenter/social media poster will pedantically explain to you that you are not buying a <em>thing</em>, you are buying a&nbsp;<em>license to view or use a thing</em>.</p>
<p>The main reason I stick with physical games is because that sucks! That's a bad arrangement!</p>
<p>A Game-Key card, for all its weird faults and inconveniences, still manages to clear that bar for me. It's not a non-transferable title tied to my Nintendo account for all time, restricted to whatever sharing mechanism Nintendo decides I can use. It is still a thing to be looked at and a transferrable physical object that retains inherent value in a way that a downloadable game does not. I would prefer "real" game cards, and I don't love the market forces that gave rise to the Game-Key card idea. But I can still work with this.</p>
