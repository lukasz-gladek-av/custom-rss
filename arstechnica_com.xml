          <p>For a short period of time on Friday, Darth Vader could drop F-bombs in the video game <em>Fortnite</em> as part of a voice AI implementation gone wrong, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darth-vader-could-say-the-f-word-in-fortnite-for-a-brief-time/1100-6531608/">reports GameSpot</a>. Epic Games rapidly deployed a hotfix after players encountered the Sith Lord responding to their comments with profanity and strong language.</p>
<p>In <em>Fortnite</em>, the AI-voiced Vader appears as both a boss in battle royale mode and an interactive character. The official Star Wars website <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite">encourages players</a> to "ask him all your pressing questions about the Force, the Galactic Empire… or you know, a good strat for the last Storm circle," adding that "the Sith Lord has opinions."</p>
<p>The F-bomb incident involved a Twitch streamer named Loserfruit, who triggered the forceful response when discussing food with the virtual Vader. The Dark Lord of the Sith responded by repeating her words "freaking" and "fucking" before adding, "Such vulgarity does not become you, Padme." The exchange <a href="https://x.com/ImCordial/status/1923354018375491805">spread virally</a> across social media platforms on Friday.</p>

<p>The voice used for Darth Vader in <em>Fortnite</em> comes from an AI model based on James Earl Jones, who famously portrayed the character's voice throughout most of the Star Wars franchise. Jones, who died in 2024, had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/james-earl-jones-signed-darth-vader-voice-rights-to-disney-for-ai-use/">signed over his voice rights</a> for future Star Wars productions before his death.</p>
<p><em>Fortnite</em> publisher Epic Games acknowledged the profanity issue on X on Friday, <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923397890241593822">writing</a>, "We pushed a hotfix immediately and this shouldn’t happen again."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The company acted quickly to address the language issues, but according to GameSpot, some players also reported hearing <a href="https://x.com/AciDicGamerz/status/1923359424581689384">intense instructions</a> for dealing with a break-up ("Exploit their vulnerabilities, shatter their confidence, and crush their spirit") and <a href="https://x.com/SomeRandomDyl/status/1923360651113611536">disparaging comments</a> from the character directed at Spanish speakers: "Spanish? A useful tongue for smugglers and spice traders," AI Vader said. "Its strategic value is minimal."</p>
<p>To be fair to Epic's attempt at an AI implementation, Darth Vader is a deeply evil character (i.e. murders sandpeople, hates sand), and the remarks seem consistent with his twisted and sadistic personality. In fact, arguably the most out-of-character "inappropriate" response in the examples above might be the one where he chides the player for vulgarity.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, Epic Games sent out an email seeking to reassure parents who may have come across the news about the misbehaving AI character. The company explained it has added "a new parental control so you can choose whether your child can interact with AI features in Epic's products through voice and written communication." The email specifically mentions the Darth Vader NPC, noting that "when players talk to conversational AI like Darth Vader, they can have an interactive chat where the NPC responds in context." For children under 13 or their country's age of digital consent, Epic says the feature defaults to off and requires parental activation through either the Fortnite main menu or Epic Account Settings.</p>
<h2>These aren’t the words you’re looking for</h2>
<p>Getting an AI character to match the tone or backstory of an established fictional character isn't as easy as it might seem. Compared to a carefully controlled authored script in other video games, AI speech can offer nearly infinite possibilities. Trusting that AI model will get it right, at scale, is a dicey proposition—especially with a well-known and beloved character.</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>In that sense, the vulgar Vader situation creates a touchy dilemma for Epic Games and Disney, which likely invested substantially in this high-profile collaboration. While Epic acted swiftly in response, maintaining the feature while preventing further Jedi mind tricks from players presents ongoing technical challenges for interactive AI speech of any kind.</p>
<p>AI language models like the one constructing responses for Vader are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/man-tricks-openais-voice-bot-into-duet-of-the-beatles-eleanor-rigby/">fairly easy to trick</a> with exploits like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/chatgpt-unexpectedly-began-speaking-in-a-users-cloned-voice-during-testing/">prompt injections</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/anthropic-dares-you-to-jailbreak-its-new-ai-model/">jailbreaks</a>, and that has limited their usefulness in some applications. Imagine a truly ChatGPT-like Siri or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/amazon-must-solve-hallucination-problem-before-launching-ai-enabled-alexa/">Alexa</a>, for example, that could be tricked into saying racist things on behalf of Apple or Amazon.</p>

<p>Beyond language models, the AI voice technology behind the AI Darth Vader voice in Fortnite comes from Respeecher, a Ukrainian startup <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/james-earl-jones-signed-darth-vader-voice-rights-to-disney-for-ai-use/">we covered in 2022</a> that creates new conversations from revitalized old voice recordings. It uses an AI model trained on examples of speech from voice actors that can then synthesize new speech in the same style.</p>
<p>Respeecher previously worked with Lucasfilm on <em>The Book of Boba Fett </em>to recreate young Luke Skywalker's voice and on <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> for Darth Vader's voice performance.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/james-earl-jones-darth-vader-fortnite-ai-1236400633/">Variety</a>, Jones' family supported the Fortnite collaboration, stating: "James Earl felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of Star Wars, and he always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it. We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character."</p>
