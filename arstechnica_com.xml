          <p>Four out of five game developers are currently working on a project for the PC, a sizable increase from 66 percent of developers a year ago. That's according to <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">Informa's latest State of the Game Industry survey</a>, which partnered with Omdia to ask over 3,000 game industry professionals about their work in advance of March's Game Developers Conference.</p>
<p>The 80 percent of developers working on PC projects in this year's survey is by far the highest mark for any platform dating back to at least 2018, when 60 percent of surveyed developers were working on a PC game. In the years since, the ratio of game developers working on the PC has hovered between 56 and 66 percent before this year's unexpected jump. The number of game developers saying they were <em>interested</em> in the PC as a platform also increased substantially, from 62 percent last year to 74 percent this year.</p>

<p>The PC has long been the most popular platform for developers to work on in the annual State of the Game Industry survey, easily outpacing consoles and mobile platforms that generally see active work from anywhere between 12 to 36 percent of developer respondents, depending on the year. In its report, Informa notes this surge as a "passion for PC development explod[ing]" among developers, and mentions that while "PC has consistently been the platform of choice... this year saw its dominance increase even more."</p>
<p>The increasing popularity of PC gaming among developers is also reflected in the number of individual game releases on Steam, which topped out at a record of 18,974 individual titles for 2024, <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/">according to SteamDB</a>. That record number was up over 32 percent from 2023, which was up from just under 16 percent from 2022 (though many Steam games each year were "Limited Games" that failed to meet <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile">Valve's minimum engagement metrics</a> for Badges and Trading Cards).</p>

<h2>The Steam Deck effect?</h2>
<p>While it's hard to pinpoint a single reason for the sudden surge in the popularity of PC game development, Informa speculates that it's "connected to the rising popularity of Valveâ€™s Steam Deck." While Valve has only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954205/valve-steam-deck-multiple-millions">officially acknowledged "multiple millions" in sales for the portable hardware</a>, GameDiscoverCo analyst Simon Carless <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/steam-deck-everything-you-were-afraid">estimated</a> that between 3 million and 4 million Steam Deck units had been sold by October 2023, up significantly from <a href="https://80.lv/articles/steam-deck-has-reportedly-sold-over-1-million-units/">reports of 1 million Deck shipments</a> in October 2022.</p>

<p>In place of <em>Doom Eternal</em>'s "jump and shoot" gameplay loop, <em>The Dark Ages</em> focuses on more of a "stand and fight" mentality, the developers said. If <em>Doom Eternal</em> was like flying a fighter jet, then <em>The Dark Ages</em> is more like controlling a tank, they added by way of analogy.</p>

<p>That means a "flatter" game space, where the old-fashioned "strafe-to-aim" strategies work more effectively than in recent <em>Doom</em> games, with less need to be constantly floating through the air. The developers say they're returning to the slower projectile speeds of the original <em>Doom</em> games, too, allowing players to more easily weave between them in a sort of first-person take on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up">shmup pattern</a>. At the same time, your own projectile weapons tend toward the medium to short range, the developers said, encouraging you to take the fight close to the enemies.</p>
<p>While staggering enemies to set up instant Glory Kills is still a core part of <em>The Dark Ages</em>, the developers said the system has been redesigned to avoid taking control away from the player for extended, repetitive canned animations. The new Glory Kill system allows for instant, physics-based attacks that can be activated from any angle without interrupting the gameplay flow.</p>
<h2>The more things change</h2>
<p><em>The Dark Ages</em> developers also promised a more open design, where the usual more linear corridors are interspersed with larger playspaces that let you decide which direction to go and which objective to pursue in what order. And the standard shooting action will be broken up into specific sections where you control a 30-story mech or fly a powerful dragon.</p>

<p>But the core game will still include the requisite raft of secret areas and hidden nooks to discover, the developers promised. This time around, though, those secrets are more directly tied to your power progression rather than just being collectible in-game trinkets, the developers said.</p>
<p>It's all in service of pushing toward a game that feels "new but familiar," Martin said. <em>The Dark Ages</em> is still about the same sense of exploration and power that all good Doom games capture. But Martin said the development team is comfortable experimenting with what that specific sense of power is, "especially if the change you make brings it closer to classic <em>Doom</em>."</p>
<p>But "I want to play a Doom game," he added. "We don't [want to] change so much that it's not a Doom game.</p>
<p>Doom: The Dark Ages<em> is scheduled to hit Windows, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on May 15.</em></p>
