          <p>There are only two licensed professional sports games included in Wikipedia's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_notable_for_negative_reception">List of video games notable for negative reception</a>." Do not be fooled, however: <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_2K20">WWE 2K20</a></em> and <em>eFootball 2022</em> are just the outliers, arriving so poorly crafted as to cause notable outcry and an actual change to development plans. Most licensed professional sports games come out yearly, whether fully baked, notably improved, or not, and fans who have few other options to play with their favorite intellectual property learn to make do with them.</p>
<p>Not so with fans of <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/">Football Manager</a>, a series that can be traced back in some form to 1992 that has released a game almost every year, minus one ownership shift in the early 2000s. Sports Interactive, the company behind the franchise, <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1">released a statement on Thursday</a> (in British time) that says that "following extensive internal discussions and careful consideration," <em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>is canceled. The game was "too far away from the standards you deserve," so they are focusing on the 2026 version.</p>
<h2>Trying not to make “the same bloody game every year”</h2>

<p><em>Football Manager 2025&nbsp;</em>was already delayed twice and is now quite late—as we are now midway into the European football (or what Americans call soccer) season. The game was intended to be a major overhaul.</p>
<p>Miles Jacobson, head of developer Sports Interactive, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fm25-is-not-a-continuation-of-fm24-the-big-football-manager-interview">told Eurogamer last fall</a> that the 2025 version was the "first chapter in the new book of <em>Football Manager.</em>" Lots of existing modes would be tossed out, including international management and "touchline shouts," or phrases you can yell or calmly administer to your team during the matches you don't actually control. The game was moving from a proprietary engine to Unity. The team reimagined and redesigned more than 500 screens full of data. Perhaps most importantly, 2025 was the year the franchise landed the official license for the Premier League.</p>
<p>With all that, there have been a lot of scope changes. "I've de-scoped something today," Jacobson told Eurogamer in September, "that at the time of the [June] dev blog was still in scope. And we re-scoped something last week, and we up-scoped something last week—it's a very fluid process!" The reason for these changes? "It's our ambition," Jacobson said then. "I know that some people will find that difficult to believe because, 'Oh, they only work on iterations, they're making the same bloody game every year.'"</p>

      A short emulator-aided demonstration of how the broken ladder glitch works (not shown: the dozens of frame-perfect inputs needed to pull it off).

<h2>Better to be lucky than to be good</h2>
<p>While players have <a href="https://donkeykongforum.net/index.php?topic=325.0">theorized about using the broken ladder glitch to pass the kill screen for years</a>, it initially seemed like even this glitched shortcut was too slow for the short kill screen timer. Yet when Kosmic attempted the same trick using his own emulator-assisted setup recently, he says he was able to complete the level on his first try. What gives?</p>
<p>As it turns out, Kosmic was the beneficiary of some significant luck. Basically, every time Donkey Kong throws a barrel, there is a 1 in 32 chance that he will wait an extra half second or so before throwing the next barrel (this random process <a href="https://pastebin.com/WXR5iy7t">is explained in way too much detail in this Pastebin</a>). Since the game's bonus timer only ticks down when Donkey Kong actually throws a barrel, the semi-rare delay can give Mario the crucial extra frames he needs to reach the top of the kill screen using the broken ladder glitch.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, this randomized barrel-throwing delay can theoretically repeat indefinitely, provided the game's randomizer picks the same lucky 1-in-32 sequence over and over again. If Donkey Kong decides to delay his barrel throw about 19 times in a row, Mario would actually be able to complete the kill screen normally, without the broken ladder glitch (and without facing many barrels, even). Of course, the chances of that happening on unmodified arcade hardware are nearly 1 in 40 octillion (1 in 32^19, to be precise), so don't count on encountering it in the wild any time soon.</p>

<p>With the ladder glitch, though, Kosmic's emulator-assisted run needed significantly less luck to pass the kill screen at 22-1. He was even able to push the game past the next four stages (including previously unseen spring and pie factory screens) to reach level 22-6.</p>
<p>Kosmic calls that stage the game's true kill screen, as there's currently no known way for Mario to remove all eight rivets quickly enough to overcome the glitch-shortened timer, even with emulator assistance. Then again, for decades, players assumed there was no way to complete level 22-1, either. Maybe someone will figure out a clever method for beating this new kill screen with 40 more years of sustained effort.</p>
