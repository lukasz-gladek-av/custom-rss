            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-new-nvidia-app-is-probably-hurting-your-pc-gaming-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When Nvidia replaced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/latest-nvidia-drivers-to-be-locked-behind-geforce-experience-app/">the longstanding GeForce Experience App</a> with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/">a new, unified Nvidia App</a> last month, most GPU owners probably noted the refresh and rebranding with nothing more than bemusement (though <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/nvidias-new-app-doesnt-require-you-to-log-in-to-update-your-gpu-driver/">the new lack of an account login requirement</a> was a nice improvement). Now, testing shows that running the new app with default settings can lead to some significant frame rate dips on many high-end games, even when the app's advanced AI features aren't being actively used.</p>
<p>Tom's Hardware <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/we-tested-nvidia-app-performance-problems-games-run-up-to-15-percent-slower-with-the-app">noted the performance dip</a> after reading reports of related problems around the web. The site's testing with and without the Nvidia App installed confirms that, across five games running on an RTX 4060, the app reduced average frame rates by around 3 to 6 percent, depending on the resolution and graphical quality level.</p>
<p>The site's measured frame rate drop peaked at 12 percent for <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> running at 1080p Ultra settings; other tested games (including <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, <em>Flight Simulator 2024</em>, and <em>Stalker 2</em>) showed a smaller drop at most settings.</p>
<h2>Unfiltered</h2>
<p>This is a significant performance impact for an app that simply runs quietly in the background for most users. The impact is roughly comparable to that of going from a top-of-the-line RTX 4070 Ti Super to an older RTX 4070 Ti or 4070 Super, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/4070-ti-super-review-faster-gpu-for-the-same-799-but-not-nvidias-best-value/">based on our earlier testing of those cards</a>.</p>
