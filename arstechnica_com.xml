<h2>More than just rolling for initiative</h2>
<p>Obsidian <a href="https://fextralife.com/pillars-of-eternity-2-deadfire-turn-based-combat-mechanics-explained/">added a turn-based mode</a> to&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</em> in patch 4.1, roughly eight months after the game's initial release. Designer Josh Sawyer, who worked on&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate II&nbsp;</em>and directed&nbsp;both&nbsp;<em>PoE</em> games, said in a 2023<a href="https://toucharcade.com/2023/10/18/pentiment-anniversary-interview-josh-sawyer-on-hi%5B%E2%80%A6%5Ding-a-potential-pillars-of-eternity-3-rpg-mechanics-and-more/"> interview with Touch Arcade</a> that the real-time systems in the <em>PoE</em>&nbsp;games were largely a concession to the old-school CRPG fans that crowdfunded both games.</p>
<p>Turn-based was Sawyer's stated preference, and he thinks <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> largely put an end to the debate in modern times:</p>
<blockquote><p>I just think it’s easier to design more intricate combats. I like games with a lot of stats, obviously. (He laughs). But the problem with real time with pause is that it’s honestly very difficult for people to actually parse all of that information, and one of the things I’ve heard a lot from people who’ve played <em>Deadfire</em> in turn based, is that there were things about the game like the affliction and inspiration system that they didn’t really understand very clearly until they played it in turn based.</p></blockquote>
<p>But both&nbsp;<em>Pillars&nbsp;</em>games were designed with real-time combat in mind, such that, even with his appreciation for the turn-based addition to&nbsp;<em>PoE 2</em>, Sawyer knows "the game wasn't designed for it," he told Touch Arcade. This is almost certainly going to be the case, too, for the original&nbsp;<em>PoE</em>, but there could be lessons learned from&nbsp;<em>PoE 2</em>'s transformation to apply. Other games from that era might also lure folks like me back, though perhaps they, too, have a density of encounters and maps that just can't cut it for turn-based.</p>
<p>Beyond this notably big "patch" coming to the original&nbsp;<em>PoE</em>, the 10th anniversary patch should make it easier for Mac and Linux (through Proton) users to stay up to date on bug fixes, and for players on GOG and Epic to get Kickstarter rewards and achievements. Lots of audio and visual effects were fixed up, along with a whole heap of mechanical and combat fixes.</p>
