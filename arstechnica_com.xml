<p>But discovering the addresses was only half the problem. When you talk to a villager in <em>Animal Crossing</em>, the game normally displays dialogue instantly. Calling an AI model over the Internet takes several seconds. Willison examined the code and found Fonseca's solution: a watch_dialogue() function that polls memory 10 times per second. When it detects a conversation starting, it immediately writes placeholder text: three dots with hidden pause commands between them, followed by a "Press A to continue" prompt.</p>
<p>"So the user gets a 'press A to continue' button and hopefully the LLM has finished by the time they press that button," Willison <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45195311">noted</a> in a Hacker News comment. While players watch dots appear and reach for the A button, the mod races to get a response from the AI model and translate it into the game's dialog format.</p>
<h2>Learning the game’s secret language</h2>
<p>Simply writing text to memory froze the game. <em>Animal Crossing</em> uses an encoded format with control codes that manage everything from text color to character emotions. A special prefix byte (0x7F) signals commands rather than characters. Without the proper end-of-conversation control code, the game waits forever.</p>
<p>"Think of it like HTML," Fonseca explains. "Your browser doesn't just display words; it interprets tags ... to make text bold." The decompilation community had documented these codes, allowing Fonseca to build encoder and decoder tools that translate between a human-readable format and the GameCube's expected byte sequences.</p>

<p>Initially, he tried using a single AI model to handle both creative writing and technical formatting. "The results were a mess," he notes. "The AI was trying to be a creative writer and a technical programmer simultaneously and was bad at both."</p>
<p>The solution: split the work between two models. A Writer AI creates dialogue using character sheets scraped from the <em>Animal Crossing</em> fan wiki. A Director AI then adds technical elements, including pauses, color changes, character expressions, and sound effects.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/vuciv/animal-crossing-llm-mod">code is available on GitHub</a>, though Fonseca warns it contains known bugs and has only been tested on macOS. The mod requires Python 3.8+, API keys for either Google Gemini or OpenAI, and Dolphin emulator. Have fun sticking it to the man—or the raccoon, as the case may be.</p>
