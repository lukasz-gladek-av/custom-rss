          <p>We’ll admit that we weren’t paying enough attention to the state of <em>Anthem</em>—BioWare’s troubled 2019 jetpack-powered open-world shooter—to notice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250703185925/https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update">EA’s July announcement</a> that it was planning to shut down the game’s servers. But with that planned server shutdown now just a week away, we thought it was worth alerting you readers to your final opportunity to play one of BioWare’s most ambitious failures.</p>
<p><em>Anthem</em> was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/bioware-anthem-e3-release-date/">unveiled</a> at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/biowares-sci-fi-gaming-wizards-unveil-new-series-called-anthem/">E3 2017</a> in a demo that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/inside-look-at-bioware-explains-exactly-how-fake-e3-2017s-anthem-demo-was/">later revealed to have been largely faked</a> to paper over major issues with the game’s early development. <em>Anthem’</em>s&nbsp;early 2019 release was met with <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/7084/anthem">a lot of middling-to-poor reviews</a> (including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/anthem-game-review-honestly-its-not-finished/">one from Ars itself</a>), followed about a year later by a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/02/bioware-promises-substantial-reinvention-for-year-old-anthem/">promise from BioWare General Manager Casey Hudson</a> that a “longer-term redesign” and “substantial reinvention” of the overall game experience were coming. Hudson <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2020/12/03/from-casey-hudson/">left BioWare in December 2020</a>, though, and a few months later, that planned <em>Anthem</em> overhaul <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/ea-bioware-cancel-anthems-sweeping-overhaul/">was officially canceled</a>.</p>
<p>While active development on <em>Anthem</em> has been dormant for years, the game’s servers have remained up and running. And though the game didn’t exactly explode in popularity during that period of benign neglect, <a href="https://mmo-population.com/game/anthem">estimates from MMO Populations</a> suggest a few hundred to a few thousand players have been jetpacking around the game’s world daily. The game also still sees <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame">a smattering of daily</a> subreddit posts, including some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q3hjpc/is_there_a_chance_to_make_a_private_server_of/">hoping against hope for a fan-led private server revival</a>, a la <a href="https://pretendo.network/">the Pretendo Network</a>. And there are still <a href="https://streamscharts.com/games/anthem">a small handful of Twitch streamers</a> sharing the game while they still can, including one racing to obtain all of the in-game achievements after <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2661748161">picking up a $4 copy at Goodwill</a>.</p>
