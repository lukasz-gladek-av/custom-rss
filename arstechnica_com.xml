          <p>There are countless Android-powered gaming handhelds, but they go beyond the usual slate of Android games by offering console emulation support. The problem is the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/can-a-digital-lending-library-solve-classic-gamings-piracy-problem/">game ROMs</a> on these devices, which are not entirely legal. Italian YouTuber Once Were Nerd is learning how seriously some rightsholders are taking game piracy after agents from the country's Guardia di Finanza showed up to confiscate his consoles. He now says the investigation could lead to criminal charges and the end of his channel.</p>
<p>Once Were Nerd has produced YouTube content covering a plethora of gaming topics, including Android-based handheld game machines from the likes of Powkiddy and TrimUI. These devices usually run an older version of Android that has been heavily modified for gaming, featuring built-in emulation support for retro consoles like SNES, Nintendo 64, PlayStation Portable, GameCube, and more. They've become quite popular as the cost of mobile hardware has come down, making it possible to buy what is essentially an updated PSP or Game Boy Advance for $100 or less.</p>
<p>Recently, Once Were Nerd attracted the attention of Italy's Ministry of Economy and Finance, which is tasked with policing copyright in the country. In the video first spotted by <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/once-were-nerd-youtuber-copyright-lawsuit-3577995/">Android Authority</a> (which has an AI-generated English language track), the YouTuber explains that Guardia di Finanza appeared at his door in April with a search warrant.</p>

<p>Agents accused the creator of promoting pirated copyrighted materials stemming from his coverage of Anbernic handheld game consoles. While emulation software is not illegal, a surprising number of these devices ship chock-full of pre-loaded ROMs—the channel showed multiple Sony and Nintendo games running on the device. Once Were Nerd is far from the only channel posting about these devices, though.</p>

<h2>PC-like power, console-like benefits</h2>
<p><em>Cyberpunk</em> is a big get for the Mac’s gaming team, as it's an enduringly popular open-world game with a distinctive look, but it’s also of a piece with all of the AAA gaming launches the Mac has seen in the last couple of years. It’s a popular and graphically impressive game from a major studio, but it’s also coming to the Mac years after it initially arrived on PCs and consoles.</p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk</em>’s graphics settings show where the Mac could have advantages as a gaming platform, though. Like PCs, Apple Silicon Macs are available at all kinds of price and performance levels, from the low-end fanless MacBook Air to the top-tier M3 Ultra Mac Studio. But unlike PCs, where developers can’t account for all of the possible CPU, GPU, motherboard, storage, and RAM configurations, Windows versions, and graphics driver updates, the Mac comes in a more finite number of configurations with more tightly controlled software. This makes it easier for developers to target and tune for specific hardware.</p>
<p>Case in point,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>’s “<a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/mac/sp-technical/issue/2894/for-this-mac-preset">For this Mac</a>” preset. Unlike the PC game’s Steam Deck preset, this isn’t a fixed collection of specific settings made with one particular hardware configuration in mind. Rather, it’s a dynamic preset that chooses different settings based on which specific Mac hardware you’re running the game on. An M1 Mac using this preset would get different settings than an M4 Max Mac using the same preset, and players can choose it knowing that they ought to get reasonably smooth and consistent performance with the best settings that their individual Mac can reasonably handle. (The one setting “For this Mac” doesn’t touch is ray-tracing, which can be manually enabled on M3- and M4-series Macs with the GPU hardware to support it but which won’t be turned on automatically.)</p>
