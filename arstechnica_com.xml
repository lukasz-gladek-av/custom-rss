          <p>Valve's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/valve-we-want-to-allow-everything-on-steam-including-something-that-you-hate/">famously permissive</a> rules for what games are and are not allowed on Steam got a little less permissive this week, seemingly in response to outside pressure from some of its partner companies. In <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamworksDocumentation/commit/fddd59b5395cc3c1c74574650dbf5784612d0521">a Tuesday update</a> to the "Rules and Guidelines" section of <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding">Steam's Onboarding Documentation</a>, the company added a new rule prohibiting "Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or Internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content."</p>
<p>On its own, the new rule seems rather vague, with no details on which of the many kinds of "adult only content" would belong in the "certain" subset prohibited by these unnamed payment processors and ISPs. But the trackers over at SteamDB <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lu32vdlsmg27">noticed</a> that the publication of the new rule coincides with <a href="https://steamdb.info/history/events/?before=64657809">the removal of dozens of Steam games</a> whose titles make reference to incest, along with a handful of sex games referencing "slave" or "prison" imagery.</p>
<h2>Holding the keys to the bank</h2>
<p>Valve isn't alone in having de facto restrictions on content imposed on it by outside payment processors. In 2022, for instance, Visa <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/08/visa-pauses-pornhub-ad-payments-ahead-of-child-sexual-abuse-trial/">suspended all payments to Pornhub's ad network</a> after the adult video site was accused of profiting from child sexual abuse materials. And PayPal has routinely disallowed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/07/paypal-sets-down-stricter-regulations-for-file-sharing-sites/">payments to file-sharing sites</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/paypal-blocks-vpn-smartdns-providers-payments-over-copyright-violations/">VPN providers</a> over concerns surrounding piracy of copyrighted materials.</p>

          <p>There are countless Android-powered gaming handhelds, but they go beyond the usual slate of Android games by offering console emulation support. The problem is the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/can-a-digital-lending-library-solve-classic-gamings-piracy-problem/">game ROMs</a> on these devices, which are not entirely legal. Italian YouTuber Once Were Nerd is learning how seriously some rightsholders are taking game piracy after agents from the country's Guardia di Finanza showed up to confiscate his consoles. He now says the investigation could lead to criminal charges and the end of his channel.</p>
<p>Once Were Nerd has produced YouTube content covering a plethora of gaming topics, including Android-based handheld game machines from the likes of Powkiddy and TrimUI. These devices usually run an older version of Android that has been heavily modified for gaming, featuring built-in emulation support for retro consoles like SNES, Nintendo 64, PlayStation Portable, GameCube, and more. They've become quite popular as the cost of mobile hardware has come down, making it possible to buy what is essentially an updated PSP or Game Boy Advance for $100 or less.</p>
<p>Recently, Once Were Nerd attracted the attention of Italy's Ministry of Economy and Finance, which is tasked with policing copyright in the country. In the video first spotted by <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/once-were-nerd-youtuber-copyright-lawsuit-3577995/">Android Authority</a> (which has an AI-generated English language track), the YouTuber explains that Guardia di Finanza appeared at his door in April with a search warrant.</p>

<p>Agents accused the creator of promoting pirated copyrighted materials stemming from his coverage of Anbernic handheld game consoles. While emulation software is not illegal, a surprising number of these devices ship chock-full of pre-loaded ROMs—the channel showed multiple Sony and Nintendo games running on the device. Once Were Nerd is far from the only channel posting about these devices, though.</p>
