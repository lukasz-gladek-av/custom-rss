          <p>It’s been nearly three years now since <em>Destiny</em> maker (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/01/sony-to-acquire-bungie-destiny-series-for-3-6-billion/">Sony subsidiary</a>) Bungie <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/remember-marathon-bungies-pre-halo-and-destiny-shooter-its-back-kind-of/">formally announced</a> a revival of the storied <em>Marathon</em> FPS franchise. And it has been about seven months since the game’s original announced release date of September 23, 2025 was <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">pushed back indefinitely</a> after a reportedly poor response to the game’s first Alpha test.</p>
<p>But today, in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/bungie-unveils-marathon/">a post on the PlayStation Blog</a>, Bungie revealed that the new <em>Marathon</em> would finally be hitting PS5, Windows, and Xbox Series X|S on March 5, narrowing down the month-long March release window <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">announced back in December</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike <em>Destiny 2</em>, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/destiny-2-will-become-free-to-play-later-this-year-fully-cross-platform/">transitioned to a free-to-play model in 2019</a>, the new <em>Marathon</em> sells for $40 in a Standard Edition or a $60 Deluxe Edition that includes some digital rewards and cosmetics. That mirrors the pricing of the somewhat similar <em>Arc Raiders</em>, which recently hit 12 million sales in less than 12 weeks.</p>
<h2>A new kind of <em>Marathon</em></h2>
<p>Unlike the original <em>Marathon</em> trilogy on the ’90s Macintosh—which closely followed on the single-player campaign corridors and deathmatch multiplayer of the original <em>Doom</em>—the new <em>Marathon</em> is described as a “PvPvE survival extraction shooter.” That means gameplay based around exploring distinct zones and scavenging for cosmetics and gear upgrades in exploratory missions alone or with up to two friends, then seeing those missions “break into fast-paced PvP combat” at a moment’s notice, according to the game’s official description.</p>
