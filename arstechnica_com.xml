<p>In place of <em>Doom Eternal</em>'s "jump and shoot" gameplay loop, <em>The Dark Ages</em> focuses on more of a "stand and fight" mentality, the developers said. If <em>Doom Eternal</em> was like flying a fighter jet, then <em>The Dark Ages</em> is more like controlling a tank, they added by way of analogy.</p>

<p>That means a "flatter" game space, where the old-fashioned "strafe-to-aim" strategies work more effectively than in recent <em>Doom</em> games, with less need to be constantly floating through the air. The developers say they're returning to the slower projectile speeds of the original <em>Doom</em> games, too, allowing players to more easily weave between them in a sort of first-person take on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up">shmup pattern</a>. At the same time, your own projectile weapons tend toward the medium to short range, the developers said, encouraging you to take the fight close to the enemies.</p>
<p>While staggering enemies to set up instant Glory Kills is still a core part of <em>The Dark Ages</em>, the developers said the system has been redesigned to avoid taking control away from the player for extended, repetitive canned animations. The new Glory Kill system allows for instant, physics-based attacks that can be activated from any angle without interrupting the gameplay flow.</p>
<h2>The more things change</h2>
<p><em>The Dark Ages</em> developers also promised a more open design, where the usual more linear corridors are interspersed with larger playspaces that let you decide which direction to go and which objective to pursue in what order. And the standard shooting action will be broken up into specific sections where you control a 30-story mech or fly a powerful dragon.</p>

<p>But the core game will still include the requisite raft of secret areas and hidden nooks to discover, the developers promised. This time around, though, those secrets are more directly tied to your power progression rather than just being collectible in-game trinkets, the developers said.</p>
<p>It's all in service of pushing toward a game that feels "new but familiar," Martin said. <em>The Dark Ages</em> is still about the same sense of exploration and power that all good Doom games capture. But Martin said the development team is comfortable experimenting with what that specific sense of power is, "especially if the change you make brings it closer to classic <em>Doom</em>."</p>
<p>But "I want to play a Doom game," he added. "We don't [want to] change so much that it's not a Doom game.</p>
<p>Doom: The Dark Ages<em> is scheduled to hit Windows, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on May 15.</em></p>
