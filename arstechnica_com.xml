<p>The Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPUs won't be totally abandoned after 2025; Nvidia says it will release quarterly security updates for these cards through October 2028. These updates won't optimize performance or fix bugs in any new games, but if you still have an older or hand-me-down PC using one of these cards to play <em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>, you won't be leaving yourself open to GPU-related security exploits.</p>
<p>Nvidia has dropped hints that the end of support for these older GPUs was coming. The company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/nvidia-winding-down-support-for-older-gpus-including-the-legendary-750-ti-and-1060/">announced back in January</a> that CUDA support for the Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta architectures was considered "feature complete" and was being frozen. This is the first time since 2021 that Nvidia has dropped support for older GPUs.</p>
<p>As for Windows 10, Microsoft has been pushing users toward Windows 11 for years, including by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsoft-pushes-full-screen-ads-for-copilot-pcs-on-windows-10-users/">using full-screen ads</a> encouraging people to buy new Copilot+ PCs, but the older operating system still has a sizable user base. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/">According to the Steam Hardware Survey</a>, Windows 10 is in decline, but it still powers over a third of the PCs in the survey as of June 2025, compared to a little over 60 percent for Windows 11.</p>
