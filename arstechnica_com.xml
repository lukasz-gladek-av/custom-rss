          <p>Earlier this month, Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/ram-shortage-delays-valves-steam-machine-desktop-and-steam-frame-headset/">announced</a> it was delaying the release of its new Steam Machine desktop and Steam Frame VR headset due to memory and storage shortages that have been cascading across the PC industry since late 2025. But those shortages are also coming for products that have already launched.</p>
<p>Valve had added a note to its Steam Deck page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">noting</a> that the device would be “out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages.” None of Valve’s three listed Steam Deck configurations are currently available to buy, nor are any of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeckrefurbished">certified refurbished Steam Deck configurations</a> that Valve sometimes offers.</p>
<p>Valve hasn’t announced any price increases for the Deck, at least not yet—the 512GB OLED model is still listed at $549 and the 1TB version at $649. But the basic 256GB LCD model has been formally discontinued now that it has sold out, increasing the Deck’s de facto starting price from $399 to $549. Valve <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/344310/valve-discontinues-steam-deck-lcd-oled-versions-remain#g344310-2">announced in December</a> that it was ending production on the LCD version of the Deck and that it wouldn’t be restocked once it sold out.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck’s hardware is four years old this month, and faster hardware with better chips and higher-resolution screens have been released in the years since. But those Ryzen Z1 and Z2 chips aren’t always dramatically faster than the Deck’s semi-custom AMD chip; many of those handhelds are also considerably more expensive than the OLED Deck’s $549 starting price. When it’s in stock, the Deck still offers compelling performance and specs for the price.</p>
