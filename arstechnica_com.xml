<p><em>Civilization VII</em> launched to mixed reception in early 2025. We liked it when we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/civilization-vii-review-a-major-overhaul-solves-civs-oldest-problems/">reviewed</a> it at Ars, despite some notable shortcomings in terms of polish and user interface, and it has a decent community of dedicated players. However, it makes enormous changes to the classic series’ formula, drawing ideas from competitors like <em>Humankind</em>. Many players feel it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/civilization-vii-one-month-later-the-community-and-developers-chime-in/">strayed too far</a>, and there are still some frustrations with the user interface not showing enough information to players.</p>
<p>It has gotten a steady stream of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/civilization-vii-patch-lets-you-turn-off-some-controversial-new-features/">updates</a> since launch, though, and 2K seems committed to continuing to release content and patches.</p>
<p>This version of <em>Civilization VII</em> is expected to launch on February 5, and it will run on iPhone, Mac, and iPad. There’s no mention of Apple TV, and the App Store page specifically notes that Intel Macs aren’t supported, so you’ll need an M1 or later Mac.</p>
<p>Apple also announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/popular-pc-franchise-civilization-comes-to-apple-arcade-on-february-5/">a few other Arcade releases</a> coming on February 5, including <em>Felicity’s Door</em> and <em>I Love Hue Too+</em>. There will also be Retrocade, a digital arcade that includes <em>Asteroids</em>, <em>Bubble Bobble</em>, <em>Centipede</em>, <em>Galaga</em>, and others. Notably, Retrocade will get a Vision Pro release that will let players play on simulated cabinets in a 3D virtual arcade space.</p>
