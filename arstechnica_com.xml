          <p>It has been over six years since Epic <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/epic-undercuts-steam-with-new-store-that-gives-devs-more-money/">started undercutting Steam's 30 percent revenue share for developers</a>, asking for just 12 percent of sales on its then-new Epic Games Store. Now, Epic is going even further by reducing those fees to zero for a game's first $1 million in annual sales.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update">newly announced fee structure</a> will go into effect in June, Epic said, and will apply to a developer's revenue on a "per app" basis. After the first $1 million in annual sales, apps will be charged the usual 12 percent fee for listing on the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Epic has offered a financial break to smaller developers. Back in 2011, the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/02/no-royalties-on-unreal-development-kit-until-5000-in-sales/">eschewed royalty payments for the first $50,000 in sales</a> for projects made with the newly free Unreal Development Kit. By 2020, that royalty-free grace period for Unreal Engine projects <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/unreal-engine-is-now-royalty-free-until-a-game-makes-a-whopping-1-mill/">was increased to cover the first $1 million in lifetime sales</a> for a project.</p>
<h2>Looking out for the little guy?</h2>
<p>Epic's focus on the low end of the gaming revenue scale is something of an inverse of Valve's fee structure on Steam. In 2018, Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/steam-now-gives-its-biggest-developers-a-bigger-cut-of-the-revenue/">cut its default 30 percent revenue share</a>&nbsp;to 25 percent, but only for lifetime per-game earnings in excess of $10 million. Valve's fee goes down again to 20 percent after a game hits $50 million in lifetime sales.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/gta-vi-will-miss-2025-after-all-new-target-is-may-26-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Rockstar's highly anticipated <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will finally launch on May 26, 2026, Rockstar Games said in <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">a Friday morning announcement</a>.</p>
<p>That means the game will miss the "2025" release window that the developer announced alongside <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-confirms-many-things-including-its-florida-vibes/">the game's first trailer in late 2023</a>. That delay is needed, Rockstar said, so the company can use "this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve."</p>
<p>"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected," Rockstar wrote in its announcement. "The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game."</p>
<h2>A long wait gets longer</h2>
<p>While disappointing for franchise fans, today's official announcement of a delay hasn't exactly been unexpected. Insider sources have been reporting that the 2025 release target looked unlikely <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-development-2026-delay-rockstar-office-release-1851359831">for well over a year now</a>.</p>
<p>"Nobody Iâ€™ve talked to at Rockstar has believed Fall 2025 was a real window for a very long time now," Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x">wrote on Bluesky</a> this morning. "Too much work, not enough time, and what appears to be a real desire from management to avoid brutal crunch. GTA VI slipping to 2026 has seemed inevitable for months if not longer."</p>
<p>The new planned launch date of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> now falls a full 4,634 days after the Sept. 17, 2013 launch of <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. By contrast, there was just a 1,967-day gap between the release of <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and the prior release <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em>, which <em>also</em> launched on the PS3 and Xbox 360 on April 29, 2008.</p>
