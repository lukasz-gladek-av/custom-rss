          <p>When I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/nintendo-switch-2-the-ars-technica-review/">reviewed the Switch 2 back in June</a>, I noted that the lack of any sort of extended grip on the extremely thin Joy-Con 2 controllers made them relatively awkward to hold, both when connected to the system and when cradled in separate hands. At the time, I said that “my Switch 2 will probably need something like <a href="https://nyxigame.com/products/nyxi-hyperion-pro-purple-style-wireless-joy-pad-for-switch-switch-oled?sv1=affiliate&amp;sv_campaign_id=78888&amp;sscid=95943_1769092363_1038034ce8587237102389cdbd188388&amp;awc=95943_1769092363_1038034ce8587237102389cdbd188388">the Nyxi Hyperion Pro</a>, which I’ve come to rely on to make portable play on the original Switch much more comfortable.”</p>
<p>Over half a year later, Nyxi is once again addressing my Switch controller-related comfort concerns with the <a href="https://nyxigame.com/products/nyxi-hyperion-3-wireless-joypad-for-switch-2">Hyperion 3</a>, which was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NYXIGameOFFICIAL/videos/25434137766281969/">made available for preorder earlier this week</a> ahead of planned March 1 shipments. Unfortunately, it looks like players will have to pay a relatively high price for a potentially more ergonomic Switch 2 experience.</p>
<p>While there are <a href="https://www.powera.com/p/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2/controllers/wireless/advantage-wireless-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-black-nsgp0545-01/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=pmax&amp;utm_campaign=gpmax-2025_Jun_6_gpmax-nsw2_smart_paid_sales_all_product&amp;gad_source=1">plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/next-wireless-rechargeable-pro-controller-for-switch-2-switch-midnight/J3R4V77RLK/sku/6601305?utm_source=feed&amp;extStoreId=1129&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=20510845600&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=20510847514">third-party controllers</a> for the Switch 2, none of the current options mimic the official Joy-Cons’ ability to connect magnetically to the console tablet itself (controllers designed to slide into the grooves on the original Switch tablet also can’t hook to the successor console). The Hyperion 3 is the first Switch 2 controller to offer this magnetic connection, making it uniquely suited for handheld play on the system.</p>
<p>And although I haven’t held the Hyperion 3 in my hands yet, my experience with the similar Hyperion 2 on the original Switch suggests that the ergonomic design here will be a welcome upgrade from the relatively small buttons and cramp-inducing flat back of the official Switch 2 Joy-Cons (“Say Goodbye to Tendonitis,” as Nyxi claims in its marketing materials). The controller can also connect wirelessly via Bluetooth 5.0 for when you want to switch to docked play, unlike some Switch Joy-Con replacements that only work in portable mode.</p>
