          <p>Yesterday’s announcement of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">new living room</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/valve-rejoins-the-vr-hardware-wars-with-standalone-steam-frame/">VR hardware</a> from Valve obviously has many gamers clamoring for any news of a more powerful version of the nearly 4-year-old Steam Deck. In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-says-it-has-a-pretty-good-idea-of-what-steam-deck-2-is-going-to-be-explains-why-its-holding-off-for-now">a new interview with IGN</a>, though, Valve Software Engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais says that portable gaming silicon still hasn’t advanced enough to justify brand-new benchmark hardware.</p>
<p>“The thing we’re making sure of is that it’s a worthwhile enough performance upgrade [for a Steam Deck 2] to make sense as a standalone product,” Griffais told IGN. “We’re not interested in getting to a point where it’s 20 or 30 or even 50 percent more performance at the same battery life. We want something a little bit more demarcated than that.”</p>
<p>“So we’ve been working back from silicon advancements and architectural improvements, and I think we have a pretty good idea of what the next version of Steam Deck is going to be, but right now there’s no offerings in that landscape, in the SoC [System on a Chip] landscape, that we think would truly be a next-gen performance Steam Deck,” Griffais continued.</p>
<h2>More power, but at what cost?</h2>
<p>At first glance, Griffais’ comments might seem to run counter to the advancements we’ve seen in portable PC gaming handhelds in recent years. The eight-core Zen 5-based AMD chip in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/rog-xbox-ally-x-the-ars-technica-review/">the recently launched ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, for instance, is significantly more powerful than the four-core Zen 2 chip in the Steam Deck. The newer handheld can push out decent-quality 1080p graphics at reasonable frame rates for many recent games that the old Steam Deck struggles to run at all.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, though, that Griffais said Valve is focused on getting those kinds of performance improvements “at the same battery life.” The ROG Xbox Ally X has a 50 percent larger battery than the original Steam Deck, and it still fully drains that battery in around two hours when running the most taxing games in “Turbo” mode.</p>
