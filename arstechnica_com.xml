<p>If you head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest?tab=23">the Steam Next Fest charts</a> right now, Valve will offer you a glimpse of the 2,228 games offering free downloadable demos as part of the event through Sunday, March 3. That is way too many games to effectively evaluate in such a short time, even with the massive resources of the Ars Orbiting HQ.</p>
<p>But we haven't let that stop us from trying. With the assistance of some early access provided by Valve and game publishers, we've spent the last few days playing dozens and dozens of the most promising Next Fest demos in an attempt to pull out some interesting-looking needles from Valve's massive haystack. Below are the results of that search—a varied list of 11 titles we think are worth investing some time (and zero dollars of money) into a demo download.</p>
<p>But this is just a starting point. Please use the comments below to share any other diamonds in the rough you think your fellow Ars readers need to know about.</p>
<h2><em>Afterblast</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KwBKiG_bVhk?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Lumino Games<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> April 2025<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> FPS, Online Co-Op, Action Roguelike, Roguelite<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1338490/AFTERBLAST/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>Start with the roguelike, room-based shooting action of <em>Returnal</em>. Move it to a first-person perspective and add in the double-jump-and-dash movement system of the new Doom games. Throw in a <em>Halo Infinite</em>-style grappling hook that can be used for traversal or combat. The result would come pretty close to <em>Afterblast</em>, a twitch-action shooter that shines from the jump in this fast-paced demo.</p>
<p>This is the kind of game where halting your movement for even a split second often means being instantly overwhelmed by enemies that swarm from all angles. Rather than being hard to handle, though, the game's zippy movement makes it feel relatively simple to jump and dash from ledge to ledge, avoiding bullet-hell style projectile patterns as you do.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The grappling hook is by far the most satisfying part of the demo, though. Beyond jumping out of the way of opposing fire, you can also use it to drag yourself over to stunned enemies, exploding them into piles of goo and collectible items. Bouncing from enemy to enemy in this way, with a few well-placed jumps and dashes in between, felt like being a kid bouncing on a trampoline.</p>
<p>The <em>Afterblast</em> demo provides a feel for the game's randomized item system, which gives access to automated drones, powerful grenades, and other superpowers that should make each run feel unique. We can't wait to see more.</p>

<h2><em>Castle V Castle</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3WHiA2nZrRE?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Nopopo<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> "Coming soon"<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Card Battler, Roguelite, Card Game, PvE<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3398880/Castle_V_Castle/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>If you remember cult-classic Flash game <a href="https://www.quickflashgames.com/games/castle-wars/"><em>Castle Wars</em></a>, you already know the basics of <em>Castle V Castle</em>. You and your opponent take turns using a handful of cards to either build up your own castle or break down the castle on the other side until one castle has been reduced to rubble. You then improve your deck and do it all again.</p>
<p>Playing effectively means figuring out when to attack, when to defend, and when to use cards to bulk up the various resources needed to play future cards. Strong play requires thinking a few moves ahead, both to avoid being left with a hand of unplayable cards and to counter or reflect potential incoming attacks from your opponent (or deny them the resources they might need).</p>
<p>An extremely clean black and white interface and quick, amusing animations make this a very easy game to pick up and play. But it's the strategy of taking on short-term risks to get long-term rewards that will keep you coming back for round after round. And while the demo's extremely punishing daily challenges are good for some continued longevity, we're hoping the final game will add online multiplayer battles rather than just letting us beat down the AI over and over again.</p>

<h2><em>Dragonkin: The Banished</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ulKicq4lig?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Eko Software<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> March 6, 2025 (Early Access)<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Action, Hack and Slash, Adventure, RPG, Loot<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1863430/Dragonkin_The_Banished/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>If you've grown tired of <em>Diablo IV</em> but are looking for another dark, mouse-based action RPG to scratch the same itch, <em>Dragonkin: The Banished</em> should be right up your alley. Just like in <em>Diablo,</em> the name of the game here is clicking to move and attack swarms of enemies in dark isometric dungeons, throwing in some magical attacks with the number keys on your keyboard as needed.</p>
<p>The <em>Dragonkin</em> demo leads you through a lot of extremely expository and overwrought cutscenes, broken up by short playable vignettes that introduce you to the main character classes: the heavy, the archer, the fire mage, etc. These introductory characters seem extremely overpowered for the early game, cutting through enemy grunts like butter while barely taking a scratch from underpowered opposition attacks. But it gives a good feel for the wide variety of available attacks available, from radiating lightning to a satisfying bull charge.</p>
<p>It's only after this introduction that you're thrown into a more standard challenge, clearing out a dungeon with a low-level character that needs all the help they can get. While the moment to moment gameplay will be familiar to <em>Diablo</em> heads, a few small touches like a handy dash-dodge maneuver make it all lean a bit more towards the "action" side of "action RPG."</p>
<p>If you're looking for pyrotechnic explosions, cinematic cut scenes, and plenty of things to click on, you could definitely do a lot worse.</p>

<h2><em>Glum</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rdCzLAZuzVQ?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>CinderCat Games<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> 2025<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Adventure, Funny, Singleplayer<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2235550/GLUM/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>First-person shooters are obviously all about the shooting—it's right there in the name, after all. But the most satisfying part of these games is often running right up to an enemy and pounding them with a suspiciously powerful close-range melee attack.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><em>Glum</em> takes this satisfying melee bit and makes it the focus of the whole game. Instead of fists or a bludgeoning weapon, though, your main melee weapon in <em>Glum</em> is a steel-toed boot. You'll see that boot hovering menacingly and incongruously in front of you as you zip around vaguely medieval-themed rooms, charging back with a bent knee for perfectly timed strikes as soon as an enemy gets in your face.</p>
<p>The <em>Glum</em> demo already takes this "first-person booter" concept in some interesting directions, providing plenty of barrels and other heavy objects you can convert into single-use projectile weapons with a kick from the right angle. You can also kick off of walls and other angled surfaces to fly through the air in some surprisingly satisfying and floaty platforming, which is key to finding the many secrets hidden in the demo's tutorial-esque rooms.</p>
<p>But the most satisfying part is still kicking an enemy directly and watching the ragdoll corpse fly off a wall and back toward your boot, where you can send it flying into other encroaching foes. The light-hearted comedy action is especially welcome in an industry that sometimes seems full of first-person games that are too full of themselves.</p>

<h2><em>Guntouchables</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bLpofsLLwko?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Game Swing<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> "To be announced"<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Action Roguelike, Multiplayer, Post-apocalyptic<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2543510/GUNTOUCHABLES/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>Seeing and hearing the pre-game logo screen for Ghost Ship Games immediately puts my brain into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/how-deep-rock-galactics-dwarf-miners-have-helped-me-survive-the-pandemic/"><em>Deep Rock Galactic</em></a> mode: headset on, workday stress abandoned, beverage ready. <em>Guntouchables,&nbsp;</em>published by Ghost Ship and developed by Game Swing, could readily fit into that slot. It's a multiplayer-first overhead shooter in which you and up to three other sausage-y folks with tiny stick legs grab loot, kill baddies, and get the heck out of there. If it's been a moment since you and your squad have shot some things together, send them a message and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2543510/GUNTOUCHABLES/">link the demo</a>.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>A horde of mutants have overrun the world, and you and your fellow redneck preppers are having their moment. You pick a weapon, like the precise but slow hunting rifle or pray-and-spray SMG, and a character, each with their own secondary weapons and skill trees. The game shows you a map with stuff to grab or destroy and the car you need to reach to escape. Then you're off, moving with WASD keys and aiming in a circle with a mouse. The demo wasn't ready for controller play yet, but I could see it coming in the future (along with another justification for the trackpads on the Steam Deck).</p>
<p>I cajoled a friend into playing, and we had a great time, both blasting and winning, but also explaining to each other just how dumb that last move was. The game could do more to help you quickly identify and distinguish among your teammates, as they're currently all green names and health bars. And an optional tutorial mission would go a long way to help explain weapon and item mechanics that we had to test out live. But it's a demo, and the core experience—shoot, run, grab, swarm coming, panic—already feels plenty strong. There's a goofy, lightly icky charm to the voice-overs and visuals, and the upgrade paths are pleasantly addictive. It's a ridiculous game with a ridiculous name, and I recommend it.</p>

<h2><em>Hyper Empire</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQhd2lRFaKA?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Fair Weather Studios<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> Q1 2025<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> 4X, Turn-Based Strategy, Auto Battler, Strategy<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3096370/Hyper_Empire/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>When you play an RPG or strategy game, do you spend hours just staring at the tech tree, trying to figure out the upgrade path that will maximize your power going forward? If so, you'll probably love <em>Hyper Empire</em>, a super-condensed 4X space simulation where a good 80 percent of the game is spent staring at a menu screen and deciding how best to spend your limited resources.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>That's actually more interesting than it might initially sound. You need to spend money on a fleet of ships to defend your carrier from potential attack, of course. But spending too much on powerful ships means you can't invest in the outpost stations and tools that will bring in even more resources (and more powerful ships) later in the run. The balance between short-term risk and long-term reward seems well-tuned for those who like to agonize over every potential decision.</p>
<p>When battles inevitably happen, they play out as automated orgies of interstellar explosions that can be a joy to watch, especially once you hit a critical mass of defensive ships. And while random happenings can influence your resources between those battles, none of them have seemed too impactful in the demo so far.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with <em>Hyper Empires</em> right now is that the demo caps out at 30 turns, right when the "just one more turn" resource-building loop is starting to get good. We can't wait to continue to juggle a bunch of numbers like an intergalactic accountant in the full game.</p>

<h2><em>Monaco 2</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKF0feOQcPU?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Pocketwatch Games<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> 2025<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Co-op, Heist, Indie, Arcade, Top-Down, Loot<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063030/Monaco_2/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>It's been well over a decade <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/12/the-prince-of-monaco-andy-schatz-talks-up-his-indie-heist-simulator/">since the first <em>Monaco</em> wowed us</a> with its ultra-stylish overhead "heist simulator" gameplay. This long-delayed sequel keeps the same basic find-the-Macguffin-and-escape gameplay, but now with vibrant 3D graphics and more complex, multi-floor building layouts.</p>
<p>As with the first <em>Monaco</em>, this is a stealth game that doesn't absolutely require stealth. Sure, it's easier if you sneak by the guards and cameras without raising the alarm, using handy sightlines and quiet movements to avoid detection. But if you're found, the game quickly transitions into something of a 3D game of <em>Pac-Man</em>, where you have to outrun the guards and use hidden corridors or hidey-holes to outsmart them.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The <em>Monaco 2</em> demo includes four classes of thieves, each with their own unique way of distracting or avoiding the guards. I especially liked the socialite, who uses a toy poodle to charm nearby guards into ignoring her, and the tech specialist, who can use a drone to interact with doors and items while he hides in relative safety.</p>
<p>The updated 3D viewpoint loses some of the simplistic charm of the original's overhead perspective. Still, this modernized version of the classic stealth game is incredibly easy to pick up and play, especially with a few friends in co-op mode.</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLmMkqeH_9w?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Shiny Shoe<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> "Coming Soon"<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Strategy, Card Game, Roguelike, Demons, PvP<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830/Monster_Train_2/">Steam page</a></p>
<p><em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>is a lot more <em>Monster Train</em>. Given that the original is in my top five of all-time Steam game hours, I'm happy about that. Just 30 minutes into testing it, I had to tell myself, "No, <em>this</em> really is the last round," and physically walk away to enforce it. Well, the last round, and then some upgrade shopping. OK, one more and <em>then</em> no more.</p>
<p><em>Monster Train 2</em> is, like the original, an amalgam of turn-based tactics and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-there-are-861-roguelike-deckbuilders-on-steam-all-of-a-sudden/">roguelike deckbuilding</a>, with a heaven-versus-hell backstory that is arch, goofy, and entirely skippable. Enemies enter your train on the bottom of three decks and fight their way upward, turn by turn. Your card deck has hellish monsters that you place across three levels of your train and spells that can damage, buff your monsters, and debuff their misguided angels. The music is high-energy melodic metal, the art pops off the screen, and the challenge is largely the same: balancing momentary threats against the need to prepare for future baddies.</p>
<p>Besides new monsters, cards, and clans, the sequel adds some new things, all of which might add up to be a bit too much to manage for some folks. Hero-type creatures can have abilities with cooldowns. New card types include equipment you can put on creatures and abilities you can apply to train floors. You can customize your train and upgrade its core pyre with abilities. This demo had me forgetting monster abilities and feeling overwhelmed with where to focus my upgrades. And yet I had a good time, and I'll probably learn a new approach to turn actions over time. Hell, after all, devours the indolent.</p>

<h2><em>Reignbreaker</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vpVDO7G_5eM?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Studio Fizbin<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> March 18, 2025<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Indie, Hack and Slash, Action Roguelike, Combat<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129810/Reignbreaker/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>The surface similarities between <em>Reignbreaker</em> and <em>Hades</em> are hard to ignore. But <em>Reignbreaker</em>'s flavor of isometric run-and-gun-and-bash gameplay sets itself apart instantly with an extremely compelling steampunk aesthetic, full of clanging metal sound effects and relentless robotic enemies. That extends to the art direction, with thick outlines making it easy to pick out the color-coded hazards from the dull blues and grays of the metal-and-stone backgrounds.</p>
<p><em>Reignbreaker</em> also stands out for some extremely chunky-feeling melee attacks and a javelin that can be used for powerful ranged projectiles or slammed down as a temporary turret. Tight controls make it a joy to dash between enemy projectiles as you wait for the opportune moment to go in for the kill. The <em>Reignbreaker</em> demo also shows off a few of the powerful bosses that will require most players to acquire a few permanent power-ups before making it too deep into the game's randomized corridors.</p>
<p>This is one to keep an eye on as <em>Hades 2</em> continues to barrel through Early Access toward its eventual final release</p>

<h2><em>Shuffle Tactics</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LG0WEHIL7RQ?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Club Sandwich<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> "Coming soon"<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Singleplayer, Roguelike, Tactical RPG, Isometric<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186580/Shuffle_Tactics/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>Like any good game with the word "Tactics" in its title, <em>Shuffle Tactics</em> is all about positioning. Move your units on a grid to maximize the damage they can inflict on enemies while minimizing the counterattacks that will inevitably come on their next turn. You know the drill.</p>
<p>But <em>Shuffle Tactics</em> adds just a hint of <em>Slay the Spire</em> into the mix, limiting your actions to those drawn from a deck of cards that you can build and modify between battles. As the game goes on, that means you might not be sure what options will be available on your next turn, forcing some quick improvisation if you want to maximize your chances.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>I'm already a big fan of the demo's satisfying sword-throwing mechanic, which lets you toss your melee weapon for a ranged attack and then call it back for more damage when it returns to your hand. I'm also enamored with the game's evocative pixel-art animations, which make every movement and attack a joy to watch.</p>
<p>My biggest problem is that the demo gets very difficult very quickly; I had quite a few runs fall apart incredibly early when faced with an unavoidable "Elite" matchup that I wasn't yet powerful enough to conquer. Hopefully. the developer can work out the balancing issues before launch because this mix of tactical strategy and card-based luck is a match made in heaven.</p>

<h2><em>Squirreled Away</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LhJk44xeF6w?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Far Seas<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> "Coming soon"<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Exploration, Third Person, Cute, Relaxing<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2977620/Squirreled_Away/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>"Be the squirrel" is Far Seas' description of its upcoming game, and while that's a big promise, <em>Squirreled Away </em>seems on track to deliver. You're not <em>just</em> a squirrel, mind you, but a tool-crafting, home-building, achievement-unlocking squirrel, owing to the demands of the gaming format. But when moving around, you get to experience the manic, sticky-pawed, and often weightless nature of squirreldom. Why do squirrels run corkscrews around the perimeter of a tree instead of climbing straight up? Maybe because, like me, they're trying to keep up with their camera view on their right controller stick while moving with the left.</p>
<p><em>Squirreled Away</em>'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3453320/Squirreled_Away_Demo/">demo</a> gives you a taste of its core mechanics, like stashing away items in a cache for winter or building an axe out of a pebble and twig so you can break larger branches into sticks for a fellow squirrel. The look, feel, and sound of the experience are decidedly calm, with single-instrument melodies lilting in and out as you scamper about, gather resources, and unlock quests and areas. You have health and stamina bars, but the game is gentle if you run them out, sending you back to safety or reminding you to eat some food.</p>
<p>It feels like a more kinetic <em>Animal Crossing</em>, with friendly animals and low-stakes challenges. Except that at any time, you could bail on your tasks, scamper upward, and leap from one far-out branch to another, living out the daydreams of anybody who works next to a window overlooking a tree.</p>
