<p>The itch.io domain was back up and running by 7 am Eastern, according to media reports, "after the registrant finally responded to our notice and took appropriate action to resolve the issue." Users could access the site throughout if they typed the itch.io IP address into their web browser directly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.brandshield.com/">BrandShield's website</a> describes it as a service that "detects and hunts online trademark infringement, counterfeit sales, and brand abuse across multiple platforms.” The company claims to have multiple Fortune 500 and FTSE100 companies on its client list.</p>
<p>In its own series of social media posts, BrandShield <a href="https://x.com/BrandShieldltd/status/1866143933320892707">said</a> its "AI-driven platform" had identified "an abuse of Funko... from an itch.io subdomain." The takedown request it filed was focused on that subdomain, not the entirety of itch.io, BrandShield said.</p>
<p>"The temporary takedown of the website was a decision made by the service providers, not BrandShield or Funko."</p>
<p>The whole affair highlights how the delicate web of domain registrars and DNS servers can remain a key failure point for web-based businesses. Back in May, we saw how the desyncing of a single DNS root server <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/dns-glitch-that-threatened-internet-stability-fixed-cause-remains-unclear/">could cause problems across the entire Internet</a>. And in 2012, the hacking collective Anonymous highlighted <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/03/how-anonymous-plans-to-use-dns-as-a-weapon/">the potential for a coordinated attack</a> to take down the entire DNS system.</p>
