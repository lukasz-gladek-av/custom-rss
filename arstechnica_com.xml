          <p>This morning's announcement that Nintendo is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-to-assess-trump-tariff-effects/">delaying US preorders for the Switch 2</a> immediately increased the salience of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/critics-suspect-trumps-weird-tariff-math-came-from-chatbots/">President Trump's proposed wide-reaching import tariffs</a> for millions of American Nintendo fans. Additionally, the Entertainment Software Association—a lobbying group that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/gaming-trade-org-for-dmca-theres-no-such-thing-as-an-obsolete-game/">represents the game industry's interests</a> in Washington—is warning that the effects of Trump's tariffs on the gaming world won't stop with Nintendo.</p>
<p>"There are so many devices we play video games on," ESA senior vice president Aubrey Quinn <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/esa-responds-to-trump-tariffs-if-we-think-its-just-the-switch-2-then-we-arent-taking-it-seriously">said in an interview with IGN</a> just as Nintendo's preorder delay news broke. "There are other consoles... VR headsets, our smartphones, people who love PC games; if we think it's just the Switch, then we aren't taking it seriously.</p>
<p>"This is company-agnostic, this is an entire industry," she continued. "There's going to be an impact on the entire industry."</p>
<p>While Trump's tariff proposal includes a 10 percent tax on imports from pretty much every country, it also includes a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam and a 54 percent total tariff on China, the two countries where most console hardware is produced. Quinn told IGN that it's "hard to imagine a world where tariffs like these don’t impact pricing" for those consoles.</p>
<p>More than that, though, Quinn warns that massive tariffs would tamp down overall consumer spending, which would have knock-on effects for game industry revenues, employment, and research and development investment.</p>
<p>"Video game consoles are sold under tight margins in order to reduce the barrier to entry for consumers," the ESA notes in <a href="https://www.theesa.com/issues/tariffs/">its issue page on tariffs</a>. "Tariffs mean that the additional costs would be passed along to consumers, resulting in a ripple effect of harm for the industry and the jobs it generates and supports.</p>
<h2>Not just a foreign problem</h2>
<p>The negative impacts wouldn't be limited to foreign companies like Nintendo, Quinn warned, because "even American-based companies, they're getting products that need to cross into American borders to make those consoles, to make those games. And so there's going to be a real impact regardless of company."</p>
