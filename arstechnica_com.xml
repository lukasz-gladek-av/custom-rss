<p>Epic Games has disabled a <em>Fortnite</em> emote based on the HBO show <em>Peacemaker</em> after the latest episode cast the dancing animation in a potentially different light.</p>
<p><em>The remainder of this post contains spoilers for Season 2 of Peacemaker.</em></p>
<p>The "Peaceful Hips" emote, which was first introduced to the game on September 15, mirrors the dance motions that John Cena's character Christopher Smith makes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS11-GIemXY">during the opening credits sequence</a> for the show's second season. In the dance and the emote (which can be applied to any character in-game), the dancer briefly flails their arms at opposing right angles before shaking their hips seductively.</p>
<p>Some are seeing the dance in a different light after the sixth episode of the show's second season, "Ignorance is Chris," which revealed that the alternate universe featured throughout the season has been controlled by swastika-brandishing Nazis. With that knowledge front of mind, the arm movements in the dance emote could be seen as a winking reference to the arms of a swastika.</p>
<p>"[In] season 2 there's a lot more of the story of the season in the intro, [in] the first season there wasn't as much of a reference to the story," choreographer Charissa Barton <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdtN4MTYXQM">said in a video interview</a> posted by Warner Bros. last month.</p>

<h2>The arm motions mean <em>what</em>?</h2>
<p>Fans have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PeacemakerShow/comments/1npn95v/90_probability_its_a_nazi_dimension_but_heres/">picking up on hints</a> of the show's eventual Nazi-related reveal (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PeacemakerShow/comments/1nm9772/hidden_nazi_hints_in_the_opening_dance_sequence/">including from that opening dance</a>) as the second season has aired over recent weeks. But the confirmation of the link in Sunday's episode had Epic quickly re-evaluating the emote by Sunday night.</p>
