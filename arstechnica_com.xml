<p>With those games excluded, SonixLegend's collection actually encompasses the vast majority of the 45,000 or so "full profile" paid games <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/">tracked by SteamDB</a>. But with <a href="https://steamspy.com/year/">thousands of new games being released on Steam every year</a>, it might not be long until a badge for 50,000 owned games becomes a real possibility.</p>
<h2>So whatâ€™s good?</h2>
<p>It's hard to gauge just how much of SonixLegend's massive Steam collection officially counts as a "backlog" since their private account doesn't offer a public breakdown of playtime for most individual titles. That said, there are only 261 games for which SonixLegend has earned at least one achievement and only <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/SonixLegend/recommended/">16 that were good enough to merit a user review</a> (they all ended up as "Recommended").</p>
<p>The implications of SonixLegend trying to actually work through their Steam backlog can be more than a little intimidating, though. <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/steam?userName=SonixLegend">HowLongToBeat data</a> suggests that finishing just the "top 2,500" games in SonixLegend's Steam collection would take over 2,463 days, or nearly seven years of 24/7 gameplay.</p>
<p>Ironically, SonixLegend's favorite game isn't even one that counts toward their record-setting badge. The user's Steam profile page lists 551 hours spent playing Valve's 2010 free-to-play overhead shooter <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/630"><em>Alien Swarm</em></a>. In a way, it's nice to know that, even with access to nearly every paid modern PC game in existence, the one game this user keeps coming back to is a 15-year-old title that doesn't cost a penny.</p>
