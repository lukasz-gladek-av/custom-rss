<p>You can read a lot more about original Switch games' compatibility on the Switch 2, "Editions," and upgrade packs <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/some-original-switch-games-will-run-better-on-switch-2-some-wont-run-at-all/">elsewhere in Ars' Switch 2 launch coverage</a>.</p>

      Switch 2's "Partner Spotlight," Part 1

          </p>

<p>With the promise of new hardware capable of 1080p, 120 frames per second, HDR, and even mouse capabilities, the Switch 2 is getting attention from developers eager to make up for lost time—and stake out a place on a sequel to the system that sold more than 150 million hardware units.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition</em>,&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 0</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Street Fighter 6, </em><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</em> <em>Intergrade</em> stood out as games from the near-to-middle past slated to arrive on the Switch 2.</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake,</em>&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6, Civilization 7, </em>and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> are due to arrive at launch on June 5, with the rest arriving in 2025.</p>

<h2>Notable independents (most notably <em>Silksong)</em></h2>

<p>The cruel games industry joke, ever since&nbsp;<em>Silksong's</em> announcement in 2019, is that the game, originally intended as DLC for acclaimed platformer/Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>, is always due to be announced, never gets announced, and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-reach-as-yet-unheard-of-levels-of-cope-as-the-metroidvanias-nintendo-switch-store-page-briefly-disappears/">resumes torturing its expectant fans</a>.</p>
<p>But there it was, for a blip of a moment in the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal:&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>, coming in "2025." That's all that is known: it will, purportedly, arrive on this console in 2025. It was initially due to arrive on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox when it was announced, but that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Another delayed indie gem,&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>, a kinda-sequel to <em>Undertale</em>, purports to land all four chapters of its parallel story on Switch 2 at the console's launch.</p>
<p>Other notable games from across the studio-size spectrum:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>(2025)</li>
<li><em>Split Fiction</em> (at launch)</li>
<li><em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster&nbsp;</em>(at launch)</li>
<li><em>Enter the Gungeon</em> 2 ("Coming soon")</li>
<li><em>Two Point</em> Museum (2025)</li>
<li><em>Human Fall Flat 2&nbsp;</em>("Coming soon")</li>
</ul>
<h2>The legally distinct game that sure looks like <em>Bloodborne 2</em></h2>

<p>The next original game from FromSoftware, maker of beautifully realized finger-torture titles like <em>Elden Ring</em> and the&nbsp;Dark Souls series, is a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive,&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods. </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niKHDEKQ7xA">The trailer</a>, with its gore-etched hands, gothic churches, and eldritch/Victorian machinery, certainly stood out from the <em>Kirby</em> and&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong</em> games around it. The game arrives sometime in 2026.</p>
