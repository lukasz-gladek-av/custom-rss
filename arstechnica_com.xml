<h2>Viral success (for someone else)</h2>
<p>VoltekPlay <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1j3zr6n/comment/mg4va8a/">writes on Reddit</a> that it was only alerted to the existence of <em>My Baby or Not!</em> on iOS by "a suspicious burst of traffic on our itch.io page—all coming from Google organic search." Only after adding a "where did you find our game?" player poll to the page were the developers made aware of some <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@moonliteskye/video/7478018135375842568">popular TikTok videos</a> featuring the iOS version.</p>
<p>"Luckily, some people in the [Tiktok] comments mentioned the real game name—<em>Diapers, Please!</em>—so a few thousand players were able to google their way to our page," VoltekPlay writes. "I can only imagine how many more ended up on the thief’s App Store page instead."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the $2.99 iOS release of <em>My Baby or Not!</em> was <a href="https://app.sensortower.com/overview/6742455066?country=US&amp;tab=category_rankings">quickly climbing iOS's paid games charts</a>, attracting an estimated 20,000 downloads overall, <a href="https://app.sensortower.com/publisher/ios/1758988688/?page=1&amp;page_size=25">according to Sensor Tower</a>.</p>

<p>The App Store listing credited <em>My Baby or Not!</em> to "Marwane Benyssef," a new iOS developer with no apparent history in the game development community. Benyssef's only other iOS game, <em>Kiosk Food Night Shift</em>, was released last August and appears to be a direct copy of <em>Kiosk</em>, a pay-what-you-want title that was <a href="https://vividev.itch.io/kiosk/">posted to itch.io last year</a> (with a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126330/Kiosk/">subsequent "full" release on Steam</a> this year)</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1j3zr6n/someone_stole_our_game_from_itchio_renamed_it_and/">a Reddit post</a>, the team at VoltekPlay said that they had filed a DMCA copyright claim against <em>My Baby or Not!</em> Apple subsequently shared that claim with Bennysof, VoltekPlay writes, along with a message that "Apple encourages the parties to a dispute to work directly with one another to resolve the claim."</p>
<p>This morning, Ars reached out to Apple to request a comment on the situation. While awaiting a response (which Apple has yet to provide), Apple appears to have removed Benyssef's developer page and all traces of their games from the iOS App Store.</p>
