          <p>Nvidia will release the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/even-more-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-games-and-updates-released/">GeForce RTX 5060</a> on May 19 starting at $299, the company announced via press release today. The new card, a successor to popular past GPUs like the GTX 1060 and RTX 3060, will bring Nvidia's DLSS 4 and Multi Frame-Generation technology to budget-to-mainstream gaming builds—at least, it <em>would</em>&nbsp;if every single GPU launched by any company at any price wasn't instantly selling out these days.</p>
<p>Nvidia announced a May release for the 5060 last month when it released the RTX 5060 Ti for $379 (8GB) and $429 (16GB). Prices for that card so far haven't been&nbsp;<em>as&nbsp;</em>inflated as they have been for the RTX 5070 on up, but the cheapest ones you can currently get are still between $50 and $100 over that MSRP. Unless Nvidia and its partners have made dramatically more RTX 5060 cards than they've made of any other model so far, expect this card to carry a similar pricing premium for a while.</p>

<p>Compared to the RTX 4060, the RTX 5060 adds a few hundred extra CUDA cores and gets a big memory bandwidth increase thanks to the move from GDDR6 to GDDR7. But its utility at higher resolutions will continue to be limited by its 8GB of RAM, which is already becoming a problem for a handful of high-end games at 1440p and 4K.</p>
<p>Regardless of its performance, the RTX 5060 will likely become a popular mainstream graphics card, just like its predecessors. Of the Steam Hardware Survey's top 10 GPUs, three are RTX xx60-series desktop GPUs (the 3060, 4060, and 2060); the laptop versions of the 4060 and 3060 are two of the others. If supply of the RTX 5060 is adequate and pricing isn't out of control, we'd expect it to shoot up these charts pretty quickly over the next few months.</p>

<p>Last month, Nintendo and its third-party partners revealed that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2s-gameless-game-key-cards-are-going-to-be-very-common/">many</a> of the "physical" games on the Switch 2 would be made available <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendos-game-key-cards-for-the-switch-2/">only as "Digital Key Cards."</a> Unlike traditional physical Switch games—which contain flash memory with the necessary data to play the game on the card itself—these key cards will simply enable the holder to download a copy of the game to their system and play that copy if and when the transferable key card is inserted in the system.</p>
<p>Already, many players are thinking ahead to what this means for their ability to play Game Key Card releases well into the future. It's not hard to find potential Switch 2 owners publicly worrying about games <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendo%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cgame-key-cards%E2%80%9D-for-the-switch-2.1506662/#post-43644552">"disappear[ing] into the void"</a> or becoming "effectively a worthless piece of plastic/e-waste" when Nintendo eventually disables its Switch 2 game download servers. Some go even farther, calling a Game Key Card <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1jtpjiy/comment/mlvyf6h/">an "eighty dollar rental"</a> rather than a real game purchase.</p>
<p>While these are valid long-term concerns, I think some players are underestimating the likely timeline for when Game Key Cards will become "useless e-waste." As it stands, we already have an example of Nintendo supporting continued downloads of games purchased nearly two decades ago and counting.</p>
<h2>The enduring Virtual Console</h2>
<p>When Nintendo launched the Wii in November 2006, it also launched the Wii Virtual Console <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2006/11/8124/">with 30 downloadable titles</a> ranging from <em>Super Mario 64</em> to <em>Urban Champion</em>. And it may surprise you to learn that Virtual Console purchases made the day the Wii launched can still be redownloaded from Nintendo's servers to this day.</p>
<p>I know it surprised me when I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/nintendo-switch-2%E2%80%99s-gameless-game-key-cards-are-going-to-be-very-common.1507000/page-2#post-43684635">read about it</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wii/comments/17pxta1/can_you_still_redownload_wii_games_on_the_digital/">various forum threads</a> in recent weeks. I've been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/04/end-of-an-era-many-wii-online-services-shutting-down-in-june/">writing</a> about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/the-day-the-mario-kart-died-nintendos-killswitch-and-the-future-of-online-consoles/">the shutdown</a> of the Wii's various online services for years, not to mention <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/why-game-archivists-are-dreading-this-months-3ds-wii-u-eshop-shutdown/">the high-profile shutdown of the 3DS and Wii U eShops</a> in 2023. By now, I figured that Nintendo had pulled the final plug on whatever aging server was letting Wii Virtual Console (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/05/wiiware-review/">WiiWare</a>) downloads limp along.</p>

<p>True, Nintendo shut off <em>new</em> downloadable game purchases on the Wii in 2019, likely to avoid the financial and customer support hassles of providing payment services for a vanishingly small market of players still actively buying games on the Wii. But when it comes to downloading old purchases, the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Wii/Troubleshooting/Wii-Shop-Channel/Missing-previously-downloaded-games/Missing-previously-downloaded-games-241877.html?srsltid=AfmBOoo1cZU7wGwS4tffto7ToGLE0CMmwIiS2rBi6yVDVEJAN5tkr0u5">official support site</a> still says that "as long as you are using the same Wii console you used to originally download the game, you will be able to re-download it should the game be lost or deleted."</p>
<p>Sure enough, just yesterday, I was able to plug in my aging Wii U, flip over to Wii mode (which still contains <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/12/the-long-frustrating-road-to-recovering-my-wii-downloads/">my recovered and transferred Virtual Console games licenses</a>) and download fresh copies of games like <em>Actraiser</em> and <em>Bonk's Adventure</em> like it was still 2006 (the same goes for redownloading previous Wii U and 3DS game purchases on those consoles, by the way).</p>
<p>When it comes to the longevity of a downloadable purchase, Nintendo now comes close to rivaling Steam, where players can still redownload <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-half-life-2-helped-sell-steam-to-a-skeptical-pc-gaming-market/">the copy of <em>Half-Life 2</em> they purchased over 20 years ago</a>. And while those Wii downloads are frustratingly tied to the original hardware used to make the purchase, the Switch 2's Game Key Cards ensure any future downloads will be easily portable to different hardware units.</p>

<h2>Past performance, future results</h2>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that Nintendo has kept the game download servers for the Wii active even though it hasn't <em>sold</em> any new downloadable Wii games for roughly six years. At this point, any server hardware and bandwidth Nintendo is using to support Wii downloads is nothing but a financial loss for the company (unlike Steam, where Valve is at least <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/">still selling fresh copies of <em>Half-Life 2</em></a> to new generations of PC gamers). The fact that Nintendo is still willing to provide those downloads with no direct financial upside suggests good things about its future commitment to Game Key Cards.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>You could even argue that Nintendo is <em>more</em> likely to offer longer-term support for Game Key Card downloads since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-will-play-original-switch-games/">backward compatibility seems to be a priority for the Switch hardware line</a>. If we presume that future Switch systems will remain backward compatible, we can probably also presume that Nintendo will want players on new hardware to still have access to their old Game Key Card purchases (or to be able to use Game Key Cards purchased on the secondhand market).</p>

<p>There are no guarantees in life, of course, and nothing lasts forever. Nintendo will one day go out of business, at which point it seems unlikely that a Game Key Card will be able to download much of anything. Short of that, Nintendo could suffer a financial malady that makes download servers for legacy systems seem like an indulgence, or it could come under new management that doesn't see value in supporting decades-old purchases made for ancient consoles.</p>
<p>As of this writing, though, Nintendo has kept its Wii game download servers active for 6,743 days and counting. If the Switch 2 Game Key Card servers last as long, that means those cards will still be fully functional through at least October 2043.</p>
<p>I don't know what I will be doing with my life in 2043, but it's comforting and extremely plausible to imagine that the "eighty dollar rental" I made of a Switch 2 Game Key Card back in 2025 will still work as intended.</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, I think it's highly likely that I will become "e-waste" long before any Switch 2 Game Key Cards.</p>
