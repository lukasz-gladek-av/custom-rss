<h2>You can do better than that</h2>
<p>That’s a moderately useful option for cloud-curious Xbox players that might not be willing to take the plunge on a monthly subscription, we suppose. But it also feels like Microsoft could come up with some more imaginative ways to use Cloud Gaming to reach occasional players in new ways.</p>
<p>What’s stopping Microsoft from offer streaming players a 30-minute timed demo stream of <em>any</em> available Xbox Cloud Gaming title—perhaps in exchange for watching a short ad, or perhaps simply as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/01/xbox-live-arcade-portolio-planner-sounds-off-about-demos/">an Xbox Live Arcade-style sales juicing tactic</a>? Or why not offer discounted access to a streaming-only Game Pass subscription for players willing to watch occasional ads, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/netflix-rolls-out-its-basic-with-ads-plan-in-the-us-and-beyond/">like Netflix</a>? Microsoft could even let players spend a couple of bucks to rent a digital copy of the title for a few days, much as services like iTunes do for newer films.</p>
<p>Those are just a few ideas off the top of our heads. And they all feel potentially more impactful than using ads as a way to let Xbox players stream copies of games they already purchased.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/despite-revolutionary-promises-stadias-biz-model-is-pure-establishment/">noted</a> how Stadia’s strictly buy-before-you-play streaming business model limited the appeal of what ended up as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/google-stadia-officially-shuts-down-january-2023-will-refund-game-purchases/">a doomed cloud-gaming experiment</a>. Microsoft should take some lessons from Google’s failure and experiment with new ways to use streaming to reach players that might not have access to the latest high-end hardware for their gaming experiences.</p>
