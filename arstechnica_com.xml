          <p>Nvidia is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/nvidia-partners-leak-next-gen-rtx-50-series-gpus-including-a-32gb-5090/">reportedly gearing up to launch</a> the first few cards in its RTX 50-series at CES next week, including an RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070. The 5090 will be of particular interest to performance-obsessed, money-is-no-object PC gaming fanatics since it's the first new GPU in over two years that can beat the performance of 2022's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/rtx-4090-review-nvidias-biggest-gpu-is-easily-its-best/">RTX 4090</a>.</p>
<p>But boosted performance and slower advancements in chip manufacturing technology mean that the 5090's maximum power draw will far outstrip the 4090's, according to leakers. VideoCardz reports that the 5090's thermal design power (TDP) will be set at 575 W, up from 450 W for the already power-hungry RTX 4090. The RTX 5080's TDP is also increasing to 360 W, up from 320 W for the RTX 4080 Super.</p>
<p>That also puts the RTX 5090 close to the maximum power draw available over a single 12VHPWR connector, which is capable of delivering up to 600 W of power (though once you include the 75 W available via the PCI Express slot on your motherboard, the actual maximum possible power draw for a GPU with a single 12VHPWR connector is a slightly higher 675 W).</p>
<p>Higher peak power consumption doesn't necessarily mean that these cards will always draw more power during actual gaming than their 40-series counterparts. And their performance could be good enough that they could still be very efficient cards in terms of performance per watt.</p>
<p>But if you're considering an upgrade to an RTX 5090 and these power specs are accurate, you may need to consider an upgraded power supply along with your new graphics card. Nvidia recommends at least an 850 W power supply for the RTX 4090 to accommodate what the GPU needs while leaving enough power left over for the rest of the system. An additional 125 W bump suggests that Nvidia will recommend a 1,000 W power supply as the minimum for the 5090.</p>
<p>We'll probably know more about Nvidia's next-gen cards after <a href="https://www.ces.tech/attendee-guides/nvidia-keynote/">its CES keynote</a>, currently scheduled for 9:30 pm Eastern/6:30 pm Pacific on Monday, January 6.</p>

          <p>With Valve's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">impressive work on the Proton tool for Linux</a> and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2023/06/apple-has-a-proton-like-game-porting-toolkit-for-getting-windows-games-on-mac/">Mac's Game Porting Toolkit</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/new-directx-12-to-metal-translation-could-bring-a-world-of-windows-games-to-macos/">CrossOver</a> options, few games are truly "Windows only" these days. The exceptions are those with aggressive, Windows-based anti-cheating tools baked in, something that hit back hard against players eager to dive into a new superhero shooter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, an <em>Overwatch</em>-ish free-to-play hero shooter released in early December 2024, has all the typical big online game elements: an in-game shop with skins and customizations, battle passes, and anti-cheating tech. While Proton, which powers the Linux-based Steam Deck's ability to play just about any Windows game, has come very far in a few years' time, its biggest blind spots are these kinds of online-only games, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/gta-online-is-broken-on-steam-deck-following-anti-cheat-update/">like <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/"><em>Fortnite</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/">Apex Legends</a>,&nbsp;</em>and the like. The same goes for Mac players, who, if they can work past DirectX 12, can often get a Windows game working in CrossOver or Parallels, minus any anti-cheat tools.</p>
<p>Is there harm in trying? For a while, there was 100 years' worth. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/1hrsitf/marvel_rivals_banning_mac_os_users/">detailed in the r/macgaming subreddit</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1hs39mf/can_proton_cause_you_to_get_flagged_for_cheating/">at r/SteamDeck</a>, many players who successfully got <em>Marvel Rivals</em> working would receive a "Penalty Issued" notice, with a violation "detected" and bans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hs2s6z/ban_until_2124_for_cheating_but_i_didnt_cheat/">issued until 2124</a>. Should such a ban stand, players risked entirely missing the much-prophesied Year of the Linux Desktop or Mainstream Mac Gaming, almost certain to happen at some point in that span.</p>
