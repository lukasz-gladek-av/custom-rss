          <p>Here at Ars, we're judicious about which of the many, many Switch 2 rumors we decide to highlight on this page. For every report on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/what-do-we-know-about-the-switch-2s-hardware-power/">hardware power</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/report-switch-2-joy-cons-will-attach-via-magnets/">magnetic Joy-Cons</a> that we share, there are probably five others we see and decide are too lightly sourced, too unlikely, or just too plain obscure to spread here.</p>
<p>But when we started hearing reports that the Switch 2's Joy-Cons could be cradled on their sides and manipulated like a full-fledged gaming mouse, we knew the concept was one you'd want to hear about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Rumor: More images of Switch 2 Joy-Cons have immerged from China.</p>

<p>The rumors of mouse-like functionality on the Switch 2's included controllers got supercharged over the weekend when a Reddit poster <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hu3rte/new_joycon_photos_from_chinese_sns/">shared detailed photos of purported Switch 2 Joy-Cons</a>, sourced from an unnamed Chinese social media user. In between the longer shoulder buttons along the Joy-Con's inner edge (SL and SR) and a new central connector port, eagle-eyed viewers noticed what looks suspiciously like the optical sensor that sits on the bottom of practically every mouse these days.</p>
<p>That could suggest a mode where you stand the controller up vertically against a hard surface and slide it around like a mouse. The layout would even allow a user to put a thumb on the face buttons and an index finger on the shoulder buttons for various "click" functions.</p>
