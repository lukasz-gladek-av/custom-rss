          <p>AMD's new Radeon RX 90-series cards and the RDNA4 architecture make their official debut on March 5, and a new version of AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) upscaling technology is coming along with them.</p>
<p>FSR and Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) upscalers have the same goal: to take a lower-resolution image rendered by your graphics card, bump up the resolution, and fill in the gaps between the natively rendered pixels to make an image that looks <em>close</em> to natively rendered without making the GPU do all that rendering work. These upscalers can make errors, and they won't always look quite as good as a native-resolution image. But they're both nice alternatives to living with a blurry, non-native-resolution picture on an LCD or OLED display.</p>
<p>FSR and DLSS are especially useful for older or cheaper 1080p or 1440p-capable GPUs that are connected to a 4K monitor, where you'd otherwise have to decide between a sharp 4K image and a playable frame rate; it's also useful for hitting higher frame rates at lower resolutions, which can be handy for high-refresh-rate gaming monitors.</p>
<p>But unlike past versions of FSR, FSR 4 is upscaling images using hardware-backed machine-learning algorithms, hardware newly added to RDNA4 and the RX 90-series graphics cards. This mirrors Nvidia's strategy with DLSS, which has always leveraged the tensor cores found in RTX GPUs to run machine-learning models to achieve superior image quality for upscaled and AI-generated frames. If you don't have an RDNA4 GPU, you can't use FSR 4.</p>
