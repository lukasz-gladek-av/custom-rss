          <p>With Valve's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">impressive work on the Proton tool for Linux</a> and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2023/06/apple-has-a-proton-like-game-porting-toolkit-for-getting-windows-games-on-mac/">Mac's Game Porting Toolkit</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/new-directx-12-to-metal-translation-could-bring-a-world-of-windows-games-to-macos/">CrossOver</a> options, few games are truly "Windows only" these days. The exceptions are those with aggressive, Windows-based anti-cheating tools baked in, something that hit back hard against players eager to dive into a new superhero shooter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, an <em>Overwatch</em>-ish free-to-play hero shooter released in early December 2024, has all the typical big online game elements: an in-game shop with skins and customizations, battle passes, and anti-cheating tech. While Proton, which powers the Linux-based Steam Deck's ability to play just about any Windows game, has come very far in a few years' time, its biggest blind spots are these kinds of online-only games, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/gta-online-is-broken-on-steam-deck-following-anti-cheat-update/">like <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/"><em>Fortnite</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/">Apex Legends</a>,&nbsp;</em>and the like. The same goes for Mac players, who, if they can work past DirectX 12, can often get a Windows game working in CrossOver or Parallels, minus any anti-cheat tools.</p>
<p>Is there harm in trying? For a while, there was 100 years' worth. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/1hrsitf/marvel_rivals_banning_mac_os_users/">detailed in the r/macgaming subreddit</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1hs39mf/can_proton_cause_you_to_get_flagged_for_cheating/">at r/SteamDeck</a>, many players who successfully got <em>Marvel Rivals</em> working would receive a "Penalty Issued" notice, with a violation "detected" and bans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hs2s6z/ban_until_2124_for_cheating_but_i_didnt_cheat/">issued until 2124</a>. Should such a ban stand, players risked entirely missing the much-prophesied Year of the Linux Desktop or Mainstream Mac Gaming, almost certain to happen at some point in that span.</p>
