<p>In the descriptions for those videos, though, Coincident acknowledged some of the reasons that Okuplok's level has been "deemed impossible to beat in one segment" on Ultra Violence difficulty. Even if you have a perfect strategy mapped out for each segment, "some of the later fights are a pure RNG grind," he wrote. "Losing multiple 5-hour-long [Ultra Violence] runs over and over again that late into the map would drive me insane."</p>

      Coincident's strategy videos for the slaughter map highlight just how tough even the "easy" sections are to complete.

<p>The slaughter level's "wildly varying levels of difficulty between each fight" are "extremely frustrating as a challenge, especially when you die to a difficult fight, after having cleared several easy (and borderline boring) fights for 3 hours," Coincident continued in another video description. "Some consider that the only reason why no one has single-segmented Okuplok on UV yet is because no one even wants to try. I wouldn't be surprised."</p>
<h2>“It’s over!”</h2>
<p>Nonetheless, over the weekend, Coincident proved he was willing to try what he once considered an "impossible" task. His grueling, six-hour-long marathon isn't actually that fun to watch at many points. The occasional moments of intense, close-quarters combat are punctuated by long segments where Coincident circle-strafes endlessly around large hordes, waiting for enemies to hurt each other with incidental damage so he can conserve ammunition. He also kills many <a href="https://gamicus.fandom.com/wiki/Kiting">kited enemies</a> one by one in corridors or through small gaps to keep things as safe as possible.</p>
<p>Even if you're not willing to sit through six hours of that kind of meticulous gameplay, it can be thrilling to jump around the stream and revel in the portions where Coincident shows off some extremely precise, near-perfect dodging through arenas filled with projectiles and floors littered with pixelated corpses. The drama gets especially intense near the end, when Coincident's breathing becomes noticeably heavy before finishing the run with a flashy rocket to the face just as he hits the exit panel.</p>
<p>"Yes! Fuck yes!" Coincident exclaims after the run is finally over. "Okuplok is done! Done, done, done, done, done! ... Oh my god, what a ride, this was quite the ride... It's done, I don't have to run this again! It's over!"</p>
