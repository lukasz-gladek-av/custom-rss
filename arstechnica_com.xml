          <p><em>Neverwinter Nights</em> came out in 2002 and received an enhanced edition in 2018. In 2025, that should really be it, but there's something special about Bioware's second dip into the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> universe. The energy from the game's community is strong enough that, based largely on the work of "unpaid software engineers," the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/704450/view/511820969218671050">received a new patch last week</a>.</p>
<p><em>Neverwinter Nights (NN) Enhanced Edition</em> (on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/704450/Neverwinter_Nights_Enhanced_Edition/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/neverwinter_nights_enhanced_edition_pack">GOG</a>)&nbsp;now has anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering built in, major improvements to its networking code and performance, and <a href="https://nwn.beamdog.net/docs/">more than 100 other improvements</a>. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/23-year-old-d-and-d-rpg-neverwinter-nights-just-got-a-new-update-thanks-to-the-unpaid-software-engineers-of-its-unkillable-community/">noted by PC Gamer</a>,&nbsp;<em>NN</em> was originally built for single-core CPUs, so while it may seem odd to seek "major" improvements to performance for a 23-year-old RPG, it is far from optimized for modern systems.</p>
<p><em>NN&nbsp;</em>received a similar fan-led patch, described as "a year-long love effort" by community developers, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/one-of-my-favorite-dandd-videogames-is-still-getting-beefy-updates-after-21-years/">in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's not so surprising that&nbsp;<em>NN </em>achieved this kind of fan-driven immortality. Opinions vary on the virtues of its single-player campaigns, but its "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/23-year-old-d-and-d-rpg-neverwinter-nights-just-got-a-new-update-thanks-to-the-unpaid-software-engineers-of-its-unkillable-community/">persistent worlds</a>," essentially tiny MMOs run by people with DM-like powers, kept it from giving off the abandoned feel of other "massive" online games. Fantasy author Luke Scull credits the game with launching his writing career and continues to work on an unofficial sequel to the game, <a href="https://www.lukescull.com/2021/07/14/announcing-the-blades-of-netheril-an-unofficial-sequel-to-the-neverwinter-nights-original-campaign/"><em>The Blades of Netheril</em></a>, with a roadmap of seven chapters through at least 2027.</p>
