          <p>If you can take your mind way back to the beginning of 2025, you might remember a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/is-2025-finally-the-real-year-of-half-life-3-confirmed/">fresh wave</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/fresh-leaks-suggest-half-life-3-development-may-be-nearing-completion/">rumors</a> suggesting that <em>Half-Life 3</em> was finally reaching the final stages of production, and could be announced and/or released at any moment. Now, though, 2025 seems set to come to a close without any official news of a game fans have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/12/valves-doug-lombardi-kinda-confirms-half-life-3/">waiting</a> literal <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/half-life-3-totally-absolutely-confirmed-by-hidden-dota-2-update-file/">decades</a> for.</p>
<p>That doesn’t necessarily mean a <em>Half-Life 3</em> announcement and/or release isn’t imminent, though. On the contrary, veteran journalist Mike Straw insisted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/x7GRLcaZtgA">on a recent Insider Gaming podcast</a> that “everybody I’ve talked to are still adamant [<em>Half-Life 3</em>] is a game that will be a launch title with the Steam Machine.”</p>
<p>Straw—who has <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1514651538026815490">a long</a> <a href="https://x.com/mikestrawmedia/status/1869824116339159465?s=46">history</a> of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-in-development/">reporting</a> gaming rumors <a href="https://mikestrawmedia.com/column/lets-talk-about-anonymous-sources/">from anonymous sources</a>—said this <em>Half-Life 3</em> information is “not [from] these run-of-the-mill sources that haven’t gotten me information before. … These aren’t like random, one-off people.” And those sources are “still adamant that the game is coming in the spring,” Straw added, noting that he was “specifically told [that] spring 2026 [is the window] for the Steam Machine, for the Frame, for the Controller, [and] for <em>Half-Life 3</em>.”</p>
<h2>For real, this time?</h2>
<p>Tying the long-awaited <em>Half-Life 3</em> to a major hardware push that has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">already been announced for an “early 2026” window</a> certainly sounds plausible, given previous leaks about the game’s advanced state of development. But there are still some reasons to doubt Straw’s “adamant” sources here.</p>
<p>For one, Straw admitted that the previous information he had received on potential <em>Half-Life 3</em> launch and/or announcement dates was not reliable enough to report in detail. “I had been told a date. I was not going to report that date because they weren’t 100 percent confident in that date,” he said. “That date has since passed.”</p>
