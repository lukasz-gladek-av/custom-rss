<p>Silver Lake was part of the consortium involved in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/china-keeps-the-algorithm-critics-attack-trumps-tiktok-deal/">this month's controversial deal</a> to bring Tiktok under the control of US-based companies. Back in 2013, the private investment firm also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/michael-dell-wins-buyout-bid-after-icahn-takes-ball-goes-home/">helped take computer-maker Dell private in a $25 billion deal</a>.</p>
<p>Affinity Partners CEO Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Trump, said in a statement that he has "admired [EA's] ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games – and now enjoys them with his kids – I couldn’t be more excited about what’s ahead."</p>
<p>EA first went public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1990, and by 1996 its market cap had risen to $1.61 billion. Last week, the company's valuation was hovering around $43 billion.</p>
<p>EA brought in $7.5 billion in revenue in the 2025 fiscal year (ending March 31) on the strength of franchises including <em>Madden NFL</em>, <em>EA Sports FC</em>, <em>Battlefield</em>, <em>The Sims</em>, <em>Dragon Age</em>, and <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>.</p>
