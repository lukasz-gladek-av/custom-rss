      The modding community is already hard at work despite lack of "official" support.

          <p>Bethesda <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672">isn't officially supporting mods</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/you-can-play-the-unreal-powered-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-today/">the newly released <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></a>. But that hasn't stopped some players from discovering that many mods created for the 2006 original seem to work just fine in the new game with a bare minimum of installation headaches.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivionmods/comments/1k5c77z/from_the_bethesda_discord/">noted on Reddit</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/784542837596225567/842456895942819840/1364285658595852358">the Bethesda Game Studios Discord</a>, some .esp mod files designed years ago for the original <em>Oblivion</em> have the same effect when plugged into the new <em>Remastered</em> game. Ars confirmed this during some quick testing, using <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/20947">a mod uploaded in 2008</a> to easily add high-end weapons and armor to the opening jail cell scene in the <em>Remastered</em> version.</p>
<p>While players of the original game could use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2097">the Oblivion Mod Manager</a> to easily install these mods, doing so in the <em>Remastered</em> version requires a bit more manual work. First, users have to download the applicable .esp mod files and put them in the "Content/Dev/ObvData/Data" folder (the same one that already houses DLC data files like "DLCHorseArmor.esp"). Then it's just a matter of opening "Plugins.txt" in the same folder and adding that full .esp file name to the plaintext list.</p>

<p>Early testers <a href="https://discord.com/channels/784542837596225567/842456895942819840/1364295162640990270">report</a> that some more complex mods designed for the original <em>Oblivion</em> will lead to crashes or mixed results when loaded in the <em>Remastered</em> game. Others <a href="https://discord.com/channels/784542837596225567/842456895942819840/1364298964077117460">theorize</a> that "the game seems to read OG <em>Oblivion</em> as its base, so manually adding a mod that doesnâ€™t have new assets ... would work."</p>
<p>As the community continues to analyze this modding backward compatibility, other modders have already rushed to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivionremastered/mods">release dozens of new mods</a> designed specifically for the <em>Remastered</em> version, even without official support from Bethesda. At this point, most of these seem focused on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/222">some basic UI tweaks</a> or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/202">quality-of-life</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/235">hacks</a> to make the game more enjoyable (we're particularly fond of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/219">this one that makes slow-walking NPCs a bit faster</a>).</p>
<p>More complex mods may require <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/packaging-unreal-engine-projects">diving into the Unreal Engine's pak file format</a> to replace in-game assets with new, modded versions. That means it's probably just a matter of time before we get the equivalent of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/4431">the custom Mystic Elf race</a> modded back into the newer version of the game.</p>

          <p>Wizards of the Coast has released the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/srd">System Reference Document</a>, the heart of the three core rule books that constitute <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>' 2024 gameplay, under a Creative Commons license. This means the company cannot alter the deal further, like it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/rpg-fans-irate-as-dd-tries-to-shut-its-open-game-license/">almost did in early 2023</a>, leading to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/game-makers-stage-mass-exodus-from-dungeons-dragons-open-license/">considerable pushback</a> and, eventually, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/dd-maker-retreats-from-attempts-to-update-longstanding-open-license/">retreat</a>. It was a long quest, but the lawful good party has earned some long-term rewards, including a new, similarly licensed reference book.</p>
<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> owner Wizards of the Coast (WotC) put the core <em>D&amp;D</em> rules into an <a href="https://opengamingfoundation.org/ogl.html">Open Gaming License</a> in the early 2000s, inspired by Richard Stallman's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/how-to-choose-an-open-source-license/">GNU General Public License</a>. The idea was that by making the core mechanics, classes, spells, races, and monsters available for anyone to build on, royalty-free, more versions of games would draw more people into the tabletop roleplaying sphere, and perhaps back to the core <em>D&amp;D</em> games and rule books. It also likely didn't do much harm to WotC's properties, as these basic aspects of the game, and bits taken from existing fantasy works, were going to be difficult to copyright.</p>
<p>WotC considered that the Open Gaming License (OGL) was open to revisions, however, and the company <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1410-ogls-srds-one-d-d">proposed</a> changes to the OGL that would require that anyone making certain amounts of money had to report it (over $50,000 per year) or start paying royalties (over $750,000). A <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dnd-wizards-of-the-coast-ogl-1-1-open-gaming-license-1849950634">leaked version of that license</a> put the higher-level royalties at 25 percent, and only covered printed materials and static PDFs, leaving virtual tabletop and software makers questioning where they might fit in.</p>
