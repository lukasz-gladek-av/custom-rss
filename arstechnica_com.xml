<p>There is no difficulty setting, and while the tutorial-style, pre-credits run gives you the basics of choosing abilities and placing troops, you are going to learn a lot through trial and error. Each fighter has a dozen stats to consider, and the game leans into abbreviations and tiny icons for each. The game has a codex, which helps (though I'm still uncertain as to how a fighter gets "Marked"). I did not really get what "Elemental Power" was until a half-dozen runs had failed (it powers not only magic attacks, but healing amounts—pretty important).</p>
<p>Watching your team get mauled a few times will teach you the rest. You might, for example, set up your melee fighters near the enemy's ranged attackers, assuming they'll take them out and then pivot to the boss in the middle of the stage. But then that peripheral shooter will get lucky, evade three hits in a row, and suddenly the boss, perhaps sensing a soft target, is at that fighter's back. Your other two fighters refuse to pivot, sticking to their own corners while an unlucky one is flanked and murdered, and, yep, it's time to abandon this run.</p>
<p>Next time, you would focus your upgrades on defense for the little guy, movement speed for your hero, and position them all very differently. Will that work? Maybe, but you won't fight the same fight again. The invisible dice rolls on each hit, the changing order of battles and rewards, the seemingly algorithmic but often chaotic choices by your fighters—it's certainly a more accurate portrayal of battle than turn-based, perfect-knowledge strategy, but definitely not more confidence-boosting.</p>

<h2>That elusive balance of challenge and reward</h2>

              Some abilities only work for certain classes, others are generic, and some can be combined into upgraded versions. Each time you run, the ability cards are different.

<p>Is it fun? Does the challenge bring you back? I've had fun more often than not, and I've enjoyed my introduction to the <em>Five Rings</em> world, despite some exposition-dumping dialogue. I failed the first chapter many, many times, and started getting sick of the goblins and wraiths that inhabit it, but more enemy types have shown up in Act 2. Each run has made me feel a smidge wiser, gradually better prepared, and occasionally clever, but one dumb move can doom an otherwise winnable run. It's not a straight line, which can make the wins feel great, but the losses a bit random.</p>
