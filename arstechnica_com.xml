          <p>The era of Google's Play's unrivaled dominance may be coming to an end in the wake of the company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/google-loses-app-store-antitrust-appeal-must-make-sweeping-changes-to-play-store/">antitrust loss</a>, but Google's app store isn't going anywhere. In fact, the Play Store experience is getting a massive update with more personalization, content, and yes, AI. This is Google, after all.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/curation-update-september-2025/">revamped Google Play Games</a> is a key part of this update. Gamer profiles will now have a public face, allowing you to interact with other players if you choose. Play Games will track your activity for daily streaks, which will be shown on your profile and unlock new Play Points rewards. Your profile will also display your in-game achievements.</p>
<p>Your gaming exploits can also span multiple platforms. Google Play Games for PC is officially leaving beta. Google says there are now 200,000 games that work across mobile and PC, and even more PC-friendly titles, like <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em>, are on the way. Your stats and streaks will apply across both mobile and PC as long as the title comes from the Play Store.</p>
<p>At the core of Google's app store revamp is the You Tab, which will soon take its place in the main navigation bar of the Play Store. This page will show your rewards, subscriptions, game, stats, and moreâ€”and it goes beyond gaming. The You Tab will recommend a variety of content on Google Play, including books and podcasts.</p>
