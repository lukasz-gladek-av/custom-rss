<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Donating is easy. Simply <a href="https://childsplay.salsalabs.org/Donate/index.html">donate to Child's Play</a> using a credit card or PayPal or <a href="http://eff.org/AT2014">donate to the EFF</a> using PayPal, credit card, or cryptocurrency. You can also support Child's Play directly by using <a href="https://my.onecause.com/fundraiser/organizations/8534d777-53ce-4d94-a537-c8e0cbb7acb0/fundraisers/fundraiser:ae0c129c-94ac-4e63-a265-20b71ac4bd03">this Ars Technica campaign page</a> or by picking an item from the Amazon wish list of a specific hospital on <a href="https://childsplaycharity.org/get-involved#hospital-map">its donation page</a>. Donate as much or as little as you feel comfortable withâ€”every bit helps.</p>
<p>Once that's done, it's time to register your entry in our sweepstakes. Just grab a digital copy of your receipt (a forwarded email, a screenshot, or simply a cut-and-paste of the text) and send it to <a href="mailto:ArsCharityDrive@gmail.com">ArsCharityDrive@gmail.com</a> with your name, postal address, daytime telephone number, and email address by 11:59 pm ET Thursday, January 2, 2025.</p>
<p>One entry per person, and each person can only win up to one prize. US residents only. NO PURCHASE NECESSARY. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/2024-ars-technica-charity-drive-official-rules/">See the official rules</a> for more information, including how to enter without making a donation. Also, refer to the <a href="http://www.condenast.com/privacy-policy#privacypolicy">Ars Technica privacy policy (https://www.condenast.com/privacy-policy)</a>.</p>
<p>We'll then contact the winners and have them choose their prize by January 31, 2025 (choosing takes place in the order the winners are drawn). Good luck!</p>
