          <p>In 2019, Nintendo <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/2019/5/16/18627669/nintendo-switch-online-game-vouchers-deal">announced</a> a new benefit for subscribers to its Switch Online service: <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers/">a pair of game vouchers</a>, available for $100, that could be redeemed for any two Switch games on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=pd&amp;p=0">Nintendo's eligibility list</a>. If you already knew you were going to be buying first-party games, the voucher could save you $20, or even $30, if you used it on the normally $70 <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>
<p>However, Nintendo announced today that it will soon end the program, rather than carrying it forward into the Switch 2 era. Switch Online subscribers can still buy a pair of vouchers until the end of January 2026, and those vouchers will be redeemable for up to a year after purchase, but you can't buy new vouchers after that.</p>
<p>The vouchers were already notably&nbsp;<em>not</em> usable to buy Switch 2-exclusive games like&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. However, for hybrid Switch games with a separate Switch 2 Edition, you could still use them to buy a game like <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> and then upgrade it to the Switch 2 edition separately.&nbsp;Nintendo also <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Nintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html">said on its FAQ page</a> that new titles would be added to the eligibility list between now and January 2026, raising the possibility that upcoming high-profile hybrid games like <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> or&nbsp;<em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>could make the list.</p>
