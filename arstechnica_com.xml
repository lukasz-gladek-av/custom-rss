          <p>The long-running video game series Assassin's Creed will get a live-action TV series adaptation. <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-1236463572/">Variety</a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-news-1236318387/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> report that Netflix has greenlit the series after years of development hell; the intention to produce the series was <a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/assassins-creed-netflix-series-1234816203/">announced</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>The series had been through multiple creative teams even before it was greenlit, but Netflix settled on two co-showrunners. Roberto Patino, a writer on FX's <em>Sons of Anarchy</em> and HBO's <em>Westworld</em>, will join David Wiener, who led Paramount+'s <em>Halo</em> TV series as well as&nbsp;<em>Fear the Walking Dead</em>.</p>
<p>The two released a joint statement with the news that the show is moving forward:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve been fans of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> since its release in 2007. Every day we work on this show, we come away excited and humbled by the possibilities that <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> opens to us. Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story—about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith. It is about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance. But more than anything, this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time. And it’s about what we stand to lose as a species, when those connections break. We’ve got an amazing team behind us with the folks at Ubisoft and our champions at Netflix, and we’re committed to creating something undeniable for fans all over the planet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not many details are known about the series, beyond the obvious: like the games, it will follow a shadow war between the rival Templars and Assassins factions fought across centuries and cultures, with characters diving into genetic memory to experience the lives of ancestors who played pivotal roles in the war. There are no public details about characters or casting.</p>
