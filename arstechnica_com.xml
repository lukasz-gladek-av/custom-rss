<p>Inside the source code are some wonderful reminders of what Windows game development from 1995 to 2003 was really like. One experienced modder <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rwtema.bsky.social/post/3lj73vvrhr226">posted some gems on Bluesky</a>, like a "HACK ALERT!" text string added just to prevent the Watcom IDE from crashing because of a "magic text heap length" crash: "Who knows why, but it works," wrote that poor soul.</p>
<p>This writer's personal favorite is this little bit in <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour/blob/main/Generals/Code/Tools/WorldBuilder/src/RampOptions.cpp">the RampOptions.cpp file</a> in <em>Generals</em>, credited to John K. McDonald Jr., which expresses concerns about "TheRampOptions" existing with a set value:</p>
<p><code>if (TheRampOptions) {</code><br>
<code>// oh shit.</code><br>
<code>return;</code><br>
<code>}</code></p>
<p>In addition to helping out modders and entertaining experienced coders, the GPL-licensed source code releases do a lot to help preserve these games, such that they can be reworked to run on future platforms. Projects like <a href="https://www.openra.net/">OpenRA</a> and <a href="https://opensage.github.io/">OpenSAGE</a> already offer open source reimplementations of those games' code, but having the original source can only help. <em>C&amp;C </em>community stalwart Luke "CCHyper" Feenan worked with EA leaders to get the code back into a build-ready state and said in a press release that the updated code should make the classic games easier to patch in the future.</p>
<p>As part of the source code release, the&nbsp;<em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> team dropped off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN2gryZYz6g">35 minutes of footage</a>, newly found in the archives, of alpha and archive footage from the later Sage-engine based&nbsp;<em>Generals</em> and <em>Renegade</em> games.</p>

      Archival footage from alpha versions of <em>Command &amp; Conquer: Generals </em>and <em>Renegade</em>, released by EA as part of their source code release.

<p>It's heartening to see that with the right combination of people and purpose, classic games can find renewed interest and longevity inside a big publisher.</p>
