<p>Today's video game consoles are hundreds of dollars more expensive than you'd expect based on historic pricing trends. That's according to an Ars Technica analysis of decades of pricing data and price-cut timing across dozens of major US console releases.</p>
<p>The overall direction of this trend has been apparent to industry watchers for a while now. Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft have failed to cut their console prices in recent years and have instead been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-raises-planned-switch-2-accessory-prices-amid-tariff-uncertainty/">increasing</a> the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/microsoft-raises-prices-on-xbox-hardware-says-some-holiday-games-will-be-80/">nominal MSRP</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/sony-joins-xbox-and-nintendo-in-hiking-playstation-5-prices-in-the-us/">many current consoles</a> in the past six months.</p>
<div>

<p>But when you crunch the numbers, it's pretty incredible just how much today's console prices defy historic expectations, even when you account for higher-than-normal inflation in recent years. If today's consoles were seeing anything like what used to be standard price cuts over time, we could be paying around $200 today for pricey systems like the Switch OLED, PS5 Digital Edition, and Xbox Series S.</p>
<h2>Crunching the numbers</h2>
<p>To determine the extent of today's relative console overpricing, we dug through old news reports, press releases, advertisements, and store catalogs for annual price data going back to the Atari 2600's launch in 1977. We used permanent MSRP announcements wherever possible so that temporary sales or store-specific closeouts wouldn't affect the data. If a console dropped in price multiple times in one year, we took the lowest price from that year. We then adjusted all the nominal prices for inflation to consistent July 2025 dollars using <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">BLM's CPI calculator</a>.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>Almost every classic console saw significant price drops by its second or third year on the market (and beyond).</span>
                    <span>

<p>The resulting trendlines can be a bit noisy from console to console. Some classic consoles saw significant, drastic price drops after just a year on the market, often before disappearing from shelves altogether shortly afterward. Others stayed at their nominal launch price for a year or three, letting inflation slowly chip away at that value of those dollars before finally dropping the price as a way to bolster lagging sales for aging hardware.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Overall, though, you can see a clear and significant downward trend to the year-over-year pricing for game consoles released before 2016. After three years on the market, the median game console during this period cost less than half as much (on an inflation-adjusted basis) as it did at launch. Consoles that stuck around on the market long enough could expect further slow price erosion over time, until they were selling for roughly 43 percent of their launch price in year five and about 33 percent in year eight.</p>
<p>That kind of extreme price-cutting is a distant memory for today's game consoles. By year three, the median console currently on the market costs about 85 percent of its real launch price, thanks to the effects of inflation. By year five, that median launch price ratio for modern consoles actually <em>increases</em> to 92 percent, thanks to the nominal price increases that many consoles have seen in their fourth or fifth years on the market. And the eight-year-old Nintendo Switch is currently selling for about 86 percent of its inflation-adjusted launch price, or more than 50 percentage points higher than the median trend for earlier long-lived consoles.</p>

    <p><span>While the data is noisy, the overall trend in older console pricing over time is very clear.</span>

<p>To be fair, today's game consoles are not the most expensive the industry has ever seen. Systems like the Atari 2600, Intellivision, Neo Geo, and 3DO launched at prices that would be well over $1,000 in 2025 money. More recently, systems like the PS3 ($949.50 at launch in 2025 dollars) and Xbox One ($689.29 at launch in 2025 dollars) were significantly pricier than the $300 to $600 range that encompasses most of today's consoles.</p>

<p>But when classic consoles launched at such high prices, those prices never lasted very long. Even the most expensive console launches of the past dropped in price quickly enough that, by year three or so, they were down to inflation-adjusted prices comparable to today's consoles. And classic consoles that launched at more reasonable prices usually saw price cuts that took them well into the sub-$300 range (in 2025 dollars) within a few years, making them a relative bargain from today's perspective.</p>

<h2>What’s keeping prices high?</h2>
<p>So why are today's consoles staying so stubbornly resistant to historic price-drop trends? Higher-than-normal inflation in recent years explains some of the nominal price inflexibility, but nothing close to all of it. In fact, even when you adjust for inflation, some current consoles like the Xbox Series S and PS5 Pro are <em>more expensive</em> on a real basis today than they were on launch day.</p>
<p>The uncertainty and extra import costs of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/thanks-to-new-tariffs-many-more-physical-game-discs-may-simply-not-get-made/">Trump administration tariffs</a> definitely play some part in the change, as console makers obliquely reference by citing "market conditions" or a "challenging economic environment" in their price-raising announcements. But even before recent tariffs, modern console prices weren't dropping nearly as fast as history suggested they should. In fact, Sony first raised the nominal starting price of the PS5 Digital Edition <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/redesigned-ps5-models-slim-down-one-of-the-bulkiest-consoles-ever/">back in 2023</a>, way before Trump's current trade war was even on the horizon.</p>

              Sony suggested that chip shortages during the pandemic were contributing to a lack of expected PS5 supply.

<p>Some of that earlier price drop wariness could have been due to pandemic-related chip shortages, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/nintendo-warns-global-chip-shortage-to-hit-switch-production/">console makers</a> at the time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/sony-says-ps5-could-be-difficult-to-find-into-2022/">warned</a> were keeping hardware supplies well below demand. But all indications suggest those global supply chain effects were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/sony-expects-ps5-will-still-be-in-short-supply-until-2023/">more or less ameliorated by early 2023</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/low-semiconductor-supplies-may-not-be-the-main-reason-for-ps5-shortages/">may not have been as significant as they seemed</a> from the outside.</p>
<p>Amid all those macroeconomic factors, the slowdown in Moore's Law, specifically, seems like a likely candidate for today's stubborn console pricing. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/chips-arent-improving-like-they-used-to-and-its-killing-game-console-price-cuts/">we've discussed in depth recently</a>, the rate of advancement in microchip manufacturing <a href="https://cap.csail.mit.edu/death-moores-law-what-it-means-and-what-might-fill-gap-going-forward">has slowed in recent years</a>, making it harder than it was in the past to develop cheaper and/or smaller versions of console hardware.</p>

<p>That explains why costs for hardware makers have remained higher than usual. But in the past, console makers have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/08/nintendo-wii-u-still-being-sold-at-a-loss/">shown a willingness to sell hardware at a loss</a> when needed to make the money back on software sales. Systems like the PS3, Xbox One, Wii U, and 3DS saw extremely rapid price drops after less-than-stellar launch receptions, suggesting they were slashing or eliminating hardware profits well before any manufacturing savings could be passed on to consumers.</p>
<p>The fact that we're not seeing such price cutting today could be interpreted as a sign that current console prices aren't too high for the market to bear. Back in 2022, we noted how <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/will-the-nintendo-switch-ever-see-a-price-drop/">the ahistorical lack of a Switch price drop</a> didn't seem to be dampening that system's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/nintendo-switch-crosses-100-million-mark-outsells-wii-ps1/">historically strong sales</a>. The same seems to be true of the PS5 and PS5 Pro, which are <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/ps5-shipments-top-80-3-million">selling</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-700-price-tag-isnt-hurting-ps5-pros-early-sales/">briskly</a> despite a lack of price drops. And while the Xbox hardware line <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/xbox-console-sales-continue-to-crater-with-massive-42-revenue-drop/">may be struggling for customer attention these days</a>, Microsoft also seems <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/we-run-a-business-why-microsofts-indiana-jones-will-be-on-ps5/">less interested</a> in providing the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-confirms-which-xbox-games-are-going-to-switch-playstation/">exclusive games</a> that would usually help justify the purchase of an Xbox (and perhaps more interested in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/why-microsofts-next-xbox-should-just-run-windows-already/">pivoting to Windows-based gaming hardware</a> like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally</a>).</p>
<p>In other words, console prices aren't dropping in part because the market isn't forcing them to. As long as today's console makers are satisfied with sales at their current levels, the price drops customers came to expect historically will continue to be a thing of the past.</p>
