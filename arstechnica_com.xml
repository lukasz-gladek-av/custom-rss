          <p>When my colleague Kyle Orland submitted <a href="https://kertisjones.itch.io/tetrisweeper"><em>Tetrisweeper</em></a>&nbsp;for a list of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ars-favorite-games-of-2024-that-were-not-released-in-2024/">Ars' favorite 2024 games not from 2024</a>, I told him, essentially: "Good for you, not for me." I'm a pedestrian <em>Tetris</em> player, at best, so the idea of managing a whole different game mechanic, while trying to clear lines and prevent stack-ups, sounded like taking a standardized test while baking a three-layer cake.</p>
<p>And yet, here I am, sneaking rounds of&nbsp;<em>Drop Duchy</em> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525310/Drop_Duchy/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/drop-duchy-f46b7e">Epic</a>, for Windows/Linux via Proton) into lunch breaks, weekend mornings, and other bits of downtime. <em>Drop Duchy</em> is similarly not just a <em>Tetris</em>-esque block-dropper. It also has you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aligning terrain types for resources</li>
<li>Placing both your troops and the enemy's</li>
<li>Choosing which cards to upgrade, sell, and bring into battle</li>
<li>Picking between terrain types to leave behind</li>
<li>Upgrading a tech tree with achievements</li>
<li>Picking the sequence of battles for maximum effectiveness</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Drop Duchy</em> is a quirky game, one that hasn't entirely fused together its various influences without some seams showing. But I keep returning to it, even as it beats me to a pulp on Normal mode, based on decisions I made five rounds ago. It feels like a medium-deep board game, played at triple speed, with someone across the table timing you on how fast you arrange your tiles.</p>

<p>Allow me to try to describe what is happening in <em>Drop Duchy,&nbsp;</em>ignoring entirely the idea that there is some kind of plot. You start off with three buildings and your enemy's buildings that you must place, mixed into a pile of terrain (plains and forest to start) in <em>Tetris-</em>like shapes. Filling a horizontal line gives you resources (wheat, wood, and stone) from that line but does not clear it.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>If you build up a big area of plains on your board, you can drop your "Farm" piece in the middle, and it converts those plains into richer plains. Put a "Woodcutter" into a bunch of forest, and it harvests that wood and turns it into plains. Set down a "Watchtower," and it recruits some archer units for every plains tile in its vicinity, and even more for richer fields. You could drop a Woodcutter next to a Farm and Watchtower, and it would turn the forests into plains, the Farm would turn the plains into fields, and the Watchtower would pick up more units for all those rich fields.</p>
<p>That kind of multi-effect combo, resulting from one piece you perfectly placed in the nick of time, is what keeps you coming back to <em>Drop Duchy</em>. The bitter losses come from the other side, like realizing you've leaned too heavily into heavy, halberd-wielding units when the enemy has lots of ranged units that are strong against them. Or that feeling, familiar to&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em> vets, that one hasty decision you made 10 rows back has doomed you to the awkward, slanted pile-up you find yourself in now. Except that lines don't clear in&nbsp;<em>Drop Duchy</em>, and the game's boss battles specifically punish you for running out of good places to put things.</p>
<p>There's an upper strategic layer to all the which-square-where action. You choose branching paths on your way to each boss, picking different resources, battles, and trading posts. Every victory has you picking a card for your deck, whether military, production, or, later on, general "technology" gains. You upgrade cards using your gathered resources, try to balance or min-max cards toward certain armies or terrains, and try not to lose any one round by too many soldiers. You have a sort of "overall defense" life meter, and each loss chips away at it. Run out of money to refill it, and that's the game.</p>

<h2>Again: It is not a <em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>clone</h2>


<p><em>Drop Duchy</em> feels, moment to moment, triumphalist and unfair, but that is its intended rogue-ish nature. Where I see issues with the game beyond that is in the little stuff.</p>
<p>The game plays well on a Steam Deck or other handhelds, but if you have any issues with reading small text on a small screen, <em>Drop Duchy&nbsp;</em>is unforgiving. Many of the buildings look very similar, and the icons and text can be quite small. I feel the most for folks with extensive&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>experience and muscle memory.&nbsp;<em>Drop Duchy</em> uses some non-standard pieces, like single, double, and three-square corners. And while line clearing is almost always rewarded, it can also work against you, like if an enemy's fort fits a slot, but also grants it lots of troops from the surrounding terrain.</p>
<p><em>Drop Duchy&nbsp;</em>can sometimes feel unbalanced, sometimes a bit unfair. Its bosses will typically require multiple runs before you figure out the right multi-round strategies. The game's many, many mechanics make this a title where I wouldn't blame someone for running the Tutorial round more than once.</p>
<p>But, like golf, home repair, or setting up a server, the few times you get a round, or just a line, perfectly right can erase all the hard lessons you had to endure before. I keep finding things in <em>Drop Duchy</em> that seem impossible to overcome, and then I come right back and try it a different way. I think this title will get a few balance fixes, but even before those, it's a good run.</p>
