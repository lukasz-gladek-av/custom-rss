          <p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/chips-arent-improving-like-they-used-to-and-its-killing-game-console-price-cuts/">Slowed tech progress</a>, inflation, and global trade wars are doing a number on game console pricing this year, and the bad news keeps coming. Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-raises-planned-switch-2-accessory-prices-amid-tariff-uncertainty/">delayed</a> preorders of the Switch 2 in the US and increased accessory prices, and Microsoft gave its Series S and X consoles across-the-board price hikes<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/microsoft-raises-prices-on-xbox-hardware-says-some-holiday-games-will-be-80/">in May</a>.</p>
<p>Today, Nintendo is back for more, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/">increasing prices</a> on the&nbsp;<em>original</em> Switch hardware, as well as some Amiibo, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/nintendos-new-clock-tracks-your-movement-in-bed/">the Alarmo clock</a>, and some Switch and Switch 2 accessories. The price increases will formally take effect on August 3.</p>
<p>The company says that there are currently no price increases coming for the Switch 2 console, Nintendo Online memberships, and physical and digital Switch 2 games. But it didn't take future price increases off the table, noting that "price adjustments may be necessary in the future."</p>
<p>Nintendo didn't announce how large the price increases would be, but <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvdvrv55rd2x">some retailers</a> were already listing higher prices as of Friday. Target now lists the Switch Lite for $229.99, up from $199.99; the original Switch for $339.99, up from $299.99; and the OLED model of the Switch for a whopping $399.99, up from $349.99 and just $50 less than the price of the much more powerful Switch 2 console.</p>
