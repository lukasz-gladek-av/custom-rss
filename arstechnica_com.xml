<p>"Bethesda has always been supportive of community projects like ours, and we don't see that changing anytime soon," the team wrote at the time.</p>

<p>Other publishers aren't always similarly open to competition from fans, though. Nintendo has long <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/what-to-make-of-valves-recent-fan-project-takedowns/">taken a legal scorched earth approach</a> to a wide variety of fan games that use its licensed characters or trademarks. And last year, Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/what-to-make-of-valves-recent-fan-project-takedowns/">also took steps</a> to shut down a number of fan remakes of its legacy games.</p>
<p>In 2016, Blizzard <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/04/blizzard-shuts-down-popular-fan-run-pirate-server-for-classic-wow/">shut down</a> a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/07/blizzard-shuts-down-legacy-wow-fan-server-hours-after-it-goes-up/">couple</a> of fan-run "classic" <em>World of Warcraft</em> servers in the run-up to its announcement of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/world-of-warcraft-classic-is-official-will-bring-vanilla-wow-back/">official <em>World of Warcraft Classic</em> servers</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/activision-kills-fan-clients-for-classic-call-of-duty-multiplayer-mods/">Activision</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/ea-shuts-down-fan-run-servers-for-older-battlefield-games/">EA</a> have similarly shut down modded servers for legacy online titles.</p>
<p>Some publishers have mirrored Bethesda's more open approach to modders, though. Sega <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/04/sega-embraces-legal-console-game-modding-with-new-genesis-pc-emulation-hub/">actively encouraged</a> official <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=34270&amp;browsesort=trend&amp;section=readytouseitems&amp;days=90">Steamworks modding</a> for some Sega Genesis classics released as PC downloads in 2016. And the heavily <em>Halo</em>-inspired <em>Installation 01</em> <a href="https://installation01.org/">continues to thrive</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/halo-inspired-fan-game-gets-conditional-thumbs-up-from-microsoft/">something close to official support</a> from Microsoft and developer 343 Industries, as long as it remains a non-commercial project.</p>
<p>As for Skyblivion, while the project's last public road map update <a href="https://skyblivion.com/update/skyblivion-update-ii/">is months old</a> at this point, the team is still confident it will be able to release a version of its ambitious mod later this year. "We are confident that players will be the true winners, having the opportunity to experience both a community-driven reimagining and a professional, modern version of this beloved game."</p>
