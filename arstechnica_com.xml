          <p>After Valve announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">its upcoming Steam Machine living room box</a> earlier this month, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/are-you-ready-for-a-1000-steam-machine-some-analysts-think-you-should-be/">some analysts suggested to Ars</a> that Valve could and should aggressively subsidize that hardware with “loss leader” pricing that leads to more revenue from improved Steam software sales. In <a href="https://youtu.be/yvu66Y2VLq8?si=SskFh89ieBarjGmu">a new interview with YouTube channel Skill Up</a>, though, Valve’s Pierre-Loup Griffais ruled out that kind of console-style pricing model, saying that the Steam Machine will be “more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market.”</p>
<p>Griffais said the AMD Zen 4 CPU and RDNA3 GPU in the Steam Machine were designed to outperform the bottom 70 percent of machines that opt-in to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">Valve’s regular hardware survey</a>. And Steam Machine owners should expect to pay roughly what they would for desktop hardware with similar specs, he added.</p>
<p>“If you build a PC from parts and get to basically the same level of performance, that’s the general price window that we aim to be at,” Griffais said.</p>
<p>The new comments follow similar sentiments relayed by Linus Sebastian on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dnKy4UEdiyo">a recent episode of his WAN Show podcast</a>. Sebastian said that, when talking to Valve representatives at a preview event, he suggested that a heavily subsidized price point would make the Steam Machine hardware into “a more meaningful product.” But when he suggested that he was imagining a console-style price in the range of $500, “nobody said anything, but the energy of the room wasn’t great.”</p>
<h2>Forget about $500</h2>
<p>Based on these comments, we could start estimating a potential Steam Machine price range by speccing out a comparable desktop machine. That would likely require building around <a href="https://www.newegg.com/amd-ryzen-5-7600x-ryzen-5-7000-series-raphael-zen-4-socket-am5/p/N82E16819113770">a Ryzen 5 7600X CPU</a> and <a href="https://www.newegg.com/asrock-challenger-rx7600-cl-8go-radeon-rx-7600-8gb-graphics-card-double-fans/p/N82E16814930093">Radeon RX 7600 GPU</a>, which would probably push the overall build into the $700-plus range. That would make the Steam Machine competitive with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/sony-joins-xbox-and-nintendo-in-hiking-playstation-5-prices-in-the-us/">the pricey PS5 Pro</a>, even though <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1oxg6r0/a_hardware_engineer_from_the_canal_moores_law/">some estimates</a> price out the actual internal Steam Machine components in the $400 to $500 range.</p>
