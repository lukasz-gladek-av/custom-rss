          <p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/these-are-the-lasting-things-that-half-life-2-gave-us-besides-headcrabs-and-crowbars/">more than two decades since <em>Half-Life 2</em></a>'s release have been filled with plenty of rumors and hints about <em>Half-Life 3</em>, ranging from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/valve-secrets-spill-over-including-half-life-3-in-new-steam-documentary-app/">official</a>-<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/valve-half-life-alyx-is-not-the-end-of-the-franchise/">ish</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/half-life-3-totally-absolutely-confirmed-by-hidden-dota-2-update-file/">thin</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/mysterious-black-mesa-website-says-its-not-secretly-working-on-half-life-3/">downright</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/valve-registers-european-trademark-for-half-life-3/">misleading</a>. As we head into 2025, though, we're approaching something close to a critical mass of rumors and leaks suggesting that <em>Half-Life 3</em> is really in the works this time, and could be officially announced in the coming months.</p>
<p>The latest tease came just before the end of 2024 via <a href="https://x.com/mikeshapiroland/status/1874213952680607922">a New Year's Eve social media video</a> from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0788587/">G-Man voice actor Mike Shapiro</a>. In the voice of the mysterious in-game bureaucrat, Shapiro expresses hopes that "the next quarter century [will] deliver as many <em>unexpected surprises</em> as did the millennium's first (emphasis added)... See you in the new year."</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="und"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Valve?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Valve</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Halflife?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Halflife</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GMan?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GMan</a> #2025 <a href="https://t.co/mdT5hlxKJT">pic.twitter.com/mdT5hlxKJT</a></p>
<p>— Mike Shapiro (@mikeshapiroland) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeshapiroland/status/1874213952680607922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The post is all the more notable because it's Shapiro's first in over four years, when he concluded a flurry of promotional posts surrounding the release of <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> (many of which were in-character as G-Man). And in 2020, just after <em>Alyx</em>'s release, Shapiro <a href="https://www.vg247.com/mike-shapiro-voice-of-the-g-man-says-the-next-game-hes-in-will-be-like-seeing-an-old-friend-again">told USGamer</a> that he had recently worked on a "blast from the past" project that he would "announce... on my Twitter feed when I'm allowed to" (no such announcement has been forthcoming for any other game).</p>
<p>"I was working on that game for quite a while before I knew [what it was]," Shapiro said at the time of the unannounced project. "There was a rehearsal and some recordings, and after one of the recording sessions I was having a drink with the director. He told me what the game was, and nobody knows that this is coming.</p>
<p>"This is going to be such a mindblowing re-up from what people have come to know," Shapiro continued in 2020. "It's going to really... it's going to make people have a complete re-understanding of what they thought they knew about the story in the game prior to it, and I don't even know if people are expecting it."</p>
<h2>Raised HLX-pectations</h2>
<p>On its own, a single in-character post from a voice actor would probably be a bit too cryptic to excite <em>Half-Life</em> fans who have seen their sequel hopes dashed so often over the last two decades. But the unexpected tease comes amid a wave of leaks and rumors surrounding "HLX," an internal Valve project that has been referenced in a number of other Source 2 engine game files recently.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/someone-made-a-captcha-where-you-play-doom-on-nightmare-difficulty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>It's a WebAssembly application, but it was made via a human language, prompt-driven web development tool called <a href="https://v0.dev/">v0</a> that's part of a suite of features offered as part of Vercel, a cloud-based developer tool service, of which Rauch is the CEO. You can see the LLM bot chat history with the <a href="https://v0.dev/chat/4X85A52Dzde#vZBwKTIde4ZPopW5ExYEzIi38oM6vJzm">series of prompts</a> that produced this CAPTCHA game on the v0 website.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, there has been a past attempt at making a <em>Doom</em> CAPTCHA. In 2021, developer Miquel Camps Orteza made <a href="https://vivirenremoto.github.io/doomcaptcha/">an approximation of one</a>—though not all the assets matched <em>Doom</em>, and it was more <em>Doom</em>-adjacent. That one was made directly by hand, and its source code is available on GitHub. Its developer noted that it's not secure; it's just for fun.</p>
<p>Rauch's attempt is no more serious as a CAPTCHA, but it at least resembles <em>Doom</em> more closely.</p>
<p>Don't expect to be playing this to verify at real websites anytime soon, though. It's not secure, and its legality is fuzzy at best. While the <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM">code</a> for <em>Doom</em> is open source, the assets from the game like enemy sprites and environment textures—which feature prominently in this application—are not.</p>
