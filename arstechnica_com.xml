          <p>When Sony <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/">revealed the PlayStation 5 Pro a few months ago</a>, some wondered just how many people would be willing to spend $700 for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/the-ps5-pros-biggest-problem-is-that-the-ps5-is-already-very-good/">a marginal upgrade</a> to the already quite powerful graphical performance of the PS5. Now, initial sales reports suggest there's still a substantial portion of the console market that's willing to shell out serious money for top-of-the-line console graphics.</p>
<p>Circana analyst Matt Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf4dap62o">shared on Bluesky this morning</a> that the PS5 Pro accounted for a full 19 percent of US PS5 sales in its launch month of November. That sales ratio puts initial upgrade interest in the PS5 Pro roughly in line with <em>lifetime</em> interest in the PS4 Pro, which <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1834785622541975897">recent reports suggest</a> was responsible for about 20 percent of all PS4 sales <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1834878244509647327">following its launch</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>That US sales ratio also lines up with international sales reports for the PS5 Pro launch. In the UK, GfK ChartTrack <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/black-friday-video-game-sales-dip-in-the-uk-uk-monthly-charts">reports</a> that the PS5 Pro was responsible for 26 percent of all console sales for November. And in Japan, Famitsu sales data suggests the PS5 Pro was responsible for a full 63 percent of the PS5's November sales after <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/famitsu-sales-11-4-24-11-10-24">selling an impressive 78,000 units in its launch week alone</a>.</p>
<h2>Shut up and take my money</h2>
<p>In the US, raw unit sales for the PS5 Pro were down slightly (12 percent) compared to those for the PS4 Pro's launch month in November 2016, Piscatella writes. But the PS5 Pro still managed to bring in 50 percent more total US revenue in its launch month, owing to the PS4 Pro's much more reasonable $400 launch price (or $533 in 2024 dollars).</p>
