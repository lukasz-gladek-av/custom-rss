          <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch">Bloomberg reports</a> that Sony is "in the early stages" of work on a fully portable console that can play PlayStation 5 software. The device is still "likely years away from launch," according to "people familiar with its development" that spoke to Bloomberg anonymously.</p>
<p>The report comes less than a year after the launch of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/sonys-200-handheld-portal-can-stream-games-from-your-ps5-and-uh-thats-it/">the PlayStation Portal</a>, a Sony portable device designed to stream PS5 games running on a console on the same local network. Recently, Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/">updated the Portal firmware</a> to let PlayStation Plus subscribers also stream PS5 games from Sony's centralized servers at up to 1080p and 60 fps.</p>
<p>Sony's reported PS5 portable plans also come after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-sure-seems-to-be-thinking-about-some-sort-of-portable-xbox/">months of rumors</a> that Microsoft has also been working on a new Xbox console with a portable form factor. In June, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer added fuel to those rumors by directly saying, "I think we should have a handheld, too... I like my ROG Ally, my Lenovo Legion Go, my Steam Deck... I think being able to play games locally is really important."</p>
<p>Nintendo's follow-up to the Switch, which will be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/nintendo-pre-announces-a-switch-2-announcement-is-coming-eventually/">formally announced in the next few months</a>, is also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/controller-maker-says-switch-2-will-be-backward-compatible-with-all-switch-games/">widely expected</a> to mimic the hybrid portable/console design of Nintendo's last console.</p>
<p>Sony first dipped its toes in the portable gaming arena with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/02/4619-2/">2005's PlayStation Portable</a>, which is still the only major handheld console to make use of optical discs (in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/05/4916-2/">Sony's own proprietary UMD format</a>). Sony followed that up with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/02/a-new-standard-in-design-in-depth-with-the-playstation-vita/">2012's PlayStation Vita</a>, a well-loved console that brought a full analog stick and a larger high-resolution screen to the portable console space. But both efforts struggled to find much market success compared to the sales juggernauts of Nintendo's cheaper <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/a-fond-farewell-to-the-weird-and-wonderful-nintendo-ds/">Nintendo DS</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/the-end-of-the-3ds-marks-an-inflection-point-for-portable-gaming/">3DS</a> hardware lines.</p>
