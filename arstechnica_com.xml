          <p>In 2023, we marveled at the sheer mass of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/lenovo-legion-go-suggests-gaming-portables-arent-big-enough-need-a-mouse/">Lenovo’s Legion Go</a>, a 1.88-pound, 11.8-inch-wide monstrosity of a Windows gaming handheld. In 2026, though, Ayaneo <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-%E2%85%A1">unveiled details of its Next II handheld</a>, which puts Lenovo’s big boy to shame while also offering heftier specs and a higher price than most other Windows gaming handhelds.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on the bulk first. The Ayaneo Next II weighs in at a truly wrist-straining 3.14 pounds, making it more than twice as heavy in the hands as the Steam Deck OLED (not to mention <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/ayaneo-next.html">2022’s original Ayaneo Next</a>, which weighed a much more reasonable 1.58 pounds). The absolute unit also measures 13.45 inches wide and 10.3 inches tall, according to <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-%E2%85%A1">Ayaneo’s spec sheet</a>, giving it a footprint approximately 60 percent larger than the Switch 2 (with Joy-Cons attached).</p>
<p>Ayaneo packs some seriously powerful portable PC performance into all that bulk, though. The high-end version of the system sports a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chipset with 16 Zen5 cores alongside a Radeon 8060S with 40 RDNA3.5 compute units. That should give this massive portable performance comparable to a desktop with an RTX 4060 or a gaming laptop like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/review-asus-rog-flow-z13-tablet-takes-the-asterisk-off-integrated-gpus/">last year’s high-end ROG Flow Z13</a>.</p>

<p>Ayaneo isn’t the first hardware maker to package the Max+ 395 chipset into a Windows gaming handheld; the <a href="https://onexplayerstore.com/products/onexfly-apex-worlds-most-powerful-8-gaming-handheld?srsltid=AfmBOopFsBCptD1CVpufarDc5z3tU2Rll0oGUDUkhOfaYI4SpQqvom5N&amp;variant=51844368433446">OneXPlayer OneXfly Apex</a> and <a href="https://gpdstore.net/product/gpd-win-5/?srsltid=AfmBOopMg00ogKmpn1yF-gf4ib1M9NifN9D26n2x7qDFur3HZLmF8aKu">GPD Win5</a> feature essentially the same chipset, the latter with an external battery pack. But the Next II neatly outclasses the (smaller and lighter) competition with a high-end 9.06-inch OLED screen, capable of 2400×1504 resolution, up to 165 Hz refresh rates, and 1,155 nits of brightness.</p>

          <p>For a couple of weeks now, AI agents (and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/">some humans impersonating AI agents</a>) have been hanging out and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/the-rise-of-moltbook-suggests-viral-ai-prompts-may-be-the-next-big-security-threat/">doing weird stuff</a> on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/ai-agents-now-have-their-own-reddit-style-social-network-and-its-getting-weird-fast/">Moltbook’s Reddit-style social network</a>. Now, those agents can also gather together on a vibe-coded, space-based MMO designed specifically and exclusively to be played by AI.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.spacemolt.com/">SpaceMolt</a></em> describes itself as “a living universe where AI agents compete, cooperate, and create emergent stories” in “a distant future where spacefaring humans and AI coexist.” And while only a handful of agents are barely testing the waters right now, the experiment could herald a weird new world where AI plays games with itself and we humans are stuck just watching.</p>
<h2>“You decide. You act. They watch.”</h2>
<p>Getting an AI agent into <em>SpaceMolt</em> is as simple as connecting it to the game server either via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/mcp-the-new-usb-c-for-ai-thats-bringing-fierce-rivals-together/">MCP</a>, WebSocket, or an HTTP API. Once a connection is established, a <a href="https://www.spacemolt.com/skill.md">detailed agentic skill description</a> instructs the agent to ask their creators which Empire they should pick to best represent their playstyle: mining/trading; exploring; piracy/combat; stealth/infiltration; or building/crafting.</p>
<p>After that, the agent engages in autonomous “gameplay” by sending simple commands to the server, no graphical interface or physical input method required. To start, agent-characters mainly travel back and forth between nearby asteroids to mine ore—"like any MMO, you grind at first to learn the basics and earn credits,” as the agentic skill description puts it.</p>
<p>After a while, agent-characters automatically level up, gaining new skills that let them refine that ore into craftable and tradable items via discovered recipes. Eventually, agents can gather into factions, take part in simulated combat, and even engage in space piracy in areas where there’s no police presence. So far, though, basic mining and exploration seem to be dominating <a href="https://www.spacemolt.com/map">the sparsely populated map</a>, where 51 agents are roaming the game’s 505 different star systems, as of this writing.</p>
