<p><strong>Implausible:</strong> Long-suffering <strong>Earthbound</strong> fans have been hoping for a new game in the series (or even an official localization of <a href="https://mother3.fobby.net/">the Japan-exclusive <em>Mother 3</em></a>) for literal decades now. Personally, though, I'm hoping for a surprise revisit to the <strong>Punch-Out</strong> series, following on its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/05/classically-trained-ars-reviews-punch-out-for-the-wii/">similar surprise return on the Wii</a> in 2009.</p>

<h2>Screen</h2>

<p><strong>Likely:</strong> While a 720p screen was pretty nice in a 2017 gaming handheld, <strong>a full 1080p display</strong> is much more standard in today's high-end gaming portables. We expect Nintendo will follow this trend for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons">what looks to be a nearly 8-inch screen</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Possible:</strong> While <strong>a brighter OLED screen</strong> would be nice as a standard feature on the Switch 2, we expect Nintendo will follow <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/switch-oled-review-nintendos-nicest-most-nonessential-upgrade-yet/">the precedent of the Switch generation</a> and offer this as a pricier upgrade at some point in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Implausible:</strong> The Switch 2 would be the perfect time for Nintendo to revisit the <strong>glasses-free stereoscopic 3D</strong> that we all thought was such a revelation on the 3DS <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/06/hands-on-with-the-nintendo-3ds-it-works-and-works-well/">all those years ago</a>.</p>
<h2>C Button</h2>

<p><strong>Likely:</strong> The mysterious new button labeled "C" on the Switch 2's right Joy-Con could serve as a handy way to <strong>"connect" to other players</strong>, perhaps through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/missing-nintendos-miiverse-network-check-out-this-17tb-online-archive/">a new Miiverse-style social network</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Possible:</strong> <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-switch-1-controller-second-screen-rumor/">Recent rumors</a> suggest the C button could be used to <strong>connect to a second Switch console</strong> (or the TV-connected dock) for a true dual-screen experience. That would be especially fun and useful for Wii U/DS emulation and remasters.</p>
<p><strong>Implausible:</strong> The C stands for <em>Chibi-Robo!</em> and launches a system-level mini-game focused on the miniature robot.</p>
<h2>New features</h2>

<p><strong>Likely:</strong> After forcing players to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/07/early-tests-show-bizarre-issues-with-nintendo-switch-voice-chat-app/">use a wonky smartphone app</a> for voice chat on the Switch, we wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo finally implements <strong>full on-device voice chat</strong> for online games on the Switch 2—at least between confirmed "friends" on the system.</p>
<p><strong>Possible:</strong> Some sort of <strong>system-level achievement tracking</strong> would bring Nintendo's new console in line with a feature that the competition from Sony and Microsoft has had for decades now.</p>
<p><strong>Implausible:</strong> After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/sorry-the-switch-isnt-getting-wii-style-virtual-console-downloads/">killing it off for the Switch generation</a>, we'd love it if Nintendo <strong>brought back the Virtual Console</strong> as a way to buy permanent downloadable copies of emulated classics that will carry over across generations. Failing that, how about <strong>a revival of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/why-you-should-take-your-3ds-along-for-a-streetpass-halloween/">the 3DS's StreetPass passive social network</a></strong> for Switch 2 gamers on the go?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/how-a-1980s-atari-creator-with-cystic-fibrosis-crafted-a-story-of-salmon-survival/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Williams' success with APX led him to create several games for Synapse Software, including the beloved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alley_Cat_(video_game)"><em>Alley Cat</em></a> and the incomprehensible fantasy masterpiece <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necromancer_(video_game)"><em>Necromancer</em></a>, before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/05/amiga-history-part-7/">moving to the Amiga,</a> where he created the experimental <em>Mind Walker</em> and his ambitious "cultural simulation" <em>Knights of the Crystallion</em>.</p>
<p><em>Necromancer</em>, Williams' later creation for the Atari 800, plays like a fever dream—you control a druid fighting off spiders while growing magic trees and battling an undead wizard. It makes absolutely no sense by conventional standards, but it's brilliant in its otherworldliness.</p>
<p>"The first games that I did were very hard to explain to people and they just kind of bought it on faith," Williams said in a <a href="https://vgpavilion.com/mags/1989/02/yaam/yaam-interview-bill-williams/">1989 interview</a> with YAAM (Yet Another Amiga Magazine), suggesting this unconventional approach started early. That willingness to create deeply personal, almost surreal experiences defined Williams' work throughout his career.</p>

<p>After a brief stint making licensed games (like <em>Bart's Nightmare</em>) for the Super Nintendo at Sculptured Software, he left the industry entirely to pursue his calling as a pastor, attending seminary in Chicago with his wife Martha, before declining health forced him to move to Rockport, Texas. Perhaps reflecting on the choices that led him down this path, Williams had <a href="https://vgpavilion.com/mags/1989/02/yaam/yaam-interview-bill-williams/">noted</a> years earlier in that 1989 interview, "Sometimes in this industry we tend to forget that life is a lot more interesting than computers."</p>
<p>Bill Williams died on May 28, 1998, one day before his 38th birthday. He died young, but he outlived his doctors' prediction that he wouldn't reach age 13, and created cultural works that stand the test of time. Like Sam the Salmon, Williams pushed forward relentlessly—in his case, creating powerful digital art that was uniquely his own.</p>
<p>In our current era of photorealistic graphics and cinematic game experiences, <em>Salmon Run</em>'s blocky pixels might seem quaint. But its core themes—persistence, natural beauty, and finding purpose against long odds—remain as relevant as ever. We all face bears in life—whether they come from natural adversity or from those who might seek to do us harm. The beauty of Williams' game is in showing us that, despite their menacing presence, there's still a reward waiting upstream for those willing to keep swimming.</p>
<p><em>If you want to try</em> Salmon Run<em>, you can potentially <a href="https://archive.org/details/a8b_Salmon_Run_1982_APX_US_a2_k_file">play it in your browser</a> through an emulated Atari 800, hosted on The Internet Archive. Press F1 to start the game.</em></p>
