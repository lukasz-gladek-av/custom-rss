          <p><em>Neverwinter Nights</em> came out in 2002 and received an enhanced edition in 2018. In 2025, that should really be it, but there's something special about Bioware's second dip into the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> universe. The energy from the game's community is strong enough that, based largely on the work of "unpaid software engineers," the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/704450/view/511820969218671050">received a new patch last week</a>.</p>
<p><em>Neverwinter Nights (NN) Enhanced Edition</em> (on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/704450/Neverwinter_Nights_Enhanced_Edition/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/neverwinter_nights_enhanced_edition_pack">GOG</a>)&nbsp;now has anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering built in, major improvements to its networking code and performance, and <a href="https://nwn.beamdog.net/docs/">more than 100 other improvements</a>. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/23-year-old-d-and-d-rpg-neverwinter-nights-just-got-a-new-update-thanks-to-the-unpaid-software-engineers-of-its-unkillable-community/">noted by PC Gamer</a>,&nbsp;<em>NN</em> was originally built for single-core CPUs, so while it may seem odd to seek "major" improvements to performance for a 23-year-old RPG, it is far from optimized for modern systems.</p>
<p><em>NN&nbsp;</em>received a similar fan-led patch, described as "a year-long love effort" by community developers, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/one-of-my-favorite-dandd-videogames-is-still-getting-beefy-updates-after-21-years/">in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's not so surprising that&nbsp;<em>NN </em>achieved this kind of fan-driven immortality. Opinions vary on the virtues of its single-player campaigns, but its "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/23-year-old-d-and-d-rpg-neverwinter-nights-just-got-a-new-update-thanks-to-the-unpaid-software-engineers-of-its-unkillable-community/">persistent worlds</a>," essentially tiny MMOs run by people with DM-like powers, kept it from giving off the abandoned feel of other "massive" online games. Fantasy author Luke Scull credits the game with launching his writing career and continues to work on an unofficial sequel to the game, <a href="https://www.lukescull.com/2021/07/14/announcing-the-blades-of-netheril-an-unofficial-sequel-to-the-neverwinter-nights-original-campaign/"><em>The Blades of Netheril</em></a>, with a roadmap of seven chapters through at least 2027.</p>

          <p>Nintendo may be getting ready to make its Switch 2 console official. According to "industry whispers" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">collected by Eurogamer</a>, as well as <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1878827836741673217">reporting</a> from The Verge's Tom Warren, the Switch 2 could be formally announced sometime this week. Eurogamer suggests the reveal is scheduled for this Thursday, January 16.</p>
<p>The reporting also suggests that the reveal will focus mostly on the console's hardware design, with another game-centered announcement coming later. Eurogamer reports that the console won't be ready to launch until April; this would be similar to Nintendo's strategy for the original Switch, which was announced in mid-January 2017 but not launched until March.</p>
<p>Many things about the Switch 2's physical hardware design have been thoroughly leaked at this point, thanks mostly to accessory makers who have been showing off their upcoming cases. Accessory maker Genki was at CES last week with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/our-best-look-yet-at-the-switch-2s-expanded-size-and-snap-on-joy-cons/">a 3D-printed replica of the console</a> based on the real thing, suggesting a much larger but still familiar-looking console with a design and button layout similar to the current Switch.</p>
<p>On the inside, the console is said to sport a new Nvidia-designed Arm processor with a much more powerful GPU and more RAM than the current Switch. Dubbed "T239," Eurogamer reports that the chip includes 1,536 CUDA cores based on the Ampere architecture, the same used in 2020's GeForce RTX 30-series graphics cards on the PC.</p>
