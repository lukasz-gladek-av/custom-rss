<p>There's also a new loading screen with more detailed information and more interactive elements, which Firaxis says is a hint at other major UI overhauls to come. That said, players have already complained that it doesn't look very nice because the 2D leader assets that appear on it have been scaled awkwardly and look fuzzy.</p>
<p>The remaining changes are largely balance and systems-related. Trade convoys can now travel over land, which means treasure ships will no longer get stuck in lakes, and there are broader strategic options for tackling the economic path in the Exploration Age. There has been a significant effort to overhaul town focuses, including the addition of a couple new ones, and the much-anticipated nerf of the Hub Town focus; it now provides +1 influence per connected town instead of two, though that may still not be quite enough to make the Hub Town, well, not overpowered.</p>
<p>You can find a bunch of other small balance tweaks in <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">the patch notes</a>, including new city-state bonuses, pantheons, and religious beliefs, among other things.</p>
<p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly to some, you can now issue a command to pet the scout unit's dog.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>As far as I can tell, there are still two major traditional features fans are waiting on: autoexplore for scout units and hotseat multiplayer support. Firaxis says it's working on both, but neither made it into 1.2.2. Players have also been asking for further UI overhauls. Firaxis says those are coming, too.</p>
<p>When <em>Civilization VII</em> launched, I wrote <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/civilization-vii-review-a-major-overhaul-solves-civs-oldest-problems/">that I quite liked it</a>, but I also pointed out bugs and balance changes and noted that it won't please traditionalists. For some players, the review said it might be better to wait. We did a follow-up article about a month in, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/civilization-vii-one-month-later-the-community-and-developers-chime-in/">interviewing the developers</a>. But that was still during the "fix things that are on fire stage."</p>
<p>More than any previous update, today's 1.2.2 is the first one that seems like a natural jumping-on point for people who have been taking a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<p>It's quite common for strategy games like this to not really fully hit their stride until weeks or even months of updates. <em>Civilization VII</em>'s UI problems made it a particularly notable example of that trend, but the good news is that it's also following the same path as the games before it that got good post-launch support: slowly, it's becoming a game a broader range of Civ fans can enjoy.</p>
