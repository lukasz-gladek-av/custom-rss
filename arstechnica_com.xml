          <p>It's been nearly two years now since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/05/phil-harrisons-successor-announced-at-sony-shuhei-yoshida/">game industry veteran</a> Phil Harrison <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/after-the-death-of-stadia-vp-phil-harrison-has-left-google/">left Google</a> following the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/google-stadia-officially-shuts-down-january-2023-will-refund-game-purchases/">implosion of the company's Stadia cloud gaming service</a>. But the passage of time hasn't stopped one company from taking advantage of this week's Game Developers Conference to poke fun at the erstwhile gaming executive for his <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/meet-the-stadia-developers-blindsided-by-googles-latest-product-shutdown/">alleged mistreatment of developers</a>.</p>
<p>VGC <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/has-a-harrison-fired-you-lately-savage-planet-devs-taunt-former-stadia-boss-phil-harrison-with-gdc-billboard/">spotted a conspicuous billboard</a> in San Francisco's Union Square Monday featuring the overinflated, completely bald head of <em>Gunther</em> Harrison, the fictional Alta Interglobal CEO who was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-will-serve-up-its-dish-in-may-2025/">recently revealed</a> as the blatantly satirical antagonist in the upcoming game <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>. A large message atop the billboard asks passersby—including the tens of thousands in town for GDC—"Has a Harrison fired <em>you</em> lately? You might be eligible for emotional support."</p>

<p>While Gunther Harrison probably hasn't fired any GDC attendees, the famously bald Phil Harrison was responsible for the firing of plenty of developers when he <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/report-stadia-undershot-to-the-tune-of-hundreds-of-thousands-of-users/">shut down Google's short-lived Stadia Games &amp; Entertainment (SG&amp;E) publishing imprint</a> in early 2021. That shutdown <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/google-praised-stadia-studio-for-great-progress-one-week-before-killing-it/">surprised a lot of newly jobless game developers</a>, perhaps none moreso than those at Montreal-based Typhoon Games, which Google had <a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/google-buys-triple-a-game-dev-typhoon-studio-to-beef-up-stadia/">acquired in late 2019</a> to make what Google's Jade Raymond said at the time would be "platform-defining exclusive content" for Stadia.</p>
<p>Yet on the very same day that <em>Journey to the Savage Planet</em> launched as a Stadia exclusive, the developers at Typhoon found themselves jobless, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/google-closes-stadias-dedicated-game-studios-after-less-than-2-years/">alongside the rest of SG&amp;E</a>. By the end of 2022, Google would shut down Stadia entirely, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/meet-the-stadia-developers-blindsided-by-googles-latest-product-shutdown/">blindsiding even more game developers</a>.</p>
<h2>Don’t forgive, don’t forget</h2>
<p>After being let go by Google, Typhoon Games would reform as Raccoon Logic (thanks in large part to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/life-after-stadia-new-studio-raccoon-logic-picks-up-where-typhoon-studios-left-off">investment from Chinese publishing giant Tencent</a>) and reacquire the rights to the Savage Planet franchise. And now that the next game in that series is set to launch in May, it seems the developers still haven't fully gotten over how they were treated during Google's brief foray into game publishing.</p>

<h2>A bargain at twice the price</h2>
<p>The extensive <em>Portal</em> theming on the table seems to extend to the gameplay as well. As you might expect, launching a ball into a lit portal on one side of the playfield can lead to it (or a ball that looks a lot like it) immediately launching from another portal elsewhere. The speed of the ball as it enters one portal and exits the other seems like it might matter to the gameplay, too: A <a href="https://www.multimorphic.com/portal/">description</a> for an "aerial portal" table feature warns that players should "make sure to build enough momentum or else your ball will land in the pit!"</p>


<p>The table is full of other little nods to the <em>Portal</em> games, from a physical Weighted Companion Cube that can travel through a portal to lock balls in place for eventual multiball to an Aerial Faith Plate that physically flings the ball up to a higher level. There's also a turret-themed multiball, which GLaDOS reminds you is based around "the pale spherical things that are full of bullets. Oh wait, that's you in five seconds."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.multimorphic.com/store/p3-pinball-machine/p3-machine-with-the-portal-standard-game-kit/">purchase a full <em>Portal</em> pinball table</a> starting at $11,620 (plus shipping), which isn't unreasonable as far as brand-new pinball tables are concerned <a href="https://sternpinball.com/2024/10/16/stern-pinball-revisits-a-timeless-classic-with-metallica-remastered-available-now/">these days</a>. But if you already own <a href="https://www.multimorphic.com/p3-pinball-platform/">the base table for Multimorphic's P3 Pinball Platform</a>, you can purchase a "Game Kit" upgrade—with the requisite game software and physical playfield pieces to install on your table—starting at just $3,900.</p>
<p>Even players that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/one-week-with-the-valve-index-a-vr-game-changer-with-a-few-question-marks/">invested $1,000 or more in an Index VR headset</a> just to play <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/half-life-alyx-review-the-greatest-vr-adventure-game-yet-and-then-some/"><em>Half-Life Alyx</em></a> might balk at those kinds of prices for the closest thing we've got to a new, "official" <em>Portal</em> game. For true Valve obsessives, though, it might be a small price to pay for the ultimate company collector's item and conversation piece.</p>
