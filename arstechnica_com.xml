          <p>Four out of five game developers are currently working on a project for the PC, a sizable increase from 66 percent of developers a year ago. That's according to <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">Informa's latest State of the Game Industry survey</a>, which partnered with Omdia to ask over 3,000 game industry professionals about their work in advance of March's Game Developers Conference.</p>
<p>The 80 percent of developers working on PC projects in this year's survey is by far the highest mark for any platform dating back to at least 2018, when 60 percent of surveyed developers were working on a PC game. In the years since, the ratio of game developers working on the PC has hovered between 56 and 66 percent before this year's unexpected jump. The number of game developers saying they were <em>interested</em> in the PC as a platform also increased substantially, from 62 percent last year to 74 percent this year.</p>

<p>The PC has long been the most popular platform for developers to work on in the annual State of the Game Industry survey, easily outpacing consoles and mobile platforms that generally see active work from anywhere between 12 to 36 percent of developer respondents, depending on the year. In its report, Informa notes this surge as a "passion for PC development explod[ing]" among developers, and mentions that while "PC has consistently been the platform of choice... this year saw its dominance increase even more."</p>
<p>The increasing popularity of PC gaming among developers is also reflected in the number of individual game releases on Steam, which topped out at a record of 18,974 individual titles for 2024, <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/">according to SteamDB</a>. That record number was up over 32 percent from 2023, which was up from just under 16 percent from 2022 (though many Steam games each year were "Limited Games" that failed to meet <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile">Valve's minimum engagement metrics</a> for Badges and Trading Cards).</p>

<h2>The Steam Deck effect?</h2>
<p>While it's hard to pinpoint a single reason for the sudden surge in the popularity of PC game development, Informa speculates that it's "connected to the rising popularity of Valveâ€™s Steam Deck." While Valve has only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954205/valve-steam-deck-multiple-millions">officially acknowledged "multiple millions" in sales for the portable hardware</a>, GameDiscoverCo analyst Simon Carless <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/steam-deck-everything-you-were-afraid">estimated</a> that between 3 million and 4 million Steam Deck units had been sold by October 2023, up significantly from <a href="https://80.lv/articles/steam-deck-has-reportedly-sold-over-1-million-units/">reports of 1 million Deck shipments</a> in October 2022.</p>
