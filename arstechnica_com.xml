<p>In many ways, the timing of Sony's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/playstation-4-ps4-pro-review-4k/">2016 launch of the PS4 Pro</a> couldn't have been better. The slightly upgraded version of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/11/impressions-our-first-day-with-the-playstation-4-is-full-of-surprises/">2013's PlayStation 4</a> came at a time when a wave of 4K TVs was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161109006184/en/2016-a-Banner-Year-for-4K-UHD-TV-Display-Sales-to-Grow-40-Percent-as-4K-Ecosystem-Continues-to-Expand-Says-CTA">just beginning to crest</a> in the form of tens of millions of annual sales in the US.</p>
<p>Purchasing Sony's first-ever "mid-generation" console upgrade in 2016 didn't give original PS4 owners access to any new games, a fact that contributed to us <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/playstation-4-ps4-pro-review-4k/">calling the PS4 Pro "a questionable value proposition"</a> when it launched. Still, many graphics-conscious console gamers were looking for an excuse to use the extra pixels and HDR colors on their new 4K TVs, and spending hundreds of dollars on a stopgap console years before the PS5 served that purpose well enough.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today and the PS5 Pro faces an even weaker value proposition. The PS5, after all, has proven more than capable of creating excellent-looking games that take full advantage of the 4K TVs that are now practically standard in American homes. With 8K TVs <a href="https://variety.com/vip/8k-tv-high-resolution-tech-1236115228/">still an extremely small market niche</a>, there isn't anything akin to what Sony's Mike Somerset called "the most significant picture-quality increase probably since black and white went to color" <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/ps4-pro-hdr-preview-gt-sport-nioh/">when talking about 4K TV in 2016</a>.</p>

<p>Instead, Sony says that spending $700 on a PS5 Pro has a decidedly more marginal impact—namely, helping current PS5 gamers avoid having to choose between the smooth, 60 fps visuals of "Performance" mode and the resolution-maximizing, graphical effects-laden "Fidelity" mode in many games. The extra power of the PS5 Pro, Sony says, will let you have the best of both worlds: full 4K, ray-traced graphics <em>and</em> 60 fps at the same time.</p>
<p>While there's nothing precisely <em>wrong</em> with this value proposition, there's a severe case of diminishing returns that comes into play here. The graphical improvements between a "Performance mode" PS5 game and a "Performance Pro mode" PS5 game are small enough, in fact, that I often found it hard to reliably tell at a glance which was which.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with the PS5 Pro, in other words, is that the original PS5 is already too good.</p>
<h2>Smooth operator</h2>
<p>In announcing the PS5 Pro <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/">in September</a>, Sony's Mark Cerny mentioned that roughly three-quarters of PS5 owners opt for Performance mode over Fidelity mode when offered the choice on a stock PS5. It's not hard to see why. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/does-anyone-really-need-a-1000-hz-gaming-display/">Research shows</a> that the vast majority of people can detect a distinct decrease in flickering or juddery animation when the frames-per-second counter is cranked up from (Fidelity mode's) 30 fps to (Performance mode's) 60 fps.</p>
<p>The extra visual smoothness is especially important in any reflex-heavy game, where every millisecond of reaction time between your eyes and your thumbs can have a dramatic impact. That reaction advantage can extend well past 60 fps, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/does-anyone-really-need-a-1000-hz-gaming-display/">as PC gamers know all too well</a>.</p>


<p>But the other reason that Performance mode is so overwhelmingly popular among PS5 players, I'd argue, is that you don't really have to give up too much to get that frame rate-doubling boost. In most games, hopping from Fidelity mode to Performance means giving up a steady 4K image for either a (nicely upscaled) 1440p image or "Dynamic 4K" resolution (i.e., 4K that sometimes temporarily drops down lower to maintain frame rates). While some gamers swear that this difference is important to a game's overall visual impact, most players will likely struggle to even notice that resolution dip unless they're <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/does-the-world-really-need-8k-resolution-game-consoles/">sitting incredibly close to a very large screen</a>.</p>

<p>For the PS5 Pro, Sony is marketing "PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution," its buzzword for an AI-driven upscaling feature that adds further clarity and detail to scenes. Sony's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/">original announcement of "Super Resolution"</a> heavily used zoomed-in footage to highlight the impact of this feature on distant details. That's likely because without that level of zoom, the effect of this resolution bump is practically unnoticeable.</p>

    <div>
          
          


<h2>Tracing those rays</h2>
<p>The other visual upgrade often inherent in a PS5 game's Fidelity mode is support for ray-tracing, wherein the system tracks individual light rays for more accurate reflections and light scattering off of simulated objects. Having ray-tracing enabled can sometimes lead to striking visual moments, such as when you see Spider-Man's every move reflected in the mirrored windows of a nearby skyscraper. But as we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/playstation-5-review-more-of-a-generational-hop-than-a-leap/">noted in our initial PS5 review</a>, the effect is usually a much subtler tweak to the overall "realism" of how objects come across in a scene.</p>
<p>Having those kind of ray-traced images at a full 60 fps is definitely nice, but the impact tends to be muted unless a scene has a lot of highly reflective objects. Even the "Fidelity Pro" mode in some PS5 Pro games—which scales the frame rate back to 30 fps to allow for the ray-tracing algorithm to model more reflections and more accurate occlusion and shadows—doesn't create very many "wow" moments over a standard PS5 in moment-to-moment gameplay.</p>


<p>On the original PS5, I never hesitated to give up the (often marginal) fidelity improvements in favor of a much smoother frame rate. Getting that slightly improved fidelity on the PS5 Pro—without having to give up my beloved 60 fps—is definitely nice, but it's far from an exciting new frontier in graphical impact.</p>
<h2>Which is which?</h2>
<p>When testing the PS5 Pro for this review, I had my original PS5 plugged into a secondary input on the same TV, running the same games consecutively. I'd play a section of a game in Pro mode on the PS5 Pro, then immediately switch to the PS5 running the same game in Performance mode (or vice versa). Sitting roughly six feet away from a 60-inch 4K TV, I was struggling to notice any subjective difference in overall visual quality.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>I also took comparative screenshots on an original PS5 and a PS5 Pro in as close to identical circumstances as possible, some of which you can see shared in this review (be sure to blow them up to full screen on a good monitor). Flipping back and forth between two screenshots, I could occasionally make out small tangible differences—more natural shine coming off the skin of Aloy's face in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, for instance, or a slight increase in detail on Ratchet's Lombax fur. More often than not, though, I had legitimate trouble telling which screenshot came from which console without double-checking which TV input was currently active.</p>



<p>I'm a single reviewer with a single pair of eyes, of course. Your impression of the relative visual improvement might be very different. Luckily, if you have access to a PS5 already, you can run your own visual test just by switching between Fidelity and Performance modes on any of your current games. If you find the individual screens in Performance mode look noticeably worse than those in Fidelity mode (putting frame rate aside), then you might be in the market for a PS5 Pro. If you don't, you can probably stop reading this review right here.</p>
<h2>Barely a bang for your buck</h2>
<p>Even if you're the kind of person who appreciates the visual impact of Fidelity mode on the PS5, upgrading to the PS5 Pro isn't exactly an instant purchase. At $700, getting a PS5 Pro is akin to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/review-geforce-rtx-4070-super-makes-a-good-gpu-even-better-still-costs-600/">a PC gamer purchasing a top-of-the-line graphics card</a>, even though the lack of modular components means replacing your entire PS5 console rather than a single part. But while a GeForce RTX 4070 Ti could conceivably keep running new PC games <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/your-10-year-old-graphics-card-can-run-dragon-age-the-veilguard/">for a decade or more</a>, the PS5 Pro should be thought of as more of a stopgap until the PlayStation 6 (and its inevitable exclusive games) hit around 2028 or so (based on past PlayStation launch spacing).</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>If you already have a PS5, that $700 could instead go toward the purchase of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/the-return-of-the-70-video-game-has-been-a-long-time-coming/">10 full, big-budget games</a> at launch pricing or even more intriguing indie releases. That money could also go toward <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/breaking-down-sonys-confusing-playstation-plus-subscription-relaunch/">more than four years of PlayStation Plus Premium</a> and access to its library of hundreds of streaming and downloadable modern and classic PlayStation titles PS5 titles. Both strike me as a better use of a limited gaming budget than the slight visual upgrade you'd get from a PS5 Pro.</p>


<p>Even if you're in the market for your first PS5, I'm not sure the Pro is the version I'd recommend. The $250 difference between a stock PS5 and the PS5 Pro similarly feels like it could be put to better use than the slight visual improvements on offer here. And while the addition of an extra terabyte of high-speed game storage on the PS5 Pro is very welcome, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/the-ps5-pro-brings-the-game-consoles-disc-drive-era-to-an-end/">need to buy an external disc drive peripheral for physical games on the new console</a> may understandably rub some players the wrong way.</p>
<p>Back when the PlayStation 2 launched, I distinctly remember thinking that video game graphics had reached a "good enough" plateau, past which future hardware improvements would be mostly superfluous. That memory feels incredibly quaint now from the perspective of nearly two-and-a-half decades of improvements in console graphics and TV displays. Yet the PS5 Pro has me similarly feeling that the original PS5 was something of a graphical plateau, with this next half-step in graphical horsepower struggling to prove its worth.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll look back in two decades and consider that feeling similarly naive, seeing the PS5 Pro as a halting first step toward yet unimagined frontiers of graphical realism. Right now, though, I'm comfortable recommending that the vast majority of console gamers spend their money elsewhere.</p>
