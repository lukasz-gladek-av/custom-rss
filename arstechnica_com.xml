<p>The Switch 2 hardware will still retail for its initially announced $449.99, alongside a $499.99 bundle including a digital download of <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Nintendo revealed Thursday that the Mario Kart bundle will only be produced "through Fall 2025," though, and will only be available "while supplies last." <em>Mario Kart World</em> will retail for $79.99 on its own, while&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> will launch in July for a $69.99 MSRP.</p>
<p>Most industry analysts <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/why-trumps-tariffs-probably-wont-cause-an-immediate-switch-2-price-bump/">expected Nintendo to hold the price for the Switch 2 hardware steady</a>, even as Trump's wide-ranging tariffs threatened to raise the cost the company incurred for systems built in China and Vietnam. "I believe it is now too late for Nintendo to drive up the price further, if that ever was an option in the first place," Kantan Games' Serkan Toto <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/how-trumps-tariffs-could-affect-the-switch-2-and-the-rest-of-the-games-industry-1">told GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "As far as tariffs go, Nintendo was looking at a black box all the way until April 2, just like everybody else. As a hardware manufacturer, Nintendo most likely ran simulations to get to a price that would make them tariff-proof as much as possible."</p>
<p>But that pricing calculus might not hold forever. "If the tariffs persist, I think a price increase in 2026 might be on the table," Ampere Analysis' Piers Harding-Rolls <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">told GameSpot</a>. "Nintendo will be treading very carefully considering the importance of the US market."</p>
<p>Since the Switch 2 launch details were announced earlier this month, Nintendo's official promotional livestreams have been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3llym2u63522u">inundated with messages begging the company to "DROP THE PRICE."</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/sunderfolk-is-a-couch-co-op-tactical-rpg-you-play-with-a-phone-no-really/">creators of <em>Sunderfolk</em></a>&nbsp;wanted to make a video game that would help players “Rediscover game night.” By my reckoning, they have succeeded, because I am now regularly arguing with good friends over stupid moves. Why didn’t I pick up that gold? Don’t you see how ending up there messed up an area attack? Ah, well.</p>
<p>That kind of friendly friction, inside dedicated social time, only gets harder to come by as you get older, settle into routines, and sometimes move apart. I’ve hosted four <i>Sunderfolk</i> sessions with three friends, all in different states, and it has felt like reclaiming something I lost. <a href="https://www.dreamhaven.com/games/sunderfolk"><i>Sunderfolk</i></a> is a fun game with a lot of good ideas, and the best one is convincing humans to join up in pondering hex tiles, turn order, and what to name the ogres who shoot arrows (“Pointy Bros”).</p>
<p>Maybe you already have all the gaming appointments you need with friends, online or in person. <i>Sunderfolk</i>, I might suggest, is a worthy addition to your queue as a low-effort way to give everyone a break from being the organizer. It does a decent job of tutorializing and onboarding less experienced players, then adds depth as it goes on. Given that only one person out of four has to own the game on some system, and the only other hardware needed is a phone, it’s a pretty light lift for what I’m finding to be a great payoff. Some parts could be improved, but the core loop and its camaraderie engine feel sturdy.</p>

<p><i>Sunderfolk</i> is a turn-based tactical RPG, putting you and your friends on a grid filled with objects, enemies, and surprises. You pick from familiar role-playing character classes—my party picked rogue, berserker, wizard, and a kind of pyromancer—and choose one ability card each turn. The cards put a <i>Gloomhaven</i>-like emphasis on sequence and map positioning. One of my rogue’s potential moves is a quick attack, then gaining strength by picking up nearby gold. Another involves moving, hitting, moving, hitting, then one more single-hex move at the end, to stay out of danger and get a protective “Shrouded” effect.</p>

<p>You and your squad are all watching the same screen, be it a living room TV, a laptop, or a window streamed over Zoom or Discord. You choose your cards, plot your movement, and interact with everything using your phone or tablet’s touchscreen.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once you’ve won a quest by beating the baddies and/or hitting other markers, you head back to town and do a whole bunch of housekeeping tasks. <i>Sunderfolk</i> has mechanics for both players not being present (scaling the quests and keeping the missing leveled up) and for someone having to drop mid-battle (someone else can play their seat and their own). It’s accommodating to players of different RPG experience levels and different schedules.</p>

<h2>You have my sword—and my phone</h2>
<p>Let’s address the phone controls, the roughly 6-inch-diagonal elephant in the room. My three friends all had to spend a few minutes getting used to using their phone screen as a multi-modal controller: touchpad for hex movement and cursor pointing, card picker and info box reader, and then the town landscape screen. After that, nobody had any real issues with the controls themselves. The tactile feedback guides your finger, and there was no appreciable lag in our sessions.</p>
<p>Sometimes we’d get momentarily flummoxed by the card-choosing flow, and there is perhaps some inherent mental tax in switching between screens. But the phone controls, besides making couch co-op possible, also allowed everyone in my group to play in their most comfortable spot: a TV streaming the Discord app, a tablet on the couch, a laptop at the kitchen counter.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Not for nothing, but with each player using their phone for controls—and the game announcing when players had “disconnected” if they switched to another app too long, only for them to come right back—<i>Sunderfolk</i> can apply some anti-scrolling pressure and keep everyone checked in. You could get around this with secondary devices or tiled windows, but it's better to be present and ask your friends whose turn it is to fire off their Ultimate card.</p>
<p>(To clarify how remote play works: One owner of the game can screen-cast their game to Discord, Zoom, Meet, or whatever service, everyone playing can chat there or elsewhere, and players log in their phones/controllers with a QR code that is displayed from the screen-casted main title screen)</p>

<p>All this adventuring takes place in a world of anthropomorphized animals and overgrown woods and purple-blue ogres that strongly evoke <i>World of Warcraft</i>’s style (at least in Act 1). When you’re back in town, you tap around to chat with recurring NPCs, gain friendship levels that sometimes result in gifts, and upgrade parts of the town to your liking. The town hub provides more opportunities for strategy and bonding with players. You might send some of the gold you greedily picked up on the last quest to the friend so they can nab a great weapon. You might, as a group, buy a quirky town upgrade just for the chance to rename some things.</p>
<p>But the town is one place I felt some friction, familiar from more in-depth board games. Some players will be done with making their decisions and speeding through dialogue faster than others and may or may not be more engaged with the town chatterboxes. Just as with cardboard games, you can take this moment to get up, stretch your legs, and maybe refresh a drink. But you might have to nudge people along if they’re overwhelmed by gear choices.</p>

<p>The non-gory, often goofy nature of <i>Sunderfolk</i>’s setting makes it appropriate for a wider range of players. The voice acting, almost all of it by Anjali Bhimani (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetra">Symmetra</a>), re-creates the feel of having a game master switch between “Frightened Blue Jay miner” and “Furious Ogre Queen” in one session. I’m not too engaged in the broad plot after one act—ogres, fueled by Darkstone, want to extinguish the village’s Brightstone—but it’s not a big deal. The game has given my group something else to latch onto: naming things.</p>

<p>The chance to name things in <i>Sunderfolk, </i>and have those names stick for the whole campaign, is something a good GM would do to engage their players and break up tension. <i>Sunderfolk</i> is clever about this, offering both secret naming prompts to individual players on their phones or dishing out naming opportunities in town. In my party’s campaign, healing statues are named Neatos, the town bridge is Seagull Murder (a misremembered, <a href="https://www.buffalorising.com/2008/04/change-in-peace-bridge-design/">obscure Peace Bridge reference</a>), and the beetle we rescued is named, as it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/sunderfolk-is-a-couch-co-op-tactical-rpg-you-play-with-a-phone-no-really">during my preview</a>, Michael Keaton. It’s fun to build your own stupid world out of goofy names, something too few games provide.</p>
<p>Individual phone controls give the game a chance to pull off a few other tricks, like only telling certain players about how a certain enemy looks like they’re carrying great loot. If <i>Sunderfolk</i> added even more of this, I would not mind at all.</p>
<p>I’m generally enjoying the combat, difficulty ramp (on the default setting), and upgrade paths of the characters. After three or four sessions, your character has much more move variety, and items and weapons are more useful and varied. The town of Arden, while overly chatty, has more to offer. It feels like a game that has had its pacing and onboarding fine-tuned.</p>

<p>But I have nits to pick:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are cheap but great upgrades you can easily miss in town, like tavern meals and temple fate cards</li>
<li>Enemy variety feels slightly lacking in the first act</li>
<li>Some things, like mission selection, demand all-party agreement; perhaps the game could figuratively flip a coin when parties are divided</li>
<li>Everyone in my party has accidentally skipped an attack once or twice, despite an “Are you sure?” prompt</li>
<li>Movement traces and signaling could be clearer, as we have all also wasted hexes and shoved each other around</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s been hard to be overly critical of a game that has all but forced me to log off and talk to friends for a couple hours each week. The downsides of <i>Sunderfolk</i> have mostly been the same as those of playing any tabletop game with humans: waiting, expertise imbalance, distraction, and someone’s dog needing attention.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I think <i>Sunderfolk </i>is a success at what it set out to do: Put the cardboard, cards, and dice on the screen and make it easier for everyone to show up. It won’t replace the traditional game night, but it might bring more people into it and remind people like me why it’s so good.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed titles are cozy games for me. There’s no more relaxing place to go after a difficult day: historical outdoor museum tours, plus dopamine dispensers, plus slow-paced assassination simulators. The developers of <em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em> seem to understand this need to escape better than ever before.</p>
<p dir="auto">I’m “only” 40 hours into <em>Shadows</em> (I reckon I’m only about 30 percent through the game), but I already consider it one of the best entries in the franchise’s long history.</p>
<p dir="auto">I’ve appreciated some past titles’ willingness to experiment and get jazzy with it, but <em>Shadows</em> takes a different tack. It has cherry-picked the best elements from the past decade or so of the franchise and refined them.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, although the wheel hasn’t been reinvented here, it offers a smoother ride than fans have ever gotten from the series.</p>
<p dir="auto">That’s a relief, and for once, I have some praise to offer Ubisoft. It has done an excellent job understanding its audience and proven that when in doubt, AAA publishers should feel more comfortable with the idea of delaying a game to focus on quality.</p>
<h2 dir="auto" data-heading="Choosing wisely">Choosing wisely</h2>
<p dir="auto"><em>Shadows</em> is the latest entry in the 18-year series, and it was developed primarily by a Ubisoft superteam, combining the talents of two flagship studios: Ubisoft Montreal (<em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Origins</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em>) and Ubisoft Quebec (<em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em>, <em>Immortals Fenyx Rising</em>).</p>
<p dir="auto">After a mediocre entry in 2023’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em>—which began as <em>Valhalla</em> DLC and was developed by B-team Ubisoft Bordeaux—<em>Shadows</em> is an all-in, massive budget monstrosity led by the very Aist of teams.</p>
<p dir="auto">The game comes after a trilogy of games that many fans call the ancient trilogy (<em>Origins</em>, <em>Odyssey</em>, and <em>Valhalla</em>—with <em>Mirage</em> tightly connected), which was pretty divisive.</p>
<p dir="auto">Peaking with <em>Odyssey</em>, the ancient trilogy departed from classic Assassin's Creed gameplay in significant ways. For the most part, cornerstones like social stealth, modern-day framing, and primarily urban environments were abandoned in favor of what could be reasonably described as "<em>The Witcher 3 </em>lite"—vast, open-world RPG gameplay with detailed character customization and gear systems, branching dialogue options, and lots of time spent wandering the wilderness instead of cities.</p>

      As in <em>Odyssey</em>, you spend most of your time in <em>Shadows</em> exploring the wilds.

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/i-played-11-assassins-creed-games-in-11-years-and-odyssey-made-them-all-worth-it/">I loved that shift</a>, as I felt the old formula had grown stale over a decade of annual releases. Many other longtime fans did not agree. So in the weeks leading up to <em>Shadows</em>' launch, Ubisoft was in a tough spot: please the old-school fans or fans of the ancient trilogy. The publisher tried to please both at once with <em>Valhalla</em> but ended up not really making anyone happy, and it tried a retro throwback with <em>Mirage</em>, which was well-received by a dedicated cohort, but that didn't make many waves outside that OG community.</p>
<p dir="auto">During development, a Ubisoft lead publicly assured fans that <em>Shadows</em> would be a big departure from <em>Odyssey</em>, seemingly letting folks know which fanbase the game was meant to please. That's why I was surprised when <em>Shadows</em> actually came out and was... a lot like <em>Odyssey</em>—more like <em>Odyssey</em> than any other game in the franchise, in fact.</p>

<p dir="auto">Similar to <em>Odyssey</em>, <em>Shadows</em> has deep character progression, gear, and RPG systems. It is also far more focused on the countryside than on urban gameplay and has no social stealth. It has branching dialogue (anemic though that feature may be) and plays like a modernization of <em>The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Yet it seems this time around, most players are happy. What gives?</p>
<p dir="auto">Well, <em>Shadows</em> exhibits a level of polish and handcrafted care that many <em>Odyssey</em> detractors felt was lacking. In other words, the game is so slick and fun to play, it's hard to dislike it just because it's not exactly what <em>you</em> would have done had you been in charge of picking the next direction for the franchise.</p>
<p dir="auto">Part of that comes from learning lessons from the specific complaints that even <em>Odyssey</em>'s biggest fans had about that game, but part of it can be attributed to the fact that Ubisoft did something uncharacteristic this time around: It delayed an Assassin's Creed game for months to make sure the team could nail it.</p>

<p dir="auto">Last fall, Ubisoft published <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, which was basically Assassin's Creed set in the Star Wars universe. You'd think that would be a recipe for success, but the game landed with a thud. The critical reception was lukewarm, and gaming communities bounced off it quickly. And while it sold well by most single-player games' standards, it didn't sell well enough to justify its huge budget or to please either Disney or Ubisoft's bean counters.</p>
<p dir="auto">I played <em>Outlaws</em> a little bit, but I, too, dropped it after a short time. The stealth sequences were frustrating, its design decisions didn't seem very well-thought out, and it wasn't that fun to play.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since I wasn't alone in that impression, Ubisoft looked at <em>Shadows</em> (which was due to launch mere weeks later) and panicked. Was the studio on the right track? It made a fateful decision: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-after-poor-star-wars-outlaws-reception/">delay <em>Shadows</em> for months</a>, well beyond the quarter, to make sure it wouldn't disappoint as much as <em>Outlaws</em> did.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'm not privy to the inside discussions about that decision, but given that the business was surely counting on <em>Shadows</em> to deliver for the all-important holiday quarter and that Ubisoft had never delayed an Assassin's Creed title by more than a few weeks before, it probably wasn't an easy one.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's hard to imagine it was the wrong one, though. Like I said, <em>Shadows</em> might be the most polished and consistently fun Assassin's Creed game ever made.</p>

<p dir="auto">In an industry where quarterly profits are everything and building quality experiences for players or preserving the mental health and financial stability of employees are more in the "it's nice when it happens" category, I feel it's important to recognize when a company makes a better choice.</p>
<p dir="auto">I don't know what Ubisoft developers' internal experiences were, but I sincerely hope the extra time allowed them to both be happier with their work and their work-life balance. (If you're reading this and you work at Ubisoft and have insight, email me via my author page here. I want to know.)</p>

<p dir="auto">In any case, there's no question that players got a superior product because of the decision to delay the game. I can think of many times when players got angry at publishers for delaying games, but they shouldn't be. When a game gets delayed, that's not necessarily a bad sign. The more time the game spends in the oven, the better it's going to be. Players should welcome that.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, too, should business leaders at these publishers. Let <em>Shadows</em> be an example: Getting it right is worth it.</p>


<h2 dir="auto" data-heading="More dad rock, less prestige TV">More dad rock, less prestige TV</h2>
<p dir="auto">Of course, despite this game's positive reception among many fans, Assassin’s Creed in general is often reviled by some critics and gamers. Sure, there’s a reasonable and informed argument to be made that its big-budget excess, rampant commercialism, and formulaic checkbox-checking exemplify everything wrong with the AAA gaming industry right now.</p>
<p dir="auto">And certainly, there have been entries in the franchise's long history that lend ammunition to those criticisms. But since <em>Shadows</em> is good, this is an ideal time to discuss why the franchise (and this entry in particular) deserves more credit than it sometimes gets.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's use a pop culture analogy.</p>
<p dir="auto">In its current era, Assassin’s Creed is like the video game equivalent of the bands U2 or Tool. People call those “dad rock.” Taking a cue from those folks, I call <em>Shadows</em> and other titles like it (<em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, <em>Starfield</em>) “dad games.”</p>
<p dir="auto">While the kids are out there seeking fame through competitive prowess and streaming in <em>Valorant</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> or building chaotic metaverses in <em>Roblox</em> and—well, also <em>Fortnite</em>—games like <em>Shadows</em> are meant to appeal to a different sensibility. It’s one that had its heyday in the 2000s and early 2010s, before the landscape shifted.</p>
<p dir="auto">We’re talking single-player games, cutting-edge graphics showcases, and giant maps full of satisfying checklists.</p>
<p dir="auto">In a time when all the biggest games are multiplayer games-as-a-service, when many people are questioning whether graphics are advancing rapidly enough to make them a selling point on their own, and when checklist design is maligned by critics in favor of more holistic ideas, <em>Shadows</em> represents an era that may soon by a bygone one.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p dir="auto">So, yes, given the increasingly archaic sensibility in which it’s rooted and the current age of people for whom that era was prime gaming time, the core audience for <em>Shadows</em> probably now includes a whole lot of dads and moms.</p>

<p dir="auto">There's a time and a place for pushing the envelope or experimenting, but media that deftly treads comfortable ground doesn't get enough appreciation.</p>
<p dir="auto">Around the time Ubisoft went all-in on this formula with <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla</em>, lots of people sneered, saying it was like watered-down <em>The</em> <em>Witcher 3</em> or <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. Those games from CD Projekt Red and Rockstar Games moved things forward, while Ubisoft's games seemed content to stay in proven territory.</p>
<p dir="auto">Those people tended to look at this from a business point of view: Woe is an industry that avoids bold and challenging choices for fear of losing an investment. But playing it safe can be a good experience for players, and not just because it allows developers to deliver a refined product.</p>
<p dir="auto">Safety is the point. Yeah, I appreciate something that pushes the envelope in production values and storytelling. If <em>The Witcher 3</em> and <em>RDR2</em> were TV shows, we’d call them “prestige TV”—a type of show that’s all about expanding and building on what television can be, with a focus on critical acclaim and cultural capital.</p>
<p dir="auto">I, too, enjoy prestige shows like HBO’s <em>The White Lotus</em>. But sometimes I have to actually work on getting myself in the mood to watch a show like that. When I’ve had a particularly draining day, I don’t want challenging entertainment. That’s when it’s time to turn on <em>Parks and Recreation</em> or <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>—unchallenging or nostalgic programming that lets me zone out in my comfort zone for a while.</p>
<p dir="auto">That's what Assassin's Creed has been for about a decade now—comfort gaming for a certain audience. Ubisoft knows that audience well, and the game is all the more effective because the studios that made it were given the time to fine-tune every part of it <em>for</em> that audience.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> isn't groundbreaking, and that's OK, because it's a hundred hours of fun and relaxation. It's definitely not prestige gaming. It’s dad gaming: comfortable, refined, a little corny, but satisfying. If that's what you crave with your limited free time, it's worth a try.</p>
