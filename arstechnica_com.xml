          <p>Longtime Valve watchers likely remember <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/steam-machines/">Steam Machines</a>, the company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">aborted</a>, pre-Steam Deck attempt at crafting a line of third-party gaming PC hardware based around <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/12/valve-first-version-of-steamos-to-be-released-to-the-masses-on-friday/">an early verison of its Linux-based SteamOS</a>. Now, there are strong signs that Valve is on the verge of launching a similar third-party hardware branding effort under the "Powered by SteamOS" label.</p>
<p>The newest sign of those plans come via <a href="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steam_brandGuidelines.pdf">newly updated branding guidelines</a> posted by Valve on Wednesday (as noticed by <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamworksDocumentation/compare/d54725a035de...41944930ea8a#diff-5daae83579359a756437d0a949cfce0a729a6857724a1740b2825f45fd0d9292">the trackers at SteamDB</a>). That update includes the first appearance of a new "Powered by SteamOS" logo intended "for hardware running the SteamOS operating system, implemented in close collaboration with Valve."</p>
<p>The document goes on to clarify that the new Powered by SteamOS logo "indicates that a hardware device will run the SteamOS and boot into SteamOS upon powering on the device." That's distinct from the licensed branding for merely "Steam Compatible" devices, which include "non-Valve input peripherals" that have been reviewed by Valve to work with Steam.</p>
<p>The new guidelines replace <a href="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/Steam_Guidelines_060222.pdf">an older set of branding guidelines</a>, last revised in late 2017, that included detailed instructions for how to use the old "Steam Machines" name and logo on third-party hardware. That branding has been functionally defunct for years, making Valve's apparent need to suddenly update it more than a little suspect.</p>
