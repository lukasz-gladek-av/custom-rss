<h2>End of an era</h2>
<p>Polygon was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/polygon-com-its-a-website.1185405/">founded in 2012</a> when Vox Media <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2012/10/24/the-inside-story-of-polygon-the-verges-new-gaming-sister-site/">spent significant money</a> to poach top journalists from popular gaming blogs like Kotaku, Joystiq, and The Escapist. After initially publishing as the Gaming section of Vox.com for a few months, the Polygon domain <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2012/10/24/3547938/welcome-to-polygon">launched</a> alongside <a href="https://botherer.org/2012/08/23/polygon-and-the-documentary-that-cured-cancer/">a series of flashy videos</a> hyping up the staff's lofty goals for video game journalism.</p>
<p>In the years since, Polygon has become a respected source for news and views on the gaming and entertainment industries—one that Ars Technica has cited frequently during my tenure as senior gaming editor.</p>
<p>"Just completely sickened by this news," Polygon cofounder Brian Crecente <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/crecente.bsky.social/post/3lo4nrllxuc25">shared on Bluesky</a>. "Mostly for those so suddenly and deeply impacted, but also for the dwindling number of publications seriously covering video games."</p>
<p>New Polygon owner Valnet publishes dozens of Internet content brands<span>, which collectively have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.valnetinc.com/en/screen-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 260 million page views</a></span>. But the publisher, founded by Pornhub co-founder Hassan Youssef, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/">has earned something of a reputation</a> over the years for exploitative work conditions and quick-churn, clickbait content. One contributor to Valnet-owned Collider <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/">told The Wrap</a> last year that the site runs as "a content mill, borderline like almost sweatshop-level," with writers "constantly being pushed to write more, to do it quicker."</p>
<p>"We’re proud to have built Polygon into the gaming authority for both experts and casual fans alike, a publication that has informed and delighted tens of millions of gaming enthusiasts since its founding at Vox Media more than a decade ago," Vox Media co-founder, chair, and CEO Jim Bankoff <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250501630767/en/Valnet-Acquires-Premium-Gaming-Publication-Polygon-from-Vox-Media">said in a statement</a>.</p>
