<p>Those additional options should be welcome news for fans looking for new ways to play PC games of a certain era. The PC Gaming Wiki <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/List_of_Direct3D_2-7_games">lists over 400 titles</a> written with the D3D7 APIs, and while most of those games were released between 2000 and 2004, a handful of new D3D7 games have continued to be released through 2022.</p>
<p>The D3D7 games list predictably includes a lot of licensed shovelware, but there are also well-remembered games like <em>Escape from Monkey Island</em>, <em>Arx Fatalis</em>, and the original <em>Hitman: Codename 47</em>. WinterSnowfall writes that the project was inspired by a desire to play games like <em>Sacrifice</em> and <em>Disciples II</em> on top of the existing dxvk framework.</p>
<p>Despite some <a href="https://github.com/WinterSnowfall/d7vk/issues">known issues with certain D3D7 titles</a>, WinterSnowfall writes that recent tuning means “things are now anywhere between decent to stellar in most of the supported games.” Still, the project author warns that the project will likely never reach full compatibility since “D3D7 is a land of highly cursed API interoperability.”</p>
<p>Don’t expect this project to expand to include support for even older DirectX APIs, either, WinterSnowfall warns. “D3D7 is enough of a challenge and a mess as it is,” the author writes. “The further we stray from D3D9, the further we stray from the divine.”</p>
