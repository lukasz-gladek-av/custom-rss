<p>Digital Foundry also notes that the Switch 2's stated clock speeds can be tuned to higher theoretical maximums: 1.4 GHz for the GPU and 1.7 GHz for the CPU. Nintendo could eventually make use of this headroom for improved graphical performance and faster loading screens, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2019-nintendo-switch-boost-mode-analysis">it did on the original Switch in 2019</a>. And while developers can adjust the GPU clock rate used by their games, it's unclear if they'll be able to directly overclock to the theoretical maximum themselves.</p>
<h2>System resources</h2>
<p>As on the original Switch, 25 percent of the CPU cores and overall memory on the Switch 2 is reserved by the system for OS features and is thus inaccessible to game developers directly. Digital Foundry also notes that some GPU resources are reserved by the system OS, though it didn't provide a precise measurement for this amount.</p>

<p>This time around, those system-level features include <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">Game Chat</a>, which offers the ability to stream gameplay and/or webcam video from up to four friends to a single system. Even with significant resources set aside by the OS, though, Digital Foundry notes that Game Chat has "a significant impact on system resources," leading Nintendo to provide developers with a testing tool that "simulates API latency and L3 cache misses" that can happen when Game Chat is in use.</p>
<p>Aside from the core pixel-pushing hardware, the Switch 2 also adds a new separate File Decompression Engine, which can handle loading game data off of the system's 256GB of on-board UFS memory and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/what-is-microsd-express-and-why-is-it-mandatory-for-the-nintendo-switch-2/">MicroSD Express expansion cards</a> without taxing the CPU. And while the Switch 2's portable screen includes support for variable refresh rates up to 120 Hz, there is currently no official support for VRR on HDMI displays connected to the system's dock.</p>
<p>While it's fun to look at numbers, the real proof of the Switch 2's hardware power will be in the performance of its games. We look forward to having more direct comparisons of software performance when the console launches next month.</p>
