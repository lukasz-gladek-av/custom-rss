          <p>A PC mod that added online gameplay to Rockstar’s 2006 school-exploration title <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2006/10/bully/"><em>Bully</em></a> was abruptly taken down on Wednesday, roughly a month after it was first made available. While the specific reason for the “Bully Online” takedown hasn’t been publicly discussed, a <a href="https://x.com/TheNathanNS/status/2011478101419544964">message posted by the developers</a> to the project’s now-defunct Discord server clarifies that “this was not something we wanted.”</p>
<p>The Bully Online mod was spearheaded by Swegta, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SWEGTA/videos">Rockstar-focused YouTuber</a> who <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-may-not-have-bully-2-but-this-fan-made-bully-online-mod-may-be-the-next-best-thing">formally announced the project in October</a> as a mod that “allows you and your friends to play minigames, role-play, compete in racing, fend off against NPCs, and much more.”</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement, Swegta said the mod was “a project me and my team have been working on for a very long time” and that early access in December would be limited to those who contributed at least $8 to a Ko-Fi account. When December actually rolled around, though, a message on Swegta.com (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260113025609/https://swegta.com/">archived</a>) suggested that the mod was being released freely as an open source project, with a registration page (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260114160805/https://swegta.com/online/">archived</a>) offering new accounts to anyone.</p>
<p>That source code has now been completely removed from Swegta.com, along with any webpages referencing the project or offering downloads for the mod’s custom launcher. On Discord, the team said that development of any Bully Online scripts would stop and that any account data created by users would be deleted.</p>
