          <p>Two key writers of HBO's series&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em> are moving on, according to announcements on Instagram yesterday. Neil Druckmann, co-creator of the franchise, and Halley Gross, co-writer of <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> and frequent writer on the show, are both leaving before work begins on season 3.</p>
<p>Both were credited as executive producers on the show; Druckmann frequently contributed writing to episodes, as did Gross, and Druckmann also directed. Druckmann and Gross co-wrote the second game, <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>.</p>
<p>Druckmann said in his announcement <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLnTt7ZPVbJ/">post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve made the difficult decision to step away from my creative involvement in <em>The Last of Us</em> on HBO. With work completed on season 2 and before any meaningful work starts on season 3, now is the right time for me to transition my complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects, including writing and directing our exciting next game, <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>, along with my responsibilities as Studio Head and Head of Creative.</p>
<p>Co-creating the show has been a career highlight. It’s been an honor to work alongside Craig Mazin to executive produce, direct and write on the last two seasons. I’m deeply thankful for the thoughtful approach and dedication the talented cast and crew took to adapting <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> and the continued adaptation of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p></blockquote>
