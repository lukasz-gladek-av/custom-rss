          <p>The Switch 2’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendos-game-key-cards-for-the-switch-2/">data-free, download-enabling Game Key Cards</a> have proved <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendo%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cgame-key-cards%E2%80%9D-for-the-switch-2.1506662/#post-43644552">controversial with players</a> who worry about long-term ownership and access issues to their purchases. But they’ve remained <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2s-gameless-game-key-cards-are-going-to-be-very-common/">popular with publishers</a> that want to save production costs on a boxed Switch 2 game release, since Game Key Cards don’t include any of the expensive flash memory found on a standard Switch 2 cartridge.</p>
<p>Now, though, at least one publisher has publicly suggested that Nintendo is offering cheaper Switch 2 cartridge options with smaller storage capacities, lowering production costs in a way that could make full cartridge releases more viable for many games on the console.</p>
<p><a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/regarding-the-physical-format-on-nintendo-switch-2-please-read-carefully">Earlier this week</a>, <em>R-Type Dimensions III </em>publisher Inin Games explained to customers that it couldn’t switch from Game Key Cards to a “full physical cartridge” for the retail version of the Switch 2 game without “significantly rais[ing] manufacturing costs.” Those additional costs would “force us to increase the retail price by at least €15 [about $20],” Inin Games wrote at the time.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/doesitplay.org/post/3mae3kmiy5y2b">an update posted to social media earlier today</a>, though, the publisher said that “there is no better timing: two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge [storage capacity] sizes for Nintendo Switch 2. This allows us to recalculate production in a way that wasn’t possible before.”</p>
<p>As such, Inin said it has decided to replace the Game Key Cards that were going to be in the game’s retail box with full physical cartridges. That change will result in the game’s asking price going up by €10 (about $13) “due to still higher production costs,” Inin explained. Still, that’s still less than the “at least €15” Inin was speculatively quoting for the same change just days ago. And Inin said early pre-order customers for <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em> won’t have to pay the increased price, essentially getting the full cartridge at no additional cost.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot Games is making an anti-cheat change that could be rough on older PCs]]></title>
            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/some-valorant-players-need-to-update-their-pc-bios-to-keep-anti-cheat-software-happy/</link>

<p>But Riot says it’s considering rolling the BIOS requirement out to all players in <em>Valorant</em>‘s highest competitive ranking tiers (Ascendant, Immortal, and Radiant), where there’s more to be gained from working around the anti-cheat software. And Riot anti-cheat analyst Mohamed Al-Sharifi says the same restrictions <a href="https://x.com/ItsGamerDoc/status/2001831378401530297">could be turned on</a> for&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>, though they aren’t currently. If users are blocked from playing by Vanguard, they’ll need to download and install the latest BIOS update for their motherboard before they’ll be allowed to launch the game.</p>

<p>The vulnerability is known to affect four of the largest PC motherboard makers: ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI. All four have released updates for at least some of their newer motherboards, while other boards have updates coming later. According to <a href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/382314">the vulnerability note</a>, it’s unclear whether systems from OEMs like Dell, Lenovo, Acer, or HP are affected.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.asrock.com/support/Security.asp?iD=1">ASRock’s security bulletin</a> about the issue says it affects Intel boards based on the 500-, 600-, 700-, and 800-series chipsets; <a href="https://csr.msi.com/global/product-security-advisories">MSI</a> only lists the 600- and 700-series chipsets. <a href="https://www.asus.com/security-advisory/">Asus</a> is also missing the 800-series, but says the vulnerability affects boards based on even older 400-series Intel chipsets; <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Support/Security/2338">Gigabyte</a>, meanwhile, covers 600-through-800-series Intel chipsets, but is also the only vendor to mention patches for AMD’s 600- and 800-series chipsets (any motherboard with an AM5 socket, in short).</p>
<p>Collectively, all of these chipsets cover Intel’s 10th-generation Core processors and newer, and AMD Ryzen 7000 series and newer.</p>
<p>What’s unclear is whether the boards and chipsets that go unmentioned by each vendor aren’t getting a patch because they don’t <em>need</em> a patch, if they will be patched but they just aren’t being mentioned, or if they aren’t getting a patch at all. The bulletins at least suggest that 400- and 500-series Intel chipsets and 600- and 800-series AMD chipsets <em>could</em> be affected, but not all vendors have promised patches for them.</p>
