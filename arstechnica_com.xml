<blockquote><p>Chrono Divide is a fan-made project which aims to recreate the original “Red Alert 2” from the “Command &amp; Conquer” series using web technologies. The result is a game client that runs in your web browser, with no additional plugins or applications installed.</p>
<p>The project initially started out as an experiment and was meant to prove that it was possible to have a fully working, cross-platform RTS game running in a web browser. Now, with a playable version already available, the end-goal is reaching feature parity with the original vanilla “Red Alert 2” engine.</p></blockquote>
<p>It works with a client-server model (“say goodbye to port forwarding and firewall exceptions”), supports mods, offers both modern and classic mouse control schemes, and works “on any device and operating system, directly from your web browser,” including phones and tablets. You (understandably) have to have a copy of the game files to play, though.</p>
<p>Further, there are leaderboards and a <a href="https://discord.gg/uavJ34JTWY">Discord server</a>, plus modern-game-style “seasons” (with no monetization, of course) that feature special rules and map rotations. So there’s a decent-sized community playing <em>Red Alert 2</em> on the regular in 2025, which is pretty wild.</p>
<p>Chrono Divide joins a handful of similar projects in bringing older multiplayer PC games with modern bells and whistles to web browsers. One example: <a href="https://dos.zone/mp/?lobby=*">DOS Zone</a> offers one-click joining of online matches of <em>Doom</em>, <em>Quake 2</em> and <em>3</em>, <em>Unreal Tournament</em>, and <em>Half-Life: Deathmatch</em>—again, with a Discord server for an extra community layer.</p>
<p>So if you want to spend your Friday night reliving the TCP/IP and LAN party multiplayer games of the early 2000s, well, there you go. I’ll see you there—I still think <em>Unreal Tournament</em> is the best multiplayer first-person shooter ever made.</p>
