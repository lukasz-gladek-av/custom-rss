          <p>Back in 2004, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-half-life-2-helped-sell-steam-to-a-skeptical-pc-gaming-market/">the launch of <em>Half-Life 2</em> would help launch Steam</a> on the path to eventually becoming the de facto digital rights management (DRM) system for the vast majority of PC games. But years before that, with the 1998 launch of the original <em>Half-Life</em>, Valve cofounder and then-CMO Monica Harrington said she was inspired to take DRM more seriously by her nephew's reaction to the purchase of a new CD-ROM burner.</p>
<p>PC Gamer <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/valves-drm-was-inspired-by-the-cmos-nephew-who-used-a-usd500-check-id-sent-him-for-school-expenses-and-bought-himself-a-cd-rom-replicator-he-sent-me-a-lovely-thank-you-note/">pulled that interesting tidbit</a> from <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/how-valve-became-valve-an-insiders-account/911257">a talk Harrington gave at last week's Game Developers Conference</a>. In her remembering, Harrington's nephew had used funds she had sent for school supplies on a CD replicator, then sent her "a lovely thank you note essentially saying how happy he was to copy and share games with his friends."</p>
<p>That was the moment Harrington said she realized this new technology was leading to a "generational shift" in both the availability and acceptability of PC game piracy. While game piracy and DRM definitely existed prior to CD burners (anyone else remember the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Tz0YpDa6o">large codewheels</a> that cluttered many early PC game boxes?), Harrington said the new technology—and the blasé attitude her nephew showed toward using it for piracy—could "put our entire business model at risk."</p>
<p>Shortly after <em>Half-Life</em> launched <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Half-Life">with a simple CD key verification system in place</a>, Harrington said the company noticed a wave of message board complaints about the game not working. But when Valve cofounder (and Monica's then-husband) Mike Harrington followed up with those complaining posters, he found that "none of them had actually bought the game. So it turned out that the authentication system was working really well," Harrington said.</p>
