<p>To demonstrate the Switch 2's mouse controls, Nintendo showed a new game called <em>Drag x Drive</em>, planned for Summer 2025. This dual-mouse controlled game lets you control a player in a <em>Rocket League</em>-style 3 on 3 basketball match. Sliding one mouse is used to move your character while waving the other can be used to shoot or wave to other players to call for the ball. Players were also shown rolling up halfpipes near the basket for massive dunks.</p>

<p>An optional Nintendo Switch 2 camera connected to the system dock will let you appear on screen and video chat over gameplay, or in a small circle next to your character. The GameChat feature will require Nintendo Switch Online membership, or without through March 31, 2026.</p>


<p>The Switch 2 will feature a 7.9" LCD display with "approximately double the pixels" of the original Switch, on a 1080p screen that supports up to 120 fps and "more vivid" HDR colors. When docked, the system will support resolutions up to 4K, and includes a cooling fan to "help keep performance stable."</p>

<p>The Switch 2 will include 256 GB of internal storage. Players can add additional storage only through MicroSD Express cards, which will "make high-speed data transfers possible." Regular MicroSD cards that work on Switch will not be compatible with the new console. Game Cards for the Switch 2 resemble the shape of those for the original Switch, but will be in red and feature "much faster data reading speeds," Nintendo announced.</p>
<p>As seen previously, the Joy-Cons will be bigger than on the original Switch, and feature larger shoulder buttons on the inside edges. The system itself has a larger, "more sturdy" stand that can be adjusted in multiple angles. A second USB-C outlet on the top of the system will allow for easier charging and connections.</p>
<p>Third-party publishers announced a number of ports for the Switch 2, including <em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Hades II, Street Fighter VI, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Hogwarts Legacy </em>(with new Mouse Controls)<em>, Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, and Hitman: World of Assassination</em>.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch Online memberships will carry over to Switch 2. And Switch 2 owners who subscribe to the Expansion Pack will get access to a library of Nintendo Gamecube games including <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>,&nbsp;<em>Soulcalibur II, F-Zero GX </em>at launch, with more to be added in the future. These games will feature "sharper graphics and higher resolution" than the original releases, Nintendo said. A replica wireless GameCube controller will also be available for purchase by Nintendo Switch Online members.</p>
