<p>The Joy-Con can also be used as a mouse by sliding the edge along a table. This mode combines with the Joy-Con's internal gyroscope to let you angle shots with a putter while moving the mouse to control the position, for instance.</p>

<p>An optional Nintendo Switch 2 camera connected to the system dock will let you appear on screen and video chat over gameplay, or in a small circle next to your character. The GameChat feature will require Nintendo Switch Online membership, or without through March 31, 2026.</p>


<p>The Switch 2 will feature a 7.9" LCD display with "approximately double the pixels" of the original Switch, on a 1080p screen that supports up to 120 fps and "more vivid" HDR colors. When docked, the system will support resolutions up to 4K, and includes a cooling fan to "help keep performance stable."</p>

<p>The Switch 2 will include 256 GB of internal storage. Players can add additional storage only through MicroSD Express cards, which will "make high-speed data transfers possible." Regular MicroSD cards that work on Switch will not be compatible with the new console. Game Cards for the Switch 2 resemble the shape of those for the original Switch, but will be in red and feature "much faster data reading speeds," Nintendo announced.</p>
<p>As seen previously, the Joy-Cons will be bigger than on the original Switch, and feature larger shoulder buttons on the inside edges. The system itself has a larger, "more sturdy" stand that can be adjusted in multiple angles. A second USB-C outlet on the top of the system will allow for easier charging and connections.</p>
<p>Third-party publishers announced a number of ports for the Switch 2, including <em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Hades II, Street Fighter VI, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Hogwarts Legacy </em>(with new Mouse Controls)<em>, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, and&nbsp;Hitman: World of Assassination</em>.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated as new information comes in.</em></p>
