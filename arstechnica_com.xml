          <p>Julian LeFay, the man often credited as "the father of The Elder Scrolls," has died at the age of 59, his creative partners announced this week.</p>
<p>"It is with profound sadness and heavy hearts that we inform our community of the passing of Julian LeFay, our beloved Technical Director and co-founder of Once Lost Games," his colleagues <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oncelostgames.bsky.social/post/3lum4pyp3cs2e">wrote in a Bluesky post</a>.</p>
<p>LeFay spent most of the 1990s at Bethesda Softworks, culminating in his work on The Elder Scrolls series into the late '90s.</p>
<p>His career didn't start with The Elder Scrolls, though. Beginning in 1988, LeFay made music for the Amiga hack-and-slash game <em>Sword of Sodan</em> as well as the NES game <em>Where's Waldo</em>, and he did design and programming work on titles like&nbsp;<em>Wayne Gretzky Hockey</em>, the DOS version of <em>Dragon's Lair</em>, and two DOS games based on the Terminator movie franchise.</p>
<p>In the early '90s, he joined fellow Bethesda developers Ted Peterson and Vijay Lakshman on an Ultima Underworld-inspired RPG that would come to be called <em>The Elder Scrolls: Arena</em>. Though famed creative director Todd Howard has helmed the franchise since its third entry, <em>The Elder Scrolls: Arena</em> and <em>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</em> were chiefly spearheaded by LeFay. One of the gods of The Elder Scrolls universe was named after LeFay, and the setting was inspired by the literature and tabletop role-playing games LeFay and Peterson enjoyed.</p>
