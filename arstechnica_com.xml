          <p>Valve's updates to its classic games evoke Hemingway's two kinds of going bankrupt: gradually, then suddenly. Nothing is heard, little is seen, and then, one day, <em>Half-Life 2: Deathmatch</em>,&nbsp;<em>Day of Defeat</em>, and other Source-engine-based games get a bevy of modern upgrades. Now, the entirety of <em>Team Fortress 2</em> (<em>TF2</em>) client and server game code, a boon for modders and fixers, is also being released.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_2013">source code</a> allows for more ambitious projects than have been possible thus far, <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=238809">Valve wrote in a blog post</a>. "Unlike the Steam Workshop or local content mods, this SDK gives mod makers the ability to change, extend, or rewrite <em>TF2</em>, making anything from small tweaks to complete conversions possible." The SDK license restricts any resulting projects to "a non-commercial basis," but they can be published on Steam's store as their own entities.</p>
<p>Since it had the tools out, Valve also poked around the games based on that more open source engine and spiffed them up as well. Most games got 64-bit binary support, scalable HUD graphics, borderless window options, and the like. Many of these upgrades come from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/valve-celebrates-25-years-of-half-life-with-feature-packed-steam-update/">the big 25-year anniversary update made to&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2</em></a>, which included "overbright lighting," gamepad configurations, Steam networking support, and the like.</p>
