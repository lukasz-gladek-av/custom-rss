    <p><span>Of note in this encased Switch 2 shot from a Genki video: the top USB port, expanded shoudler buttons, mysterious C button below the Home button.</span>

<p>Away from CES, Genki's website was updated Tuesday night with <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/pages/ns2_accessories">a new video</a> showing encased Switch 2 Joy-Cons attaching to the tablet via a horizontal snap-on motion, as opposed to the vertical slide seen on the original Switch. The video also shows a special lever on the back of the Joy-Cons engaging to detach the Joy-Cons horizontally, seemingly with the aid of a small extendable post near the top of the inner edge of the controller itself.</p>
<p>The inner edges of the Joy-Cons shown in Genki's video match very closely with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/switch-2-leaks-point-to-controllers-that-work-like-computer-mice/">other recent leaked photos of the Switch 2 Joy-Cons</a>, right down to the mysterious optical sensor. That sensor can even be seen flashing a laser-like red dot in the Genki promo video, helping to support rumors of mouse-like functionality for the controllers. The Genki video also offers a brief glimpse of the Switch 2 itself sliding into a familiar-looking dock labeled with an embossed Switch logo and a large number 2 next to it.</p>

<p>A Genki representative also told Numerama that the company expects the console to be released in April, which is just after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/nintendo-pre-announces-a-switch-2-announcement-is-coming-eventually/">Nintendo's self-imposed deadline</a> for announcing more details about the system. The company had better get a move on, as third-party accessory makers are apparently getting tired of waiting.</p>
