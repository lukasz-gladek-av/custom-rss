          <p>The GeForce RTX 5090 and 5080 are both very fast graphics cards—if you can look past the possibility that we may have yet another power-connector-related overheating problem on our hands. But the vast majority of people (including you, discerning and tech-savvy Ars Technica reader) won't be spending $1,000 or $2,000 (<a href="https://www.newegg.com/gigabyte-gv-n5090aorus-m-32gd-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-32gb-gddr7/p/N82E16814932760">or $2,750 or whatever</a>) on a new graphics card this generation.</p>
<p>No, statistically, you (like most people) will probably end up buying one of the more affordable midrange Nvidia or AMD cards, GPUs that are all slated to begin shipping later this month or early in March.</p>
<p>There has been a spate of announcements on that front this week. Nvidia announced yesterday that the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, which the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/geforce-rtx-50-gpus-run-from-1999-to-549-lean-heavily-on-ai-generated-frames/">previously introduced at CES</a>, would be available starting on February 20 for $749 and up. The new GPU, like the RTX 5080, looks like a relatively modest upgrade from last year's RTX 4070 Ti Super. But it ought to at least flirt with affordability for people who are looking to get natively rendered 4K without automatically needing to enable DLSS upscaling to get playable frame rates.</p>

<p>That said, if the launches of the 5090 and 5080 are anything to go by, it may not be easy to find and buy the RTX 5070 Ti for anything close to the listed retail price; early retail listings <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/rtx-5070-ti-listings-appear-on-us-and-eu-retailers-some-at-nearly-double-the-msrp">are not promising</a> on this front. You'll also be relying exclusively on Nvidia's partners to deliver unadorned, relatively minimalist MSRP versions of the cards since Nvidia isn't making a Founders Edition version.</p>
<p>As for the $549 RTX 5070, Nvidia's website <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/50-series/rtx-5070-family/">says</a> it's launching on March 5. But it's less exciting than the other 50-series cards because it has <em>fewer</em> CUDA cores than the outgoing RTX 4070 Super, leaving it even more reliant on AI-generated frames to improve performance compared to the last generation.</p>
