<p><em>Black &amp; White</em> was intriguing; it had classic Molyneaux over-reach and deserves, in the words of one Ars staffer, a re-release so that "a new generation can realize just how janky it is." As detailed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtNvEna6bxc">a documentary by Noclip</a>, the <em>B&amp;W </em>games are stuck in publishing purgatory. Microsoft acquired Lionhead's IP and assets, while Electronic Arts retains the publishing rights to the <em>B&amp;W&nbsp;</em>games, and nobody has yet been able to align those two very large planets.</p>
<p>GOG has added its own "Our Pick" tag to games it wants to see brought forward onto modern systems. Among them is <em><a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/freelancer">Freelancer</a>,</em> which Ars' Samuel Axon described in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ars-favorite-games-of-2024-that-were-not-released-in-2024/">our 2024 roundup of non-2024 games</a> as "a sincere attempt to make games like <em>Elite (Dangerous)</em> and <em>Wing Commander: Privateer</em> far more accessible." GOG selected <em>Freelancer</em> as <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/dreamlist-gog-staff-picks/">one of its staff picks</a> for the Dreamlist, citing its "dynamic economy and engaging storyline."</p>
<p>The main thing GOG would be fixing with&nbsp;<em>Freelancer</em>, as with many games, would be simple availability, as the game is not available on any proper digital storefront. Axon reports that, in having an original disc, installing <em>Freelancer</em> was not too hard, with the installer working in Windows 11. You can apply <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Freelancer">community patches</a>, like an "HD Edition" mod, but Axon preferred playing at a non-native resolution (1024×768) at 4:3 and adjusting his monitor.</p>
<p>Other notable games GOG and its voting public want to see brought back are <em><a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a>&nbsp;</em>(the original, not <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/final-fantasy-vii-remake-on-pc-a-gorgeous-start-but-where-are-the-toggles/">the remake</a>), the point-and-click <a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/discworld"><em>Discworld </em></a>adventure,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/command-conquer-the-ultimate-collection"><em>Command &amp; Conquer: The Ultimate Collection</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/the-operative-no-one-lives-forever">The Operative: No One Lives Forever</a>.</em></p>
