          <p>It has been over six years since Epic <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/epic-undercuts-steam-with-new-store-that-gives-devs-more-money/">started undercutting Steam's 30 percent revenue share for developers</a>, asking for just 12 percent of sales on its then-new Epic Games Store. Now, Epic is going even further by reducing those fees to zero for a game's first $1 million in annual sales.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update">newly announced fee structure</a> will go into effect in June, Epic said, and will apply to a developer's revenue on a "per app" basis. After the first $1 million in annual sales, apps will be charged the usual 12 percent fee for listing on the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Epic has offered a financial break to smaller developers. Back in 2011, the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/02/no-royalties-on-unreal-development-kit-until-5000-in-sales/">eschewed royalty payments for the first $50,000 in sales</a> for projects made with the newly free Unreal Development Kit. By 2020, that royalty-free grace period for Unreal Engine projects <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/unreal-engine-is-now-royalty-free-until-a-game-makes-a-whopping-1-mill/">was increased to cover the first $1 million in lifetime sales</a> for a project.</p>
<h2>Looking out for the little guy?</h2>
<p>Epic's focus on the low end of the gaming revenue scale is something of an inverse of Valve's fee structure on Steam. In 2018, Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/steam-now-gives-its-biggest-developers-a-bigger-cut-of-the-revenue/">cut its default 30 percent revenue share</a>&nbsp;to 25 percent, but only for lifetime per-game earnings in excess of $10 million. Valve's fee goes down again to 20 percent after a game hits $50 million in lifetime sales.</p>
