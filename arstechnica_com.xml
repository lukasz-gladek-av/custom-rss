          <p>It’s been over 10 years since the launch of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/05/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-hunting-fiends-for-fun-and-forever/">the excellent <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em></a>, and nearly four years since <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/news/42167/a-new-saga-begins">the announcement</a> of “the next installment in The Witcher series of video games.” Despite those long waits, developer CD Projekt Red is still insisting it will deliver the next three complete <em>Witcher</em> games in a short six-year window.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">a recent earnings call</a>, CDPR VP of Business Development Michał Nowakowski suggested that a rapid release schedule would be enabled in no small part by the team’s transition away from its proprietary REDEngine to the popular Unreal Engine <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/the-witcher-will-return-as-a-triple-a-rpg-shifting-to-unreal-engine-5/">in 2022</a>. At the time, CDPR said the transition to Unreal Engine would “elevate development predictability and efficiency, while simultaneously granting us access to cutting-edge game development tools.” Those considerations seemed especially important in the wake of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/cd-projekt-red-offers-refunds-to-unsatisfied-cyberpunk-2077-console-players/">widespread technical issues with the console versions of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, which CDPR later <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/cdpr-ceo-blames-in-game-streaming-for-cyberpunks-console-problems/">blamed on REDEngine’s “in-game streaming system.”</a></p>
<p>“We’re happy with how [Unreal Engine] is evolving through the Epic team’s efforts, and how we are learning how to make it work within a huge open-world game, as [<em>The Witcher 4</em>] is meant to be,” Nowakowski said in the recent earnings call. “In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time—as we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between <em>TW4</em> and <em>TW5</em>, between <em>TW5</em> and <em>TW6</em> and so on.”</p>
<h2>Don’t start the clock just yet</h2>
<p>To be clear, the “six-year period” Nowakowski is talking about here starts with the eventual release of <em>The Witcher 4</em>, meaning the developer plans to release two <em>additional</em> sequels within six years of that launch. And CDPR <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-cd-projekt-q3-2023-sees-strong-sales-and-strategic-growth-93CH-3947581">confirmed earlier this year</a> that <em>The Witcher 4</em> would not launch in 2026, extending the window for when we can expect all these promised new games.</p>
