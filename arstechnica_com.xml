          <p>Microsoft is increasing the recommended asking price of Xbox hardware and accessories worldwide starting today and will start charging $79.99 for some new first-party games this holiday season. <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">The announcement</a> comes after "careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development," Microsoft said.</p>
<p>In the United States, this means Microsoft's premiere Xbox Series X will now cost $599.99 for a unit with a disc drive (up from $499.99), while the Digital version will cost $549.99 (up from $449.99). On the lower end, a 1 TB Xbox Series S will now cost $429.99 (up from $349.99), while a 512GB unit will cost $379.99 (up from $299.99).</p>
<p>The new prices are already reflected on Microsoft's official online store, and Microsoft says it will "provide updated recommended pricing to local retailers." That might leave a small window where you can get Xbox hardware and accessories from those retailers at the older, lower price while supplies remain available.</p>
<p>For headsets specifically, Microsoft said that pricing will change "in the US and Canada only," a potential recognition of the Trump administration tariffs on foreign goods imported into the United States. Microsoft also warned that "Xbox Series S and X availability may continue to change over time depending on the retailer and by country" as those tariffs threaten to upend international trade worldwide.</p>
<p>On the software side, Microsoft said the increase to $79.99 will apply to both digital and physical versions of "some" new games this holiday season. Existing Xbox games will not be seeing a price increase, and "different games and expansions will continue to be offered at a variety of price points."</p>
