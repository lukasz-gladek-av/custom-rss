          <p>The classic PC games market is "in a sorry state," according to DRM-free and classic-minded storefront GOG. Small games that aren't currently selling get abandoned, and compatibility issues arise as technology moves forward or as one-off development ideas age like milk.</p>
<p>Classic games are only 20 percent of GOG's catalog, and the firm hasn't actually called itself "Good Old Games" in 12 years. And yet, today, GOG announces that it is making "a significant commitment of resources" toward a new GOG Preservation Program. It starts with 100 games for which GOG's own developers are working to create current and future compatibility, keeping them DRM-free and giving them ongoing tech support, along with granting them a "Good Old Game: Preserved by GOG" stamp.</p>

<p>GOG is not shifting its mission of providing a DRM-free alternative to Steam, Epic, and other PC storefronts, at least not entirely. But it is demonstrably excited about a new focus that ties back to its original name, inspired in some part by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/5-years-after-it-was-yanked-off-stores-gogs-bringing-underrated-spy-rpg-alpha-protocol-in-from-the-cold-with-fewer-crashes-and-new-achievements/">its work on </a><em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/5-years-after-it-was-yanked-off-stores-gogs-bringing-underrated-spy-rpg-alpha-protocol-in-from-the-cold-with-fewer-crashes-and-new-achievements/">Alpha Protocol</a>.</em></p>
<p>"We think we can significantly impact the classics industry by focusing our resources on it and creating superior products," writes Arthur Dejardin, head of sales marketing at GOG. "If we wanted to spread the DRM-free gospel by focusing on getting new AAA games on GOG instead, we would make little progress with the same amount of effort and money (we’ve been trying various versions of that for the last 5 years)."</p>

<h2>Getting knights, demons, and zombies up to snuff</h2>
<p>What kind of games? Scanning the list of <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program">Good Old Games</a>, most of them are, by all accounts, both good and old. Personally, I'm glad to see the <em>Jagged Alliance</em> games,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Warcraft I &amp; II</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Keeper</em> <em>Gold </em>and&nbsp;<em>Theme Park</em>,&nbsp;<em>SimCity 3000 Unlimited,&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Wing Commander</em> series (particularly, personally,&nbsp;<em>Privateer)</em>. Most of them are, understandably, Windows-only, though Mac support extends to 34 titles so far, and Linux may pick up many more through Proton compatibility, beyond the 19 native titles to date.</p>
