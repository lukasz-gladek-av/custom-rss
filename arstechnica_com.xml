          <p>If you've been too busy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-captures-the-feel-of-a-great-indy-movie/">punching virtual Nazis</a>&nbsp;to take part in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/win-hardware-collectibles-and-more-in-the-2024-ars-technica-charity-drive/">this year's Ars Technica Charity Drive sweepstakes</a>, don't worry. You still have time to donate to a good cause and get a chance to win your share of over $4,000 worth of swag (no purchase necessary to win).</p>
<p>In the first three days of the drive, over 100 readers have contributed almost $9,500 to either the <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> or <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child's Play</a> as part of the charity drive (Child's Play is now leading in the donation totals by about $1,000). That's a long way off from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/ars-readers-gave-a-record-58000-in-2020-charity-drive/">2020's record haul of over $58,000</a>, but there's still plenty of time until the Charity Drive wraps up on Thursday, January 2, 2025.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean you should put your donation off, though. Do yourself and the charities involved a favor and give now while you're thinking about it.</p>
<p>See below for instructions on how to enter, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/win-hardware-collectibles-and-more-in-the-2024-ars-technica-charity-drive/">check out the Charity Drive kickoff post</a> for a complete list of available prizes.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Donating is easy. Simply <a href="https://childsplay.salsalabs.org/Donate/index.html">donate to Child's Play</a> using a credit card or PayPal or <a href="http://eff.org/AT2014">donate to the EFF</a> using PayPal, credit card, or cryptocurrency. You can also support Child's Play directly by using <a href="https://my.onecause.com/fundraiser/organizations/8534d777-53ce-4d94-a537-c8e0cbb7acb0/fundraisers/fundraiser:ae0c129c-94ac-4e63-a265-20b71ac4bd03">this Ars Technica campaign page</a> or picking an item from the Amazon wish list of a specific hospital on <a href="https://childsplaycharity.org/get-involved#hospital-map">its donation page</a>. Donate as much or as little as you feel comfortable withâ€”every little bit helps.</p>
