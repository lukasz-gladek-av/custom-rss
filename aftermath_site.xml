            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-respawn-titanfall-layoffs-andrew-wilson-pay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a very normal day</a>. Nothing is amiss. But just for fun, let’s have a gander at the most recent available information on how much EA execs, like CEO Andrew Wilson, are making.&nbsp;</p><p>Now admittedly, these numbers come from <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000712515/f0be0a59-dd50-4247-b36e-0513336b6c1f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA’s 2024 proxy statement</a>, the 2025 version of which is just around the corner, so they might be a little out of date. Still, I think they’re useful a) as a point of comparison to workers in less vaunted positions and b) because they’re from a time period during which EA <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/ea-layoffs-company-to-cut-5percent-of-workforce-or-about-670-employees.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut five percent of its global workforce</a> – the sort of ripcord a major video game publisher would obviously <em>never </em>pull again, but to liven up an otherwise dull day, why don’t we consider how such a thing does or does not impact executive compensation.</p><p>During fiscal 2024, Wilson took home over $25.6 million via a mixture of a $1.3 million base salary, $20.4 million in stock awards, $3.44 million from a non-equity incentive plan, and around $500,000 in personal security benefits. In the same proxy statement, EA said that the annual total compensation of its median employee was $148,704. If you crunch the numbers <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Game Developer did</a>, you’ll find that Wilson made 172 times more than the median EA worker.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re wondering how Wilson fared in years where EA didn’t lay off five percent of its workforce, well, those were some real belt-tightening times for the company’s head honcho, who pulled in only $20.6 million in fiscal 2023 and $19.8 million in fiscal 2022, down from $39 million the year prior, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-executives-blocked-from-received-exorbitant-awards-1844694638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an “exorbitant” level of executive pay</a> that shareholders ultimately <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-ceo-pay-apex-legends-fifa-battlefield-layoffs-compen-1849078379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voted to rein in</a>.</p><p>Here’s what other EA executives made during fiscal 2024:</p><figure></figure><p>Now, as a thought experiment, let’s say that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTk1MzQ2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2NTU4MjY4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVkhVQjFUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Ok9U1G-8KnrQWSRme5JF1VqfCPIxgENs3iq9d32PeRc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">300-400 workers had just gotten laid</a> off as a result of poor sales of games like <em>EA Sports FC 25</em>,<em> </em>as well as longstanding mismanagement of beloved series like <a href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-layoffs-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dragon Age</em></a> and, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-cancels-single-player-titanfall-apex-legends-game-221552559.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repeatedly</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ea-reportedly-cancels-another-titanfall-game-lays-off-several-hundred-employees-205008255.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Titanfall</em></a>. Wouldn’t you think one or even a few of these people could stand to take a pay cut in order to prevent such an outcome? Wilson alone, as we’ve learned, is equivalent to 172 employees if we’re measuring in pure dollars, and I’m sure he’s got plenty in the bank.</p><p>Fortunately, this is all hypothetical, and there’s no need to feel any wholly justified, blood vessel-bursting rage about any of it. We are, after all, in the midst of yet another normal spring day. Nothing to see here.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike"><h3>Almost Three Years After Neutrality Agreement, Negotiations Between Microsoft And Unionized Workers Aren’t Going Well</h3></a><p>"Although Microsoft tries to position itself as a good-faith employer, there’s another story being told behind the scenes at the bargaining table"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/flcl-reanimated"><h3>I’m Obsessed With FLCL Reanimated</h3></a><p>300+ artists got together to swing the bat and give FLCL the tribute it deserves

Which, fine, Nintendo can be glacial when it comes to changing this stuff, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement (or just new ideas!).</p><figure></figure><p>A very pretty example of exactly what I'm talking about is <a href="https://arkotype.co/project/sw1tchos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Clarke's attempt at creating an entirely new Nintendo OS</a>. A video games-centric designer by trade--<a href="https://aftermath.site/gamelogo-is-the-last-good-twitter-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we've covered Dan's stuff before!</a>--this goes well beyond just mocking up a main dashboard, going into the tiniest detail on everything from fonts to icons to the battery display.</p><figure><figcaption>It's great how Virtual Console games are given their own little historical showcases</figcaption></figure><p>What I love about it is that it manages to nail both ends of the brief. Yes, it's clean and crisp in the way all modern interfaces must be for a serious company selling expensive hardware, but it also doesn't forget that Nintendo is a company built on fun, and so still has room for stuff like a cute little pop-up when you put the cartridge in, and a re-imagining of achievements as "stickers". </p><figure></figure><p>If you're a fiend for this stuff as much as I am, <a href="https://arkotype.co/project/sw1tchos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please go check out the full concept over on Dan's site</a>; design sickos should know it includes everything from the colour palette to the percentages/dimensions for the layout of the home screen.</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike"><h3>Almost Three Years After Neutrality Agreement, Negotiations Between Microsoft And Unionized Workers Aren’t Going Well</h3></a><p>"Although Microsoft tries to position itself as a good-faith employer, there’s another story being told behind the scenes at the bargaining table"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/flcl-reanimated"><h3>I’m Obsessed With FLCL Reanimated</h3></a><p>300+ artists got together to swing the bat and give FLCL the tribute it deserves
