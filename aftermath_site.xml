            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wind-breaker-shonen-anime-toxic-masculinity<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a love/hate relationship with shonen anime. On the one hand, I love the fights and the action. On the other hand, I feel like so much focus on fights and action can breed toxic ideas about masculinity, with few shows examining what it really means to be ‚Äúthe strongest‚Äù beyond physical strength and power scaling debates. <em>Wind Breaker</em> restored my faith in the genre by showing that strength can be&nbsp;something more than just physical prowess.</p><p><em>Wind Breaker</em>, created by Satoru Nii and animated by CloverWorks, is basically what would happen if the <a href="https://aftermath.site/infinite-wealth-hawaii-yakuza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Yakuza </em>games</a> were made into an anime. The series follows a group of rival gangs whose diverse archetypes of delinquent boys beef over turf, where the only adults appear to be the local business owners in the fictional Tokyo shopping district of Makochi.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Wind Breaker</em>‚Äôs story follows the new kid on the block, Haruka Sakura, who quickly gets involved in the gangsta life after enrolling in Furin High School and joining up with its titular gang, Bofurin. Each high school gang has its captains, lieutenants, and foot soldiers, but rather than shake down neighborhoods for money, Bofurin acts as its town‚Äôs protectors from rival gangs running amok ‚Äî basically how <a href="https://aftermath.site/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-spoilers-kazuma-kiryu-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kiryu Kazuma</a> fashions himself as the stalwart protector of Kamurocho. The show‚Äôs secret sauce isn‚Äôt its action, though the action is <em>incredible</em>. It's how the show redefines masculinity through brotherhood and acceptance.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="THIS is How You Introduce an MC üò§ | WIND BREAKER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Q7iAdbi684?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While the ‚Äúpower of friendship‚Äù anime trope has often been reduced to the usually half-baked and understated emotional fuel for fights, <em>Wind Breaker</em> flips the script. Instead of feeling obligatory or stale, its portrayal of brotherhood is earnest, nuanced, and genuinely impactful, seamlessly woven into both the action and development of its characters.&nbsp;</p><p>You see, Sakura is a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tsundere</a> ‚Äî a character who has difficulty expressing his feelings. Much of his emotionally restrained disposition stems from him being bullied in the past for having dual hair colors and bright eyes, which folks assumed he did as a cry for attention instead of being his natural color. So instead of talking through matters, he settles disagreements by throwing hands ‚Äî making him a division one draft pick to join the ranks of Bofurin‚Äôs kick ass gang. However, folks around the town, most notably, Bofurin gang‚Äôs resident big sis, Kotoha Tachibana, clock the soft boi nature not so subtly hiding under Sakura‚Äôs tough-guy demeanor, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwv8rTN9r00&amp;pp=ygUZY3J1bmNoeXJvbGwgd2luZCBicmVha2Vycw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">routinely tease him</a>, causing him to blush tomato red whenever they catch him in the act of pushing down his feelings. However, their teasing isn‚Äôt to discourage him but to get the kid to stop bottling up his emotions and loosen up around his bros and throw punches at his toxic masculinity as hard as his foes.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Sakura's Heart Grew 3 Sizes That Day | WIND BREAKER Season 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cwv8rTN9r00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Rather than use the power of friendship as a tepid story beat to ferry viewers to the next high-octane fight scene, <em>Wind Breaker</em> challenges the traditional ideas of masculinity by enriching its narrative with an emotional depth that speaks to the power of friendship, acceptance, and community as story‚Äôs lifeblood. Learning how to express your feelings is what keeps the story pumping, not just leaving rival gangs in a bloody heap. This is all too refreshing considering that anime, like gaming, has become an unchecked playground for the male loneliness epidemic that leads folks to dive headfirst into red-pill manosphere ideologies for the answer to why they don‚Äôt feel accepted in society.&nbsp;</p><p>While season one‚Äôs climactic fight, a turf war brawl between Bofurin and a rival gang, KEEL, culminated in a beautiful display of ‚Äújust talk‚Äù among the rival gang about their brotherly drifting apart, episode 18 (‚ÄúA Place I Belong‚Äù) hit the ground running by toning down the action and letting genuine comradery serve as the antidote to toxic masculinity. Off the heels of a gang battle, Sakura is in the dumps, feeling he could‚Äôve done more to help his friends. Adding to his man pain is his being sick and not wanting his friends and fellow gang members to come check up on him. His friends inevitably break down his walls and get him to be embarrassed about his feelings and accept them head-on.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Sakura Laughs??? | WIND BREAKER Season 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubvfZeF2IK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><h2><em>Wind Breaker </em>also has that good queer representation</h2><p>‚ÄúA Place I Belong‚Äù and its follow-up episode, ‚ÄúHidden Feelings,‚Äù perfectly dovetail into the show‚Äôs continued combating of toxic masculinity by segueing into the official introduction of the show‚Äôs best character, <a href="https://wind-breaker.fandom.com/wiki/Tasuku_Tsubakino" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tsubaki-chan</a>, the anime‚Äôs gender nonconforming character and one of <a href="https://wind-breaker.fandom.com/wiki/The_Four_Kings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bofurin‚Äôs four kings</a>. When Tsubaki (whose official pronouns are he/him) first meets Sakura, he‚Äôs taken aback by Sakura complimenting him on his style. Given Bofurin‚Äôs full-throated acceptance of Tsubaki-chan, the compliment isn‚Äôt rare. But it‚Äôs wholesome to see it, given that Sakura just went through the lesson of accepting himself, insecurities and all.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Crunchyroll/Cloverworks</span></figcaption></figure><p>After going through the anime hijinks of being stunned by Tsubaki presenting as a girl in the otherwise macho group of teenagers, where other anime would embellish in misgendering for low-hanging fruit jokes, <em>Wind Breaker</em> takes an earnest and no-big-deal approach by having the whole gang treat Tsubaki-chan as an inalienable part of their crew. They even poke fun at him for having an obvious crush on their leader, Hajime Umemiya ‚Äî a crush he‚Äôs also aware of.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúHidden Feelings‚Äù acts as a backstory for Tsubaki-chan learning to accept his love for cute things in middle school and dressing more femininely with the encouragement of a senior couple (one of the rare instances adults rear their heads in the show). It is also a prescient vibe check for the series in terms of how far it is willing to go to represent these themes of self acceptance. Where other shows would make you read between the lines, <em>Wind Breaker</em> makes this subtext textual by having its senior characters outwardly state gender affirming remarks while applying Tsubaki-chan‚Äôs makeup, as he accepts himself as a person who likes cute things over the traditionally masculine.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Crunchyroll/Cloverworks</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Why <em>Wind Breaker</em> is necessary in today‚Äôs shonen anime landscape&nbsp;</h2><p>Much like gaming, the anime fandom struggles with a vocal minority that perpetuates toxic masculinity. These voices often elevate shonen anime solely for its fanservice and action sequences, treating them as the ultimate markers of quality, or ‚Äúpeak‚Äù anime. In their obsession with power fantasies, they sideline deeper narratives, reducing complex stories to flashy battles. This narrow perspective dismisses the emotional depth and thematic richness of anime and reinforces a rigid, exclusionary view of what the medium should be.&nbsp;</p><p>This issue is compounded by how legacy media‚Äôs anime coverage often reduces the medium to shonen as its defining genre, presenting it as the only thing worth engaging with in guides and recommendations. But shonen is only the tip of the iceberg of what anime offers. <a href="https://kotaku.com/crunchyroll-fantasy-anime-frieren-review-madhouse-1850884841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frieren: Beyond Journey's End</a> is a shonen that explores the survivor's guilt of a virtually immortal elf as she learns to appreciate the beauty in the mundanity of human life. <em>Nana</em> and its spiritual successor, <em>The Guy She Was Interested In Wasn't A Guy At All,</em> are girls‚Äô comics (also known as shojo) that follow two women's journey of <a href="https://aftermath.site/green-yuri-nana-shojo-girls-love" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">self-discovery and love</a> through their shared love of music.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Crunchyroll/Cloverworks</span></figcaption></figure><p>The trope of ‚Äúmight equals right‚Äù frequently overshadows more meaningful themes, like the power of friendship, which, rather than serving as a rich emotional core, is often reduced to a generic connective tissue for its fights ‚Äî something fans either overlook or rush past to clip bombastic fights that follow emotional breakthroughs. This narrow lens limits the engagement with anime‚Äôs depth and fuels a strange cultural phenomenon in online spaces that misses the plot entirely.</p><p>Platforms like the born-again right-wing cesspool Twitter have emboldened the very anime avatar crowd people used to avoid like the plague‚Äîthe ones who twist media discourse into reactionary grifts, rallying against ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù while paradoxically claiming deep allegiance to shonen staples like <a href="https://x.com/you_are_gay6969/status/1896294141996544373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em></a> and <a href="https://x.com/altades_art/status/1906847391837229155" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Trigun</em></a>. The irony of their vitriolic rhetoric is striking because these series embody ideals of justice, compassion, and defiance against oppression‚Äîthe principles they seem to reject. In their hands, shonen anime isn‚Äôt a medium to appreciate but a weaponized tool in a larger, dumber, ideological battle antithetical to the causes its heroes champion.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bon-chan! | One Piece" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_K63IovR2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It doesn‚Äôt help that prominent anime content creators, such as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hasan_Piker/comments/1j2sb3r/connor_talks_about_the_trash_taste_episode_with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trash Taste crew</a>, often avoid taking a stance when confronted with their fan base‚Äôs hostility toward discussions about the inherent political themes in anime. Case in point, their announcement that they‚Äôd no longer feature Twitch streamer <a href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-twitch-ban-rick-scott-medicare-medicaid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hasan ‚ÄúHasanabi‚Äù Piker</a> on the podcast on March 3, after they <a href="https://x.com/HasPause/status/1896453220572221539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received backlash</a> over him correctly calling <a href="https://kotaku.com/hasan-piker-one-piece-socialist-twitch-youtube-politics-1850295738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em> correctly socialist</a>. By choosing neutrality, they reinforce the misconception that anime lacks political intent, allowing reactionary voices to dominate the conversation and reshape anime discourse in their image (ironically for right-wing ends).&nbsp;</p><p>By refusing to engage with what Piker was saying, these content creators further obfuscate the rich, intentional storytelling of series like One Piece. This distorts the medium into a matter of debate over <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-harassment-comes-with-the-territory-of-translating-popular-manga-2000556430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‚Äúmistranslations‚Äù</a> when fans point out its political messaging and gender-affirming themes. <em>Wind Breaker</em> bucks every opportunity for misconceptions by laying its stance on toxic masculinity and acceptance bare for all to see. That‚Äôs so fucking refreshing.&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>Wind Breaker </em>is sweet, endearing, and quietly revolutionary. It proves that masculinity isn‚Äôt about rigid roles as a stoic protector. It‚Äôs about genuine connection, unwavering acceptance, and fighting for (and alongside) the people you cherish. I hope that <em>Wind Breaker</em>‚Äôs Sakura and Tsubaki will serve as a gateway for anime fans who mainline shonen to try out shows from other genres like seinen and shojo that also explore gender expression to greater depths ‚Äî anime like <em>Paradise Kiss</em>, <em>Princess Jellyfish</em>, <em>Skip and Loafer</em>, and manga like <em>Boys Run the Riot</em>. If a shonen anime can pull off that feat, I think the kids will be alright.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/darumi-amemiya-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-emo-cringe-punk"><h3>The Hundred Line‚Äôs Darumi Amemiya Is Mortifying And I Will Defend Her With My Life</h3></a><p>Never before has a character been as embarrassing to be around and while being so relatable</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo-tv-series-show-impressions"><h3>The Last Of Us Season 2 Is Bad Television</h3></a><p>It's not great, whether you've played the game or not</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/darumi-amemiya-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-emo-cringe-punk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Some characters torment you simply with their presence. Often this is because they are irritating or embarrassing. Darumi Amemiya from <em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> is a masterclass in being annoying: a creature so debased and overflowing with cringe that I want to shoot her out of a cannon, yet so endearingly true that I will defend her with every fiber of my being. I loathe and love my cringe daughter.</p><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> is a collaboration between <em>Danganronpa</em> creator Kazutaka Kodaka and <em>Zero Escape</em> creator Kotaro Uchikoshi. Both series are visual novel adventure games, and both games feature a labyrinthine, twisting narrative with a bunch of idiosyncratic anime characters trapped in a deadly space by a mysterious creature or person.</p><figure><figcaption>Welcome to the game. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Kotaro Uchikoshi‚Äôs storytelling tends towards the existential. He peppers his narratives with heavy handed philosophical, sci-fi and game theory ideas while making aggressive use of branching ergodic narrative structure. Kazutaka Kodaka is far more lurid, gleefully leaning heavily into the debased, violent nature of <em>Danganronpa‚Äôs</em> ‚Äúkilling game‚Äù premise. <em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em>, somehow, represents the perfect synthesis of these tones, a ‚ÄúDueling Banjos‚Äù of two of the most distinct narrative voices in Japanese game development that understands and anticipates the player‚Äôs expectations from these two authors.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Though still very much a visual novel, <em>The Hundred Line </em>is also a tactical game in the vein of <em>Fire Emblem</em>. Humanity has been living in some kind of protected bunker when it‚Äôs invaded by malicious creatures. After a brief fight the main character, Takumi Sukimo, wakes up in The Last Defense Academy at the behest of a strange, mascot-like entity named Sirei, who looks as if a ghost had legs, a hat, a little bow tie and a visible brain. They are told that their blood is special, compatible with a substance called ‚ÄúHemoanima‚Äù that allows them to self-harm henshin <em>Persona</em>-style by plunging a special knife into their chest and unlocking heretofore unknown powers. They also are told they are functionally immortal on school grounds, allowed to be revived should they fall in battle. I‚Äôm still working through the game, and it‚Äôs reported that there are 100 distinct endings, although I don‚Äôt know if anybody has gotten all of them.</p><figure><figcaption>Darumi won't stop talking about her favorite niche porno games. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Each of the students in <em>The Hundred Line</em> is a nasty little freak in a distinct and unique way that interacts with how they behave on the battlefield. For example there‚Äôs Takemaru, the aggressive, B≈çs≈çzoku-style biker, who becomes a cavalry unit on the battlefield that benefits from distance traveled. Tsubasa the pretty mechanic has a stress reaction that makes her vomit; Shouma is a tiny meek child who looks like a turtle; the Tsukomos can only be described as ‚Äúthe incest twins.‚Äù And while each cast member has their foibles, none compare to the queen: Darumi Amemiya.</p><figure><figcaption>Here she Darumi. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>When you meet Darumi, she is so aggressively off-putting you are not quite sure what to make of her. Her hair looks like if Hatsune Miku let her roots grow out for several months because she was depressed, and she‚Äôs wearing edgelord Heath Ledger Joker makeup. Her outfit looks like a car crash of ‚Äò00s American emo culture and trashy Japanese street fashion: a striped fuku covered in punk patches and gargantuan safety pins. She is annoyingly morbid, a self-loathing Yandere goth who canonically has <a href="https://x.com/Jabberwocky2469/status/1912858379867079009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bipolar disorder</a> according to co-director Akihiro Togawa.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Darumi won't stop doing the puppygirl bit. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Darumi constantly rants about doing harm to herself and others, and is obsessed with gory media and eroge. Darumi will frequently name drop her favorite erotic games, forcing your character to play them should you interact with her, often in ways that foreshadow narrative events in the game. It gives me no pleasure to admit that she has frankly fantastic taste in the genre.</p><p>Her obsession with ‚Äúkilling games‚Äù is by far the funniest aspect of her character. She is clearly a stand-in for the audience and is probably the most well-adjusted <em>Danganronpa </em>fan in history. On some level you can hear Kodaka lovingly shoving her in your face and saying ‚ÄúSee this? This is what you guys all sound like.‚Äù If you fall into that category, it‚Äôs quite clear that he got your ass.</p><figure><figcaption>Darumi is prone to sudden mood swings. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Even outside of the meta context of the game, it is impossible for the intended audience of the work to not experience regular bouts of mortification from everything that she says. In Japanese she is voiced by Fairouz Ai (better known as the voice of Jolyene in <em>JoJo‚Äôs Bizarre Adventure</em>) while Sarah Pritard voices her English. Both do a fantastic job at rendering her character in ways distinct to their context, although Pritard‚Äôs performance is particularly brutal for anybody who came of age during the aughts. Because her character is almost eternal at this point, it is hard not for me to project my own millennial context on her.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Cut that out Darumi. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>In Darumi, I see both myself and the many cringe women and gay men I knew in middle and high school. She is an emo scenester, insecure, the kind of girl who would get way too into <em>Johnny The Homicidal Maniac</em> and have full zip up <em>Invader Zim</em> GIR pajamas. She is a walking Hot Topic despite thinking herself above that, someone who I could see owning a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaoi_paddle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yaoi paddle</a>. I knew, and on some level was, a person like this: full of self-loathing and overly effusive, swinging between the far ends of depression and uncontrollable excitement, burying myself in extreme and transgressive fiction and externalizing pain as a means of hiding it. And though the cast of <em>The Hundred Line </em>is initially abrasive, the game does its best to sell even the most depraved and cartoonish student, attempting and often succeeding at giving them depth and pathos. After the initial shock, it is hard not to care for Darumi like a good friend, a sibling or child.</p><figure><figcaption>I know this is the localization but I still think it's appropriate. Credit: XSEED Games, Aniplex</figcaption></figure><p>Darumi is a walking disaster, an aggressively insistent indoor kid who continues to grow on you, and though she may be cringe, she is also a funhouse mirror into the soul of the intended audience of this game. To be annoyed with her when she pretends to be a weird puppy girl is to be annoyed with your younger self, and to embrace her is to embrace that same. Thank you Darumi; you‚Äôre one of my favorite characters in recent memory. I will defend your honor in spite of (and often because of) the fact that you simply won‚Äôt shut the fuck up.</p><figure><figcaption>I have indeed been Darumi'd.
