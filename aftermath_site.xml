But as the site grows, and as the seasons and styles change, we're going to keep adding to it.</p><p>Like we just did, <a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the release of our second season of merch</a>! Just in time to buy that special someone (or yourself) the perfect holiday gift! This new lineup features a couple of lighter takes on our tee and oversized tee:</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/products/tee-s2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><figcaption>Our regular AS Color tee is now available in "natural" in all sizes</figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/products/oversized-tee-s2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><figcaption>Our oversized tee, meanwhile, now comes in "faded bone"</figcaption></figure><p>A beanie to keep your head warm in these colder months:</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/products/beanie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a></figure><p>And, finally, another mug. The <strong>Even Bigger Mug</strong>. Our first one was 15oz. This one is 20oz. </p><figure><a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/products/even-bigger-mug?source=dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a></figure><p>These items <a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are all available now in our store</a> (if there are holiday shipping cut-offs for any items, they'll be clearly stated on the product page). And remember, all proceeds go straight back into the site, so every shirt and hoodie and BIG MUG you buy is helping support independent video games media!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
