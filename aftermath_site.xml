Layoffs, studio closures and a lack of funding are decimating headcount and opportunities. We’ve written <a href="https://aftermath.site/search?s=layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot</a> about this, and of what people have decided to do <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-industry-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaving the games industry</a>, but what’s it like right now for the tens of thousands of workers looking to get in, stay or get back into video games?</p><p>For as long as we’ve been hearing about layoffs, there's been a concurrent tragedy: extremely qualified designers, artists, programmers, social media experts and other workers all across the industry have not only lost their jobs, they've quickly run into a succession of brick walls as they try to find new ones. Many are filing hundreds of applications over months and even years, all to no avail, while also having to deal with everything from hiring scams to overwhelmed recruitment teams, AI screening tools to rampant ghosting. Basically, trying to find a job in video games at the moment has become a dehumanising, demoralising grind.</p><p>Given the scale of the issue, it’s something often brought up in discussions, studies and exasperated Linkedin posts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E2%80%932025_video_game_industry_layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as a collection of raw numbers</a> (we’re at an estimated 35,000 laid off games workers and counting, if you’re wondering). A single job had <em>this </em>many applicants, there are <em>this </em>many artists out of work right now, only <em>this </em>percentage of people are ever going to find meaningful work in video games ever again, etc.</p><p>But behind those numbers are people. Individuals with their own experiences, needs, work history and skills. Here are some of those peoples’ stories.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><strong>BRUCE</strong></p><p>Bruce (not their real name) has been applying for jobs for months. At studios like Ghost Stories Games, who they say interviewed them, then had them complete two workplace assignments (one an “entire paper”) after which they “ghosted”, a practice where prospective employers–just like the word means elsewhere–simply never get back to you, even to tell you you’ve been unsuccessful.&nbsp;</p><p>Bruce then applied for a role at Misfit Games, where they say exactly the same thing happened: an interview, an assessment, then ghosted. EA Sports’ <em>Madden </em>team had Bruce complete an assessment then ghosted. They say applications at High Voltage Software, Double Fine, Hypixel and 1047 Games all involved either interviews, assignments or both, and they all ghosted as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUDREY</strong></p><p>“Larian are the absolute worst at this”, says Audrey (not their real name). “I've interviewed with them twice and feel like an idiot for doing so. The first time I applied, the second time they approached me.”</p><p>For the first interview, they say that after applying via a public posting the studio told them they hadn't even meant to post the job publicly; it was intended for university graduates. However, the recruiter had said he “had read over 200 applicants and portfolios and mine was so strong he'd set a writing test before he went on holiday the next week.”</p><p>“He didn't send it, and I ended up finding another Larian recruiter on Linkedin to send it.”</p><p>That test involved writing a “complex interactive dialogue sequence” in Twine, which was supposed to take only a few hours, but realistically–after revisions and polish–took much longer.&nbsp;</p><p>“It's stressful waiting for a reply”, Audrey says. “I kept to my side of the deadline twice. While it's being reviewed, it's not something I feel OK using for a portfolio piece elsewhere. The Twine template means it's much harder to reuse elsewhere, too. So it's not as if I get a portfolio piece out of it”. This application was unsuccessful, but in late 2024 a Larian recruiter reached out to them personally and “asked to talk”.&nbsp;</p><p>“So I did”, they say. “It was initially for another role related to writing, but after talking to me he said I could try out for both and warned me their replies could be slow. I said I had tried before and while he was thrown, he did say repeat applications were OK. I did ask what the response times were, he said they'd worked on it but it shouldn't be more than a month.”</p><p>“It's been a year. No response to emails, nothing on Linkedin.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>...in 2022 I applied for two jobs and received offers for both. In 2024-5 I applied for 70 jobs and received offers for none.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>RICKY</strong></p><p>Having been in the AAA side of the video game industry for over 20 years, Ricky (not their real name) has filed their share of job applications. “I’ve always applied responsibly to roles I know I’m a fit for, and have generally spoken with the hiring manager at least. This changed dramatically last year. It’s much more common now to not hear back at all”.</p><p>In the cases they do hear back, Ricky says the companies seem “completely disorganized and unprofessional”.</p><p>“I once received a boiler plate ‘thanks for applying, we don't think you're a fit’ email from a studio I applied to, then an hour later I received a template ‘we just saw your profile online and think you're a great fit’ email from the same studio for the same role.”</p><p>For another application, they received a "not a fit" response, then immediately afterwards received a "disregard, still in consideration" email, then was completely ghosted.</p><p>“I've also been completely ghosted by two different studios after an HR screen and second interview with the project director”, they say. “HR said they were interested and reviewing other candidates. I reached out three weeks later to hear one role had been filled and never heard back from the others at all.”</p><p>Ricky stresses these are not startups or struggling indie studios, they’re AAA companies.&nbsp; They suspect that some of these listings are “either just collecting data, browsing the buyers market, are a result of HR departments that have been gutted by layoffs and are using bad AI tools to automate, or all of the above”.</p><p>In another example of a busted recruitment process, Ricky says they spent eight weeks working with a major games company planning a project with a large IP holder, during which they completed nine interviews, performed a two-week practical test, and then a further week of panel interviews before meeting department leads.&nbsp;</p><p>“Through the entire process, nobody could tell me what the actual day to day of the role was, or what they were actually making”, Ricky says. “I never met with anyone that actually makes games. Two weeks later, I was told I was ‘not a fit’”.</p><p>Given Ricky’s past experience applying for AAA jobs in bygone eras, another change they’ve noticed lately is that job application processes have stretched well past their traditional length. “Where job applications usually wrapped in two weeks, now it's common to still be dragging along 4-6 weeks after an initial response, with no sign of resolution”, they say. “I had to take a temp contract because I got an offer in the middle of two other processes that had been taking over a month each. I couldn't risk passing on the offer in hand and had to stop one application. One studio recommended continuing the process regardless. I met with the project lead, then was completely ghosted. Glad I took the contract.”</p><p><strong>GWEN</strong></p><p>Gwen’s story is the shortest you’ll see today, but also perhaps the most representative of how broken video game recruitment is right now.&nbsp; An author and game designer, she recently applied for a role that involved 12 interviews with 15 different people at a single studio. After all that, she was ghosted.</p><p>She says she also recently applied for a position with Wizards of the Coast, who flew her out for an all-day interview, even paying for a hotel stay. And then ghosted her.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CALLUM</strong></p><p>Callum (not their real name) was laid off in July 2024. Having made many job applications since, there’s one in particular they describe as especially frustrating.&nbsp;</p><p>“I went through the interview process for my dream role at my dream company in October 2024”, they say, “and after the final round interview, was told they ended up going with someone else, but it was a hard decision and I was their second choice, which made me feel good!”</p><p>“Then in May of this year, I saw the same company had posted the same role so I reached out to the recruiter. He got back to me right away, said I’d be ‘the candidate to beat’ (his exact words) and said he’d set up an interview with the team just to go through the process.”</p><p>“Weeks passed, I followed up a few times, each time being told the team was swamped and it would be a week or so before anything progressed. After the final follow-up the recruiter told me they had decided to close the position. So in the span of two months, the company opened the position, the recruiter led me to believe I was a shoo-in, and then the company decided they didn’t actually want to hire anyone for it. Brutal. And this is a big well-established AAA company.”</p><p>Another job they applied for, at another established studio, asked Callum to complete a 12-page writing test, and while sending the test out “forgot to bcc everyone”, so Callum knew they were among roughly 20 other applicants. After completing the test they were asked not to follow up, but after 4-5 months with no response, they reached out anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>“The email in response was ‘thank you so much for interviewing with us, it was great to talk with you, we decided to go with someone else’ which would have been fine except they never even interviewed me!! They couldn’t even keep track of the people they had asked to do unpaid labor!”</p><p>“Also just an anecdote that I feel best represents how bad it's gotten in games over the past years: in 2022 I applied for two jobs and received offers for both. In 2024-5 I applied for 70 jobs and received offers for none”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>It’s honestly been a bloodbath. I haven’t had this much trouble finding work since I first joined the industry.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>JASON</strong></p><p>“I applied months ago at Doublefine, for a ‘Senior Systems Generalist’ posting”, says Jason (not their real name). “They were advertising it on Bluesky.”</p><p>“I never really expected to get the job, because I've always been indie, I figured it would go to some laid-off AAA guy for sure, but I'm like whatever, I have 12 years of experience, I can code, I can do art, I'm a generalist, I've technically lead teams before”. So they wrote a cover letter, updated their resume and applied.</p><p>“And I fired it off and didn't really think much of it, but once a month or so, I would get an email from them like ‘Sorry for the wait! We're gonna start reviewing emails next week! Our people have just been going through it’ or whatever, which like, fair enough.”</p><p>“They eventually sent everyone an email saying ‘Oh we decided not to hire anybody after all, sorry’, and it was very funny to me”.</p><p><strong>JARORY</strong></p><p>Jarory was cast into the job market when the studio he had been working at was not paying them enough to live in San Francisco (where the position was based). When he tried to shift to a different studio he ended up being laid off from the former, while the latter ended up not hiring them, leaving him stuck without a job.</p><p>“Since then I’ve applied for over 200 jobs”, he says. “I have eight years experience, a Master’s degree, three shipped titles plus mobile titles. I’m one of the very few narrative designers who can code in C++, but despite this for the most part I’ve been unable to even get to a first round interview with studios in the US”.</p><p>He has had slightly more luck with European studios, but those needed Jarory to either relocate or cover the (often expensive) cost of visas. He also says he has received personal referrals for applications, from “high level people” at very well-known companies, without ever getting even an interview.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s honestly been a bloodbath”, he says. “I haven’t had this much trouble finding work since I first joined the industry”.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AARON</strong></p><p>Aaron can sum up his job search very easily: “it’s pretty much been a complete nightmare, to be honest”. Citing many of the same concerns other applicants have expressed, like rampant ghosting and confusing replies from recruiters, Aaron at least has some sympathy for those working in recruitment.</p><p>“I don't really blame them a ton”, he says. “I think there are just so many folks out of jobs that there are just so many applicants for every single role, and loads of them are highly qualified professionals, all trying to scrape up the bits and pieces available on the market still”.</p><p>What’s got to Aaron the most, though, is the rapidly increasing prevalence of a more menacing hurdle for job applicants. “The real shocking thing about the whole process has been the ramping up of scams”, he says. “There are so many job postings that are scams now, and the platform doesn't seem to matter. They're all over LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc”.</p><p>“They usually pose as some credible company, attempt to get some manner of personal information, and then go ‘congrats you're hired! no interview required, you will make tons of money!’ etc etc. At first, it was pretty obvious which was which, but with the sheer amount of them out there now and the fact that they're getting more complex, it feels like a minefield”.</p><p>The worst example he's encountered was someone who pretended to be the business manager of a school district in Texas, who was hiring for a position Aaron was qualified for. This scammer had an email address that looked just like the school’s actual email, but in one spot had used “l” (lower-case L) instead of “i”. This imposter was asking very similar questions to those an actual recruiter would be expected to ask, and it was only when Aaron called the school district and <em>spoke with the person the scammer had been impersonating </em>that they discovered it was a fake.&nbsp;</p><p>“By the time I had confirmed this, of course, the posting had been removed from LinkedIn, making me feel like I had just suffered through the plot of a really, really lame M. Night Shyamalan plot”, he says. “Other than that, the scams are as frequent as they are relentless; phone calls and texts for fake jobs completely blow up my phone each and every day”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>...the scams are as frequent as they are relentless; phone calls and texts for fake jobs completely blow up my phone each and every day.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>YORRICK</strong></p><p>Yorrick (not their real name) has had an absolutely wild time trying to find a new job in video games, so much so that I’m going to tell their story the same way they they told it to me: via unranked list.</p><ol><li><span>They once had to perform a week-long test, clocking in at around 40 full hours of work, all because they say the recruiting studio wanted “a level design portion (which isn't my wheelhouse at all), a written brief, and then about two in-game hours' worth of recursive branching content”. They were then told that the single person responsible for reviewing every applicant’s test was out on vacation.</span></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><span>A project manager once accidentally cced 55 applicants for a position, which did lead to a bunch of “reply all” responses, but no further communication from the recruiter.</span></li></ol><ol start="3"><li><span>After taking a different week-long test (this one “only” taking 20 hours), Yorrick “was told consistently throughout the process I was a ‘yes’ for the people involved, I got to the very last stage, and then was beaten out by someone because I expressed too much empathy as a lead and a manager”.&nbsp;</span></li></ol><ol start="4"><li><span>Yorrick says recruiters have specifically reached out to them asking them to submit applications, only for those applications to be met with automated rejection emails.</span></li></ol><ol start="5"><li><span>It's not the most heinous thing in this story, but apparently Blizzard is notorious for sending rejection emails on Sunday mornings.&nbsp;</span></li></ol><ol start="6"><li><span>After getting far enough along in an application that they had completed a test, chatted with a recruiter and then met some of the team, Yorrick was told at the last minute that, due to the studio’s funding running dry, “the position was going away for an indefinite amount of time”.</span></li></ol><ol start="7"><li><span>Yorrick says few if any jobs can now offer any kind of security, with interstate or even international moves now an enormous risk, and more and more contract positions (which often don’t offer stuff like health insurance) opening up instead of permanent jobs. “I'm afraid to apply for out-of-the-country jobs because relatively few of them are subject to listing what the job pays; some of them are in spots with good incentives for the business but very little for the employee”, they say, specifically mentioning “places like Ireland and Warsaw”.</span></li></ol><ol start="8"><li><span>They say they no longer list that they’re disabled, nor do they mention they’re non-binary. “It's everywhere on my social media and Linkedin profile, but I'm afraid to rock the boat. Let them call me what they want”.</span></li></ol><ol start="9"><li><span>Yorrick is now part of a number of “find work” groups where members are “growing increasingly jaded towards the idea of staying in the video games industry”. “More resources are being published about <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-industry-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to move from the industry into another field</a>”, they say, “I'm afraid I may have to go that direction, too”.</span></li></ol><p><strong>JILL</strong></p><p>Jill is lucky enough to be among the ranks of the employed–”I can’t technically get laid off because I’m always just piecing together scraps of freelance contracts”--but they do have some very first-hand experience with one of the worst bugbears we’ve been looking at today: the fake recruiter.</p><p>“Currently someone is using my company name, and the names of two colleagues from other studios, in a hiring scam”, they say. “The scammers approach people using a Substack email address, then try to get them to join a Discord, where the coercion happens. At least one person says they have fallen for this. A lot of people find my contact details elsewhere and message me saying ‘I think this is a scam but in case it isn’t, please look at my portfolio’”.</p><p>What makes cases like this, and the small Texas school mentioned above, especially upsetting is that Jill “can't think of a single reason a scammer would impersonate my wee studio”, having never done a “hiring push” or been seen to be big enough that scammers could trade off their reputation. “I'm told my name carries some amount of credibility, but scammers are quite specifically not using <em>my</em> name”, Jill says. “Instead, they're using my studio's name and the names of the heads of two other studios-- friends and people I've worked with-- information you could get from a LinkedIn crawl”.</p><p>“Perhaps the diminutive size of <a href="https://www.discoglobe.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discoglobe</a>, combined with my larger game credits, and the use of related names creates a plausible swirl of confusion that's harder to investigate”.</p><p>Jill says the way the scam works–or at least in their case–is that the targeted applicant receives a message in the form of a private Substack email, supposedly from one of Jill’s colleagues. That email invites them to apply for a specific role, but in order to make that application, the applicant needs to add the scammer on Discord. If the applicant accepts, they’re then encouraged on Discord to reveal personal and financial information.&nbsp;</p><p>“Although it can feel like a compliment and a relief to be offered potential work, unsolicited invitations from unfamiliar contacts should be treated with maximum suspicion”, Jill warns. “No reputable hiring manager should ask you to join a Discord to prove your identity, or confirm your interest by divulging financial information or anything else that could make you more vulnerable”.</p><p>“That said, many actual, real, recruiters do use uncomfortable tactics-- forcing you to take personality quizzes, refusing to tell you what game you'll be working on, demanding lengthy unpaid tests, to name a few. Considering the climate of disrespect that these practices have made commonplace, it's not surprising that the boundaries between opportunity and scam are so thin”.</p><p><strong>XAVIER</strong></p><p>Xavier’s (not their real name) experience applying for jobs has been one dominated by AI automation, which they say is “way more widespread” now than even a couple of years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>One example they provided was for a company hiring a Brand Manager position. “They initially got me in with the automated ‘import your resume’ option. Then they almost immediately contacted me back, and asked for my availability. Somehow, they ruined that process because I couldn’t even get a cohesive response back if I asked about anything-- the company culture or pay”.</p><p>“Then, when I actually did get to do the video interview, it wasn't even with a person but more of a reality show tryout video where you don't even get feedback. I don't know, the whole thing was weird vibes and I didn't get anything back. I did however start getting spam on my looking-for-work-only email, so who knows”!</p><figure><blockquote><p>I had a conversation with a recruiter at a smaller (around 300 people) studio and he told me each job opening had around 3000-4000 applicants per role.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>STEVE</strong></p><p>Steve has had two experiences lately where they’ve “sat down with people to discuss open roles for that have only then revealed, halfway through the initial discussion, that it's actually a freelance role”.</p><p>“I'm not adverse to doing some freelance stuff, but I'd appreciate going in prepared so I can talk about rates/set expectations etc”. They were also contacted directly by a freelance recruiter, specifically to discuss freelance work, only to then have that person “disappear into the wind” and never get back to them, and in another case was halfway through an interview before the recruiter disclosed the project in question was actually a Web3 title, something that hadn’t been disclosed publicly and which is still being hidden from the project’s Steam page.&nbsp;</p><p>“I've applied for HUNDREDS of jobs on LinkedIn through their Easy Apply thing, which I'm convinced is just data mining”, they say. “I've had so many dodgy calls on my phone since I started job hunting, and I get multiple texts and WhatsApp messages from ‘TikTok HR’ and ‘Tribe HR’ every week now. It's exhausting because I want to pick up every phone call in case it's a real job and it's usually just a fucking scam”.</p><p>“I'd booked an interview with someone on the 14th of July who said they were starting interviews on the 8th of August”, Steve recalls, adding, “I got an email cancelling the interview and when I chased them to check in or re-book they told me they'd filled the position”.</p><p>They say it’s both “reassuring and demoralising” to be constantly told that, having applied for jobs with 500 other candidates, making it to interview rounds with only four other people and then missing out the job, they’re told stuff like "a year ago you'd have walked into this position".</p><p><strong>DORA</strong></p><p>Dora has been applying for a variety of full-time roles across production management, including senior producer and production manager jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>“Last year I applied for a production manager role with a publisher owned by a multi-millionaire who had worked in tech but never in games, and didn't hear anything from them for about three months, until they asked for an intro interview with someone on staff who turned out to be their marketing manager”, they recall. “The interview was fine, though a lot of the questions they asked me were specifically about items or duties that hadn't been outlined in the job post, and they weren't able to answer any of the production questions I had”.</p><p>“They seemed quite keen on me and so set up interviews with–literally–everyone else on staff, which worked out to be almost a full day of interviews back to back to back, and then a final one with their CEO the week after, who informed me directly that everyone had loved me and spoke very highly of me. They promised to get back to me before the end of that week”.</p><p>“Instead, almost another full month went by, with them saying they were ‘taking the review very seriously’ until I woke up one morning to a generic form rejection that had come in around 3AM, saying ‘they appreciated my interest, and there was a lot of competition, but they were moving forward with another candidate’”.&nbsp;</p><p>Dora says the company never responded to a request for notes or feedback, which was probably for the best; after multiple turnovers, the studio in question has now laid off nearly the entire staff.</p><figure><blockquote><p>We’ve become scapegoats in a system we didn’t build, want and can’t really control.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>PETER</strong></p><p>Peter (not their real name) is one of the more empathetic people I spoke to; while they’re obviously clearly frustrated with the entire application and hiring process across the industry, they do at least say it’s “hard to really blame things” on recruiters. “Everyone definitely seems to be trying to do their best with the cards they're dealt”, they say. “I try to be understanding when it comes to the fact that even though I'm unemployed and stressed, these people are under extreme undue stress as well. Everyone is getting shuffled around from team to team and given larger and larger workloads. So I try to accommodate people as much as I can throughout any interview process”.</p><p>They also have an idea why so many studios and publishers are using recruitment agencies instead of hiring directly. “I had a conversation with a recruiter at a smaller (around 300 people) studio and he told me each job opening had around 3000-4000 applicants per role. So I understand the daunting task of figuring that out”.</p><p>That said, Peter has still been running into frustrating roadblocks in the search for work. “A recruiter from a ‘top 5’ game developer reached out to me for a role I was very interested in”, they say. “We quickly set up an interview with the manager of that team, which went very well (as indicated by the recruiter), and they said they'd get back to me shortly to set up an additional interview. Weeks pass and I didn't hear anything so obviously I was very confused. It wasn't until I decided to follow up with them on Linkedin that I saw that not only [was the recruiter] laid off from the company, but the manager I interviewed with was as well”!</p><p>Peter is also another with first-hand experience with job scams. “A recruiter reached out to my email and said he was recruiting for a gaming job but did not disclose the company”, Peter says. “He sent a job description, and it fit my background closely so I agreed to a phone call. He called me and explained that the job was for a specific gaming company and said he could set up an interview with the hiring manager by the end of the week. I was ecstatic because it was a role at a dream company I really was interested in and was very excited”.</p><p>“He told me that in order to do the role I needed a specific tech certification and that if I did not currently have it, I could do it during the interview process and finish it up while I was on my first few weeks of the job. I didn't think too much of it because it was a certification I've heard of and was definitely real. He then told me he'd send me a link to the course that the company usually uses and once I show that I'm signed up we can proceed with the process”.</p><p>“After the call I went to the site and upon further inspection it was VERY shady. It was definitely thrown together in a very shoddy way and more or less a glorified phishing attempt to get my credit card information. I'm <strong>very</strong> lucky I realized this. I emailed him back and told him I did not feel comfortable paying $300 for a chance to interview at the company and politely declined to proceed. He then called and emailed me 5-10 times desperately trying to get back in touch with me in a last ditch effort to get me to sign up for whatever fake course they had set up. Obviously this is some scam team targeting gaming candidates to try to scam their credit card information”.</p><p><strong>PAULA</strong></p><p>Paula (not their real name) is one of the few people in this story who isn't currently applying for positions, because they work in recruitment. With a long career in the space, first for a AAA studio and now a games services firm, Paula says many in their industry “understand how brutal it is for job seekers, because we’re experiencing it too”, as restructures, closures and layoffs haven’t just affected jobseekers, but those in recruitment as well.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re seeing senior-level talent applying for lower level roles, which pushes everyone down the funnel and effectively wipes out the usual expectation of entry”, they explain. “Beyond that, there’s been a massive shift away from U.S.-based hiring. Studios are moving headcount to Eastern Europe, Latin America, and other regions with high quality talent at lower cost. It’s very similar to what we saw decades ago in manufacturing, it’s just now hitting tech and games, which has often been seen as the Wild West. We’re following a pattern similar to film in that sense”.</p><p>“As recruiters, we’re deeply aware of how this impacts people”, Paula says, “but we don’t always have the power to fix it. Most of us are doing everything we can to support candidates, advocate internally, and help companies hire wisely in this new landscape, but there are limits to what we can do, especially as many [recruiters] fear for their own job security”.</p><p>As someone working in recruitment, Paula is able to see the application process from a unique vantage, and some of the numbers involved are <em>staggering</em>. “A few years ago, a mid-level role might see 2,000–3,000 applicants over a couple of weeks”, they say. “Now? That same role can bring in six, nine or even twelve thousand applicants. Within 48 hours”.</p><p>“We have to close roles much earlier than we’d like just to manage the influx. Not to mention there’s still an expectation from both candidates and sometimes leadership that we not only review every one of those applications (we should and I strive to) but also give specific feedback or custom communications. That’s just not feasible with leaner teams, low morale, and higher workloads”.</p><p>While most of those we’ve spoken to haven’t had the best experiences with the application process, Paula says that everyone is working in an “unprecedented landscape”, and stresses “how demoralizing it is to be a recruiter right now”.</p><p>“We’re publicly visible, our names are on job posts, we’re often the first ones who pop up when you search [for a role] and many times we’re often the only human contact a candidate has during a brutal, sometimes years-long job search. So when people feel unheard, overlooked, or just burned out… they come for us”.</p><p>“We’ve become scapegoats in a system we didn’t build, want and can’t really control. Recruiters have always carried a strange burden as we’re expected to be operationally flawless and endlessly empathetic. We want to champion candidates, we want you hired and many of us are here because we care deeply. But some of the public backlash we’re facing (especially online) has been painful and unfair”.</p><p>“Everything I talked about today isn’t just tech or games, it’s happening across industries. I’m not an economist. I don’t know exactly how we got here or what’s next. But I do know this: the only way forward is with kindness, grace, and awareness. I wish more people understood, regardless of if you’re a candidate or a company, your brand is your behavior, and how you show up now (especially in this very bleak timeline) matters”.</p><hr><p>Just as there’s no single issue facing applicants here, there doesn’t appear to be a single solution to their problems, either. Unemployed video game developers are suffering through possibly the worst set of industry circumstances since there’s been an industry to hire them: a collapsing market, AI, feckless major publishers and cost-slashing CEOs. All of this coming so soon after a hiring boom doesn’t help either; the entire video game industry has collectively inhaled then exhaled over the course of around five years, first hiring tens of thousands of people, then cutting them loose just as quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>There are simply too many applicants for not enough jobs, and no amount of tweaks to the hiring process itself can change that, as recruiters are often at the mercy of the same systemic issues. They too have seen layoffs, and had hiring processes undermined by AI, or had in-house recruitment scrapped altogether in favour of bringing in outside firms with little experience in the highly-specialized field of technical games recruitment.&nbsp;</p><p>Surely there’s <em>something </em>that can be done, though, if only to make the whole ordeal a little less soul-crushing. As someone who used to work in recruitment–<a href="https://careers.fire.nsw.gov.au/permanent-firefighter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for a job hiring 50 people from 5500 applicants</a>–we were taught (like Paula mentions above) that there was a responsibility not just to hire the right people, but to make sure we treated the unsuccessful as best as we could. Because while sometimes an applicant for a job is just someone shooting their shot, in many cases it’s a person who is vulnerable. Maybe they’re desperate for a career change because of ownership or management making their current role unbearable, or (as is often the case in games right now) they urgently need money because they’ve lost their job, putting everything from their homes to their health to their families on the line.</p><p>Those people, even if they’re not ultimately hired, even with all the challenges facing everyone in the industry (even recruitment), still deserve to be treated with more courtesy and respect than they’re getting at the moment.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/video-game-recruitment-job-applications-ai-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paul Thomas Anderson’s nearly three hour long Pynchon-adjacent revolutionary drama <em>One Battle After Another</em> is a hit. We here at Aftermath give it our stamp of approval and recommend you see it in the most elaborately large format you can. Isaiah and Chris sat down to chat about what they liked.</p><p>(This article contains some spoilers for <em>One Battle After Another</em>)</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>So, as someone who just watched their first Paul Thomas Anderson film a couple weeks prior in <em>There Will Be Blood</em>, I didn't walk into<em> One Battle After Another </em>with any grand expectations like the rest of the general public. All I knew is it starred Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor, and Benicio del Toro. Assuming you've got more familiarity with PTA, how'd the film measure up for you? Spoilers for me: I rated it a rare five stars on Letterboxd.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="One Battle After Another - Official Trailer 2 - Warner Bros. UK &amp; Ireland" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rNLrWQ4HtY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Chris</strong>: Oh wow, I'm happy for you. You got a ton of great PTA films to watch. I went to film school and so it was kind of impossible to avoid the man's work. <em>Phantom Thread </em>is one of my favorite movies, and he's unimpeachably good with the exception of <em>Licorice Pizza, </em>which exactly half of my friends hated vehemently. He was "working some stuff out" with that one.&nbsp;</p><p>For people who have not seen the movie, <em>One Battle After Another</em> is an incredibly loose adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's <em>Vineland</em>. Anderson had previously adapted <em>Inherent Vice, </em>which I love, but a lot of people slid off of it. I think he made the right call here because it diverges a lot from the novel.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Ah, didn't know it was based on a book! I wonder if that'll explain some ick feelings I've been seeing from folks. But yeah, the movie---in the barest of terms, follows DiCaprio as a former revolutionary and single father. After roughly 16 years, a military dude played by Sean Penn is back on the hunt for him, putting DiCaprio and his daughter in the crosshairs of a messy (to put it lightly) family drama with a city-wide ICE raid taking place in the background. I basically walked out of the film with the burning thought to add it and <a href="https://aftermath.site/eddington-ari-aster-covid-movie-pedro-pascal-joaquin-phoenix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Eddington</em></a><em> </em>to a time capsule watchlist about how our current administration sucks.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: I agree, although I like it way more than <em>Eddington </em>for reasons that would take too long to get into.</p><p>In the movie, Bob&nbsp; (DiCaprio) is a former member of the French 75, which is pretty notably rooted in radical Black politics. His lover, Perfidia Beverly Hills (Teyana Taylor) sexually humiliates Steven J. Lockjaw (Penn) who becomes obsessed with Perfidia, and this sexual obsession becomes much of the motivating factor in tracking down Bob and his daughter Charlene.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: The movie from there is an extended game of cat and mouse as Bob looks for his daughter while Lockjaw tries to kill Bob and track her down. In the midst of all that, Lockjaw is terrorizing this small town and Del Toro's Sensei Sergio helps organize folks to circumvent ICE.</p><p>He's the coolest guy ever.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Chris</strong>: He's so sick, man. He's so cool he momentarily sells drunk driving as being cool.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: I've never seen a film so successfully advertise Modelo. Like every scene Sergio is on sight offering Bob a four pack of beer to help calm down their very stressful situation.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: I believe in the original he's a fucked up DEA agent, but in this he's like a guy who's a karate instructor but secretly the most competent guy he knows. It's really hard to watch this movie and not force analogues from P.T. Anderson's life. <em>Phantom Thread </em>is a wife guy movie, and both that movie and this feel indebted to his marriage to Maya Rudolph, who herself mostly grew up not knowing her mother, Minnie Riperton.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. I only knew him as the guy folks confuse for Milla Jovovich's husband.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: Also a wife guy director, but in a totally different way.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: I liked the film a lot. It had that kind of riding the line of being funny and stressful in equal measure with some sick-ass camera work. Which, I guess, should go without saying. Folks were clowning on the IMAX poster just being of a road instead of the cliche floating head poster. After seeing the film, they're 100 percent justified in doing so. I've never been more stressed at a camera pointed at a road in my life.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: I saw it in VistaVision, which is a very weird format from the 50s that they revived for <em>The Brutalist</em> where you flip the 35mm negative sideways to get more resolution. The film broke halfway through the screening and I saw a lot of people report similar things, but it looks FANTASTIC.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p>It is fascinating how current the movie feels. The setting that Anderson uses is a little wonky and surreal on purpose, a little unmoored in time. It envisions a world with a more radical politics than ours (closer to groups in the 70s), but the depiction of fascist ICE agents is just what I see every single day when I look at my phone. It feels like this was pitched last week.</p><p>Sean Penn puts in a deranged performance, I was in awe.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Wrestling circles are basically in agreement that Penn could play Vince McMahon in a biopic should Hollywood want one. The teeth sucking grossed me, out but that weird waddle of his is vintage Mr. McMahon.</p><p>On that note, there’s one plot point related to him I have a point of contention with if we're good to lightly dive into <strong>some spoilers</strong>.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: He does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLBUd3r1y3I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Vince walk</a>! And also yes.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: The major thrust of the film is that Bob and Perfidia are very sexually active. Like, will fuck in the middle of setting off a bomb sexual. But all of that plays out after an encounter where Perfidia humiliates Lockjaw basically making him get an erection at gunpoint while rescuing folks in an ICE encampment. This domino effects into him being obsessed with her and coercing her into sex lest Lockjaw ruin their whole operation. Hence the family drama element of Perfidia not really liking her daughter Willa, walking out on Bob, and eventually ratting on the French 75.</p><p>The rest of the movie's whole chase is basically <em>Maury</em> with the parentage of Willa being in the balance.</p><p>While I found all that drama pretty engrossing, some folks felt that part of the film was off the mark.&nbsp; Basically,<em> One Battle After Another </em>doesn't leave any Black women looking good by the end of it. It's not something I actively thought about while watching it, but I did find the movie routinely being like "kinfolk will sell you out when push comes to shove" to be something worth picking apart. Not necessarily something the movie interrogates, but an interesting aspect of the film nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p>I was wondering, since this is based on a book, if that was an element PTA directly adapted or if this is a case of PTA not being as tapped in to things that give Black folks the ick.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: Yeah, I do agree that there's something really hard to watch about Perfidia's character, and I've seen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/29/jezebels-race-kink-and-cardi-b-in-one-bat[%E2%80%A6]ther-black-women-are-still-stereotypes-paul-thomas-anderson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people echo that statement</a>. I think you're meant to sort of stew in what she did and why she did it, like her identity is meant to be a thing that Willa has to grapple with, but it comes off weird.</p><p>There's a part where Junglepussy (played by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglepussy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rapper of the same name)</a> says "this is some <em>Set It Off </em>shit" in the middle of a robbery, and it's hard not to see him borrowing heavily from that movie.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Set It Off (1996) Trailer | Jada Pinkett Smith | Queen Latifah" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkPAxsN9wQA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>A big theme of this movie is how the fascist state forces people to turn on each other, to inform, to name names. It happens again and again in the movie, but the movement persists. It's a movie that feels indebted to movies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Cercle_Rouge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Red Circle</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_Is_Over_(1966_film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The War Is Over</em></a>, about the intricacies of resistance, but the difference is it's largely meant to be a hopeful message. And I think a running theme is that even if you were complicit with the way the world is, how do you make things right?</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Yeah, the film to me didn't necessarily embellish in fetishizing Black women more than play up how people who do so are fucking weird. Kinda in the way that it would make Black people laugh watching all the shit go down with Lockjaw being both cartoony and realistically racist. I think the film also dresses that with its weird underground coven of white racists in the Christmas Adventurers Club. Still, I can see why folks aren't so hot on Black women getting the short end of the stick in tandem with revolutionaries seeming incompetent.</p><p>Basically everyone not involved with Sensei comes off as a group of washed revolutionaries or folks who are more likely to rat each other out when the going got tough. There's probably more to that, but I found that to be more interesting than something to necessarily find fault in being represented in the film. I don't necessarily need <em>One Battle After Another</em> to neatly package my politics. If it did, I'd feel more pandered to than anything. So I found even that messiness to be a quality to the film in a way.</p><p>Shit happens, people make decisions, and sometimes those are more about self preservation than true allyship. As a nonbinary person, Charlene's nonbinary friend ultimately selling her out was something I leaned forward in my chair from then threw my hands up at. I think filmmakers are at their best when they make those kinds of interesting choices that provoke conversation instead of feeling like a laminated, mass-produced, people-pleasing, cathartic affair.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Yeah, and there's this implicit element there of their nonbinary friend being the highest risk.</p><p>Related to Lockjaw's weird pathology, I had to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mass_Psychology_of_Fascism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Mass Psychology of Fascism</em></a> when I <a href="https://aftermath.site/psycho-patrol-r-early-access-impressions-review-cruelty-squad-consumer-softproducts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviewed <em>Psycho Patrol R</em> </a>and the one part where Wilhelm Reich (who was a crank) was really cooking is his idea that fascism is the sum of irrational thoughts, and that racism stems from fascism and sexual dysfunction, and that's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3llfuiymlzk2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">basically just describing Sean Penn's whole character</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I like how nobody in The Christmas Adventurers Club knows how to talk normally; they all have these weird ways of phrasing shit. Fascism is that cartoonishly evil, these people really do exist and they are currently in charge of the government. And to your point about ambiguity, I think the part that haunts me the most is the tracker Avanti played by Eric Schweig, who gives this incredible, understated performance.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p>Also, this movie is fucking FUNNY.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Yeah, I was worried when the online chatter from legacy pubs likened DiCaprio's performance to <em>The Big Lebowski </em>but that's entirely fitting. Him basically being the inverse, less a fish out of water thrown into a whole ordeal and more a guy trying his best, was a good bit. I tend to have a better time with movies that don't take themselves too painfully seriously, so <em>One Battle After Another</em> injecting some humor to break up the crushing tension of the film is great. Didn't think PTA would have a good eye for directing that, but seeing as how one of the funniest bits in <em>There Will Be Blood</em> was the whole milkshake scene, it shouldn't surprise me that he had a comedic eye too. High key, not enough folks talk about the actually funniest scene, where Paul Dano talks about God failing to alert him to the recent panic of our economy.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> He does not get enough credit for being funny, I think so often of Phiip Seymour Hoffman in <em>The Master</em> saying "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Roy_KV1WK8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you already know the answers to your questions then why ask PIG FUCK</a>?"&nbsp;</p><p>I also love that DiCaprio is like a revolutionary from another era: He sucks at doing the reading, he does not know how modern society works, but he never stops trying or caring. The scene with his daughter's nonbinary friend could have easily gone off the rails, but it's saved by him being like ‘look, I'm just trying to be POLITE.’</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Exactly! I'm not one of those folks saying it's his best performance to date or anything, but it's nice to see that this wasn't a film he seemed to be sleepwalking through doing his usual crashouts at things happening around him. Film had heart and it did so without really centering him as a blanket savior but with Willa reckoning with her place in this fucked-up world.</p><p>Also, fun fact, I discovered that her actor, <a href="https://x.com/ColumbiaChi/status/1970172755510251534?t=m6zWisMryBRmfUh5Gv8oDg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chase Infiniti</a>, actually graduated a year after me at Columbia College Chicago. Very wild stuff I'll be sure to use as bragging rights in every cinephile circle I'll frequent in the near future. Makes me wonder if I crossed her in the halls or nearly missed each other during Zoom classes for the few film courses I took there. She was great.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris</strong>: What could have been...</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: She strikes me as a fellow Devil Dawgs frequenter. Her name being a mix of inspiration from <em>Toy Story</em>'s "To infinity and beyond” and Nicole Kidman’s Chase Meridian in <em>Batman Forever</em> is <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/chase-infiniti-interview-one-battle-after-another-1236366095/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most gen-z thing anyone will ever hear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: Goddddd. Yeah, you're right.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Hopefully it'll be her star-making performance in the years to come.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: Yeah she is the breakout here, and like the heart of the movie.&nbsp;</p><p>In a movie of messy characters she is one of the few with her head on straight. She does not need her dad to save her or her mom to come out of hiding and that's the point. Despite the limitations of what her parents could give her, Bob's heroism is fundamentally in instilling a moral compass in her even when she has to raise herself. In her heart she wants to be the version of her mom that she was raised on. And that's the thing about kids– you hope that they live up in a better world, to be what you wanted to be, and not make the mistakes that you made.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: And at the end of the day, that's really the <em>One Battle After Another</em>, isn't it? Overcoming generational trauma. That and trying to live in a world that abhors your very existence.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/candy-crush-saga-lawsuit-alleged-scam-tournament-king"><h3>Candy Crush Player Sues Activision Blizzard Over Alleged ‘Scam’ Tournament</h3></a><p>He says King tricked players into thinking they have a chance at the grand prize</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/airpods-pro-3-review-heartrate-v-shaped-sound"><h3>The AirPods Pro 3 Are Everything I Wanted, And They’re Crucially Flawed</h3></a><p>The AirPods Pro 3 are a generational leap in technology, kneecapped by Apple’s showy tuning and hubris.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/one-battle-after-another-review-aftercha]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-sound-design-maxi-boch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-does-it-sound-like-to-slide-down-a-breast-milk-river-ask-baby-steps-sound-designer-maxi-boch.1315201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rhythm is important in <em>Baby Steps</em>. If you’re to get Nate—the playable man-child in Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and Bennett Foddy’s latest game—anywhere, you’re going to need to find your rhythm. Fiddling with a controller’s triggers, walking up, around, and through <em>Baby Step</em>’s many obstacles is not easy. But it <em>is</em> possible, and made all the more satisfying by the game’s dynamic sound design that creates music from both nature and the way in which Nate interacts with the world.</p><p>Maxi Boch, <em>Baby Step</em>’s sound designer, developer, and designer, told Aftermath it was an “intense undertaking” for her and her team (DJ and producer Ashe Kilbourne and game designer and composer Jack Schesigner).&nbsp;</p><p>“The music of <em>Baby Steps</em> is also walking this uncanny divide—it is made entirely of sounds of nature and the player’s interaction with the world, but is sequenced and rhythmic in a truly human way,” she said.</p><p>The wind blowing, a phone ringing, and a seagull’s incessant squawking becomes music set to Nate’s muddy footsteps and belabored grunting. In an interview with Aftermath, Boch spoke about her approach to sound design for a game that’s outside the bounds of reality—like creating sounds for Nate falling down a breast milk river.&nbsp;</p><p><em>[Ed. note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.]</em></p><figure></figure><p><strong>Aftermath: What role does sound design play in creating the world of </strong><strong><em>Baby Step</em></strong><strong>s?</strong></p><p><strong>Maxi Boch: </strong>The world of <em>Baby Steps</em> is split between intense commitments to reality &amp; fidelity and joyful embrace of the unique unrealities of video games. Sound in games is essential to creating a unique and pleasurable game feel, and I see my job as trying to make everything the player does as juicy and detailed and pleasurable from a low level interaction standpoint, even if that means going for hyper reality, so that the player can find joy in just touching stuff and&nbsp; exploring the world.&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, we try to bring a robust materiality to every interaction so that the ground you are walking on, tripping on, or falling over/sliding down. When you swim in <em>Baby Steps</em>, we model the displacement of water and play differential sounds depending on whether your feet break the surface of the water, whether you are displacing water (what we call a “slosh”) or pressing against it (a “splash”). There are 31 unique surface sounds in babysteps, and with each step, we are usually blending between two different surface sounds to arrive at a super-unique sounding step. If your foot scuffs a rock, then slides past some dirt and onto a moss-covered rock, we play a scuff that is tailored to the length of your contact with that rock, then layer in a custom slide sound that fades between dirt and and moss and rock, culminating in that unique step sound blending moss and rock in a way that the player has likely never heard before and will never hear again. The result is that the player doesn’t hear footstep sound effects, instead they start to believe the terrain is real, which makes the extremely tough and purposely difficult challenges feel somehow more fair.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>So with every slide down a breast milk river there is a bit of the “ahhh” sound that I make after swallowing something refreshing, and with every step a bit of me gulping, lending a truly surreal sonic experience.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure><p>The world of <em>Baby Steps</em> is a magical place where you can survive a fall from any height. But when you fall, we don’t want the kind of visceral, bone-breaking sounds that one might expect from an enormous tumble. Instead, we play up the slapstick nature of the fall with clattering sound effects that are detailed and complex to the point of silliness, bringing a jovial quality to the inevitable failures you’ll encounter in <em>Baby Steps</em>. Likewise with Nate’s yelling—we have a forthcoming feature where when Nate starts yelling he won’t ever stop, like his lungs just have infinite capacity for wailing and whining.&nbsp;</p><p>But when you slide down a river of breast milk, what the hell do we do given that commitment to reality? That’s where we roll up our sleeves and try to come up with bizarre sound combinations that would never exist in the real world. So with every slide down a breast milk river there is a bit of the “ahhh” sound that I make after swallowing something refreshing, and with every step a bit of me gulping, lending a truly surreal sonic experience.&nbsp;</p><p>None of that would be possible without a super performant low level audio system, because, as a physics game, we also have to be hitch free. So Jack’s work making our audio system super tight and performant, and coming in at a late hour and porting all of the work over to a new frame work, was truly indispensable in achieving this design.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>How did you build and implement the dynamic sound system in </strong><strong><em>Baby Steps</em></strong><strong>, something that adjusts to what’s happening in game?</strong></p><p>Likewise with nature sounds: the music of <em>Baby Steps</em> is also walking this uncanny divide—it is made entirely of sounds of nature and the player’s interaction with the world, but is sequenced and rhythmic in a truly human way.&nbsp;</p><p>Building a system like this is an intense undertaking. We have found that the nature sounds, given that they exist in a space outside of any particular tonal or tempered music (has no scale or key or anything like that), have the unique quality of being able to be broadly interpreted by players according to their play experience and mood.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>This allows us to sidestep the emotionally prescriptive feel that scoring can sometimes have, like when the “it’s time to cry” music comes on.</p></blockquote></figure><p><em>Baby Steps </em>has no particular rules or boundaries enforced, so it’s difficult for us to know when a particular moment is going to be high pressure or emotional for the player—they could’ve decided to climb an almost unclimbable rock and we don’t really have a good way of knowing as much. But players report the birds and animals in the game as either encouraging, or taunting, or celebrating them, depending on their context. This is beautiful to me, and allows us to sidestep the emotionally prescriptive feel that scoring can sometimes have, like when the “it’s time to cry” music comes on.</p><p><strong>What's your approach to actually recording the different sounds that make up the sound design?</strong></p><p>We are a tiny team and don’t have the resources to do a lot of our own recording with regard to surfaces, wildlife, etc. I have sourced an enormous amount of recordings from a wide variety of pro and independent sources, and worked with Ashe to process them all and get them sounding cohesive. Additionally, we run an enormous amount of analysis to each sound, so that we can understand what tempo is a natural fit for that individual sound, and how that sound compares to the others within the same cue (collection of sounds that come from the same animal, plant, etc.) That way, we can build layouts for our Ableton Live patches where similar sounds are mapped to similar locations on our midi controllers. </p><p>This lets us build cool call and response repetition style patterns without actually repeating the same sound over and over again, lending that sense of both reality and impossibility to the memorable animal and bird “hooks” that appear throughout the game and in our trailers. With few exceptions, every animal sound sequenced into songs in the game has been performed by me on an Ableton Push controller, so that it is not robotically gridded and has that looser feel that helps sell the illusion &amp; adds to the groovy musicality.</p><figure><blockquote><p> We transition between intense percussive mixes when you are falling to insect-driven percussion when you’re ambling about</p></blockquote></figure><p>We can also make real-time swaps to other similar sounds if we know the player has heard a particular sound a lot. Our intention is to make the player first question whether there is a music system at all, as if they’re just maybe imaging it, but then they start to realize there is truly a chorus of natural sounds accompanying their gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>We also love intense percussive sound effects, and originally the music design was full of those, but over time we saw the songs messing with the player’s ability to hear their own footsteps. That led us to creating insect mixes of all of the tracks—Ashe headed up that conversion—and now we transition between intense percussive mixes when you are falling to insect-driven percussion when you’re ambling about, which leaves the low end and low mids free for players to be able to hear themselves walk.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>What have you learned from your previous works that you brought with you to the sound design of </strong><strong><em>Baby Steps</em></strong><strong>?</strong></p><p>Tons! But mostly a sense of how to do it well, and what I’m interested in as a sound designer. My work at Harmonix definitely gave us the production acumen and sense of the value of tools to be able to build something this big and ambitious. <em>Baby Steps</em> does take some things from the learnings of<em> Ape Out</em>, like the value of simplifying complex player inputs to 0-1 ranges to control musical intensity—but is largely oppositional to that sound design’s procedurality, viscerality and violence. <em>Baby Steps</em> has songs with predictable, intentional structure, and we’ll be releasing them in the form of a soundtrack with a list of actual songs.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also some traditional musical compositions in the game, but I won’t spoil those for you! I’ll just say that it was wonderful to be able to share the work I have been doing in regard to voice training with the world.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-recruitment-job-applications-ai-layoffs"><h3>Trying To Get A Job In Video Games Right Now Is Like Crawling Through Hell</h3></a><p>Trying to find a job in video games at the moment has become a dehumanising, demoralising grind</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/one-battle-after-another-review-aftercha"><h3>One Battle After Another Is An Instant Classic That Plays Fast And Loose With Its Politics&nbsp;</h3></a><p>One Battle After Another is an instant popcorn classic that explores the murky, ugly side of revolution and the sexual hangups of fascism.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/candy-crush-saga-lawsuit-alleged-scam-tournament-king"><h3>Candy Crush Player Sues Activision Blizzard Over Alleged ‘Scam’ Tournament</h3></a><p>He says King tricked players into thinking they have a chance at the grand prize</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/airpods-pro-3-review-heartrate-v-shaped-sound"><h3>The AirPods Pro 3 Are Everything I Wanted, And They’re Crucially Flawed</h3></a><p>The AirPods Pro 3 are a generational leap in technology, kneecapped by Apple’s showy tuning and hubris.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-sound-design-maxi-boch]]></content:encoded>
