      <p>This week, Gita and Luke are joined by Brendan Caldwell of the new independent media website <a href="https://www.jank.cool/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jank.Cool</u></a>, which has maybe the best domain name of all time.</p><p>Jank is a website about PC gaming, started by Caldwell and his colleagues from Rock, Paper, Shotgun, John Hicks and Graham Smith. As far as I can tell, it is also a website for absolute sickos. It features blogs about <a href="https://www.jank.cool/three-game-devs-climb-a-mountain/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>forcing game developers to play <em>Peak </em>while answering interview questions</u></a>; <a href="https://www.jank.cool/i-wish-videogame-culture-would-take-more-cues-from-readers/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>taking more cues from book reading nerds</u></a>; and just <a href="https://www.jank.cool/its-a-car-mechanic-sim-where-your-mates-do-all-the-work/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>straight up torturing your friends in a video game about running a car shop</u></a>. Other than the website you are reading currently, this is the platonic ideal of a website about video games.</p><p>We also discussed Luke's life of constantly being attacked by Magpies, Gita’s frustrations with the romances in Cyberpunk 2077, the trials and tribulations of having your own website, and then Gita’s cat Ella meows directly in the mic, sidetracking everyone.</p>
