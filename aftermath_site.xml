            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Alters</em> is not what I was expecting! Given <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I now learn about new and upcoming games in a very normal way</a>, I went into it almost blind, knowing absolutely nothing about it, my only prior commentary being, well...</p><p>To find it was a very nice-looking sci-fi game with a unique blend of resource and personnel management, with loads of adventure and dialogue layered over the top, was something of a pleasant surprise!</p><p>You play as the sole survivor of a deep space accident, waking up on an incredibly hostile alien planet to find the rest of your crew is dead. Your base and transportation are still functional, however, leaving you a finite number of days (<em>Majora's Mask</em> style) to stay alive and reach an extraction point. It's a goal you'll never achieve on your own--the mission was originally designed for a whole crew, after all--so before long you need to build your <em>own </em>crew. By cloning yourself. </p><figure><figcaption>While you CAN drive much of the game from menus, it's a lot more fun to get out there and do everything in-person, especially since the WHOOSHING elevators in your base are so much fun to use</figcaption></figure><p>Seems like a straightforward solution, only there's a catch, and this is where the name and cover come in: you're not really cloning yourself, you're creating "Alters". The technology in this future has been able to map brain and body alike, the latter charted via core memories (think <em>Inside Out</em>!) revolving around important decisions you've made in your life, from childhood to school and beyond. <em>The Alters</em> lets you revisit those moments and change the outcome, after which a quantum computer simulates the results and spits out a different you.</p><p>Physically, it's you, but emotionally each clone can be a wildly different person. You've all got some degree of shared histories--the same parents, some of you broadly similar upbringings--but have also lived essentially different lives. This is a cool trick when talking to your new co-workers, everyone the same yet also not, but it also has a practical consequence, because conveniently all the Alters you grow have been trained in the different jobs you'll need to crew your base, from scientists to technicians to refinery experts.</p><p>A big part of <em>The Alters</em> is simply dealing with all of, well, you. The more Alters you create the more they bounce off each other, work themselves into exhaustion, have needs and start fights, and your job as the original is to support everyone, mediate disputes and just generally try and hold the whole operation together.</p><figure><figcaption>Both have a point! How you settle this, or whether you settle it at all, is up to you</figcaption></figure><p>The other part of the game involves running the base, which means constantly tinkering with a resource and production management system. <em>The Alters</em> has a real-time clock and everyone gets tired, but your base and crew always need fuel and food, and you always need to be building and repairing stuff, so it's essential to try and find a balance between all these competing needs.</p><p>This part of the game takes a little while to get your head around; it lives partly as a spreadsheet, with all your numbers and routines and assignments always a click away in a menu screen, but it also lives in a 3D space you can directly interact with as a player character, sometimes because it's just more fun to do it that way, also because you often need to leave your base to explore the planet around you, or do some mining.</p><p>There are very clear lines between these parts of the game, visible seams between the two halves of the elevator pitch. The team leader stuff is cool, and there are some interesting implementations of it--your ex-wife is on the phone at one point, for example, and you need to find an Alter who can actually talk to her--but a lot of the dialogue is also kinda boring and repetitive, over-written and overly-wordy in a way that had me turning the subtitles on ASAP so I could skip through sections instead of having to sit through entire conversations. The idea of all these Alters is interesting, but not many of the actual <em>guys </em>are.</p><p>The resource management stuff is also neat, in the way it can be run mostly from menus but also in person, and juggling everything alongside time and energy levels makes it a constant challenge. But it's also kinda artificial; the game's story often intrudes on your plans, so it never <em>quite </em>feels like a proper resource management game.</p><figure><figcaption>This is a very good-looking video game!</figcaption></figure><p>Where I really liked <em>The Alters</em> was the way that, thanks to its context and the way both halves of the game related to each other, none of that mattered, because the lines between them ultimately aren't important. Yeah, many of the Alters are boring and talk too much, but these are your workmates, that's incredibly relatable. And given everything else about this game, particularly its emphasis on story, I didn't <em>want </em>it to be a proper resource sim; I appreciate that it's giving me something to do in between conversations that is trying something different to the usual strategy, FPS or RPG approach to a narrative you'd expect from these visuals and this setting. I've honestly never played a game like this, and that's a very cool and fun thing to get to experience.</p><p>You're playing as a man stranded, stressed and alone, and there's just enough panic and frustration on the resource side of things that I truly felt those things. And the cloning takes the game's setting and runs with it; as a premise in the universe of <em>The Alters</em> its dicey and experimental, so its imperfect implementation is just a reflection of that.</p><p>So yeah, I really liked this game! I appreciate fresh swings at familiar genres, I am <em>very </em>into its art design (and menus, which are lovely) and I would love to see more games at this point in the market try interesting new stuff like this.</p><p>I still hate the cover though. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/this-game-sure-looks-a-lot-like-venba"><h3>This Game Sure Looks A Lot Like Venba</h3></a><p>Prolific copycat studio makes a copycat game of Venba, stripping it of any life</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/rent-a-girlfriend-manga"><h3>You win, Rent-A-Girlfriend.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Food is core to what makes <em>Venba</em>, a cooking game from Visai Games, itself. Its thoughtful cooking mechanics are an extension of its story about a Canadian Indian family. Recipes, pulled from an oil-stained cookbook, are a way to explore both the beauty of Tamil culture and the struggle of immigrant families. It’s a triumph of game development, and you don’t just have to take my word for it; <em>Venba</em> won best debut and a social impact award at the 2024 Game Developers Choice Awards, the Seamus McNally Grand Prize at the Independent Games Festival, <em>and</em> best debut game at the 20th British Academy Games Awards.</p><p>It’s no wonder that game developers would take inspiration from <em>Venba</em>. That’s not inherently a bad thing, unless you’re doing what mobile game developer Global Advertising Network LTD — lol — is doing: Whitewashing out any of the things that make <em>Venba</em> incredible, blatantly cribbing its art style, and turning it into a sloppy mobile cash grab.&nbsp;</p><p>Global Advertising Network’s game <em>Sofra</em> is marketed as a cooking simulator and released some time in 2024. It’s seemingly gone somewhat under the radar since then, though the Google Play Store lists it as having more than 10,000 downloads. There’s no story; it simply takes the gameplay mechanics and art style of <em>Venba</em>, following recipes to create inspired, creative dishes like, uh, peanut butter and jelly. As you might expect, there’s a microtransaction for everything — to earn more coins, remove ads, and to unlock levels like the vague “Asian Food Pack.”</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/visaigames.bsky.social/post/3lsegwqa3o22a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Visai Games called out <em>Sofra</em> on BlueSky</a>: “If you ever wanted a version of Venba where you get to make sandwiches instead of Tamil food and don't have to contend with themes of like dealing with racism, then I have good news for you! This mobile game rip-off with stolen assets is for you!!”</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to Visai Games, Global Advertising Network, Apple, and Google for comment.</p><p>This is, unfortunately, not a unique phenomena for mobile gaming, <a href="https://aftermath.site/unpacking-nintendo-eshop-switch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and it’s something that’s spreading elsewhere, like onto the Nintendo Switch Store</a>. Global Advertising Network, unsurprisingly, is a prolific copycat developer: Its most popular game, <em>Find Sort Match: Puzzle game</em> is a blatant ripoff of Secret Mode’s 2022 release <em>A Little to the Left</em>. According to the Google Play Store, <em>Find Sort Match: Puzzle game</em> has been downloaded more than 5 million times on that platform alone. As with <em>Venba</em>, it takes both the concept and art style of the game and makes a cheap copy of it. It’s also got games that resemble <em>Bad North</em>, <em>Frostpunk, </em>and <em>Stacklands</em>.</p><p>These sorts of low effort clone games are a major issue on mobile app stores. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#copycats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple’s guidelines include a section specifically about copycat games</a>: “Come up with your own ideas. We know you have them, so make yours come to life. Don’t simply copy the latest popular app on the App Store, or make some minor changes to another app’s name or UI and pass it off as your own. In addition to risking an intellectual property infringement claim, it makes the App Store harder to navigate and just isn’t fair to your fellow developers.”</p><p>Games can be removed, according to the guidelines, due to copyright claims or if they are “impersonating” another game or app. It’s unclear whether <em>Sofra</em> would fall into that category of impersonation; its art style is clearly a copy, but unlike in the copycat situation with <em>Unpacking</em> recently, it’s not directly using the game’s name. Some developers have moved to the court system to force app stores to take action: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/510282/poppy-playtime-lawsuit-scam-games-google" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Poppy Playtime </em>developer Mob Entertainment filed a lawsuit</a> in January over “scam” versions of its games. Mob Entertainment issued DMCA takedown requests to get the games removed from the Google Play Store, but they were later readded. That lawsuit is still ongoing. In May, Google filed a motion to dismiss, saying that Google isn’t responsible, and that Mob Entertainment should go after the infringing game developer instead.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/rent-a-girlfriend-manga"><h3>You win, Rent-A-Girlfriend.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In all my 28 years on this spinning rock, I’ve read my fair share of manga—some absolute classics, some guilty pleasures, and plenty that were straight up trash. But no series has tested my patience quite like <em>Rent-A-Girlfriend</em>. Somehow, against all odds, it’s become the most bizarrely pivotal manga out right now—perched at the edge of being either a brilliant subversion of the genre or a drawn-out cliche that’ll embolden red-pilled manosphere incels for generations. And honestly? I’m too drained to care anymore.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Rent-A-Girlfriend</em>, by Reiji Miyajima, is a rom-com series I can best describe as <em>Scott Pilgrim,</em> but worse. It follows Kazuya Kinoshita, a perpetually down-bad college student who, off the heels of a brutal breakup, impulsively hires a rental girlfriend named Chizuru Mizuhara to fill the hole in his sadboy heart. I genuinely can’t stress this enough: Kazuya is a weirdo to the nth degree at the start of the series. He blows through tissues and can’t be bothered to clean them up. Early Kazuya lashes out at Chizuru for “faking it” on their rental date, despite her doing her job. He embodies every red flag rolled into one desperate, entitled fuckboy. And this is before the trashy harem manga/anime hijinks ensue.</p><p>Kazuya and Chizuru’s grandmothers, conveniently bosom buddies at the same nursing home, spot them together, roping them into continuing a charade of “fake dating” after getting spotted together and keeping up appearances in front of Kazuya’s friends, which inevitably spirals out of control. Things get even messier when the series leans hard into full-blown harem chaos. Enter: a girl whose heart condition means her kokoro only goes doki doki for Kazuya; another painfully shy rental girlfriend but still Team Kazuya because he shows normal human decency to her; a loli sidekick who exists purely to cheer on the will-they-won’t-they with her finger firmly tipping the scale toward the former; and an ex who, ironically is the only one calling out the madness—yet gets vilified by readers who just see her as a bitch.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Best Waifu of 2020" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TwnK8DRINbY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>By now, you’re probably wondering why I even bothered diving into this series. Trust me, I ask myself that same thing every week when I clock in to read a new chapter and massage my brow. My morbid curiosity had me first watching the entirety of its first season in a day and then catching up to its available manga chapters to the point where it was, for a time, like rubbernecking a beautiful car crash.&nbsp;</p><p>Secretly, though, I hoped for a pivot—for Chizuru to wise up and leave Kazuya in an emotional landfill where he belonged. Despite their improbable chemistry hinting at genuine affection, it was a later arc of hers that caught me off guard—a storyline where she pursues acting and reveals that her rental gig was a means to support that dream. That made me feel things.&nbsp;</p><p>Kazuya, by that point, had taken enough Ls to start resembling a functioning adult instead of a 2D wish-fulfilment entity for anime and manga’s most tragic fanbase. But of course, there’s a catch: the series<em> </em>drags. It <em>drags</em>. And Kazuya somehow becomes even more of a spectacle. Case in point is an infamous waterpark meltdown, complete with tears, jealousy, and a boner where the man is crashing out at the thought (which readers see in excruciating detail) of Chizuru bumping uglies with a male friend of hers. Peak narrative despair so cringe I’m surprised I didn’t Thanos snap into oblivion having read it.</p><p>What followed, surprisingly, was a glimmer of actual progress—their lie exposed by Kazuya’s ex, and a dramatic, full-spread kiss spurned by Chizuru to prove they were dating that duped Kazuya’s friends, family, and readers into believing we were headed into final arc territory. Closure is possible.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn’t. The series kept going. And the worst part? I kept reading.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The 🔥Roast🔥 of Rent-A-Girlfriend" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OckbgVgZj04?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Fellow anime connoisseur Geoff Thew of Mother's Basement and I have exchanged war letters (via Twitter DMs) about the series. Geoff’s long since tapped out. I, on the other hand, remain entrenched in the manga, reporting back like a shell-shocked soldier. And while Geoff has summarized the pain more concisely than I can without seeing red, the core gripe remains: this manga has become an exercise in narrative purgatory.</p><p>Kazuya and Chizuru both know they have feelings for each other. Everyone knows. And yet, instead of resolution, the story stalls—like a cat toying with its food, savoring the indecision. Chizuru has had the ball in her court for what feels like geological time, and the series seems intent on suspending the inevitable “let’s date” or “let’s just be friends” moment for maximum agony. Along the way, every romcom cliche and emotionally manipulative contrivance has been hurled at them to stretch the string taut: cohabitation shenanigans, Kazuya becoming her acting manager, a chorus of women (all but his ex) lining up to cheer him on like a dating sim with no bad route story branch.&nbsp;</p><p>But then something happened. Around chapter 380, the pair is finally on their first real date. Let that sink in. In the time this saga has burned through endless trial runs of their date like it was an episode of <em>The Rehearsal</em>, entire romcoms—<em>Komi Can’t Communicate</em>, <em>My Dress-Up Darling</em>, <em>Don’t Bully Me Nagatoro</em>, and <em>Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out</em>—have wrapped up their burgeoning love stories with them getting together and ending the series. <em>Rent-A-Girlfriend</em>, meanwhile, is shaping up to be the <em>One Piece</em> of emotionally constipated romcoms.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s especially wild, and why I lead with the manga suddenly being critical in the manga reading community, is that the series is at a strange narrative crossroads: it could deliver a long-overdue moral reckoning about transactional intimacy and the entitlement that festers around men regarding women…or it could go full tilt into rewarding Kakuya, breathlessly validating the worst kinds of reader fantasies. And the manga community is embroiled in a civil war over either outcome as the series progresses toward its conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the latest chapters finally gave us the date. I’ll spare you the minute-by-minute because, true to form, readers were subjected to every intrusive, obsessive, ogling thought Kazuya had overanalyzing Chizuru’s mannerisms from start to finish. At the end of their date, it finally happened: Chizuru accepted Kazuya’s feelings. She thanked him for loving her, and she even said she loved him too.</p><p>And then she rejected him.&nbsp;</p><p>She reasoned that her lifestyle as a rental girlfriend and, more honestly, the emotional stage she was at in her life, wouldn’t allow for a relationship. Kazuya, for once, didn’t spiral. He was hurt, sure, but he took it in stride. A vocal subset of the fandom did not.</p><p>Many <em>Rent-A-Girlfriend </em>readers interpreted Chizuru’s rejection as a surprise, maybe even a subversive move—a long-con feminist parable about how affection and support shouldn’t entitle men to a relationship. But on Musk’s town square of terminal takes, the reaction to Kazuya’s rejection was nothing short of a riot. People dogpiled what looked like a rare, poignant moment of growth for Kazuya and branded the manga “peak cuck content.” Chizuru, in particular, was called everything outside her name, with some fans highlighting that Kazuya spent 250,000 yen on their dates and funded her career as evidence that she used him for emotional and financial labor, only to turn him down. One particularly heated reader went full unhinged, posting a manga edit of <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>’s Toji killing Chizuri.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">people going "erm... am i too woke or is this a teensy bit misogynistic... ☝️🤓" bro it's an edit of a woman being called a bitch and shot in the head for gently turning down a guy OBVIOUSLY it's misogynistic 😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/ajoUByBGWO">https://t.co/ajoUByBGWO</a></p>— danny website (@raincoatrevive) <a href="https://twitter.com/raincoatrevive/status/1934340105528856956?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>While I was initially championing the story for somehow surprising me by dovetailing into an essential lesson at a time when men aren’t doing okay and their manosphere pariahs aren’t helping, the manga, to my horror, appears to be spinning the block on its emotional breakthrough. In chapter 382, the story is hinting at their romance not being over, with Kazuya carrying Chizuru piggyback to their apartment after noticing her heel was bloodied from breaking in fancy new shoes—a quiet gesture he’s taken as a signal that their night matters to her, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Odds are they’ll end up together anyway, wrapped in some breathless “it was all worth it” speech. But I won’t be sticking around to see it. I’ve watched this story loop around resolution like a broken record for years, clinging to the hope it might land somewhere bold. I’m not that teenager chasing trainwrecks anymore—I’ve got bills, better taste (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-self-aware-harem-anime-must-finish-its-story-2000560926" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in trashy anime</a>), and better manga to read. Maybe it still turns the ship, but after that latest cliffhanger, I’m out. Not every trashy romance can pull off a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErTEqW1_25c&amp;pp=0gcJCf0Ao7VqN5tD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trashy-meets-classy bonkers landing</a> like <em>Domestic Girlfriend</em>. This is me breaking the cycle. Godspeed to whoever’s still riding this sinking ship.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/this-game-sure-looks-a-lot-like-venba"><h3>This Game Sure Looks A Lot Like Venba</h3></a><p>Prolific copycat studio makes a copycat game of Venba, stripping it of any life</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-sexual-exploitation-of-children-lawsuit-safety"><h3>Roblox Accused Of Allowing Sexual Exploitation In Four Separate Lawsuits</h3></a><p>All four — and more reportedly incoming, lawyers say — are filed by the same law firm</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/rent-a-girlfriend-manga]]></content:encoded>
