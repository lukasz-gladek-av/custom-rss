      <p>Toys? Sweaters? Those are gifts of Christmas Past. You should take a look around at the state of the world, at tariffs and shipping costs for material goods, and consider giving a gift that can be enjoyed by anyone on the planet, wherever they are and however they use the internet.</p><p>I'm of course talking about an Aftermath gift subscription, which can be purchased <a href="https://aftermath.site/gift-subscription/" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and will grant the lucky recipient a whole year of access at our 'Member' tier, which lets them read every blog, score an invite to our community Discord, unlocks merch discounts and even includes a link to their own full-text RSS feed of the site.</p><p>As an added bonus, the money spent on the subscription will also go toward supporting Aftermath's full-time staff, contributors and freelancers, allowing us to continue the access-free, no-bullshit work you've come to expect from a worker-owned, reader-supported website. </p><p><strong>Note</strong>: To have the subscription delivered on a specific day, make sure to select the desired 'Start Date' on the purchase form. You as the giver will be charged immediately upon purchase, but the recipient won't be notified (and their sub won't start) until the selected date. If the date is left as today's date, they'll be emailed (and their sub will begin) immediately. </p><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I don't want to be the Game Announcement Police here, ACAB, but over the last month there have been two big, new video games revealed that were notable not for what they showed off, but for what they didn't.</p><p>First up was <em>Total War: Medieval III</em>, which was announced via a live-action trailer (below) and<a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/welcome-to-total-war-medieval-iii?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>blog post</u></a>:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFKhUJTnC-E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Total War: MEDIEVAL III - Announce Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>Amazing news! There hasn't been a proper historical <em>Total War </em>release since <em>Three Kingdoms</em> (<a href="https://aftermath.site/total-war-pharaoh-dynasties-impressions-release/"><u>I'm not counting <em>Pharaoh's</em> mea culpa</u></a>), and <em>Medieval </em>is a long-time fan favourite, so this should have got people excited. Only problem is that there wasn't any gameplay shown. There weren't any screenshots. There wasn't even much art for the game, aside from<a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/our-vision-for-total-war-medieval-iii?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>a single piece shown at the top of a follow-up blog</u></a>.</p><p>Only days later, Creative Assembly announced a <em>second</em> upcoming <em>Total War </em>game coming out much sooner, this time set in the<em> Warhammer 40K </em>universe, and its debut trailer was <em>packed </em>with gameplay footage, right down to giving us a look at the menus and interface.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QeCItSg-wmI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Total War: Warhammer 40,000 – Announce Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>I'm not drawing a very long bow here to speculate that the <em>Medieval </em>announcement was made a few days prior in an attempt to head off any uproar over the <em>40K</em> announcement. For those unfamiliar with the franchise, there's a kind of uneasy divide among some in the community, with <em>Total War's</em> longest-serving fans (going back to 1999's <em>Shogun</em>) preferring the series' historical focus over the wilder, more fictional stuff that has featured in the <em>Warhammer </em>(and now <em>40K</em>) entries. They look at how much money and effort has been poured into the Creative Assembly collab, then look at the relative neglect shown to the historical games (from ending<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/creative-assembly-faces-backlash-over-decision-to-end-support-for-total-war-three-kingdoms?ref=aftermath.site"> <u><em>Three Kingdoms</em> support early</u></a> to whatever the hell happened with <em>Pharaoh</em>), and get pretty mad.</p><p>While getting <em>Medieval III</em> out in front like that probably made diplomatic sense to publishers Sega and developers Creative Assembly, I dunno, I think I'd rather a game be announced on its own merits and with something genuine to show off and talk about, rather than shoot a clip and write a blog just so you make some of your own fans less angry. <em>Medieval III</em> is clearly <em>years </em>away (they didn't even hint at a broad window for it to come out), and you went and announced a whole other game a few days later– you didn't have to <em>Elder Scolls VI</em>-ify your next big game!</p><figure><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>The Elder Scrolls 6 Announcement Is Now as Old as Skyrim Was When The Elder Scrolls 6 Was Announced - IGN</p><p>The Elder Scrolls 6 announcement is now as old as predecessor Skyrim was when The Elder Scrolls 6 was announced, and developer Bethesda hasn’t shared another snippet since.</p><p><span>ryan_dinsdale</span></p></div></a></figure><p>The second game I wanted to talk about is even funnier. Earlier today Netflix<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/fifa-mens-world-cup-2026-game-on-netflix?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>announced</u></a><u> </u>that Delphi, a company you've likely never heard of (they're relatively new, and their only public credit is as support on IO's upcoming <em>007 </em>game) will be both developing and publishing a new FIFA game. You might remember that<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/may/10/electronic-arts-ditches-fifa-ea-sports-fc?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>back in 2022 EA Sports (developers of the long-running series) and FIFA (the world governing body for football) split</u></a>, and ever since EA's series has been called <em>EA Sports FC,</em> or <em>EAFC</em> for short.</p><p>Netflix's announcement contains zero images or video of the game. And there's probably a good reason for that: the press release says stuff like "All you need is Netflix and your phone", and "We want to bring football back to its roots with something everyone can play with just the touch of a button", suggesting that whatever Delphi is cooking up, it'll be a lot closer to a casual mobile experience than the blockbuster simulation football fans have long come to expect from series like <em>FIFA </em>(now <em>EAFC</em>) and <em>Pro Evo</em> (now called <em>eFootball</em>).</p><p>That obfuscation has paid off handsomely, though, with a ton of mainstream coverage of the announcement hitting today with headlines like:</p><figure><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93w7dp42z2o?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Fifa video game to return after four years in Netflix exclusive</p><p>The game will be made by Delphi Interactive and released in time for the 2026 World Cup.</p><p><span>BBC News</span></p></div></a></figure><p>There's a <em>small </em>mention of what I've just said above at the bottom of that BBC article, but as a mainstream article intended for a mainstream audience, I guarantee Delphi and FIFA will be thrilled at the number of water cooler and group chat conversations this week that will revolve around the talking point "Boys, did you hear FIFA is coming back?"</p><p>I should point out that this isn't the first FIFA game to "return" since the body split with EA; there's already a game called <em>FIFA Rivals</em>,<a href="https://fifa.rivals.game/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>which is basically an antique NFT scam with a playerbase best summed up by the fact the game's official site has a Telegram account</u></a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why Games Go Down When Big Updates Come Out – Even Though Developers Know Tons Of Players Are Going To Log On]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/online-games-down-update-warframe-old-peace/</link>
            <guid>1386541</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Last week, <em>Warframe</em>’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/warframe-old-peace-world-war-one-interview-tennocon/"><u>hotly anticipated <em>Old Peace</em> update</u></a> launched, kicking off a saga that digs into the very foundations of the nearly 13-year-old game’s lore. Of course, like clockwork, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/warframes-the-old-peace-update-servers-issues/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>servers immediately took a tumble</u></a>, resulting in crashes, outages, and chat issues. But why has this pattern become so predictable with online games? Especially when developers are well aware that a storm of their own making is on the horizon?</p><p>During a Game Awards-adjacent event celebrating <em>The Old Peace</em>’s launch last week, I asked creative director Rebb Ford.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"You've gotta spin up capacity,” she told Aftermath, referring to the practice of paying money to a distribution partner for additional servers ahead of or during moments when many players will be trying to access content. “You're allowing so many connections. We're an always-online game, right, so every time a player does something, there's a server call. There's something that needs to be verified server and client side. … Login, mission complete, anything that needs to talk to us to say 'You did this, you did that’ – it happens to us at a volume level that's very hard to account for."</p><p>In <em>The Old Peace</em>’s case, Digital Extremes was ready for a stampede the moment it opened the gates, but not quite ready enough.</p><p>"We actually didn't fall over as much as I thought we would,” said Ford. “That's when we realized 'Oh, we didn't think this was gonna be bigger than TennoCon [<em>Warframe</em>’s annual convention that often drives record player numbers].' We spun up IRC servers, we spun up things just to deal with volume. But sometimes you just cannot be prepared enough when you didn't predict it to be the third-best day in the history of the game. That was an error on our part, but it's not so much a tech error; it was an anticipation error. We fixed it very quickly."</p><p>The ability to quickly rectify server issues is also the result of preparation – in some cases <em>years </em>of preparation.</p><p>"One of our most important things to do is make sure people can get the content as fast as possible,” said Ford. “With <em>Warframe</em>, when we have the build or the update, we release it to our distributing partners, and we do something called a pre-heat of our CDN, or content delivery network – which is basically us saying 'People shouldn't all be fetching the game data from one node.' Because that will take forever. It'll get congested. So we distribute it, and this is through years of network partner shopping, working with really good network partners. We have content servers in 16 or 17 central population hubs."</p><p>The pre-heat, Ford explained, ensures that the whole network doesn’t hinge on a single point of potential failure.</p><p>“So sometimes you'll be going in the Philippines instead of being routed to our deploying headquarters, which is Ontario,” she said. “We pre-heated our server structure across the globe so that people can fetch [new content] quicker, and that takes a lot of load off.”</p><p>But that’s only one stair in what Ford characterized as a winding staircase of individual, overlapping needs.</p><p>"So that's the first point of failure: Can you download the game at all?” she said. “Second point of failure is: Can you login at all? When that happens, that all comes to us through login capacity. That one, you just have to spin up more capacity. Then you have the question of 'Can people play missions?' So you can kind of see the staircase: Can you download the game? Can you login to the game? Can you play the game? And each one of those is a slightly different sector of stability."</p><p>In <em>Warframe</em>’s case, elements can function independently, but if they’re not all working in conjunction, players quickly begin to see the seams.</p><p>“A lot of people can be logged into the game, and that's cool, but if you can't play, [then there's a problem],” said Ford. “It's like Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Can you chat? You don't need chat to play the game, but chat servers run independently. Those were hit the hardest [on <em>Old Peace</em> launch day], and we fixed it fairly fast by spinning up more capacity."&nbsp;</p><p>Games are complicated, as is the process of distributing them to millions of different computers with as many hardware configurations as there are stars in the sky. You will not be surprised to learn, then, that many other things can also go wrong.</p><p>“We have issues where we release new code in this build, and then maybe one piece of code fires every second on a heartbeat,” Ford said. “And sometimes we find these heartbeats, and we're like 'What is pinging the servers every second on the second,' and we're like 'It's the new title system we put in,' for example. ‘It's checking against server-client to issue you a title, but it's doing it in a way where we were unsure because it's checking all this indexed stuff.’"</p><p><em>Warframe </em>has been around for over a decade and regularly pulls in tens – or in <em>Old Peace</em> launch day’s case, hundreds – of thousands of concurrent players. Nonetheless, said Ford, Digital Extremes still frets about The Ramifications as though it were a much smaller company.</p><p>"We still feel very young and scrappy, and we're like 'Can we even afford $600 more per month in capacity?'” she said. “That's the kind of question we ask ourselves on launch day. And then we're like 'Just do it! Just do it!'"</p><p><em>Warframe</em>’s servers weren’t quite able to withstand the sheer weight of years’ worth of anticipation on launch day, but Ford was relieved that they didn’t go down for “hours and hours,” which would’ve necessitated a suitably less jubilant speech at the launch event in LA.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's exciting. It's thrilling. Everyone did an amazing job,” she said. “We asked our team to do the impossible with this update, so even though those little hiccups happened, we had two speeches prepared – funeral or the celebration – and we undoubtedly got to do the celebration."</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/runescape-jagex-engine-sound-development/"><div><p>Let’s Meet A Runescape Developer Who Worked On Everything From Billing To Engines To HTML5 - Aftermath</p><p>‘I gave RuneScape 32-bit sound’</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>
