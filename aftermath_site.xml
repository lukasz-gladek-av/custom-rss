A forum is an everlasting repository of knowledge, a place where questions can be asked and their answers enshrined forever, the solutions to someone's problem just a google search away. It's also a place where conversations are turn-based, and afforded all the nuance and contemplation the platform allows.</p><p>Discord, meanwhile, is a river that never stops running. It has some forum-like features, sure, and a search bar, but its conversations are supposed to take place in real time, which is fantastic for people who are around and talking at the same time, but far less useful for anyone coming around later. Like, say, those with tech support issues, which make up a huge percentage of video game community posts.</p><p>And yet! Companies just keep on making the move anyway. The latest example: DECA, a studio owned by Embracer that now runs games like <em>Star Trek Online</em>, <em>Champions Online</em>, and <em>Neverwinter</em>, will be moving all three of their communities in the coming months.</p><p>Via<a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/05/09/deca-is-closing-the-star-trek-online-champions-online-and-neverwinter-forums-in-favor-of-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> MassivelyOP</a>, a boilerplate message left<a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/forums/neverwinter#/discussion/1268693/forum-discord-announcement?sso=eyJuYW1lIjoiIiwicGhvdG91cmwiOiIiLCJjbGllbnRfaWQiOiIxNDQzOTY4OTgxIn0%3D+f2b1bf6559dc9f73c0d97196634de43be029559b+1747025324+hmacsha1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> on all three forums</a> reads:</p><blockquote><p>After many years of community discussion on the forums, we've made the decision to migrate our resources to where most players are now actively communicating.
