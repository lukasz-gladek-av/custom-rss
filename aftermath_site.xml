As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support. Following my resignation, much of the senior leadership team resigned. Following those departures, the Board made the decision to issue WARN Act notices and proceed with a mass layoff."</p><figure><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/2-days-after-promising-it-was-still-worthy-of-your-investment-the-most-successful-kickstarter-mmo-ever-was-canceled-and-its-team-laid-off-the-developers-and-staff-acted-in-good-faith-and-deserved-better/?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>2 days after promising it was still ‘worthy of your investment,’ the most successful Kickstarter MMO ever was canceled and its team laid off: ‘The developers and staff acted in good faith and deserved better’</p><p>Sifting through the ashes of Ashes of Creation.</p><p><span>PC Gamer</span><span>Ted Litchfield</span></p></div></a></figure><hr><p>Build a Rocket Boy, developers of<a href="https://aftermath.site/mindseye-rocket-boy-impressions-review-pc/" rel="noreferrer"> the terrible <em>Mindseye</em></a>, have parted ways with publisher IO Interactive and decided to bring all publishing operations in-house. </p><figure><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/build-a-rocket-boy-io-interactive/?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>EXCLUSIVE – Build a Rocket Boy to End Publishing Partnership With IO Interactive on MindsEye</p><p>MindsEye developer Build a Rocket Boy will soon announce that it will part ways with its publishing partner IO Interactive.</p><p><span>Insider Gaming</span><span>Tom Henderson</span></p></div></a></figure><hr><p>Austin Wintory won a Grammy earlier this week for his work on <em>Sword Of The Sea</em>'s soundtrack.</p><figure><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/sword-of-the-sea-composer-austin-wintory-wins-grammy-award?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Sword of the Sea composer Austin Wintory wins Grammy award</p><p>The annual music showcase took place last night in Los Angeles.</p><p><span>Game Developer</span><span>Chris Kerr</span></p></div></a></figure><hr><p>Markiplier's <em>Iron Lung</em> movie, based on the game of the same name, is doing pretty great for something that cost only $3 million to make.</p><figure><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/indie-game-film-adaptation-iron-lung-earns-215-million-on-opening-weekend?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Indie game film adaptation Iron Lung earns $21.5 million on opening weekend</p><p>Lands at #2 on US box office thanks to involvement of YouTuber Markiplier</p><p><span>GamesIndustry.biz</span><span>Jon Hicks</span></p></div></a></figure><hr><p>Game shares took a hit last week for a number of reasons, but the funniest was after Google released a video showing that its Project Genie can make terrible videos that look like video games, which was enough to convince the investor class that it can make video games. </p><figure><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-companies-see-share-prices-plummet-following-the-launch-of-googles-very-limited-virtual-world-generator-project-genie?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Game companies see share prices plummet following the launch of Google’s very limited virtual world generator, Project Genie</p><p>Gaming companies saw share prices plummet this week after Google rolled out Project Genie 3, an AI tool that lets users…</p><p><span>Eurogamer.net</span><span>Vikki Blake</span></p></div></a></figure>
