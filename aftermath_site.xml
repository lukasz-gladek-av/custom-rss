The house that <em>Dragon Age</em> and <em>Mass Effect</em> helped build is being taken apart piece by piece, with EA <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reallocating employees</a> to its other studios following <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s bumpy landing and <em>Mass Effect 5</em>’s apparently stunted development. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-31/electronic-arts-slashes-bioware-after-dragon-age-sales-miss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg reports</a> that less than 100 people remain at the once-revered studio. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about how it all came to be.</p><p>We’re joined by Kat Bailey, former news director at IGN and current host of the <a href="https://bloodgodpod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axe of the Blood God</a> podcast, to discuss a news week that’s certainly been… interesting. First we talk about the entire staff of long-running video game site God Is A Geek <a href="https://aftermath.site/god-is-a-geek-calvin-robinson-nazi-salute-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quitting after its now-ex-priest owner threw up a Nazi salute</a> at a pro-life conference. Guess you can only get away with that shit if you’re a billionaire.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we dig into BioWare’s recent post-<em>Dragon Age</em> woes, with EA reshuffling some developers into non-BioWare teams and laying off others. Is the next<em> Mass Effect</em> in trouble? And beyond that, does BioWare as we know it have a future?&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, in response to a variation on the age-old question of which Pokemon would taste best to eat, we pose another: Could Moltres die of avian flu?&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can purchase BioWare and give its developers enough money to finally make their dream game, free of needless trend chasing. There will be just one stipulation: No more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeX0scFunQc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">punching reporters</a>.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Kat: </strong>Things aren’t super amazing at BioWare right now, unfortunately. From what I’ve heard from people who are connected to it, there are people who are on preproduction for <em>Mass Effect 5</em> – which is still in pre-production because a lot of those folks were working on <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> – and then there are a number of people who are on loan to other teams at the moment, for example <em>Skate</em>. Yeah, remember <em>Skate</em>?&nbsp;</p><p>And then the rest have unfortunately been laid off, including some veterans like the Weekes. Trick Weekes and their partner, Karin, were laid off. Trick Weekes has been around since the original <em>Mass Effect</em> and was I believe the lead writer on <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, among other things. So some notable names from the heyday of BioWare are being let go.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Can you speak to the scope of the layoffs? EA is being very unclear about it.</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> I can’t speak to the actual scope. I can only say that the mood is not amazing at BioWare at the moment. It’s hard to say where they go from here. Not detecting a lot of optimism around <em>Mass Effect 5</em> at the moment either, unfortunately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>EA as a company is kind of in a weird place. If you look at Maxis, Project Rene [the next <em>Sims </em>game] has been spinning its wheels for literally years now. The <em>EA Sports FC</em> fell off quite a bit on the sports front. They’ve got this wild Manhattan Project going on with <em>Battlefield</em>, which encompasses four or five studios, and it’s going to be the everything shooter. They’ve got a lot of franchises on ice, and oh by the way, last year they did a huge presentation that was centered almost entirely around AI.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong><a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-ai-demo-imagination-creation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All of their boxes</a>! They’re very proud of their boxes.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>So much of this mush of “Oh, it’s a live service, it’s a shooter, it’s AI.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It all means nothing. It all sounds vaguely pleasing to investors.</p><p>But yeah, it strikes me as telling of where things are at for BioWare. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> wasn’t a bad game, but neither did it land with the kind of impact they needed. It was yet another mid triple-A game, which is what a lot of triple-A games have been lately as a result of an unwillingness to take risks due to the amount of money invested and the size of audiences they’re trying to attract. All of these games are kind of OK.</p><p><strong>Kat: </strong><em>Dragon Age</em> is an interesting case, because it was in development for something like a decade and was rebooted at least twice. It began as a totally different game, then it became a multiplayer live service game. Then the directors on that ended up departing, and they effectively hit the reset button again. And they were using some of the leftover materials from that version. They were using the tech stack. A lot of what happened with <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is due to the fact that it started its life as a multiplayer game – particularly in the way the hubs and the mission structure ended up working.&nbsp;</p><p>In my view they did their best with what they had, but it was by all accounts quite a grueling production process. They got the entire <em>Mass Effect</em> team to help, and they dragged themselves across the finish line. They put a lot of focus on being as polished as possible, because they were aware that this game would get completely battered and end up in a 50 Metacritic score territory, and instead it ended up in the 80s, which is where they were aiming for.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there was a lot of hope that maybe that would be enough, but it didn’t quite land with the base. The word of mouth around it was mixed, especially around the moment-to-moment writing. Because there wasn’t a huge amount of enthusiasm from the actual community – outside certain elements; my sister platinumed that game – and they were getting hammered by, frankly, <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dragon-age-veilguard-review-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a hate campaign</a>, it was tough to achieve liftoff. That’s kind of where we ended up with <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, unfortunately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I saw the sales numbers for it. 1.5 million, right?</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> Maybe just under, because they included EA’s subscription service, where people were getting access to it as well. I think the word they were using was “engagements.”&nbsp;</p><p>A lot was riding on <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> in many respects. The eye of Sauron was upon BioWare, and it was kinda known that they had to get this game out and have it do well. What they were able to accomplish by getting it into the 80s was almost a bare minimum “OK, ship a product and have it not be a complete tire fire.” <em>Dragon Age</em> was not a tire fire.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What was the last major game that didn’t have a troubled development cycle or reboot mid-development or change to accommodate whatever the new trend of the day is in a way that ultimately felt half-baked?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> And <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was tremendously successful.</p><p><strong>Kat: </strong>It was developed by a fully independent studio that was not beholden to a publisher and was able to make it on their own timeline, and when they needed to cut off development and get the thing shipped, they did. And it went longer than they expected it to – considerably longer. But they plotted out their runway, and it ended up working. They were making a game that they wanted to play and not necessarily catering to mainstream audiences. What’s the result?<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> is one of the most successful games of the last couple years.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics"><h3>James Gunn Can’t Stop Making Suicide Squads</h3></a><p>Groups of freaky little guys are the stuff of comic book history, and maybe the future of comic book movies.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/does-elon-musks-gaming-rig-suck-or-not"><h3>I Am Disgusted By Elon Musk’s Gaming Setup</h3></a><p>Watching these streams hurt me but I have to know: is one of the wealthiest men on earth using a mediocre streaming setup?</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since James Gunn became the new boss of DC studios, it feels like he sticks to one formula: everything looks like his Suicide Squad.&nbsp;</p><p>2008, the year of the housing crisis and the subsequent Great Recession, is as good a time of death as any for the fiction of the American Dream. Economic forces manipulated by kleptocrats have completely unbalanced our received wisdom that anyone, regardless of their station and prestige, was afforded the opportunity to rise to success. But you can’t really kill a dream in America; you can only commodify it. That same year, the American Dream was reborn, repurposed, and repackaged by corporate America. Not for people, but for a new promise that any <em>property, </em>afforded the opportunity, could rise to prominence.&nbsp;</p><p>Marvel Studios’ “Avengers Initiative” was a project built from necessity. Facing bankruptcy in the 90s, Stan Lee and pals found themselves selling off the film rights to their most successful characters<em>—</em>Spider-Man, X-Men, the Fantastic Four<em>—</em>just to stay afloat. All they were left with once they had the chance to make a go of it themselves were the B-Stringers: an alcoholic tech bro, an Allied Propaganda mascot, a technically public domain anyway Norse god, a Hulk. To everyone’s multi-billion dollar surprise, they made it work. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They made it work so well that it kind of ruined movies.</a> But, significantly, it defeated the conventional comic book movie wisdom that to make a huge runaway hit, you needed a Superman or a Batman. Maybe you could build your empire on some weird little freak nobody’s even heard of. But how weird, how freaky, can we really get here?</p><figure><figcaption>The Suicide Squad/Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>James Gunn became one of the most successful men in Hollywood today answering that question. Coming up with the proudly sophomoric and sloppy underdogs of Troma Entertainment (think <em>Toxic Avenger</em>), he made his studio bones on a couple pretty decent <em>Scooby-Doo </em>movies, and proved his superhero bona fides on the pitch black Rainn Wilson and Elliot Page comedy <em>Super, </em>which does a better job of being a <em>Watchmen </em>movie than Zack Snyder’s <em>Watchmen</em>. So it was only a matter of time before Marvel Cinematic Universe mastermind Kevin Feige, known so well today for his modus operandi of taking promising, unique independent filmmakers and chaining them like Prometheus to his studio system, tapped him to make something Marvel.&nbsp;</p><p>Feige had been talking in public about adapting the rather obscure ragtag Marvel space heroes, the “Guardians of the Galaxy,” since at least 2010 during that year’s San Diego Comic-Con. Though the team had existed in some form or another since 1969, the version of the team that Feige was interested in—the one we’d see at the movies—was brand new. The Guardians as we know them, Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket Raccoon, didn’t actually exist as a team anywhere until 2008, in a series relaunch by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. No stranger to working as the underdog, it was just the project where James Gunn would thrive.</p><p>How DC got their hand on that ball was a matter of some cancel culture serendipity. During the space between the second and third <em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>movies, <a href="https://deadline.com/2018/07/james-gunn-fired-guardians-of-the-galaxy-disney-offensive-tweets-1202430392/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some outrageously tasteless tweets</a> James Gunn wrote ten years prior resurfaced. Disney, the owners of the Marvel Studios brand since 2009, cut ties with Gunn over it for about a week<em>—</em>just long enough for DC’s own parent company, Warner Bros., to swoop in with their own Guardians-caliber offer. But who were DC’s equivalent to Marvel’s scrappy Guardians of the Galaxy?</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="THE SUICIDE SQUAD – Official Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jz1FrtMIh5c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That was was a puzzle DC had already solved, poorly but accurately, with the Academy Award winning 2016 <em>Suicide Squad </em>(Best Makeup and Hairstyling). The influences Gunn had on what Warner Bros. wanted their Suicide Squad to be were apparent to anyone with eyes, ears, or a short term memory: the needle dropping soundtrack, the gleeful gore, the often puerile comedy. But without Gunn himself, the film had none of the heart, or sense of character. Unlike the Guardians, the Squad as we know them today—give or take a Harley—has existed with its current premise since 1986. And as fortune would have it, they’re even better suited to Feige’s original hail mary casting of the Guardians for unleashing the spigot on that IP-flowing fountain. Because that’s exactly what they were designed for 40 years ago.</p><p>Here’s something I often find myself writing when we’re talking about comics: let’s go back to <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths. </em>In 1985, DC Comics published their first major crossover event to clear the decks on 50 years of crufted up comic book continuity, all to present a less intimidating face to new readers. One benefit of this was, with nearly every character starting over on equal footing, it didn’t just have to be Batman and Superman rising to the fore. There were new opportunities for the thousands of characters starting fresh right alongside them. It was to this end that John Ostrander and Len Wein created a new vehicle to showcase the obscurities of DC’s roster, giving them new cause to get in front of readers’ eyes: a new, Post-Crisis incarnation of the Suicide Squad.</p><figure><figcaption>The Suicide Squad/Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>The original Suicide Squad, a team which appeared in issues of <em>The Brave and the Bold </em>in the late 50s and early 60s, wasn’t much more than a riff on Jack Kirby’s Challengers of the Unknown. But in the 1986 <em>Legends </em>miniseries, setting up much of the early status quo for the Post-Crisis DC Universe, Wein and Ostrander took the concept in an entirely new direction—one which, under the complex, authoritative figure of Amanda Waller, would feature a rotating team of cast-off villains, forgotten heroes, and former supporting characters. Not just the likes of lesser Batman and Flash villains like Deadshot and Captain Boomerang, but heroes like Vixen, whose own solo title was preemptively aborted in a 1978 industry crunch; Bronze Tiger, blaxploitation martial arts sidekick to Dennis O’Neil’s <em>Richard Dragon, Kung-Fu Fighter</em>; Enchantress, a former backup feature to Supergirl; and Nightshade, part of a collection of characters recently acquired from the defunct Charlton Comics which DC sought to integrate into their own Post-Crisis universe.</p><p>The resulting spin-off, 1987’s <em>Suicide Squad, </em>thus became one of the most versatile titles in DC’s catalog. Amanda Waller’s nuanced morality allowed for the team, depending on its roster, to take on missions from either side of the morality spectrum at any level of scale, from quelling small town white nationalists to grappling with the forces of Darkseid on Apokolips. Following in the tradition of the Golden Age Justice Society of America, whose <em>All-Star Comics </em>in the 1940s was functionally a home for heroes to stay in the spotlight without titles to call their own, <em>Suicide Squad </em>literally served as a rehabilitation clinic not just in fiction as sentence-reducing labor for its incarcerated members, but for the images of those characters themselves, elevating what might have once been a C or a D list character as high as a B. As Iron Man—nobody’s favorite superhero before 2008—would prove to the world, a B is really all you need.</p><p>So, James Gunn does <em>The Suicide Squad, </em>a loose sequel to the previous non-definite articled <em>Suicide Squad </em>that doesn’t require you to watch the first film at all. Not a lot of people watched this one either, but most were charitable in affording that to the continued horrors of a deadly pandemic, and HBO Max’s short-sighted year long “Same Day Streaming” policy which had filmmakers none too pleased. Critically, it was the fifth-best reviewed DC film of all time.</p><figure><figcaption>The Suicide Squad/Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>If anything made <em>The Suicide Squad </em>work, it was the massive number of weirdos at play. Some pulled from the deepest benches of DC history, like Javelin and The Weasel; some invented for the story, like The Detachable Kid and Ratcatcher 2. Like the first movie, much of it revolved around Harley Quinn—a character who was at first controversially associated with the Suicide Squad franchise in the 2011 “New 52” comic relaunch, and 14 years later is still more often than not the series star. Unlike the previous film, <em>The Suicide Squad </em>gave emotional arcs to its less prominent players. The likes of Polka-Dot Man, King Shark, and even the generally Squad-ubiquitous but dry-toast-bland Rick Flag all got their own beats that elevated them into new favorites.</p><p>One character, a comic relief turned third act villain, would be the focus of Gunn’s next DC project. John Cena’s Peacemaker was credibly both hilarious and threatening, but we never got to know the man under the helmet like we did the other central members of the team. The legend goes that Gunn spent one week during production of <em>The Suicide Squad </em>banging out a full 8 episode script for a <em>Peacemaker </em>TV show. It was greenlit right away.</p><p>The internet loved <em>Peacemaker</em>, with its <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/peacemaker-dance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modern dance intro</a> and stream-of-consciousness dialogue. But despite the title, Gunn always insisted that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/peacemaker-was-a-comic-book-show-in-all-the-right-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Peacemaker </em>was an ensemble piece</a>. And it was! Just as important as Peacemaker’s own story arc reckoning with his Neo-Nazi father who pushed him into vigilantism is his brilliant supporting cast of Amanda Waller’s estranged daughter, Leota Adebayo; put-upon Belle Reve warden turned problem asset babysitter John Economos; disguised alien agent on the side of humanity, Clemson Murn; James Gunn’s wife, who is fine; and an autistically swagged up incarnation of Marv Wolfman’s Vigilante. James Gunn had created another Suicide Squad.</p><figure><figcaption>The Suicide Squad/Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>In 2022, as we were all still doing the <em>Peacemaker </em>cast’s “Do You Wanna Taste It” dance, Warner Bros. did something extremely rare: they made a good decision. With the future direction of the DC cinematic universe in shambles after power plays from Zack Snyder, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and a seemingly endless cascade of otherwise bad reviews, the corporate leadership turned to the one guy who, if you at least looked at it accepting the outside influence of a pandemic, hadn’t fucked it all up. Along with his established business partner Peter Safran, James Gunn was put in charge of what would now be called “DC Studios.” Where none had really existed before, Gunn and Safran would be DC’s own Kevins Feige.</p><p>James Gunn got to work announcing a full slate of new DC projects. The very first would be an animated series which just wrapped up on HBO Max: <em>Creature Commandos</em>, a series about a team of misfit monsters embarking on a suicide mission for Amanda Waller<em>. </em>It was yet another Suicide Squad. He announced a film adaptation of Warren Ellis and Bryan Hitch’s <em>The Authority, </em>a team of morally ambiguous superhumans who do the things heroes won’t. Another Suicide Squad. Even <em>Superman</em>, the live action film DC has pinned all its hopes on as the ground claimed by superhero movies for a decade gives way to video game movies, is full of weird superheroes: Hawkgirl, Metamorpho, Mister Terrific, and Guy Gardner, the most obnoxious Green Lantern. Anyone familiar with the mythology of the Justice League can recognize what Gunn is doing: setting up his own simulacrum of Keith Giffen and JM DeMatteis’ most irreverent vision of the team, Justice League International, a collective of third-stringers cast in the shadow of the more famous heroes they couldn’t get. That’s right. It’s another Suicide Squad.</p><p>So why does this keep happening? Is it the only move Gunn has? I don’t think so. He’s proven himself a more versatile filmmaker than that. But imagine you’re wagering hundreds of millions of dollars on the success of a film. That’s going to make it difficult to break the mold, and make a risky decision. You’re going to stick with what works until it doesn’t. And so far, at least critically, what seems to work for Gunn is Suicide Squads. We’ll see if that bears out in real dollars, but it’s a better bet than a complete unknown.</p><p>From a creative standpoint, it’s not a bad thing either. The best thing about DC Comics, when it gets out of its own way, is that it’s not actually the Batman and Superman Company. It’s a publishing house filled with strange, imaginative, often contradictory characters and concepts, which really buzzes at its best when you get those A-Listers out of the way. There are 30,000 freaks and weirdos who live together in this universe created by hundreds of creative voices over 90 years of work, and the absurdity of their coexistence compounds that exponentially. This is comics. It’s Suicide Squad.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-layoffs-ea"><h3>BioWare Is In Big Trouble</h3></a><p>"A lot was riding on Dragon Age: The Veilguard"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/does-elon-musks-gaming-rig-suck-or-not"><h3>I Am Disgusted By Elon Musk’s Gaming Setup</h3></a><p>Watching these streams hurt me but I have to know: is one of the wealthiest men on earth using a mediocre streaming setup?</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
