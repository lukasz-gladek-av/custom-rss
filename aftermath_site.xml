      <p>Aftermath remains a humble mom ‘n’ pop ‘n’ two cats operation, but we have grand ambitions. Slowly but surely, we grow more powerful every day. Thanks to your subscriber dollars, for which we’re eternally grateful, we’re now able to welcome two new writers into our regular rotation. You might have heard of them.</p><p>Former (until, you guessed it, layoffs) The Verge reporter Ash Parrish and prolific freelancer Joshua Rivera will soon be contributing to Aftermath on a regular basis! Ash is gonna be blogging one day per week, and Joshua is the monthly columnist <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/"><u>prophesied in our subscriber goals</u></a>. Both have written <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-game-publishers-outersloth-pocketpair/"><u>excellent</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-games-industry/"><u>pieces</u></a> for Aftermath before, if you’d like a sample of what’s to come. We couldn’t be more excited to have them wandering the labyrinthine halls of our headquarters, by which I mean Slack.&nbsp;</p><p>I cannot emphasize enough that your subscriptions made this all possible, just as they did when we brought on Isaiah and Nicole as regular contributors last year. However, in the interest of disclosure, I will now share with you some less thrilling news: Our budget is pretty much tapped! We have <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/"><u>even grander long-term plans</u></a> – for example, hiring people full-time across multiple disciplines (and doing so at a wage that’s actually <em>livable</em>) – but we’ll need a pretty big boost to realize them.&nbsp;</p><p>This is where you come in: Consider <a href="https://aftermath.site/#/portal/"><u>subscribing</u></a> if you haven’t already! Or tell your friends! At 5,000 paying subscribers, there is still ample room for this beautiful baby website to grow. If even a small fraction of the over-100,000 who follow us on social media or who’ve signed up for our free newsletters subscribed tomorrow, we’d be set. As is, we’re doing our best, and regardless of what the future brings, we can promise you that we’ll continue to do so. Further, we recognize that times are tough. Any support you can give – even if that means only an email address – is nonetheless appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’d like to get to know Ash and Joshua better, you can listen to the latest episode of our weekly podcast, <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours/" rel="noreferrer">Aftermath Hours</a>. We discuss our shared histories at Kotaku, as well as current beats and interests (ask Ash about monster fucking). Then we delve into the media landscape at large, which can’t even go a single week without, for example, <a href="https://aftermath.site/washington-post-layoffs-bezos/"><u>The Washington Post laying off hundreds of people</u></a>. Next our light and breezy conversation takes us to Epstein Island thanks to alleged <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"><u>communications with the convicted sex criminal</u></a> from individuals in and around the world of games. Oh, we also talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/resident-evil-requiem-nintendo/"><u>this week’s Nintendo Direct</u></a> and <em>Overwatch</em>, which is <a href="https://aftermath.site/nobody-needs-this-man-were-all-so-tired/"><u>no longer <em>Overwatch 2</em></u></a>, but is also not <em>Overwatch 1</em>.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can eventually <em>buy The Washington Post</em>.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Ash:</strong> Now I have been laid off for the first time in my adult life, and rather than freaking out knowing what the landscape is like – knowing that there’s a very good possibility I will never have a full-time job like the one I left again – I’m not really that worried about it. I’m fighting against things I can’t control, so I’m gonna do the things that are within my control. I know my work is good; people wouldn’t ask me for it if it wasn’t. So I have to find more of those people, and I think I’m gonna have to at least try to see if I have the strength to continue that. We’ll see.</p><p>It’s not good advice [to other writers who might be struggling]. You can’t eat that kind of advice. You can’t eat hope. Because it’s really cliche when people ask you “How do you do this when it’s all so bad?” and I’m like “You just have to keep doing it and hope.” That has to be your main fuel, because it’s not gonna come from anywhere else because it is so damn bleak. And if you don’t got it, you don’t got it. That’s fine. It sucks because that’s not really actionable. You just have to have it. But it is what it is. I hate saying that shit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Next Aftermath subscriber goal: a machine that dispenses edible hope.&nbsp;</p><p>Josh, what about you considering that you’ve been in the freelance realm for a while longer and have had to hop between those ice floes more regularly? What does that actually look like for you?</p><p><strong>Joshua:</strong> It’s tough. When I left Polygon about a year and a half ago, it wasn’t quite starting over, but it felt a little bit like that. I was at Polygon three-ish, almost four years. Even that stretch of time, it felt like the scene had changed entirely. Even now, I feel like I’m figuring it out every day. I feel like quitting every day! It’s very much like Goku training at 100x gravity.</p><p>But I don’t know. For me it’s a sense of malcontent; I have this restless itch to say something – to figure things out and put out work that means something to people. That helps them understand the world and the things they engage with a little better. This feeling of being useful and being responsible with the platforms that I have in the time that I have them.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t know how much longer that is. We’re seeing institutions collapse all around us, and we can only respond so quickly. Like, Aftermath has been growing to the point that y’all could bring me on for a monthly column, but to replace some of the outlets that we’re losing is gonna take a lot of work and time and investment. Every day I’m pretty conscious of the fact that I could be out of the game tomorrow, so what should I say today while I can? That’s kind of what I think about.</p><p>Which makes it sound like my work is a little more serious than it is. Sometimes I do find the value of being a fucking goober – and not letting them beat that out of me.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-game-publishers-outersloth-pocketpair/"><div><p>Meet The Unconventional Publishers Trying To Unfuck The Games Industry</p><p>Developers turned publishers like Innersloth and Pocketpair are leveraging their success to help other indie games thrive.</p><p><span>Ash Parrish</span></p></div></a></figure>

      <p>The PS1 was an unrivaled time for soundtracks that go incredibly hard. Games like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurhMeaUThM&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Ridge Racer Type 4</u></em></a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://youtu.be/CuOd_mTABn8?si=plEy7cxdS7K60IZX&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>No One Can Stop Mr. Domino</u></em></a>, <em>Ape Escape</em> (and basically anything that Soichi Terada ever did), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S5ZpFWA16g&amp;list=PLDD61C76EF278E530&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Ace Combat 3 Electrosphere</u></em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9avhp8QuAlk&amp;list=PLF8A81FAC049FB959&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Ghost in the Shell: Megatech Body</u></em></a> all punch well above their weight. Hell, even the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seanseanson.bsky.social/post/3me56ggnr222z?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Animorphs</u></a> game kinda goes. In that vein, if you have never listened to the soundtrack to <em>Sheep, Dog 'n' Wolf </em>AKA<em> Looney Tunes Sheep Raider</em>, you should correct that right now because it contains at least one incredible heater.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wwidcxa3fmY?list=PL8D92393BACD4F09D" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption><p><span>Banger.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><em>Sheep, Dog ‘n' Wolf </em>was a bizarre celshaded stealth action puzzler that came out in 2001 starring Ralph Wolf (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Wolf_and_Sam_Sheepdog?ref=aftermath.site"><u>NOT Wile E. Coyote</u></a>) and described at the time by Infogrames’ Director of Marketing as “E-Rated Metal Gear.” The soundtrack was done by a musician named Eric Caspar, and though a lot of it feels like boilerplate production music, it does have bangers.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Game Informer gave it a 7.25!

It is unclear what this track is called or if it has a name, although I have seen a few sites like KHInsider and Discogs cite it as “<a href="https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/sheep-dog-n-wolf-original-soundtrack?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Fronzy Last</u></a>/Fronzylast_v3.” The track itself appears in the Planet X stage later in the game, which you can see by watching this speedrun attempt.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4usCfvJrSJk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Sheep, Dog 'n' Wolf (Sheep Raider) — Any% Speedrun in 35:00 [Former World Record]"></iframe></figure><p>Anyway, enjoy this oddly specific track that keeps appearing in my YouTube suggested feed.

            <title><![CDATA[Epic Clarifies That, No, Jeffrey Epstein Is Not Still Alive And Playing Fortnite In Tel Aviv]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>This week, a peculiar rumor picked up steam: Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced sex trafficker with <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"><u>connections</u></a> to a plethora of the world’s most powerful men, is still alive. Why? It appears that a <em>Fortnite </em>account believed to be his was <a href="https://x.com/DissidentMedia/status/2019520779550122024?ref=aftermath.site"><u>online as recently as last year</u></a>. Today, because we live in a world gone mad, an official Epic account let conspiracy-addled X The Everything App users know that, no, this is not the case.</p><p>"This was a ruse by a <em>Fortnite </em>player,” <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2019817972831780952?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>said the official Fortnite Status account</u></a> in response to a since-deleted tweet echoing the conspiracy theory. “A few days ago, an existing <em>Fortnite </em>account owner changed their username from something totally unrelated to littlestjeff1, following the revelation of littlestjeff1 as a name on YouTube. These Fortnite trackers only display your current name, not any prior changes to it."</p><p>“Littlestjeff1” is a handle that appears over 20 times in the Epstein files, albeit largely <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00629064.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>in association with Epstein’s YouTube account</u></a>. Additionally, at one point in 2019 Epstein appears to have <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02286126.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>purchased</u></a> $25 worth of <em>Fortnite </em>V-Bucks. This, plus an Israeli flag next to a correspondingly named player’s profile pic on unofficial <em>Fortnite </em>stat site <a href="https://fortnitetracker.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Fortnite Tracker</u></a>, was enough to convince many that Epstein was alive, well, and farming victory royales in Tel Aviv – confirming, in their minds, heaps of other rumors that Epstein never actually died. (Officially, Epstein <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Jeffrey_Epstein?ref=aftermath.site"><u>died by suicide in 2019</u></a>. Unofficially, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/flash-orange-caught-video-sparks-161703143.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALyLP-k-f8z1fQKIAqK6Qn6GIqwI_0c3p7frrz64laYitqq04Lzklf2h9fArvxMvMEEJhSk8OEsXL_PZAdZGH-RretfZoznN5kdmFCPZFS8_3iUb7VJs9nM_gPICtCElS9HeqMGK2AU8BicZPBj0W-SB7fzkyJLws3p4vGFfTQde&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>well…</u></a>)&nbsp;</p><p>“We have no record of the subject's email addresses referenced in the public document existing in the Epic account system,” the Fortnite Status account added. “Since the public document releases, people have created <em>Fortnite </em>accounts with similar-looking email addresses and user names.”</p><p>Epic CEO and <a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-x-ai-csam-epic-games-fortnite/"><u>prolific poster</u></a> Tim Sweeney also weighed in.</p><p>“Someone's been having fun renaming their <em>Fortnite </em>account,” he <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2019819940753379740?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>wrote</u></a>, “but it's recent and not connected to the email addresses in the archive.”</p><p>Extremely cool living in a society where public trust has eroded to the point that an official account of a video game for kids needs to wash its hands of a mess made by the massively corrupt oligarchy. Fortunately, this is absolutely the last time something like this will happen. Surely nothing weirder or stupider will happen next week, and the week after that, and the week after that, and the week after that, and the week after that, and–</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-friday-connoreatspants-interview-gavin-newsom/"><div><p>How Fortnite Friday Grew From A Bit Into An Institution That Could Pull Gavin Newsom</p><p>The unlikely rise of one of the internet’s best talk shows</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>
