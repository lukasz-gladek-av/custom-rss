      <p>The Steam Machine was <em>supposed </em>to be out pretty soon, along with the Steam Controller and Steam Frame, but Valve announced today that not only has all this hardware's release been delayed, but that it'll probably be more expensive whenever it comes out, too.</p><p>The announcement<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>reads</u></a>:</p><blockquote>When we announced these products in November, we planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now. But the memory and storage shortages you've likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then.&nbsp; The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).</blockquote><blockquote>Our goal of shipping all three products in the first half of the year has not changed. But we have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce, being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of those things can change. We will keep you updated as much as we can as we finalize those plans as soon as possible.</blockquote><p>Those "memory and storage shortages", if you <em>haven't </em>heard about them, are a result of AI data centre usage--or, not even usage, but <em>planned </em>usage--fucking with global production and supply chains so much that the cost of everything from SSDs to RAM has shot through the <em>roof</em>.</p><figure><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/ram-and-storage-is-ridiculously-expensive-right-now-because-of-drumroll-ai-of-course-and-theres-little-reason-to-think-prices-will-drop-any-time-soon/?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Here’s why RAM prices are skyrocketing and SSDs and GPUs could soon follow suit</p><p>The answer: AI of course.</p><p><span>Jacob Fox</span></p></div></a></figure><p>This news has moved me from "maybe computer use should be regulated" to "Butlerian Jihad Now" on the radicalisation scale.</p>

      <p>As you may have seen, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-ditching-the-2-amid-launch-of-new-story-driven-era-with-10-new-heroes?ref=aftermath.site"><u>there was some big <em>Overwatch </em>news today</u></a>, including the reveal of a bunch of new characters and <em>Overwatch 2</em> dropping the "2" from its title.</p><p>What you might not have seen was that IGN accidentally leaked a bunch of that news by accidentally publishing a story early,<a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-an-faq/"> <u>ahead of its agreed embargo time</u></a>. It's catastrophic for marketing teams when that happens, so I understand they'd be pretty annoyed, but it also happens sometimes, because games writers are human and humans make mistakes. This isn't the first time an embargo has accidentally been broken, and it won't be the last.</p><p>As annoyed as the <em>Overwatch </em>team would have been, though, was this tweet (below) from an account with 3.3 million followers (who knows how many are real or left these days, though) really necessary? Calling out the publication by name--a name that acts as a flame to every shit-brained moth still using Twitter and frothing at the mouth over video game <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-anime-review-score-discourse/"><u>review</u></a> scores--is not a great look for <em>Overwatch's</em> social team, but throwing in a slogan from an authoritarian regime for good measure makes it much, much worse.</p><figure></figure><p>It should be noted that as part of the big announcements today the <em>Overwatch </em>Twitter account says it has been taken over by Talon, the game's villains, so this could have been an attempt at an in-universe joke that didn't even land at all, let alone land badly. But only a few other posts have tried to be "in-character", and they were all just harmless cartoon villain stuff, not...using a Trump slogan to call out a website that gamers on the platform owned by a white supremacist love to hate.</p><p>I get it, spoiling a big day of news must have sucked! But there are more productive ways of dealing with that than punching down at someone who made a mistake.</p>
