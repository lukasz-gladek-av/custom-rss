            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dungeon-synth-ambient-magic-fantasy-tolkein-medieval<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At three in the morning on Sunday night, there was a partial solar eclipse in Aries, and then a day later, Neptune entered Aries for the first time in 150 years. As the stars enter Aries, a sign of decisive action, I am preparing myself to take greater charge of my own destiny. That Sunday night, before these transits started, I found myself in the back room of a bar in Ridgewood, wearing elf ears and bobbing my head to the sounds of a synthesized glockenspiel.</p><p>Dungeon synth is a small but enthusiastic micro genre of ambient synth music that I stumbled onto through a quirk of the YouTube algorithm. I had been listening to a cover of “Birds of a Feather” by Billie Eillish re-imagined as a song by a medieval bard when the next video, a dungeon synth song, transported me even further into fantasy. I described it to my friend who attended this show with me as sounding like medieval chamber music filtered through an aged 90s VHS tape. It is often video game adjacent—the headliner was a band called Quest Master—but just as often the music references the stories of King Arthur, witchcraft, and especially the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. All the musical acts that performed on Sunday night did so with a sense of ritual: no stage banter, no introductions, just poring over their synthesizers, surrounded by fog and electric candles, and then disappearing into the dead of night.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Source: Gita Jackson</figcaption></figure><p>Most of the acts had some level of props or visual component to their set. <a href="https://steamingwoodlands.bandcamp.com/album/the-melancholic-eons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steaming Woodlands</a> appeared on a sparse stage, with electric candelabras on the table next to his synthesizers. <a href="https://malfet.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Malfet</a> wore a hooded cloak and walked onto the stage jangling bells tied to a rope, and later rang a singing bowl; he played his entire set in front of a video collage combining images of forest nature with images of witches and Arthurian myth. I distinctly remember watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady_of_Shalott_(painting)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">J.M. Waterhouse’s painting <em>The Lady of Shalott</em></a><em> </em>emerge from a recording of a fairy ring as I let the music envelop me.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://fief.bandcamp.com/album/moonbeams-in-the-vestibule-b-w-portcullis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fief</a>, wearing chainmail over his shoulders and aviator sunglasses, played in a corner of the venue, creating a tavern-like atmosphere. As his synthesized glockenspiel broke out into a jaunty tune, the whole venue stomped in rhythm to the beat. <a href="https://questmaster.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quest Master</a> was loud, each new beat flowing into the next like a stream threatening to carry me away, the bass reverberated throughout my body, a video playing behind him that soared through waterfalls and mountains as I succumbed to a kind of trance.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Malfet - Northeast Dungeon Siege MMXXI" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fV2K8DEEzyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Just like the <a href="https://www.chani.com/blogs/your-guide-to-neptune-in-aries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transit of Neptune from Pisces into Aries</a>, this night felt transformative for me. TV Eye, the venue where these groups all played, is a small venue in Ridgewood, Queens that was absolutely packed to the brim with people just as enthusiastic about listening to medieval bangers as I was. Many of them were also in costume. I met a fan dressed in a chainmail hood, with a sword strapped to his back and a dead orc’s head made of plastic hanging from a rope on his belt. As the night went on, more and more people wearing chainmail and flower crowns joined the crowd. I was wearing elf ears for the very first time, and as I walked out of the bathroom a fellow patron complimented them. I hadn’t been to a show this intimate and packed since before 2020, when going to a small concert at a bar became a life-threatening activity.</p><p><a href="https://dungeon-synth.neocities.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dungeon synth isn’t a new genre</a>—it’s an offshoot from black metal with some of the earliest recordings dating back to the 90s—but it has grown significantly in the past few years. At the same time as the show in Ridgewood, there was a small dungeon synth festival occurring in Massachusetts called <a href="https://northeastdungeonsiege.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Northeast Dungeon Siege</a>. The two headlining groups, Fief and Quest Master, had played a set at that festival earlier that day. This summer there will be another <a href="https://texasdungeonsynth.com/pages/texas-dungeon-siege" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dungeon synth festival in Texas</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>My friend Ryan, who attended the show wearing a newly purchased cloak, told me that last year he had seen Quest Master and only one person dressed up. While those of us dressed as <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> party members were in the minority, there was a sense in the venue this year that yes, this was an acceptable place to bring out your Renaissance Faire wardrobe. I described it as “LARPing, but for people who fuck,” which was mostly a joke. But there did appear to be a spirit of magic and renewal in the room with us as the bands played. Ryan, just before the lights dimmed and Fief began playing, also called the genre “black metal, but for people who believe in magic.”</p><figure><figcaption>Source: Gita Jackson</figcaption></figure><p>The juxtaposition of synthesizers and bardic melodies suggest <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/whose-fantasy-is-this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not a return to an imaginary past</a>, but a new age of myth and magic. It’s the same feeling I get when I see the way that <em>Elden Ring</em> reframes Celtic mythology through the lens of a Japanese role playing game. Unlike the way that fascists reclaim the story of King Arthur and pre-Christian mysticism, dungeon synth does not—cannot—pretend that this is a pure place of tradition that we are coming back to. This is a newer form of witchcraft, one that makes room for the ways that technology can give us new forms of connection and understanding. One of the people I met on Sunday shared my story of stumbling across dungeon synth music through the YouTube algorithm. It also turned out that he’d responded to a post on Reddit about <a href="https://theticketing.co/e/dungeonsynth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an upcoming dungeon synth show in a converted church</a> that a friend of a friend is putting on.</p><p>Supposedly, the transit of the planet Neptune into Aries from Pisces will feel like waking from a collective dream. The last time this happened, America broke out into the Civil War, a conflict that has not truly been resolved. Dungeon synth is a genre that exploded under the dreaminess of Neptune in Pisces—unsurprisingly, a lot of people decided to fiddle around with synthesizers during the global COVID-19 pandemic. But Aries brings these dreams into reality, takes them from the ephemeral space of the internet and into the flesh. Wearing my elf ears and my cardigan adorned with mushrooms, I let this music transport me into a new era—one not marked by my fear of the past but by my eagerness for the future.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-awards-deck-nine-laid-off-developers-life-is-strange-double-exposure"><h3>Deck Nine Takes Back GDC Award From Laid-Off Devs After Failing To Send Anyone To Accept It</h3></a><p>"I keep thinking about all of the opportunities that were denied to us because of our exclusion"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-voice-actor-strike-genshin-impact-destiny-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been eight months since video game voice actors and performers represented by SAG-AFTRA went on strike. While they’ve picked up some big wins – over 170 games signed to interim agreements that honor the terms SAG-AFTRA has brought to the bargaining table – major video game companies refuse to budge on the issue of AI. The reverberations are becoming harder to ignore: In March alone, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/diabolical-genshin-impacts-english-cast-gives-new-vo-the-cold-shoulder-after-he-frames-replacing-a-striking-actor-as-an-opportunity-to-carry-the-flame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one striking <em>Genshin Impact</em> actor</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/538170/zenless-zoice-zero-voice" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> actors</a> were replaced. Characters in other games like<em> Destiny 2</em> have <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/519589/sag-aftra-video-game-actors-strike-ai-protections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gone silent</a>. This costly stalemate is the reason why SAG-AFTRA has taken the risky step of <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/IMA%20Comparison%20Chart.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishing portions of proposed contracts</a> that usually remain under wraps.</p><p>In March, SAG-AFTRA posted a comparison chart of AI-related proposals to its website and social media, contrasting specific language between the union and employers and explaining why they feel employers’ offer remains insufficient. </p><p>"[Game companies] want to use all past performances and any performance they can source from outside the contract without any of the protections being bargained at all,” SAG-AFTRA national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland and interactive media negotiating chair Sarah Elmaleh wrote in <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/member-message-video-game-strike-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a strike update</a> that ran alongside the contract comparison. “[Performers] could be told nothing about your replica being used, offered nothing in the way of payment, and you could do nothing about it. They want to be able to make your replica continue to work, as you, during a future strike, whether you like it or not. And once you’ve given your specific consent for how your replica can be used, they refuse to tell you what they actually did with it."</p><p>A representative for the companies bargaining with SAG-AFTRA disputed these claims to Aftermath.</p><p>“We have proposed a deal that includes wage increases of over 15% for SAG-AFTRA represented performers in video games, as well as enhanced health and safety protections, industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor’s performance in other games,” the representative said. “We have made meaningful progress and are eager to return to the bargaining table to reach a deal.”&nbsp;</p><p>A SAG-AFTRA representative acknowledged that companies presented an updated proposal last week, but declined to comment further as “we are evaluating the recent response.”</p><p>Zeke Alton, a video game voice actor and SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee member, told Aftermath during an interview at GDC that publishing specific terms from proposed contracts was risky, but union members felt they had no other choice after functionally being stonewalled by a group of companies that includes Activision Blizzard, Disney Character Voices, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, and WB Games.</p><p>"We set bargaining rules before we sit down in every different genre that we bargain," Alton said. "One thing we use as a standard is a press blackout, and what that means is that we don't try to litigate things outside the room. … Now we're taking more and more progressive steps to help the industry at large understand that we are not being unreasonable. If you look at the ink on the paper, we have been more than reasonable. What it points out is, those companies are not right now. And so the fans, the actors, the performers, the stunts, the general public all need to look at these companies and ask 'Why is this not OK with you select few when it's OK for everyone else? Why are you holding up this industry and costing everybody money and time?'”</p><p>While some actors – like the aforementioned Hoyoverse regulars – have taken to striking in solidarity even though the option existed to continue lending their voices to characters, others are itching to get back to work. This has resulted in frustration with companies and, in some cases, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/diabolical-genshin-impacts-english-cast-gives-new-vo-the-cold-shoulder-after-he-frames-replacing-a-striking-actor-as-an-opportunity-to-carry-the-flame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also with other voice actors</a> in situations that resemble scabbing but skirt just outside the technical definition. Elmaleh is not discouraged by these developments, however. She sees them as a sign that striking actors and performers have real leverage – and that companies can’t hold out forever.</p><p>"I feel very dearly the pain of the month-by-month, day-by-day impact that has on membership, but I always expected our leverage and our pressure to start to hit after a few months,” Elmaleh told Aftermath. “Games are not like other mediums; when you stop recording actors on a film set, you are not producing films. [On games] you can shuffle [elements] of a production around, but I think all that shuffling is wearing out. I think now is exactly when our pressure is starting to really kick in. I know this timeline is difficult, frustrating, and confusing, but I think this is the reality of the space that we're in, and I'm optimistic."</p><p>Alton added that he feels emboldened when he sees non-union actors set down their mics and pick up picket signs.</p><p>“[<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>] is a non-union game,” Alton said. "And what it makes me think is that the community of performers now understands what's at risk. This is not a union fight; it's an actors' fight. ... When we see non-union properties coming out without voice in them because they're not able to cast, because the actors are standing up and going 'No, I need my rights,' that gives me optimism. Because as time goes on, the fans don't want a bad product, and that incentivizes the business to make the right business decision.”</p><p>Recent events like <a href="https://aftermath.site/playstation-ai-aloy-horizon-talk-character" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony's bizarre internal test</a> of an AI-powered version of <em>Horizon </em>main character Aloy have provided voice actors with even more motivation to keep pushing for better protections.</p><p>"We've been told in the bargaining room 'Oh, we're not doing that,'" said Alton in reference to AI Aloy. "But sometimes [companies] are so brazen, it's amazing. Like, yeah, you are doing it. There you are doing it. We're not telling you you can't. We're telling you that the right of publicity of actors, citizens in general, is important, and so it's not going to break your company to get the actors' OK to do that -- get their consent, compensate them fairly, and be transparent."</p><p>While it might be cold comfort to voice actors who are struggling to find work or are having to take on odd jobs as the strike rages on, the interim agreement – as well as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-issues-new-agreements-to-permit-members-to-work-with-students-and-game-jams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new exception for student games and game jams</a> – has ensured that a not-insignificant number of doors remain open. In a bitterly comedic twist, Alton was even able to work on a game licensed out to another studio by WB, a company whose games division refuses to agree to SAG-AFTRA’s terms.</p><p>"I am the Green Lantern in <em>DC: Dark Legion</em>, which is a Warner Bros licensed property that is on the interim agreement," he said. "I'm really proud to have been on that game and worked on that game for a long time. Again, it's evidence that anyone can sign this. It's completely reasonable. What we don't understand is why, on the other side of the table, all we're hearing is 'No,' and we're not hearing why. We want to have that conversation so we can get to 'Yes.'"</p><p>Elmaleh, too, is eager to get back in the voice acting booth.</p><p>"I love my job! I would love to get back to doing that,” she said. “All we're trying to do is get a fair enough contract made for 160,000 members to feel safe enough to let them explore this technology and figure out how we should progress."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dungeon-synth-ambient-magic-fantasy-tolkein-medieval"><h3>I Found A New Age Of Magic At A Dungeon Synth Show In Queens</h3></a><p>Dungeon synth isn't a return to an imagined past, but a vibrant vision of the future.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-awards-deck-nine-laid-off-developers-life-is-strange-double-exposure"><h3>Deck Nine Takes Back GDC Award From Laid-Off Devs After Failing To Send Anyone To Accept It</h3></a><p>"I keep thinking about all of the opportunities that were denied to us because of our exclusion"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
