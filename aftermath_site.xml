            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702170/Strange_Jigsaws/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Strange Jigsaws'</em></a><em> </em>description is simple: It's a game of strange jigsaws where you solve strange jigsaws. I started playing it recently after seeing <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hownottodraw.bsky.social/post/3m4gmqikclc2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some posts</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m4qamjr7n22h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about it</a> on social media. Created by <em>20 Small Mazes</em> puzzle master FLEB, <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> has about 50 or so puzzles—not necessarily <em>all</em> jigsaw puzzles, but using jigsaw pieces. It opens right into the chaos: "Solve jigsaws. Find the golden pieces. Open the door."&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>Designer FLEB opens <em>Strange Jigsaw</em> with a chaotic mess of multiple jigsaw puzzles, signaling that this game is more than just a puzzle simulator. Pieces are everywhere, and it's prudent just to start moving pieces around to test out what they do. Among the first few puzzles, I'm to put pieces together to power a magnet and a computer, respectively, which opens up <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> puzzles even further. Then, trouble! A puzzle is on fire, and <em>Tetris</em>-shaped blocks of water are the only thing that can put them out. On the newly-powered computer, more puzzles: A clever captcha-inspired puzzle game, then a burger-building logic puzzle that reminded me of <a href="https://aftermath.site/is-this-seat-taken-impressions-indie-direct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Is This Seat Taken?</em></a><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><figure></figure><p>There are jigsaws that are highly meta, using pathways controlled by <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>' menu systems. There are darling puzzles illustrated by the designer's seven-year-old daughter, puzzles with missing pieces that must be recolored using a paint fill tool, puzzles that need a screwdriver to solve. <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> is expertly designed, but what makes it truly fantastic is the earnest playfulness of it all: FLEB loves puzzles, and that's obvious. He writes in <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>' Steam description that this game is harder than his last, <em>20 Small Puzzles</em>, and that may be true—but the puzzles here don't feel cruelly hard. Some are hard, but designed in a way to make them feel doable and intentional. I might not understand a puzzle now, but the game reassures me that I will be able to, later.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>There are so many moments in <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> that I want to talk to you about, but unfortunately for me, the person writing about this game, talking about them will sully the experience for you. <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> is just $5, so I urge you simply to try it out yourself. But if you need a taste of what designer FLEB is out, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2570630/20_Small_Mazes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>20 Small Mazes </em>is free</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Or, you can look to YouTube: The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FLEBpuzzles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designer FLEB has a YouTube channel</a> in which he talks about his games and others. It's just as delightful as his games. His recent videos include a retrospective on <em>20 Small Mazes</em> and a newly designed puzzle called <em>Touching Grass</em>, which is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmndrQW5AmA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naturally built out of grass</a>. Over the past 10 years—with a seven year break somewhere in there—FLEB has made videos about all sorts of different puzzles. If this doesn't convince you that FLEB knows puzzles, I don't know what will.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-telltale-games-adhoc-studio"><h3>Dispatch Brings Back The Halcyon  Era Of Online Water Cooler Talk</h3></a><p>Adhoc Studio’s superhero choose-your-own-adventure feels like a fun hole-in-the-wall, word-of-mouth-recommended spot that the gaming communities haven’t had in a minute</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor-election"><h3>Mamdani Won, And Also Cuomo Lost</h3></a><p>Mamdani can't solve all our problems, but at least he solved the problem of having to talk about Andrew Cuomo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kodansha-studios-akira-anime-live-ation-chloe-zhao-nicolas-gonda"><h3>Somehow, The Threat Of A Live-Action Akira Refuses To Die</h3></a><p>If there is any anime that could be considered Hollywood’s Moby Dick, it is Akira</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/solve-these-strange-jigsaws-steam-puzzle-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We did it. Against all odds (our profound lack of business acumen), we made it to our second anniversary, which is today, <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-a-leftist-meme-account-accidentally-fooled-everyone-into-believing-a-famous-quote-came-from-final-fantasy-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the dot</a>. We’ll have more – MUCH more – for you next week, but for now, let’s all reminisce about the highs and lows of our first two years (out of a planned infinity).&nbsp;</p><p>On the latest Aftermath Hours, the whole gang – Gita, Chris, Riley, Luke, Isaiah, Nicole, and I – gathers to celebrate Aftermath’s two-year anniversary. We begin by announcing that we’re relaunching the site next week, but not with all the bullshit bells and whistles you’ve come to expect from this sort of thing. Instead, it’ll still be the simple, streamlined Aftermath you’ve come to know and love, but sleeker, more professional, and easier to use. We’re very excited for you all to try it out!&nbsp;</p><p>We then move on to a discussion of how far the site and the underlying business have come, as well as our proudest accomplishments and our hopes and dreams for the future. We want to hire more people and make space for fresh voices, and while that was a pipe dream when we first launched, we’re now tantalizingly on the cusp. Year three, ideally, is when it all happens. Thanks for sticking with us. We wouldn’t – and literally couldn’t – be here without you.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can expand the Aftermath empire until it includes 1,000 overlapping podcasts, at least 500 of them hosted by Riley, who absolutely loves podcasts.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nicole: </strong>We got an email, and Riley shared it with the group. It was about two different stories that I had written. A student wanted to write about a serious one that I had written about <a href="https://aftermath.site/candy-crush-saga-lawsuit-alleged-scam-tournament-king" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lawsuit concerning a <em>Candy Crush</em> scam</a>, and they were like “But my teacher says it has to be from a legitimate website, so can you guys not write about anything weird, like a breast milk river,” which was <a href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-sound-design-maxi-boch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the headline of a story</a> from an interview that I’d previously done. What other site would get that email?</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>“Don’t be weird or horny until this time and date.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>They specifically requested a time. They were like “OK, you can return to publishing those sorts of stories after this point in the day.” I think it was 4:30 PM or something? But until then, no weird shit or horny shit!</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Riley followed up to make sure it went OK.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>They were very kind about it, and it went well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nicole: </strong>It went well. It was allowed.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> They were so lovely about it. I think at other sites, you’d get a mean, harassing email. But this was just so kind and lovely.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> It was so kind and sweet, and it was because they wanted to show the professor that we are a reputable outlet. They just weren’t sure how the professor would take things like breast milk rivers. I was like “You know what? Thank you for doing us this favor for one day. Now your professor will accept us as a source. It’s good for us, good for you.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>It must also be noted that that professor is definitely a coward. They see a breast milk river and think “Oh, they’re not serious?” No, we’re very serious. We just so happen to be serious about many things, including breast milk rivers. That’s fine.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> That was a serious article, too! It was real journalism. You deserve a Pulitzer Prize.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/solve-these-strange-jigsaws-steam-puzzle-games"><h3>Solve These Strange Jigsaws</h3></a><p>From puzzle maker FLEB, Strange Jigsaws is one of my favorite games this year</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-telltale-games-adhoc-studio"><h3>Dispatch Brings Back The Halcyon  Era Of Online Water Cooler Talk</h3></a><p>Adhoc Studio’s superhero choose-your-own-adventure feels like a fun hole-in-the-wall, word-of-mouth-recommended spot that the gaming communities haven’t had in a minute</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor-election"><h3>Mamdani Won, And Also Cuomo Lost</h3></a><p>Mamdani can't solve all our problems, but at least he solved the problem of having to talk about Andrew Cuomo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kodansha-studios-akira-anime-live-ation-chloe-zhao-nicolas-gonda"><h3>Somehow, The Threat Of A Live-Action Akira Refuses To Die</h3></a><p>If there is any anime that could be considered Hollywood’s Moby Dick, it is Akira</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-second-anniversary-special]]></content:encoded>
