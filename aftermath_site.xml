            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/mika-witchs-mountain-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was idly thumbing through my Bluesky feed last week when I saw someone mention a game they described as "<em>Kiki's Delivery Service</em> meets <em>Wind Waker</em>". I don't know if I've ever rushed to install a game faster.</p><p>Turns out the game, <em>Mika And The Witch's Mountain</em>, is <em>fantastic</em>. You play as a young witch seemingly going to a school situated at the top of a mountain, but nope, about two minutes into proceedings you're cast down to the town below, broom snapped in two. You're stuck there working as a courier until you're able to afford a fancy enough broom to get you back to the top.</p><p>The whole game is built around being a courier, flying your magic broom around delivering stuff for people, and so for the whole game you're doing little else but running errands. </p><p>Imagine some of the worst parts of <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>--take this thing here, only do it carefully, but also do it <em>quickly</em>--and that's <em>Mika</em>. But it's OK! Because here those delivery-based challenges are neither tedious nor stressful; the timers are generous, the damage limits manageable, and the packages are just an excuse to get you flying around a beautiful tropical island meeting everyone who lives there and learning all about their stories.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Mika and the Witch's Mountain - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FYeMFMlwLJI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It's the meeting that's ultimately what's important. Everyone here has a story to tell, and they're all lovely little stories: some about spoiled kids with a struggling dad, others about the perils of licking the boots of a shit-heeled capitalist. What's more, helping everyone out all the time gives <em>Mika </em>such a wonderful <em>energy </em>to it; all you're ever doing is helping people, and that just makes you feel better every time you play it.</p><p>I've said it before but I'll say it again:<a href="https://aftermath.site/caravan-sandwitch-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I love a small sandbox more than almost anything else in video games</a>. The island in <em>Mika </em>isn't very big, so it won't be long before you meet everyone and visit every location at least once. But that's great; it really helps the communal feel of the game that you grow to know every square inch of the place and everyone living on it.</p><p>Finally, I want to point out how charming the whole thing is. It has some wonderful animated cutscenes (including a lengthy, must-see outro), some crisp, airy visuals that are, yes, very <em>Wind Waker</em>, and a soundtrack that's the perfect accompaniment to an afternoon spent catching some sea breeze on a witch's broom.</p><p><em>Mika And The Witch's Mountain</em> is out now on PC, Switch, PlayStation and Xbox.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tell-me-about-your-favorite-niche-simulator"><h3>Tell Me About Your Favorite Niche Simulator</h3></a><p>There is still some joy in this world, probably</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-layoffs-ea"><h3>BioWare Is In Big Trouble</h3></a><p>"A lot was riding on Dragon Age: The Veilguard"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/does-elon-musks-gaming-rig-suck-or-not"><h3>I Am Disgusted By Elon Musk’s Gaming Setup</h3></a><p>Watching these streams hurt me but I have to know: is one of the wealthiest men on earth using a mediocre streaming setup?</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
