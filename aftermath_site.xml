            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-the-veilguard-electronic-arts-sales-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While <em>Dragon Age</em>: <em>The Veilguard</em> has its fans, it's not a scalding take to say that the latest--and likely final for a very long time--entry in the series did not hit like it was supposed to. And while everyone has had six months to try to pin the blame on someone or something, from writing to *spooky voice* diversity,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/inside-the-dragon-age-debacle-that-gutted-ea-s-bioware-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a new report on Bloomberg<em> </em>points the finger</a> at a familiar culprit: gross mismanagement from upstairs.</p><p>In news that will shock absolutely nobody, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier says that <em>Veilguard </em>began life as a singleplayer RPG, was then transformed into an online multiplayer title once EA's leadership saw the kind of money games like <em>Destiny</em> were making (despite Bioware already working on <em>Anthem</em>!) and then, when <em>Anthem </em>tanked, it became a singleplayer RPG once more.</p><p>That's disastrous, reactionary management, which even at the best of times would have resulted in enormous costs as teams rotated through staff and rebuilt systems. These weren't the best of times:</p><blockquote><p>In theory, the reversion back to&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>’s tried-and-true, single-player format should have been welcome news inside BioWare. But there was a catch. Typically, this kind of pivot would be coupled with a reset and a period of pre-production allowing the designers to formulate a new vision for the game. Instead, the team was asked to change the game’s fundamental structure and recast the entire story on the fly, according to people familiar with the new marching orders. They were given a year and a half to finish and told to aim for as wide a market as possible.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Compounding the game's woes were internal politics between the <em>Dragon Age </em>and <em>Mass Effect</em> teams (the latter were brought on to assist in the final months), strict limitations placed on the singleplayer game's structure because of its multiplayer roots and some emergency rewrites that led to huge tonal inconsistencies throughout the game.</p><p>It's a miracle the game came out at all. Beset by so many problems, it's easy to say the game was simply in development hell, but it's a hell of EA's making: The publisher bought Bioware in 2009 because the studio could make hit RPGs, yet under EA's leadership there hasn't been a smash Bioware game in over a <em>decade</em>. And with decisions like these impacting the teams--every hurdle the game's final iteration had to overcome was a result of EA's earlier strategic blunders--it's no wonder <em>Veilguard</em> couldn't buck that trend.</p><p>Here's an idea, EA:<a href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-layoffs-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> whatever is left of Bioware, a studio famous for singleplayer RPGs</a>, maybe just leave them alone and let them make a singleplayer RPG in peace.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-lost-save-game-pass"><h3>My Lies Of P Save File Is Dead And I Am Full Of Regret</h3></a><p>I love Lies of P, but trying to play Lies of P: Overture became a cautionary tale about Game Pass and personal data archiving.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several minutes into <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a></em>, the leader of the kingdom I crash landed on told me that he couldn't help me fix up the bone dragon I rode in on because I don't have a life. And by life, he meant a job. In <em>The Girl Who Steals Time</em>, jobs are called lives. "Because without a Life, what are we?" the leader asked. "How are we supposed to help others? Without Lives, we are no better than the monsters that roam outside the gates."</p><p>This felt like a direct shot to my gut, coming just over a month since I was laid off from a job I've been trying to untangle from my self-worth. If I wanted to help my bone dragon, I needed to get one of the 12 starting jobs. This game is both simulation and role-playing, so the jobs you can do — or, in <em>The Girl Who Steals Time</em> speak, Lives you can have —&nbsp; are resource gathering, crafting, alchemy, or several different fighting styles. I choose cooking to start — first, boiling eggs then making more complex dishes. Naturally, I also have debts to pay off, so I have to do favors to earn money. These are largely resource gathering, but then require me to pick up new jobs. I take up fishing, figuring it will complement the cooking gig. (Both fishing and foraging require a small, timed-based minigame to complete.) I fish and forage for a while to help out around town, switching between those two and several others, like mining, to earn money. It's a satisfying loop in itself, but <em>The Girl Who Steals Time</em> continues to change and shift as more pieces of the world opens up. The game feels like a mixture of <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>. And that's where taking on more jobs — again, Lives — become more crucial.</p><figure></figure><p>After leveling up your jobs a bit — of particular importance before moving on is being able to fight — you head out into the world to explore, opening up parts of the map by unlocking tall towers and fighting monsters in mysterious shrines. This is where I'm at in the game, around its second chapter. Laterally, <em>The Girl Who Steals Time</em> continues to evolve by introducing community and village-building, which I’ve only seen a fraction of. What’s impressed me so far is that developer Level-5 has collected beloved elements from other games to create something that doesn't just feel like it's been copied-and-pasted from somewhere else. That's due to the charming story and art style, which is over-the-top in a way that feels self-aware and a bit cheeky. Or, at least, that's how I'm choosing to read a game that immediately told me to get a job.&nbsp;</p><p>The sheer number of jobs, and the ways you can mix and match jobs to get stuff done around the island, is what makes the game particularly interesting. So far, I don't feel pushed into any direction or job that I'm simply not interested in. By focusing on the ideas I do care to pursue, like resource gathering and crafting, I can make the game what I want it to be. Someone who chooses a different set of jobs will surely have a different experience.</p><p>It's my first time playing the Fantasy Life series, the first game of which, simply called <em>Fantasy Life</em>, was originally released in 2012 on Nintendo 3DS. It was released globally in 2014. It was a different story, but the original concept — centered on Lives, or jobs — remains the same. <em>The Girl Who Steals Time</em> was a launch title for the Switch, with a special version that includes "improved resolution, framerate and faster load times," <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per the eShop store</a>, and the game itself came out for other consoles on May 21. I'm <em>not</em> playing it on Switch, but I suspect it'd be a perfect game for the new console because it’s got the Nintendo vibe. I've been playing on Steam Deck, where it’s the sort of game I'm enjoying in short little bursts right before bed. The lack of urgency in moving forward is key for me; I don't feel like I'm missing out by figuring out how the different jobs work before moving out into the big, open-world game.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-the-veilguard-electronic-arts-sales-layoffs"><h3>Good Day To Everyone Except The Senior Management At Electronic Arts</h3></a><p>'The team was asked to change the game’s fundamental structure and recast the entire story on the fly'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-lost-save-game-pass"><h3>My Lies Of P Save File Is Dead And I Am Full Of Regret</h3></a><p>I love Lies of P, but trying to play Lies of P: Overture became a cautionary tale about Game Pass and personal data archiving.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
