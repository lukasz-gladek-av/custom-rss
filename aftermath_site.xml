      <p><em>Wordle</em> fever has largely come and gone, as has the frantic explosion of spinoff games. But the game itself lives on under the <a href="https://aftermath.site/new-york-times-wordle-connections-puzzmo-games/" rel="noreferrer">ownership of The New York Times</a>, and many of the games inspired by it are still thriving. So I wasn't exactly surprised to come across an Irish language version this morning, but I <em>was </em>surprised to see that it was still updating with daily puzzles. And I was even more surprised to win today's game, a clear sign that I am an Irish language genius.</p><p><a href="https://www.foclach.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><em>Foclach</em></a> is <em>Wordle</em>, but in Irish. ("<a href="https://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/foclach?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Foclach</a>" means "wordy" or "verbose," and is a word I didn't know before; thanks, game!) It was created in 2022 by Linda Keating, who told the <a href="https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/its-filling-people-with-joy-irish-woman-creates-foclach-the-irish-version-of-wordle/41309366.html?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Irish Independent</a> that "part of the pure joy [of it] is pulling together this community of Irish language speakers" around the game, which had over 10,000 players in 2022. A fan of word games, Keating built the game using a <em>Wordle</em> clone and drew from several lists of five-letter Irish words. Unlike <em>Wordle</em>, <em>Foclach</em> has a practice mode, and Keating told the Irish Independent that adding the mode was when the game "really took off." She said she has no plans to monetize it--"I’ll never put it behind a paywall or I’ll never put ads on the website"--and that its simplicity is part of its charm, saying "it’s the kind of thing you would have seen on the web going back to the 1990s."</p><p>I've been <a href="https://aftermath.site/irish-now-youre-talking/" rel="noreferrer">learning Irish</a> since the spring from a combination of books, in-person and online classes, and the <a href="https://aftermath.site/duolingo-ai/" rel="noreferrer">horrors</a> of Duolingo. It's been tough--it's a complicated language, and there also aren't as many opportunities to encounter it in daily life as there are with other languages that are more widespread. (On Friday I went to a play at New York's <a href="https://irishartscenter.org/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Irish Arts Center</a>, and I was so smitten with the fact that the building has signage in Irish <em>and</em> that I could read that signage that I trespassed up several floors before I realized it.) All of this is to say that <em>Foclach</em> presented me with a unique challenge: unlike <em>Wordle</em>, I just don't know that many Irish words to guess.</p><p>So I was shocked when I got Tuesday's daily puzzle on my fifth of six tries, relying solely on my own knowledge of Irish. <strong>(Spoilers ahead if you're going to play it yourself.)</strong> I feel like it's key to start off with a good first guess in games like this, so I decided to go with "rudaí" ("things") because it contains a variety of vowels, including a fada, or accent mark. (Fada add another complication to <em>Foclach</em>; there are some words that are spelled the same but mean <a href="https://www.bitesize.irish/blog/our-fada/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">different things</a> depending on the fada.) I definitely wasn't as economical with my guesses as I am in English, using letters I knew weren't in the answer because they were in words I knew. But I managed to get close enough to make an educated guess at the last letter, and was pumped when I got it right.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Scrín means "shrine." Another new word!</span></figcaption></figure><p>Things didn't go as well when I picked a practice puzzle at random. "Rudaí" only got me an "a," and from there I floundered for appropriate words. My vocabulary was lacking, but there were a few guideposts to help me: vowels in Irish are divided into "broad" (a, o, u) and "slender" (e, i) and have to stick together in certain ways, which helped me pin down the order of a bunch of vowels. But then I was stuck with one missing letter. I went to the dictionary, but without the first letter, it was hard to search. I even looked up some of the word lists <em>Foclach</em> is based on, but they didn't help much either. Eventually, much like in <em>Wordle</em>, I just went through each remaining letter to see if they'd form a word--but unlike in <em>Wordle</em>, I didn't really <em>know</em> if my results were actually words at all. I managed to get the practice puzzle's answer of "mnaoi" (an unusual form of "bean," or "woman") by being familiar with the cluster of "mna" as a plausible run of letters  ("mná" is "women," the plural of "bean.").</p><figure><figcaption><span>My guess of "gnaoi" is also a word, meaning "beauty" or "comeliness," but I didn't know that when I guessed it; I only guessed it because I knew "g" could come before "n" based on a phrase I already know, "de gnáth" for something like "typically"</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's really fun for me about <em>Foclach</em> is how it asks me to use my language skills in a totally different way than <em>Wordle</em>. In the English game, I'm guessing <em>words</em>, drawing on my vocabulary knowledge in a way that makes the game's primary pleasure being proficient with English. I felt <em>smart</em> when I used to get the <em>Wordle</em> in a few tries (I <a href="https://writersagainstthewarongaza.com/boycott-nyt?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">don't play it</a> anymore). But with <em>Foclach</em>, my key strategy can't really be vocabulary, because my Irish vocabulary is so small. So I have to pull on the related skills I employed above, like spelling rules and other words I know. It feels like a totally different way to think about both word games and Irish, and instead of feeling clever when I got the answers, I felt like I'd climbed a mountain. It's a really cool way to engage with a language I'm learning, and I love how it forces me to explore the dictionary and learn new words.</p><p>Thanks to the practice mode, I have years of <em>Foclach</em> to go through, and I'm so excited to play more of it. It's definitely going into my daily rotation alongside my other Irish game, <a href="https://www.teanglann.ie/en/spelling-game/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">dictionary website Teanglann's spelling game</a>, which I'll say I'm pretty good at as long as I limit the dialects it draws from. Obviously I won't be able to maintain my 100% win rate forever, but I'll relish in it while I can.</p>
