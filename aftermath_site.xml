      <p>In 2020 workers at Naughty Dog, developers of the <em>Uncharted </em>and <em>Last Of Us</em> series,<a href="https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>came forward with reports</u></a> of brutal, 12-hour work days and sustained periods of what's known as<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crunch_(video_games)?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>crunch</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Many who have worked at Naughty Dog over the years describe it as a duality—as a place that can be simultaneously the best and the worst workplace in the world. Working at Naughty Dog means designing beloved, critically acclaimed games alongside artists and engineers who are considered some of the greatest in their fields. But for many of those same people, it also means working 12-hour days (or longer) and even weekends when the studio is in crunch mode, sacrificing their health, relationships, and personal lives at the altar of the game.</blockquote><p>In 2021, in response to those reports, Naughty Dog bosses Evan Wells and Neil Druckmann<a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2021/08/28/naughty-by-nature-naughty-dog-leadership-reflects-on-the-studios?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>said they were</u></a> 'assessing ways the studio can improve', with Druckmann insisting there wasn't one single solution to the problem:</p><blockquote>...in the past where we’ve said, “Okay, no working past this hour,” or, “It’s mandatory that no one can work on Sunday,” and they’re always a lot of corner cases of someone saying, “Well, I couldn’t work on Friday because I had to be with my kids. It’s actually more convenient for me to come in on Sunday.” When you try to have a silver bullet, like one solution, you’re always leaving someone behind. That’s why we feel like we need multiple solutions. We have to approach this from multiple angles.</blockquote><p>In 2024,<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-studio-admits-we-have-a-reputation-for-crunching-and-pledges-that-its-something-were-not-going-to-do-anymore/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>in a documentary detailing the production of <em>The Last Of Us 2</em></u></a>, Druckmann said, "We now have the goal for Naughty Dog to eliminate crunch", before quality assurance lead Patrick Goss added, "When we onboard people, we tell them that we have a reputation as a studio for crunching, and it's something that we don’t want. And it's something we're not going to do anymore".</p><p>In December 2025 (as in, today), Jason Schreier at Bloomberg has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic?ref=aftermath.site"><u>reported</u></a>:</p><blockquote>For the past seven weeks, the Santa Monica-based studio behind&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>has been pushing its staff to work long hours to get ready for an upcoming review of the [Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet] demo by its parent company, according to people familiar with the situation. Starting in late October, staff were asked to begin working a minimum of eight extra hours a week and logging their overtime in an internal spreadsheet, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. This overtime period was an attempt to get the production back on track after several missed deadlines.</blockquote><p>Workers were also told to get back into the office five days a week (they <em>had</em> only been required for three). What's notable here is that this cycle of crunch--which lasted for just under two months--wasn't even to finish the game, which isn't due until 2027, but just to finish a <em>demo</em>.</p><p>Also of note, from the end of Jason's story:</p><blockquote>Earlier this year, members of the production team were each given customized metal coins that seemed to capture, purposefully or not, the current state of the studio’s workplace attitude. On one side was the company’s paw-print logo. On the other, a quote from the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>: “The suffering of generations must be endured to achieve our divine end.”</blockquote><p>Cool, cool, cool.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>A survival city-builder in broadly the same vein as stuff like <em>Frostpunk </em>and <em>Ixion</em>, <em>Flotsam</em> is a game set at the end of the world that, thanks to its vibrant art style and optimistic outlooks, actually feels more like the start of the world instead.</p><p>You play as a tug boat that poots around a flooded world, ala <em>Waterworld</em>, and as you go--on a kind of strategic overworld map--you need to scrounge for resources and pick up survivors. Zoom in, though, and the game becomes a city-builder, where you can attach buildings to your boat and use those resources to craft stuff, build <em>more </em>buildings and keep everyone happy by giving them nicer houses and places to hang out.</p><p>The cheery, hand-crafted visuals are a joy to be around. For an apocalyptic game, <em>Flotsam</em>'s glass is very much half-full, its flooded wastes featuring crystal-blue oceans, storybook islands and fantastic character art, while the survivor's chatter is mostly interested in everyone working together to build something new and communal from the wreckage. To give you an idea of just how cheery things are, here's the game's website:</p><blockquote>The world of Flotsam is a colorful and cheerful place. It’s about going on adventures, seeing the world and cleaning it up as you go. The sun is shining, the sky is clear and the ocean is calm… mostly at least.</blockquote><p>Does this change the way the game plays? Not really. Does it dictate the way I feel while playing it? Absolutely. As I've explained<a href="https://aftermath.site/town-to-city-pc-builder-cozy-impressions-review/"> <u>in my impressions of <em>Town To City</em></u></a>, I like these games because they let me build stuff, and I hate the stresses so many of them bring along for the ride. <em>Flotsam</em> has those stresses--you need to keep everyone fed and supplied with fresh water--but meeting those needs is so straightforward, and everyone looks and works so happily while they're in danger, that it never feels like a <em>crisis</em>.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/owkx83gyETY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Flotsam - Official Version 1.0 Launch Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>I should note that this isn't really a city-builder in the traditional sense. While you are definitely building a settlement around your boat, and it needs walkways and power and all that stuff, the overworld navigation is a place you spend a <em>lot </em>of time exploring, finding resources and picking up survivors. What's cool is that the two are linked; you cruise around a map screen where everything is abstract, but when you find something to explore, the view zooms into the boat-scaled view, and the objects that appeared as points on the map are now islands represented off the stern of your town, on which you can see your survivors clambering over and harvesting supplies.</p><p><em>Flotsam </em>has a more involved supply chain and production management slant than many of its peers, which I really enjoyed; the loop of harvesting raw resources from the overworld, then using your city to refine them and turn them first into processed resources, then <em>things</em>, is always satisfying. There are a ton of different materials and items, some you can only get by scrounging, others that can be grown and others that you have to craft, and it's an interesting challenge having to prioritise your survivors and various buildings to churn out exactly the things you need at any given time.</p><p>I said earlier in the year<a href="https://aftermath.site/4x-game-climate-capitalism-civilization-future/"> <u>that I'm tired of apocalyptic futures where humanity is resigned to living off scraps</u></a>, where the overriding themes are those of defeat and despair. <em>Flotsam's</em> optimism and resolve to build something <em>new</em> from the ashes are exactly what I was talking about; the fact it's a game where you're directly responsible for the building only makes it better.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/4x-game-climate-capitalism-civilization-future/"><div><p>Give Me A Future Worth Fighting For - Aftermath</p><p>I want to build a better world, not live in the ruins</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>
