            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Earlier today Bloomberg's Jason Schreier published an<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify+wall&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>interview</u></a><u> </u>with Swen Vincke, the CEO of Larian, the company behind the internet's favourite video game and demonic relationship simulator <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>. It could not have gone worse for the guy.</p><p>Among all the expected pre-release interview talk about how their next game, <em>Divinity</em>, will be making all kinds of improvements over their last game, there was this:</p><blockquote>Under Vincke, Larian has been pushing hard on generative AI, although the CEO says the technology hasn’t led to big gains in efficiency. He says there won’t be any AI-generated content in<em>&nbsp;Divinity</em>&nbsp;— “everything is human actors; we’re writing everything ourselves” — but the creators often use AI tools to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text.</blockquote><blockquote>The use of generative AI has led to some pushback at Larian, “but I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it,” Vincke said.</blockquote><p>The quote made an audible record scratch on social media before leading to a ton of blowback from<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kortizart.bsky.social/post/3ma4rztk2yk2m?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>artists</u></a> and<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bryantfrancis.me/post/3ma4d2dzp5225?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>beyond</u></a>, so much so that Vincke<a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>took to Twitter to try to explain himself</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Holy fuck guys we’re not "pushing hard" for or replacing concept artists with AI.<p>We have a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more. The art they create is original and I’m very proud of what they do.</p><p>I was asked explicitly about concept art and our use of Gen AI. I answered that we use it to explore things. I didn’t say we use it to develop concept art. The artists do that. And they are indeed world class artists.</p><p>We use AI tools to explore references, just like we use google and art books. At the very early ideation stages we use it as a rough outline for composition which we replace with original concept art. There is no comparison.</p><p><a href="https://gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">I talked about how we use ML here if you would like to know more</a>.</p><p>We've hired creatives for their talent, not for their ability to do what a machine suggests, but they can experiment with these tools to make their lives easier.</p></blockquote><p>Which only made things worse! Because instead of explaining himself, all his follow-up showed is that Vincke does not appear to understand what it is that his art teams actually do, or indeed how their art is made.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:eioch6ru2ibkm7uabsa3vzua/app.bsky.feed.post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreihaduvsxwn6krehu2wr32fvxnqadpx4xk7pcafz3c75cu42pdwcei"><p lang="en">consider my feedback: i loved working at @larianstudios.com until AI. reconsider and change your direction, like, yesterday. show your employees some respect. they are world-class &amp; do not need AI assistance to come up with amazing ideas.</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:eioch6ru2ibkm7uabsa3vzua?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">anoxicart🍤 (@anoxicart.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:eioch6ru2ibkm7uabsa3vzua/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-12-16T16:20:58.862Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>That's OK, Swen, let me explain it for you! Firstly, any use of AI fucking sucks. It's a creative, economic and societal disaster, so really, there's no excusing its use in any circumstances. That's why people got so upset about the initial quote. But to get more specific, let's take a look at your justification.</p><p>Saying you only use AI for "reference" is wild. Artists use image searches and books as inspiration because they are drawing on art (but also everything else from colour palettes to photos to the weather). There's experience there, things they can relate to, be inspired by. There is no inspiration in slop! Everything AI is presenting to you is simply stolen and amalgamated. It's like asking your phone's autocorrect for relationship advice.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you are using AI to generate ideas to explore, that is using AI in your game. This is duplicitous spin to say otherwise. The entire history of creative industry happened just fine without using AI, there is no need to shoot your game in the foot by using it now.</p>— RJ Palmer (@arvalis) <a href="https://twitter.com/arvalis/status/2001019435776418179?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>There's an unsurprising tendency across leaders in the tech world (games included) to see art as merely part of something's production line, a box that needs to be ticked before copies can be sold. It's why AI is often justified as something that saves time, or saves money. But with art, that process <em>is </em>the point. The themes and ideas artists draw on, the way they iterate through those ideas with sketches, the work itself is what creates art. There are no shortcuts.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:oblggmviqritnt4hx4i7qgar/app.bsky.feed.post/3ma4w7yvzzs2z" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidmwci4fnhh4dxew67pkxmgcgjsx6bco2zotg4f2oax7a2v2zd5wy"><p lang="en">In a lot of ways, Larian was a poster child (alongside folks like Remedy) for how retaining a team and continuing to refine a toolset makes seemingly impossible things achievable.

Why spend 2 years talking about how critical this was to BG3's existence--and then say major parts of it don't matter?</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oblggmviqritnt4hx4i7qgar?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Xalavier Nelson Jr. (@writnelson.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oblggmviqritnt4hx4i7qgar/post/3ma4w7yvzzs2z?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-12-16T19:50:58.603Z</a></blockquote></figure>
