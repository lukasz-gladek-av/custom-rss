            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>News today that Xbox has <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-activision-blizzard-xbox-warcraft-rumble" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled multiple projects</a> and<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> laid off hundreds of workers</a>, on top of<a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-1900-people-at-activision-blizzard-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> thousands more let go in earlier layoffs over the last 18 months</a>, has shaken an industry already pretty damn shaken after<a href="https://aftermath.site/layoffs-are-the-vibe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> everything that's happened over the last 3-4 years</a>. This leaves me asking the same question<a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I've found myself asking a lot lately</a>: why are the people most responsible for the company's failures not the ones facing the consequences for them?</p><p>Microsoft has stepped on rake after rake in the decade since the launch of the Xbox One. I could make a list here of every mistake the company has made--from first-party development mishaps to confusing naming practices to Game Pass' undercutting of an entire industry to more recent stuff like devaluing the brand's identity itself--but you know all this already. You can take your pick as to what you think has been the biggest contributor to a once-dominant console now appearing to be in terminal decline.</p><p>Whichever you choose, in whatever order and priority, they've all got one thing in common: they're all strategic mistakes. Everything Microsoft has fucked up since 2013 has come from the very top.</p><p>Those fuck ups have consistently pointed the company on a downwards trajectory, to the point where we are now looking at a <em>fourth </em>round of layoffs since 2024. Workers who have poured their lives into making games, or marketing games, or making sure studios are run properly, have been cast aside.</p><p>None of those people were responsible for calling it the Xbox Series X But Also Series S. The person answering phones at Arkane didn't bet the farm on Game Pass becoming the next Netflix then...not becoming the next Netflix. An artist paid to draw spaceships for a <em>Halo </em>game didn't decide that Xbox should mean an actual Xbox but also kinda mean an Oculus Quest 3 and some handhelds and cloud services but also not really.</p><p>Xbox executives made those decisions! They've all been bad decisions, one after another, for over a decade now, and as you cast your eyes over the lists of people being affected by these layoffs--their careers and entire lives upended in an instant--that list does not include CEO Phil Spencer.</p><p>He remains in his role, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696922/phil-spencer-xbox-microsoft-gaming-retiring" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wants to be there for a while yet</a>, and will remain receiving total compensation in the <em>millions</em>, pay that should in theory be a result of the scale of responsibility he is entrusted with. Getting paid millions while you're doing well makes sense! Continuing to be paid millions while your business sucks so badly you think you need to lay off workers because of your terrible decisions, or decisions you're responsible for, makes <em>no </em>sense.</p><p>If Microsoft really wants to reverse a decade of mistakes, and feels the best way to achieve that is to let someone go, maybe they need to be looking at laying off the people--or person--ultimately responsible for those mistakes.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-activision-blizzard-xbox-warcraft-rumble"><h3>Microsoft Layoffs Hit Blizzard, Warcraft Rumble Put On Life Support</h3></a><p>No new content for Warcraft Rumble as Blizzard departments like marketing and customer service are also impacted</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-sale-keleops-go"><h3>G/O Media Finally Sells Kotaku</h3></a><p>Kotaku has been purchased by the owners of sister site Gizmodo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-shower-handles"><h3>An In-Depth Examination Of Death Stranding 2’s Shower Handles</h3></a><p>Death Stranding 1 &amp; 2 both feature beautiful mechanical design.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As part of Microsoft’s latest round of <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a>, which have already claimed multiple in-development projects including <em>Perfect Dark</em>, <em>Everwild</em>, and an unannounced MMO from the makers of <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em>, Activision Blizzard is effectively ending development on <em>Warcraft Rumble</em>, a mobile tower defense game that launched in 2023 after a lengthy development period.</p><p><em>Rumble</em>, Blizzard <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24215864/announcing-changes-to-warcraft-rumble-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just announced publicly</a> and earlier today in an email to staff, will no longer receive any new content.&nbsp;</p><p>“The emails from Phil [Spencer] and Matt [Booty] today have laid out workforce changes underway across Microsoft Gaming, including Blizzard,” Blizzard president Johanna Faries wrote in an email to staff viewed by Aftermath. “As part of these changes, we made the difficult decision to shift to a scaled down, live ops-only phase of development for <em>Warcraft Rumble</em>, similar to our current approach with games like <em>StarCraft II</em> and <em>Heroes of the Storm</em>.”</p><p>The game, Faries said, began life nine years ago, but ultimately, after its launch in 2023, “team leaders recognized that early development and design ambitions were not meeting expectations in terms of audience engagement and retention.”</p><p>“Since launch, <em>Rumble </em>has struggled to achieve the scale necessary to sustain its current form for the long-term, despite very good and hard work by everyone on the team and supporting the game,” Faries wrote.</p><p>She went on to say that “several” <em>Rumble </em>team members have moved to new roles within Blizzard, but others will be let go. While Faries did not disclose an exact number, Activision Blizzard employees who were granted anonymity on the basis that they were not authorized to speak publicly said the number could be as high as 100. Many employees affected by today’s layoffs, they said, found out initially via Slack deactivations. Other Blizzard departments impacted, according to Faries' email, include customer service and marketing. Other teams, like those working on various <em>Overwatch </em>features – dealt <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a devastating blow</a> during Microsoft's early-2024 mass layoffs – <a href="https://x.com/chronofloss/status/1940498049513804057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appear to be safe</a> this time around.</p><p><em>Rumble </em>was part of a burgeoning Blizzard initiative to conquer the mobile market following the success of <em>Hearthstone</em>, which <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-03/activision-blizzard-preps-warcraft-mobile-game-cancels-another" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg reported in 2022</a> played a role in Microsoft's decision to purchase Activision Blizzard for nearly $69 billion. Another Blizzard mobile game would have seen the company do its best <em>Pokémon Go</em> impression, but that project was canceled before it ever saw the light of day.</p><p>"Organizational changes like this can be difficult to navigate and our ability to adapt, stay focused, and weather storms is a testament to the strength and resilience of our teams,” wrote Faries. “I want to recognize the significant and meaningful progress we are making on many fronts. Today's news does not diminish the hard work and dedication of talented individuals, nor does it take away from the collective brilliance of so many. Together, we will continue to build towards a bright and creatively ambitious future for players the world over."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-phil-spencer"><h3>Has Xbox Considered Laying One Person Off Instead Of Thousands</h3></a><p>None of the people being laid off were responsible for the decisions that have led to these layoffs</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-sale-keleops-go"><h3>G/O Media Finally Sells Kotaku</h3></a><p>Kotaku has been purchased by the owners of sister site Gizmodo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-shower-handles"><h3>An In-Depth Examination Of Death Stranding 2’s Shower Handles</h3></a><p>Death Stranding 1 &amp; 2 both feature beautiful mechanical design.
