I just got back from drinking a coffee, during which I relaxed on the couch and watched a 34-minute documentary about the making of the excellent <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>.</p><p>Made by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ArchipelDocumentaries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ever-wonderful team at Archipel</a>, it focuses on the three people you'd most want an Atlus making-of documentary to focus on: Katsura Hashino, Shoji Meguro and artist Shigenori Soejima. Visiting Atlus' HQ just ahead of the game's release and interviewing everyone extensively, it focuses on the team's decision to take a break from <em>Persona</em>, and how they went about adapting their tried-and-tested formula for a new setting and a new era. </p><p>It's <em>really </em>good. The whole thing is in Japanese, of course, but it's got official subtitles throughout (not the dogshit auto-generated ones), so just make sure you have captions enabled before watching. </p><p>Oh, and if you were wondering/worried, "This video does not include any spoilers from the game's storyline".</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="A Metaphor in Fantasy - Katsura Hashino, Shigenori Soejima &amp; Shoji Meguro" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-eFkMJzc6ow?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
