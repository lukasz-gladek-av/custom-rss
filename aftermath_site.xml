            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/steam-next-fest-demos-ai-disclosure-algorithm<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Next Fest</a> is in full swing, and the hopefully-washed masses are once again partaking of more demos than any one person can reasonably get through. This time around, though, there’s been a recurring theme to people’s hours spent sifting diamonds from the rough: AI art.&nbsp;</p><p>Across sites like Twitter and Bluesky, numerous Steam users have turned up their noses at unpleasant surprises populating their Next Fest feeds.</p><p>"Looking at the Steam Next Fest page, it's so tiresome how many games with AI art there are," The CRPG Book editor Felipe Pepe <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/felipepepe.bsky.social/post/3lixnwg5v4k2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Bluesky. "And it's always the same crap: generic anime girl, grimdark fantasy guy with those 'Balenciaga AI' faces, or obviously fake pixel art."</p><p>"This Steam Next Fest has probably been the most AI infested ever, and it’s all been voice acting and art more than anything," a modder who goes by the handle Manny Calavera <a href="https://x.com/MannyCalavera12/status/1894395629377655087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Twitter. "It's rough."</p><p>This week, Valve also added a mandatory AI disclosure feature to game’s Steam pages, which made headlines when it forced Activision to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-admits-its-using-generative-ai-to-help-develop-some-in-game-assets-and-suddenly-all-those-poorly-made-calling-cards-make-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally admit</a> something that players have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long suspected</a>: AI cosmetics are becoming an increasingly prolific part of the world’s most popular first-person shooter. A quick perusal of Steam Next Fest’s “Simulation” section, especially, yields many similar disclosures from games with titles like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3533100/Wrap_House_Simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wrap House Simulator</em></a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3544050/Gun_Factory_Simulator_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gun Factory Simulator</em></a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3371650/Car_Mechanic_Workshop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Car Mechanic Workshop</em></a>. Other games sport art that looks <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3458190/Pocket_Garden_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspiciously similar</a> to something generative AI would spit out, but they lack disclosures.&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s difficult to say for certain whether or not the latest Next Fest is more awash with slop than its predecessors, it wouldn’t be surprising considering the <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/developers-still-aren-t-warming-up-to-generative-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing use of AI</a> in game development circles – even if nobody is actually asking for this. But there’s also an under-discussed factor at play: Valve changed how Steam Next Fest functions late last year.</p><p>"If people think they are seeing smaller or weirder games in this Next Fest – and the one at the end of last year – Steam did switch to this different approach where they cut out the livestreaming elements of Next Fest [and] are showing you a more random selection of games for the first two-to-three days of the Fest,” Simon Carless, founder of <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameDiscoverCo</a>, an agency that analyzes how players find video games, told Aftermath. “They will then show you personalized picks, based on what everyone else has been playing, later in the Fest."</p><p>It is unlikely, however, that Valve’s goal was to surface slapdash trash.</p><p>"This does lead to some odder, tinier games getting randomly surfaced,” said Carless. “But that's Steam deliberately trying to diversify and get more 'egalitarian,' as opposed to just showing the biggest trending games, which is something that was increasingly being gamed by studios launching a demo early and pushing it to influencers to get on top of the Next Fest charts for the first day."</p><p>In my experience, Carless' assessment appears correct. Several days into Next Fest, I'm now seeing far fewer suspicious recommendations, even in oft-criticized categories like "Simulation." Intriguing prospects like <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3482840/Wanderstop_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wanderstop</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585830/Promise_Mascot_Agency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Promise Mascot Agency</a></em>, as well as meme-y but undeniably amusing concepts like <em>Silent Hill</em> soccer game <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3495990/FEAR_FA_98/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FEAR FA 98</a></em>, have risen to the top. Only once I scroll down do I begin to see dicier fare.</p><p>These days, Valve applies this general philosophy to most corners of Steam, explained Chris Zukowski, a video game marketer who <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regularly writes about Steam and discoverability</a>.</p><p>"Overall, this 'Give every game 15 minutes of fame and see who survives' [approach] is a fundamental aspect to the Steam algorithm in several different areas,” Zukowski told Aftermath, pointing to a survey of Steam’s Discovery Queue he ran across 75 games of different sizes.</p><figure><figcaption>Chris Zukowski</figcaption></figure><p>"Notice how Diamond, Gold, and Silver earners all start out with around 25,000 impressions on day one and two? That is the Steam algorithm testing the games. If a lot of people buy the game on day one and two, on the subsequent days, it is given even more visibility. If it doesn't do well, its visibility is cut,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Zukowski then pointed to the brown line on the graph.&nbsp;</p><p>“Those are games that had so few wishlists going into launch that Valve figures that the dev was too unsophisticated or just a shovelware scammer,” he said. “So they don't even give them the default 25,000 views on day one and two. This Discovery Queue algorithm is why I am not worried about an AI shovelware flood. If a scammer could churn out an AI-generated game per day, they would not have had enough time or spent enough effort gathering the minimum number of wishlists to qualify for the ‘15 minutes of fame’ at launch.”&nbsp;</p><p>For years, Steam users and developers raged against <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/asset-flip-simulator-highlights-a-huge-problem-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a glut of "asset flips" and fake games</a> overrunning the platform. This was Valve's solution: to algorithmically create what are functionally two Steams – the one regular people see and the landfill. While games occasionally slip through the cracks in both directions, it's a relatively effective system overall, according to developers I've spoken to over the past couple years. But it does not solve the problem of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mhwilliams.bsky.social/post/3lj4eyb6txs2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 20,000 games releasing on Steam per year</a>; it only mitigates some of them.</p><p>Those who analyze Steam and similar platforms for a living aren’t sounding the alarm bells about an AI slop flood just yet. The bigger issue Steam developers face is the sheer number of high-effort, <em>good </em>games that come out on a daily basis. This is true of Next Fest as well. There are over 1,000 games in Steam's latest demo-palooza, and many of them look solid. Can an algorithm, no matter how much time Valve spends optimizing it to ultimately lure money out of your wallet, solve that problem? Should it?</p><p>For better or worse, the algorithm remains key, and Carless and Zukowski recommend keeping a close eye on it.</p><p>"The net result of [Valve changing its approach to the previous Steam Next Fest] was I think every game got less visibility. Even top-performing AA games got fewer wishlists during SNF. So it was less winner-take-all,” said Zukowski. “There is weird stuff on Steam, but most of it is filtered out by the algorithms.”&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chinese-cleaver-chefs-knife-caidao-cck-sbz"><h3>Everyone Should Have A Chinese Chef’s Knife</h3></a><p>My Chan Chi Kee KF1812 caidao is one of my most prized possessions and I use it for basically everything.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/washington-post-bezos"><h3>Jeff Bezos Presents: The News</h3></a><p>Bezos' new vision for The Washington Post's opinion section will destroy the paper</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monaco-2-makes-playing-a-heist-game-alone-more-fun.1121112/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/monaco-2-demo-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was a big fan of 2013’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/113020/Monaco_Whats_Yours_Is_Mine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Monaco</em></a>, a top-down, pixel art heist game with a <em>Rashomon</em>-esque plot. It was clearly meant to be played co-op, where your friends ruin your plans and then you all fight, but I mostly played it as a solo experience. It was a lot of fun that way–stealthing through its sprawling mansions, banks, discos, and art galleries until I ruined my plans all on my own, at which point I’d run around in a panic and then hide in a vent. Developer Pocketwatch announced a sequel in 2022; there’s currently a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063030/Monaco_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> available as part of Steam Next Fest, which makes single-player a more viable way to play.</p><p>The core of <em>Monaco 2</em> is essentially the same as <em>Monaco 1</em>–a group of characters is drawn together to break into glamorous buildings, locate some coveted object, and try to get out alive–but how all that works has gotten an overhaul. Most noticeable is that the sequel has nixed the pixel art, and has shifted to an isometric perspective. I wasn’t quite sold on the game’s new look when it was first announced, having such fond memories of the first’s bright, blocky colors and relative simplicity. But the new style grew on me quickly while playing the demo; the more detailed art brings life to the levels, and the new perspective makes heists feel more akin to playing a <em>Hitman</em> level than the somewhat cerebral remove of the original’s overhead design. Levels feel busier, which makes them more engaging to move through, if not sometimes a bit more chaotic, especially when things go south.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Monaco 2 OFFICIAL Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKF0feOQcPU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Developer Andy Schatz told Aftermath in an interview that some of the visual changes were due to ways Pocketwatch saw players struggle to understand the original. This is especially true of the way <em>Monaco 2</em> iterates on the first game’s most unique visual feature, which is that parts of a level outside your immediate vicinity were greyed out. Schatz said, “Some people's brains literally cannot parse [the original look]... and I wanted to be able to make the sequel something that more people could parse.” The original game had a blueprint vibe, which is preserved in the sequel through your ability to pore over the map before you start or during gameplay. But the moment-to-moment is different now; while in the first game, areas outside your line of sight were essentially invisible, here, you can see a lot more of their contents. This reduces some of the first game’s tendency to feel like a disco when things went haywire, but still maintains enough mystery to keep you on your toes. Schatz said, “There’s basically like a shadowing [in <em>Monaco 2</em>], but it's a more subtle shadowing that doesn't completely change the visual style of the region that is unseen versus the region that is seen.”</p><figure><figcaption>The original Monaco's line of sight</figcaption></figure><p>Drawing on the lessons learned from players over a decade of the first game influenced other changes for the sequel as well. One is the new way that characters work, especially when playing single-player. In the first game, you could only change characters when you died; here, you can swap them out at various checkpoints. While Schatz admitted <em>Monaco</em> will never have quite as much “riotous fun” in single-player as in co-op, he thinks the single-player experience in <em>Monaco 2</em> is better than in the first game. As a solo player, being able to change characters more often lessened the feeling that I was the wrong person for the job as I moved deeper into a level and faced new challenges.</p><p>The game’s eight characters fall into basic archetypes, each with their own distinct look and powers, like the ability to heal or a drone that can hack alarms. The variety within the team is a reflection of the heist movies <em>Monaco</em> is inspired by, in which Schatz said “the people within the crew are all unique from one another because they have a unique role within their team.” My favorite demo character was The Socialite, who has a little dog she can deploy to distract single guards. (Schatz told me that, alas, other players can’t pet the dog.) Playing alone, I’d use her in the early parts of a level, where her dog could handle the scattered enemies. When later areas got too populated, I’d swap to The Prowler and use her dash ability to sneak by multiple patrolling guards.</p><p>“The primary approach is really that we're designing for different player personalities and player styles more so than player skill,” Schatz said of the differences between the characters. “<em>Monaco</em> is designed around the idea that everyone always has the opportunity to be the hero under different circumstances.”&nbsp;</p><p>Characters also have “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1063030/view/542222803385975570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trinkets</a>” they can unlock through diamonds earned by completing challenges; trinkets give characters new abilities at the cost of some of their health. Schatz said there’s more like 40 different characters, given how much a trinket can change your playstyle. He said that trinkets largely follow a certain progression: “For the most part, they all stay within the theme of the character. I did always try to make sure that there was one trinket that was like a speedrunning trinket, and another trinket that was a team-based trinket. Then the other two were typically just like, well, this would be a cool variation on the character. I generally tried to order their unlock order so the first one is, how do I make this character a little bit easier to play?”</p><figure></figure><p>Another change that makes single-player a little more approachable is the change to how weapons work. Schatz said he didn’t like the way you picked your weapon at the beginning of a <em>Monaco 1</em> stage, and then unlocked ammo for it while collecting coins scattered around a level. In <em>Monaco 2</em>, you spend coins to unlock different weapons you find, which, like the ability to change characters, gives you more gameplay options. In the first game, similar to how I sometimes felt I was stuck with the wrong character, I’d also feel like I had the wrong tool. In the demo, I could deploy a smoke bomb to hide from guards, flee to a stairwell, then swap to a disguise to calmly stroll through the next floor. It’s not the same team-based vibe as a heist movie or co-op play, but it made me feel clever, and gave me more options when I didn’t have teammates to get me out of a jam.</p><p>But no amount of character or weapon swaps can prevent a <em>Monaco</em> level from devolving into chaos, no matter how much I want to play it like the <a href="https://aftermath.site/stealth-game-no-detection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perfect stealth game</a>. It’s not that the enemies are challenging–Schatz said the game’s guards are “particularly dumb”--but that running afoul of one has a cascading effect. You can’t really fight them head-on– Schatz said that “everyone always asked for combat back in the day [of <em>Monaco 1</em>], they wanted to be able to fight the guards... [But] that's just not how <em>Monaco 1</em> was: plan A is stealth and then plan B, we called it the ‘oh shit’ button.” Fleeing from one guard inevitably runs you into another, and they all start to chase you as you race around corners and deal with the game’s particular take on line-of-sight. Schatz said the game treats enemies like “a flock as a whole, and a giant system where you’re making waves.” This brings a slapstick vibe to things going wrong that feels core to the experience of <em>Monaco</em>, and I was glad to see it hold true for the sequel.</p><p>“The only piece of code that is literally shared between <em>Monaco 1</em> and <em>Monaco 2</em> is the aggro algorithm, the algorithm for how guards see you, how they perceive you, and when they chase you,” Schatz said. “That's the one that was like, there's special sauce in there that we don't want to mess with.”</p><figure></figure><p>This idea of enemies as a whole, rather than individuals, also feels like it fits with the nature of the heist movies <em>Monaco </em>is inspired by, which Schatz described as being about “a band of misfits that gather together to outsmart the squares.” The original <em>Monaco</em> was inspired by the heist movies of its time–Schatz cited Guy Ritchie movies and <em>The Usual Suspects</em>–but heists, and the nature of heist movies, has changed since then. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgdy5e3neko" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern heists</a>, Schatz said, “almost all involve some form of digital trickery… They often are multi-stage at this point… And that was something that kind of went into the original thoughts of some of [<em>Monaco 2</em>’s] story.” We only get a glimpse of that story in the demo, and what I played feels physical in the way of “classic” heists, letting you jetset around locations and put yourself in harm’s way, while also feeling more high-tech, such as through the presence of robot guards. “It’s not so much a sci-fi story, but it’s sort of mildly so,” Schatz said.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Monaco 2</em> is being published by Humble Games, which faced what owner Ziff Davis called a “<a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restructuring</a>” over the summer, but which to many looked more like a closure. Humble initially brought in third party The Powell Group to continue its <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/indie-devs-working-with-humble-games-were-also-blindsided-by-the-publisher-reportedly-laying-off-all-employees-this-will-have-drastic-consequences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games</a>, and, later, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/humble-games-calls-in-good-games-group-for-support-following-restructure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">external help</a> in the form of a company founded by ex-Humble employees.&nbsp;When asked how this had affected the game, Schatz acknowledged that there was “healthy and valid skepticism of the initial statements that it's a restructuring.” He said Humble has been “surprisingly really supportive… I say ‘surprisingly;’ I mean just, even I had that kind of skepticism when it all went down. I was panicked, but… they've been supporting [<em>Monaco 2</em>] beyond even sort of initial promises. No corners have been cut; in fact, corners have been added… I have been given every sign that they are extremely excited about <em>Monaco</em>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Monaco 2</em> is set to release this year. I’m enjoying my time with the demo and the way it feels more suited to my solo circumstances, even if solo play isn’t the ideal. (<em>You</em> try making plans to game with friends as a middle-aged adult.) Schatz told me, “I actually think that one of the reasons that Pocketwatch has been successful over the years is… [trying] to discover new niches of people that were underserved by the games that they know and love. And in this case, we're making a sequel… so there are some ways in which we said, if there is something that works better for this game, we can't be afraid to let it go.</p><p>“We've tried to preserve everything we could about the spirit of the original, and the emotions that you have and the types of things you think about while you're playing… [We didn’t want to] change that feeling of <em>sneak, sneak, sneak, CHAOS</em>. That is <em>Monaco</em>.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chinese-cleaver-chefs-knife-caidao-cck-sbz"><h3>Everyone Should Have A Chinese Chef’s Knife</h3></a><p>My Chan Chi Kee KF1812 caidao is one of my most prized possessions and I use it for basically everything.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/washington-post-bezos"><h3>Jeff Bezos Presents: The News</h3></a><p>Bezos' new vision for The Washington Post's opinion section will destroy the paper</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
