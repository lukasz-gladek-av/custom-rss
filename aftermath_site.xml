            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/going-rogue-galactic-andor-star-wars-rogue-one-tabletop<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Weeks ago, I found myself playing revolutionary over Discord. I was playing Choli, a Charli XCX-esque spy running a nightclub wrapped in layers of gregariousness so that no one would suspect her. What I would be roleplaying that night was the final night of her life.</p><p>I was playing <em>Going Rogue</em>, a companion for the tabletop roleplaying game <em>Galactic</em>, which is inspired by the <em>Star Wars</em> universe. I had been invited to play by the game’s designer, Jess Levine, who had previously asked me to write a piece of fiction as a setting supplement for the game’s physical edition, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/galacticgoingrogue/galactic-and-going-rogue-two-ttrpgs-of-war-among-the-stars?ref=echmoi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is being Kickstarted right now</a>. <em>Going Rogue</em> intrigued me specifically because it was inspired by <em>Rogue One</em> and <em>Andor</em>—in particular,<em> Going Rogue</em> has a mechanic baked into the game where your character is more or less guaranteed to go out in a blaze of glory for the cause.</p><p>“<em>Going Rogue</em> is a game where your characters are fated to die at the end,” Jess told me over a Discord call. “That was one of the things that I wanted from the very beginning, because I was having those feelings, like, was any of this work that we did worth it?”</p><p>Jess first started developing this game during the first Trump administration and the protests for George Floyd. In her experience as a political organizer, she often felt the absence of the kind of catharsis you might get while watching a movie like <em>Rogue One</em>. In a fictional setting, you can know for sure that a character’s sacrifice has been worth it. In real life, you never really know if you’re planting the seeds of trees whose shade you’ll never sit in, or just digging yourself a big hole.</p><figure></figure><p>“With <em>Going Rogue</em>, I was having the emotional struggle of like, was this worth it? And so what I wanted in the design of the game was that I could feel the catharsis, the bleed,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>She explained that “bleed” is a tabletop gaming term for when “you experienc[e] the emotions of your characters, and it bleed[s] out into real life. I wanted to design the game in a way that, as your character realized that they were willing to voluntarily sacrifice their life for this, you were narratively guaranteed by the mechanics that that sacrifice was worth it. You get to see, after they die, how it transforms the galaxy. I wanted you to get that feeling because you don't get that certainty in real life.”</p><p>Levine says that she knows that there are limits to the kind of change one can effect by designing a left wing tabletop roleplaying game. She didn’t make this game to convince anyone to become a socialist, but instead to create an emotional tool that serves as a mirror for the players’ own feelings about what it means to devote your life to a political cause.</p><p>“<em>Going Rogue</em> asks you to design your character, design your world, what you see in it, what you want and what you are struggling with in participation in the struggle, and you feel feelings that you are feeling outside of <em>Going Rogue</em>,” Levine said. “For people who aren't already organizers, it's a fun game, a game that lets them play in some cool themes.”</p><p>Like Levine, I am a huge fan of <em>Star Wars</em>. As every <em>Star Wars</em> fan knows, being a <em>Star Wars</em> fan means you hate <em>Star Wars</em> as much as you love it. <em>Going Rogue</em> was also a way for Levine to work out her issues with the series that inspired these games.</p><p>“You can reskin <em>Going Rogue</em> to be all the original stuff [from <em>Star Wars</em>]. I prefer, at this point, to play it not in canon <em>Star Wars</em>,” Levine said. “And also, there are things I hate about canon <em>Star Wars</em>. I think it sucks that the Jedi are child kidnapping, sexless acetics!”</p><p>In particular <em>Going Rogue</em> is a remix of <em>Rogue One</em>, which depicts the lives of a group of rebel agents who give their lives for the rebellion before the original trilogy.</p><p>“I love <em>Rogue One</em> and I hate <em>Rogue One</em>,” Levine said. “I was just watching that movie and like, watching that conflict happen in these meetings Mon Mothma and everyone else, and I was like, ‘This is what I'm going through in the organizing spaces I'm in right now.’ And that's super compelling.”</p><figure><blockquote><p><em>Going Rogue</em> aims to do more than just allow players to 'fix' <em>Star Wars</em>’s narrative problems.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In playing <em>Going Rogue</em>, you assemble a group of characters who don’t all agree with each other, or maybe have nothing in common with each other than their commitment to the rebellion against a fascist dictatorship. When I was developing Choli in the playsession that Levine invited me to, I was thinking about how to create a character who would deliberately push people’s boundaries and invite friction into conversations. This galactic party girl was someone who was brutal and ruthless, hiding her ability to manipulate and coax information out of people behind charm and opulence. I envisioned her as someone who feels self righteous about how much she has given to the cause, inviting the ire of people who put themselves in physical danger.&nbsp;</p><p>This is basically the kind of character that I wish was in a <em>Star Wars</em> story, but doesn’t ever appear. For Levine, <em>Going Rogue</em> was partially an exercise in fixing the things about <em>Rogue One</em> and <em>Star Wars</em> in general that bother her—especially <em>Rogue One</em>’s lead character, Jyn Erso.</p><p>“Jyn is a terrible character,” Levine said. “This is, from what I can tell, because of a series of rewrites. In the original version of <em>Rogue One</em>, she is a rebel from the beginning and is very committed. And when Gilroy came in, he wrote this character who is more ‘I'm cynical and jaded, and they're forcing me to be here,’ but you end up with a mishmash.”</p><p>Levine said that one of the playbooks for <em>Going Rogue</em> is based on the Gilroy version of the character: the Leveraged.</p><p>“Leverage is defined by the fact that someone is forcing them to be here,” she said. “They are being leveraged, but they have something in their heart, and you get to choose during character creation, what it is that challenges even their cynicism.”</p><p>It doesn’t escape Levine’s notice that this is, essentially, the story of Cassian Andor, lead character of the acclaimed Disney+ series <em>Andor</em>, which has just finished its second and final season. Levine said that she thinks that the <em>Andor</em> show made good on the promise of Jyn Erso’s arc, showing how someone can go from being blackmailed into a cause to being so committed that he ends up giving his life for it.</p><figure></figure><p>But <em>Going Rogue</em> aims to do more than just allow players to “fix” <em>Star Wars</em>’s narrative problems. It also allows players to explore this narrative of rebellion without having to interface with an evil entertainment empire: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/andor-star-wars-leftist-radical.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney</a>.</p><p>“I put this whole crowdfunder together in five months because Disney announced that <em>Andor</em> season two was premiering April 22 and [<em>Galactic </em>creator Riley Rethal] and I had always been like, it would probably be good for us, from a business perspective, to release the physical edition around <em>Andor</em>,” Levine said. “So I start putting it together in late December, early January, and then Riley messages me and goes, ‘Did you see that Disney+ is now on the BDS list?’”</p><p>Currently, Disney+ is a priority target on the <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BDS boycott list</a>, which asks supporters of the rights of Palestinians to economically and culturally divest from Israel. Disney+ is a priority target because of Marvel’s <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> and Disney’s <em>Snow White</em>.</p><p>“[These movies] star actors Shira Haas and Gal Gadot, respectively, that have consciously and irrefutably taken up roles as cultural ambassadors for Israel, directly representing genocidal Israel’s propaganda efforts,” the statement on the <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/Guide-to-BDS-Boycott" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BDS website</a> reads. “For <em>Captain America</em>, Marvel and Disney are reviving the racist character of Ruth Bat-Seraph, whose decades-old backstory includes working for Mossad. Disney+ is therefore clearly implicated in enabling Israel’s genocide by<a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/global/palestinian-filmmakers-accuse-hollywood-dehumanizing-gaza-israel-1236120786/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> dehumanizing Palestinians</a>.”</p><p>Jess Levine and Riley Rethal have both <a href="https://bigbadboycott.carrd.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already participated in a boycott</a> meant to pressure a tabletop roleplaying game convention into making a statement against Zionism, and wanted to figure out a way to make this game compliant with the ongoing BDS boycott. Eventually they settled on including a statement about the BDS boycott that encourages people to cancel their Disney+ subscriptions every time they mentioned the Disney-owned <em>Star Wars</em> property. They both found that including that statement led to people leaving comments about canceling their Disney+ subscriptions in solidarity with the BDS boycott.</p><p><em>Going Rogue</em> is an opportunity for <em>Star Wars</em> fans to make the story of <em>Star Wars</em> their own, including making it more in league with their own politics by taking Disney out of it.</p><p><br>“Something I like about tabletop role playing and adaptational tabletop role playing is it says, ‘Actually, fuck them. They don't get to own this thing,’” Levine said. “We can't fully divest from the connection to <em>Star Wars</em>. Obviously, we are downstream of it in certain ways. But we are also trying to say, fuck [Disney’s] ownership of this thing that you love.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/suplex-wrestling-love-letter"><h3>A Love Letter To The Suplex, Wrestling’s Greatest Move</h3></a><p>If you ever get suplexed in real life, you probably deserved it and it was raw as fuck</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/web3-nft-crypto-game-fail-close-scam-snake-oil"><h3>Oh No, Anyway</h3></a><p>'What went wrong?'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wind-breaker-shonen-anime-toxic-masculinity"><h3>This Shonen Anime Fights Toxic Masculinity</h3></a><p>Wind Breaker is a shonen anime where teenage boys talk about their feelings while punching toxic masculinity in the face.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/darumi-amemiya-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-emo-cringe-punk"><h3>The Hundred Line’s Darumi Amemiya Is Mortifying And I Will Defend Her With My Life</h3></a><p>Never before has a character been as embarrassing to be around and while being so relatable</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo-tv-series-show-impressions"><h3>The Last Of Us Season 2 Is Bad Television</h3></a><p>It's not great, whether you've played the game or not</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/suplex-wrestling-love-letter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the international wrestling community, one of the go-to icebreaker questions is asking a fellow fan about their Mt. Rushmore of professional wrestlers. One’s Mt. Rushmore of wrestlers is shaped by wrestling eras, match quality, and nostalgia for iconic performers, all without crowning one over the others. While my Mt. Rushmore shifts from month to month, I’ll never change my mind on the wrestling move I fuck with more than the other 1,000 holds in wrestling: the suplex.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suplex</a> is a wrestling maneuver where a wrestler lifts their opponent into a bridging position before slamming them onto the mat. While it might seem like a basic throw, its deceptive simplicity allows for a wide range of physical expression. Wrestling moves — like words on a webpage — come in different fonts, each infused with a unique style. Before I wax poetic about my favorite suplexes, I will set the stage explaining how wrestling moves come in more permutations than Fanta flavors.&nbsp;</p><h2>Wrestling Moves For Dummies</h2><p>Suplexes and fundamental moves like drivers, powerbombs, busters, and splashes are the bedrock of a wrestler’s arsenal. While anyone can do them, how they're delivered truly sets them apart. A performer’s gimmick, technical prowess, and artistic flair can turn one of these simple maneuvers into a spectacle worth popping out of your chair in unbridled excitement.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Undertaker Finisher - Tombstone Piledriver" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qyJKrP7L-kM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsdG0HyLHP0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Undertaker’s Tombstone Piledriver</a>. It’s a devastating finisher that the WWE’s “Deadman” has performed for three decades because it wins him matches. It begins with a signature throat slash gesture, signaling to the crowd that his opponent is about to meet his end. Taker then flips a dude upside down, cradling their head between his thighs, and spikes them headfirst into the mat. He then methodically crosses their arms like they’re being prepped for a funeral (because they are), and rolls his eyes back at the hard cam — holding the pose unti the referee’s three count seals their kayfabe fate.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kenta Kobashi debuts the burning hammer" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EuEoimAW604?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Despite the Tombstone Piledriver being a certified “move I wouldn’t want to take,” it's far from the riskiest in the grand scheme of wrestling drivers. There’s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLkN6p0Mqf8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Package Piledriver</a>, where a wrestler locks their opponent tightly upside down in the feeble position before drilling them into the mat; the <a href="https://youtu.be/mqDZRZVw4jo?si=qSmNUPKs0e3ZWP5r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canadian Destroyer</a>, a piledriver variant where a wrestler front flips while holding their opponent before driving their head into the ground; or, my personal favorite, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah2e64-VcxQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenta Kobashi’s Burning Hammer</a>, an inverted twist on the Death Valley Driver where instead of flipping his opponent onto their back from a fireman’s carry drop, he spikes them neck-first into the canvas.&nbsp;</p><p>When a wrestler masters a move, it becomes one of their signature moves. If a move reliably results in their victory, it becomes their finishing move. Over time, that move earns a legacy by renaming its modification and variation after the person who perfected it, passing it on to a new generation of wrestlers to add to their toolkits, like <a href="https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=455&amp;gimmick=Jushin+Thunder+Liger" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jushin Thunder Liger</a>’s sit-out powerbomb the “Liger Bomb,” or <a href="https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mitsuharu Misawa</a>’s double underhook powerbomb the <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Wrestling_throws#Tiger_driver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiger Driver</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Suplexes come in different shapes and sizes</h2><p>As mentioned above, wrestling moves are like fonts. But the real magic happens with a move’s modifiers. Like how text can be bolded, italicized, or underlined to change its impact, wrestling moves transform depending on speed, elevation, and execution. And the anatomy of a suplex has a plethora of variations.&nbsp;</p><p>If a wrestler executes a suplex from the top turnbuckle, it transforms into an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srq6iNLtOxo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“avalanche” suplex</a>. If they burst into the suplex without a drawn-out wind-up, prioritizing speed over theatrics, it’s classified as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggn0Ubi6uks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“snap” suplex</a>. Sitting between these two variants is the <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Professional_wrestling_throws#Brainbuster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brainbuster</a>, a suplex with a distinctly brutal twist.&nbsp;</p><p>The Brainbuster, often called a <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Vertical_Suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delayed Vertical Suplex</a>, begins with the wrestler locking their opponent in a front face lock — one hand gripping their hip, the other tucked behind their neck. Unlike a standard suplex that follows a graceful arc, a Brainbuster cuts the rotation short. Instead of rolling into a controlled fall, the wrestler delays the drop and spikes their opponent straight down onto their head in a sheer whiplash-inducing impact.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Top 20 Variations of the Brainbuster" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BN1CHgRialI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><h2>My Favorite Suplexes</h2><p>Now that I’ve thoroughly explained the ins and outs of wrestling throws and the variations of suplexes, here are my all-time favorite suplexes in no particular order.&nbsp;</p><h2>Northern Lights Suplex</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Alicia Fox- Northern Lights Suplex" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJbBP5f3f2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Key qualities for a grade-A <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Suplex#German_suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Northern Lights Suplex</a> are how fluid the rolling motion of the throw is, how high the arch of the offensive wrestler’s bridge is, and most importantly, whether they point their toes into the ground and maintain their balance while executing the move. My favorite Northern Lights Suplex belongs to WWE’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Fox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alicia Fox</a>. Her bridge is beautiful, and she makes the move look like a walk in the park.&nbsp;</p><h2>German Suplex</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Konosuke Takeshita's German Suplex Collection (110+ Clips)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pYHx_Dc1ByI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I said I wasn’t picking favorites here, but the <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Suplex#German_suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">German Suplex</a> is my favorite. I pop off when I see it in other media, like <a href="https://youtu.be/_H0Vf16JYHI?t=1460" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kratos taking an impromptu German Suplex from Baldur in <em>God of War</em></a>. I’m such a slut for a German Suplex that I hoot any time any wrestler executes any kind of variation of this suplex. It can be a deadlift German Suplex, a pop-up German Suplex, or a rolling German Suplex, I don’t care. It’s just something about watching a wrestler slipping under their opponent’s guard, locking their arms around their waist, and snapping their hips into a golden ratio arc into the mat that pleases the caveman wrinkles in my brain. It fucks. Though if I were to pick a favorite wrestler’s German Suplex, it would be my <a href="https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/konosuke-takeshita-and-cinnabon-greatest-love-story-wrestling?utm_source=TW-Fightful&amp;utm_medium=Fightful%20Wrestling%20News&amp;utm_campaign=dlvr.it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cinanbon-loving son</a>, Konosuke Takeshita, who <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/1104609/facts-only-hardcore-fans-know-about-konosuke-takeshita/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote a 20-page college thesis on the move</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Dragon Suplex</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Mayu Iwatani - Bridging Dragon Suplex compilation" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UJ-69MKqIUs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Suplex#Dragon_suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Suplex</a> is synonymous with Former Stardom-turned Marigold Ace Joshi pro wrestler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayu_Iwatani" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayu Iwatani</a>. The move is like a standard German suplex but has stages like the Power Rangers assembling the Megazord. First, she props her opponent up in a belly-to-back suplex position. While having them suspended in the air, she locks them in a full nelson and snaps them back, neck-first into the mat. Sometimes, if she’s feeling fancy, Iwatani will bridge her back and point her toes into the ground. However, it doesn’t happen often because Iwatani is a sicko who goes incredibly hard in her matches, often crumpling into a heap after delivering super kicks, so she’ll sometimes just settle for hitting the move and crumpling in exhaustion until the three-count sounds her victory.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tiger Suplex</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Perfect Tiger Suplex from Tiger Mask IV" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uBX-FAKf2YY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Suplex#Tiger_suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiger Suplex</a> is another variant of the German Suplex. Its uniqueness lies in how wrestlers set up their opponents before slamming them into the mat. Instead of locking their opponents from their waist or from a full nelson position, the Tiger Suplex has an offensive wrestler lock their adversary from the inside of their elbow, the cubital fossa if you will, from the belly-to-back position before foisting them from the earth and dropping them from a high angle on their shoulders and neck. The kayfabe psychology of the suplex, and other moves restricting an opponent's arms, is that it would prevent them from breaking their fall, making the impact more devastating. I think it’s neat that suplexes are an equal opportunity naming convention for animals.&nbsp;</p><h2>C4 Bakudan Suplex</h2><p><a href="https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=16564&amp;gimmick=AZM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AZM</a> (pronounced Azumi)’s suplex is so complex that it has its unique name. In fighting game lingo, the <a href="https://x.com/WhirlingAndy/status/1813541450304692356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C4 Bakudan Suplex</a> (or C4 Bomb) is like a command grab counter move. After deflecting a front kick from her opponent, AZM dips under their guard while folding their kicking leg to their hip like they were crossing their legs like a cool guy. After which, she performs a German Suplex. Yes, it's just a German Suplex with the bare minimum of extra steps, but the velocity with which “High Speed Bomb Girl” executes the move gets all the brownie points from me.&nbsp;</p><h2>Twilight Dream</h2><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Tam Nakano delivers a tiger suplex setting up the debut of her "Twilight Dream" finisher. 💫</p><p>Kagetsu vs. Tam Nakano<br>STARDOM at the Korakuen Hall<br>9th Anniversary Show (January 19th, 2020) <a href="https://t.co/o6jXjUyEob">pic.twitter.com/o6jXjUyEob</a></p></div>— nimbus ✨ (@surfingnimbus) <a href="https://twitter.com/surfingnimbus/status/1601126459158200320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2022</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>The Twilight Dream is one of the more complicated suplexes on this list. Still, the fluidity of its chain wrestling-eque use case from retired Stardom wrestler <a href="https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=18648&amp;gimmick=Tam+Nakano" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tam Nakano</a> makes it one of those stunning wrestling flourishes in technicality that it makes the list. The move sees the “Top Kawaii of the Cosmos” wrestler place her opponent in a combination of a hammerlock and seatbelt wrist hold, fastening their arms to the front and back of their waist, leaving no room to escape, before hoisting them up for a suplex. She typically punctuates the move by holding her back in a bridge and anchoring her tippy toes into the mat like the showoffy idol she is, and I love her for it.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ocean Cyclone Suplex&nbsp;</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Manami Toyota's Japanese Ocean Cyclone Suplex" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yos3DFvNRlk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><br><a href="https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=2265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minami Toyota</a>’s <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Manami_Toyota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ocean Cyclone Suplex</a> is what happens when a German Suplex meets an <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Electric_chair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electric Chair</a> (the wrestling move). After crossing her opponent's arms like a straitjacket while holding them in a belly-to-back position, then she lifts them, tucking her head between their thighs. The moment she has them up, she slams them back into the mat.
