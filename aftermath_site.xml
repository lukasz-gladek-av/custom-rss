            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I woke up early this morning and, like most mornings, the first thing I did was check my phone for work messages, which mostly just means catching up on <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-political-violence-new-york-times-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what fresh horrors have taken place in the United States while I've been asleep</a>. The second thing I did was open Facebook to answer some Marketplace questions, where I was greeted with something that made me wonder whether I'd actually woken up at all.<br></p><p>I don't read The Independent, and am on record as being <em>extremely </em>scared of Lego Adults, so I have no idea why I was served that story. But seeing that image turn up on the social media page of a large, established newspaper stopped me dead in my tracks.</p><p>Deahas thed Star.</p><p>The more I looked over the words (or word, since only one of them is actually a word), the more I wondered: what the fuck happened here? We live in an age where job cuts in the media industry have become so commonplace that copy editors, once the backbone of newspapers the world over, are now an endangered species. So this could just be a typo on the image that slipped through because some underpaid social media person was having a bad day, or because the story's author had also been responsible for "socialing" the post and got sloppy in the middle of all the admin that requires (relatable, since we all post our own stories on social media here as well!).</p><p>Deahas thed Star.</p><p>That doesn't feel like a regular typo though. It's not an autocorrect either. You can see where the words "Death Star" are <em>supposed </em>to be, but the way it all falls apart in the middle--even the double space between "thed" and "Star"--makes it seem unlikely it's just a slip of the keyboard. Like it's <em>so bad</em> that even the most cursory glance--like I managed at 6am in bed!--could have seen something was wrong, if not while typing it then at least once it had been published. Say it out loud and it doesn't even sound like modern English, it sounds more like:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Eowyn Sing At Theodred Funeral - LOTR The Two Towers (Extended Edition)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KV-2sgxnF8c?start=46&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>We also live in an age of AI slop, and an ownership class that is absolutely frothing at the mouth to automate as much of the media business as it can. Maybe this alphabetical casserole was instead a result of an AI-generated social media post shitting the bed in the middle of a sentence before recovering to nail the landing? But then is that really how it works? The tell-tale signs of AI writing are usually stuff like generic phrasing and a weird tone, not the structural collapse of a single word. And while The Independent <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/service/how-and-why-we-use-ai-at-the-independent-b2685631.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has confirmed it uses AI as a publication (without specifying what <em>for</em>, exactly)</a>, it also says anything made by AI gets signed off by a human, and I refuse to believe anyone employed by a newspaper would miss something like “Deahas thed Star”.</p><p>So I'm at a loss. I, someone who has been writing, editing and being edited professionally for nearly two decades, have finally found a typo so bad it's making me question whether the word "typo" is even enough anymore. This isn't that. It's something else. Something beyond, that I think for any or all of the reasons above we could only see on Facebook, for a newspaper's social media post, in 2025.</p><p>I think the worst thing about it though, worse than the way "Deahas thed Star" will be stuck in my head like a thorn for the rest of the week, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline/posts/the-mammoth-9000-piece-lego-death-star-features-38-minifigures-the-most-ambitiou/1293700442785946/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is the fact that at time of writing this story the original Facebook post has been live for <em>15 hours</em> and hasn't been fixed</a>. Which suggests that there aren't just mistakes being made on The Independent's production line, but that there's nobody answering the phone or even looking things over at the other end, either. If I'd made a typo that bad I'd have been harassed in my DMs almost <em>instantly</em>, mostly by my peers but also by well-meaning readers. Yet this thing, this unshaped clay lump of a sentence, looks like it's going to sit there for a day or more, maybe forever, leading more and more commenters like poor Gordon here to have to ask:</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-political-violence-new-york-times-eulogy"><h3>OK, But You Do Know You’re Eulogizing Charlie Kirk, Right?</h3></a><p>Are we talking about the same guy, NYT, MSNBC, and Gavin Newsom?</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/signal-rolls-secure-after-i-detleted-my-signal-history"><h3>Signal Rolls Out Secure Backups Just After I Had To Nuke My Message History</h3></a><p>Signal is allowing users to opt-in to secure backups in their beta, one of their most requested features.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday afternoon, conservative political activist Charlie Kirk was shot during a stop on his “American Comeback” tour at Utah Valley University. He <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/death-charlie-kirk-lays-bare-deep-us-political-divisions-2025-09-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">died shortly after</a>. In the 24 hours that followed, liberal news networks, publications, and politicians have tripped over themselves to eulogize Kirk, with the New York Times’ Ezra Klein <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/opinion/charlie-kirk-assassination-fear-politics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claiming</a> that Kirk was “practicing politics the right way,” while California podcaster-in-chief Gavin Newsom <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/governor.ca.gov/post/3lyjajnblcs25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> "the best way to honor Charlie's memory is to continue his work: engage with each other, across ideology, through spirited discourse.”&nbsp;</p><p>After MSNBC analyst Matthew Dowd noted, quite reasonably, that "hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions,” the network <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/msnbc-fires-matthew-dowd-charlie-kirk-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired him</a>. The New York Yankees, neither a publication nor a politician, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/yankees/2025/09/10/yankees-charlie-kirk-moment-of-silence/86085914007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">held a moment of silence</a> for Kirk.</p><p>These are just a handful of examples. Conspicuously, many such teary-eyed odes neglect to quote or substantially discuss the views of the man himself.

But Kirk knew how to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/09/charlie-kirk-shooting/684173/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cozy up to power</a> and work the algorithm – the only two skills you need to gain influence in a landscape where viewership, as opposed to expertise or a legitimate desire to better your community, is king. This is a system that makes monsters, encourages them to run rampant, and then scratches its head at the carnage they’ve caused. It is ill-equipped to grapple with the age-old adage “what goes around comes around,” because that would require accepting a measure of culpability.</p><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/charlie-kirk-video-graphic-online-social-media-6cfd4dfde356b960aeea69c01ea3ec34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many saw images of gruesome violence</a> in their algorithmically generated feeds. Some expressed outrage, acting as though this was an anomaly, and perhaps it was. Perhaps they have not spent the past almost-two years opening Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram or whatever else and being greeted by images of charred Palestinian children. Maybe the endless stream of unspeakable darkness has made them numb. Or maybe, like many pundits and elected officials, they are aware of the horrors visited upon Gaza, but to them, those are acceptable losses – bodies, but not real people. State violence is the background hum of this country, after all. It does not count as the “<a href="https://x.com/BernieSanders/status/1965867418863235410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">political violence</a>” so many politicians and pundits rushed to decry yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Kirk’s death, like much of his life, took place on a stage. Despite the artificiality of such a setting, that makes him <em>more </em>real to some Americans – and clearly to those eulogizing him. More real than the Democratic lawmaker and her husband who were <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/after-two-day-manhunt-suspect-charged-shooting-two-minnesota-lawmakers-and-their-spouses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killed just a few months ago</a>. More real than the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/people-killed-us-boat-strike-were-not-tren-de-aragua-venezuela-minister-says-2025-09-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">11 people killed last week by the US</a> government in what was almost certainly an illegal strike on a boat in the Caribbean. More real than <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/palestinian-death-toll-in-gaza-passes-64000-officials-say-after-ceasefire-talks-break-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tens</a> of thousands – or, more likely, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/8/gaza-toll-could-exceed-186000-lancet-study-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds</a> of thousands – of Palestinian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/aug/21/revealed-israeli-militarys-own-data-indicates-civilian-death-rate-of-83-in-gaza-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">civilians</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Kirk’s violent rhetoric helped shape this world, and yet, it has been deemed “civil” by those on both sides of the political divide. This is the mark of a sick society, one that is perfectly fine with an unconscionable body count as long as none of the disfigured, barely recognizable faces are ones we know from a screen. Some of the pundits fake-crying for Kirk probably found his views privately appalling. Again, networks made the deliberate <em>choice </em>to shy away from engaging with the substance of his debates. They were almost certainly aware, at least on some level, of the kinds of things he regularly said. But that didn’t matter. They had to put on a show. The show, after all, is what keeps the meat grinder that is America moving, and it must – at all costs – go on.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lego-death-star-9000-pieces"><h3>Deahas thed Star</h3></a><p>Dorth Stor?
