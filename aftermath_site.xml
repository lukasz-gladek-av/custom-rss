            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>We’ve just crested the hill of 2026’s third week, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-halifax-closed-weeks-after-unionizing-cwa-canada/"><u>once</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/meta-ubisoft-unity-layoffs-2026/"><u>again</u></a>, it’s time for another helping of dire Ubisoft news. Making previous weeks’ layoffs look like mere throat clearing, the company today announced a “major organizational, operational and portfolio reset” that will result in more layoffs, as well as delays and cancellations – most prominently of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delay-ubisoft-1850470554?ref=aftermath.site"><u>long-embattled <em>Prince of Persia</em> remake</u></a>, which is now dust in the wind. But on the bright side, we’re also getting something no one asked for: a greater investment in "player-facing Generative AI.” Oh, and more live service swings from the publisher that has repeatedly failed to get out of its own way with <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-studio-closure-layoffs/"><u>games like <em>XDefiant</em></u></a><em> </em>and <em>Skull and Bones</em>.</p><p>In <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a release published today</u></a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot – who remains in charge despite demonstrably no longer being the man for the job – announced the formation of five “creative houses” that will each focus on specific genres and series. These sound significantly more self-contained than the global, multi-studio efforts that defined Ubisoft’s previous era. They will break down as follows:</p><blockquote>- CH1 (Vantage Studios), focused on scaling and extending Ubisoft’s largest and established franchises to turn them into annual billionaire brands; Brands: <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>Rainbow Six</em></blockquote><blockquote>- CH2 dedicated to competitive and cooperative shooter experiences; Brands including <em>The Division</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, <em>Splinter Cell</em></blockquote><blockquote>- CH3 designed to operate a roster of select, sharp Live experiences; Brands including <em>For Honor</em>, <em>The Crew</em>, <em>Riders Republic</em>, <em>Brawlhalla</em>, <em>Skull &amp; Bones</em></blockquote><blockquote>- CH4 dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes; Brands including <em>Anno</em>, <em>Might &amp; Magic</em>, <em>Rayman</em>, <em>Prince of Persia</em>, <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em></blockquote><blockquote>- CH5 focused on reclaiming position in casual and family-friendly games. Brands including <em>Just Dance</em>,<em> Idle Miner Tycoon</em>, <em>Ketchapp</em>, <em>Hungry Shark</em>,<em> Invincible: Guarding the Globe</em>, <em>Uno</em>, Hasbro</blockquote><p>Each creative house will have “end-to-end responsibility for its portfolio, overseeing the full creative and brand scope from development to publishing (brand, marketing and sales go-to-market strategy)” and “will also be financially accountable, both in terms of [profit and loss] and cash generation.” Ubisoft believes this still-convoluted-sounding structure will “sharpen strategic focus, reinforce execution discipline, and ensure that investment decisions will be taken closer to where value is created.” I guess we’ll see!</p><p>Vantage, you’ll remember, was formed last year in conjunction with Tencent, from which Ubisoft <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796?ref=aftermath.site"><u>received a $1.25 billion bailout</u></a>. One of its co-CEOs is Guillemot’s son, who is <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-ceo-charlie-guillemot/"><u>definitely not a nepo baby</u></a>. All of this reshuffling will come at a steep cost – to people who are not part of the Guillemot family, of course.</p><p>“To put the Creative Houses in the best conditions to succeed, we decided to refocus our portfolio with a meaningfully revised 3-year roadmap and accelerate our cost reductions initiatives to rightsize the organization,” Guillemot wrote. “We will discontinue several projects currently in development and provide additional time to certain games, to ensure enhanced quality and maximize long term value. We will also selectively close several studios and continue restructurings throughout the Group. While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organization over the long term.”</p><p>A total of six games have been canceled, including <em>Prince of Persia</em> and four unannounced games, three of which were new IP. Definitely a sign of a company with <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-franchises-ip-sony-ea/"><u>a bright, bold future</u></a> ahead of it! Four new IPs remain in development, while seven games have been delayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not clear yet how many people will be laid off – in addition to those who already lost their jobs earlier this month – but the damage will likely be significant. As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3mcxcxiwki22r?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Game File’s Stephen Totilo pointed out</u></a>, a previous €300 million cost reduction plan has resulted in a total headcount decline of over 3,000 at Ubisoft. Now the company is planning for €200 million more in cuts by March 2028.&nbsp;</p><p>Employees who manage to dodge the scythe might still end up leaving of (what could charitably be called) their own accord, as Ubisoft is also largely putting an end to remote work.</p><p>“To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to five days per week on site for all teams, complemented by an annual allowance of working-from-home days,” Ubisoft wrote. “This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams.”</p><p>Game workers at other companies have referred to this approach as a form of “<a href="https://aftermath.site/activision-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-mandate-that-they-see-as-soft-layoffs/"><u>soft layoff</u></a>” that disproportionately targets disabled and immunocompromised people, but maybe things will be different at Ubisoft, a company that has repeatedly <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-ai-teammates-im-so-tired/"><u>stepped on rakes</u></a> while trying to follow the rest of the industry. That in mind, I’d like to close out with a selection of recent headlines about Ubisoft. Feel free to form your own conclusions.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/meta-ubisoft-unity-layoffs-2026/"><div><p>Bad Day</p><p>Two weeks into the year, too many layoffs</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-halifax-closed-weeks-after-unionizing-cwa-canada/"><div><p>Ubisoft Halifax Union To ‘Pursue Every Legal Recourse’ After Studio Closes Weeks After Union Vote</p><p>“We will be looking for Ubisoft to show us that this had nothing to do with the employees joining a union,” a Ubisoft Halifax worker said.</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Nicole Carpenter</span></p></div></a></figure><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-ai-teammates-im-so-tired/"><div><p>Ubisoft, Face Covered In Bruises, Once Again Confidently Extends Foot Towards End Of Rake</p><p>‘The team is aware of the criticisms around AI in games’</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/this-is-where-my-anno-117-impressions-were-going-to-go/"><div><p>[This Is Where My Anno 117 Impressions Were Going To Go]</p><p>‘[Our artists] use AI tools for iterations, prototyping, and exploration’</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-reconstruction-era-klansmen-cancelled-kkk/"><div><p>Ubisoft Could Not Have Handled A Reconstruction Era Assassin’s Creed - Aftermath</p><p>The developers?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Three of game studio That's No Moon's co-founders are suing another co-founder for allegedly hijacking the company’s website domain name—taking the website offline and disabling employee access to email accounts, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/985076973/That-s-No-Moon-Ex-CEO-Hijacked-Domain-Other-Founders-Say-In-Lawsuit-via-Aftermath?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to a new lawsuit</u></a>.</p><p>Tina Kowalewski, Taylor Kurosaki, and Nick Kononelos filed a complaint against co-founder and former CEO Michael Mumbauer on Tuesday in a California court. That's No Moon, which was founded in 2020 by veterans of Infinity Ward, Naughty Dog, and other AAA studios, said in its complaint that Mumbauer is looking to "cripple" the studio after being fired in 2022. "[Mumbauer]—resentful about his termination—has waged a harassment campaign that has included threatening a TNM executive and their family and sporadic but persistent efforts to cripple TNM's business."</p><p>Mumbauer, according to the complaint, purchased the domain name, and several others, when the studio was founded; it said both parties agreed these would be controlled by the studio. Mumbauer allegedly still has access to the domains, and That's No Moon said he took control over the website on Jan. 6, disabled the studio's access, and turned off employees’ ability to email external addresses. The team was locked out for two days as a four-person IT team worked to get the services back online.&nbsp;</p><p>On the public-facing side, the website briefly redirected to the Travel Switzerland page, according to the complaint. That's No Moon's lawyers said the co-founders sent Mumbauer a letter on Jan. 7 demanding he "relinquish his unauthorized access." That's when, according to the compliant, the website started redirecting to a GoDaddy Auction site, where the domain was priced at $6,666,666; That's No Moon remarked in the complaint: "A number that [Mumbauer] may well have selected for its Satanic connotation."</p><p>As of Wednesday, Aftermath was able to access a public-facing That's No Moon website using both the original domain and the new one. That's No Moon did not respond to Aftermath's request for comment by time of publishing.</p><p>"Business partners, gamers, and employee candidates were left wondering whether TNM had simply shut down, or whether the company had fired executives who were suddenly unreachable by e-mail," lawyers wrote in the complaint. That's No Moon also said in the complaint that the email lockout interrupted communications with HR providers, "resulting in missed payroll reminders and invoices."</p><p>That's No Moon immediately created a new domain (ThatsNoMoon.co) and moved its website over, per the complaint. This whole debacle, allegedly, cost the company more than $1 million in January—and, as of the complaint's filing on Tuesday, Mumbauer allegedly still has control over the domain. That's why the studio is asking to get back access and for damages related to the costs of the new domains and other harm. Per the complaint, the original domain names cost around $2,836, which That's No Moon said it reimbursed Mumbauer for.</p><p>That's No Moon fired Mumbauer in 2022, it said, because he "leaked confidential and sensitive information to the media and to competitors." After leaving That's No Moon, Mumbauer allegedly denied requests from the That's No Moon IT team to hand over the domain access. The company tried to get access from an arbitrator in 2023, but was denied because of a lack of trademark registrations.</p><p>Lawyers said Mumbauer had been harassing the company and its executives for years, and that they and their families "fear for their safety." From the complaint:</p><p><em>Following his termination from TNM in 2022, Defendant posted disruptive comments on social media alluding to the company and team members. He threatened litigation against TNM over fabricated claims about his termination. Even more significantly, he threatened a member of the TNM leadership team whom he blames for his departure through text messages. In one instance, Defendant texted the executive, “This is not going to end well for you. Trust me.” Defendant has continued to send threatening texts as late as last year—over three years after his termination. On information and belief, Defendant used an unknown phone number to contact the executive on April 24, 2025, texting, “Hope your family is well. They deserve all the stability you can provide Brute,” followed by a winking emoji. Moreover, Defendant revealed TNM’s confidential business information on multiple different occasions, violating the NDA he had signed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><p>The charges listed as part of this lawsuit are trademark infringement, cybersquatting, computer fraud, conversion, trespass to chattels, and breach of contract. That's No Moon also asked a judge for a temporary restraining order to prevent Mumbauer from continued access to the domains.</p><p>Mumbauer has not responded to Aftermath's request for comment. Mumbauer said, in an email to That's No Moon attorney Amit Rana published as part of the lawsuit, that he intends to file "a wrongful termination countersuit and will be seeking extensive damages."</p><p>That's No Moon was founded in 2020 <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-smilegate-poured-usd100m-into-thats-no-moon-and-its-aaa-veterans?ref=aftermath.site"><u>and formally announced in 2021</u></a>. It billed itself as a triple A studio from veteran developers from studios like Infinity Ward, Bungie, Sony Santa Monica, and Naughty Dog developers. That's No Moon hasn't yet announced its first game, but has said the game is led by creative director Taylor Kurosaki and game director Jacob Minkoff. South Korean publisher Smilegate invested $100 million into the company, That's No Moon announced in 2021. The company said, in its announcement in 2021, that it hoped to reach 100 employees by 2022. It’s listed as having 51 to 200 employees <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/thats-no-moon-entertainment/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>on LinkedIn</u></a> and, though it’s been publicly quiet for several years, appears to be hiring.</p><p><strong>Update: </strong>This story has been updated to include additional details.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I was listening to a surprisingly combative interview with Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan yesterday and amidst all the usual, expected stuff--like his general AI delusions and bizarre evasion of the question "what video game are you playing right now?"--I was struck by one response in particular, about subscription costs.</p><figure><a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview?utm_content=buffer84bd2&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bsky.app&amp;utm_campaign=verge_social"><div><p>Gamers will learn to love AI, says Razer CEO</p><p>Razer’s Min-Liang Tan on AI backlash, partnering with Grok, and the future of gaming.</p><p><span>Nilay Patel</span></p></div></a></figure><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview?utm_content=buffer84bd2&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bsky.app&amp;utm_campaign=verge_social"><u>Asked by The Verge's Nilay Patel whether he truly sees value in subscribing to AI platforms</u></a>, Tan says he sees value in all kinds of subscriptions. Here's a transcript of the part I'm talking about:</p><blockquote><strong>Patel: Are you seeing signs that the AI stuff is gonna be worth paying for that way? I mean, this is the bubble. We’re gonna spend all this money, we’ll forward invest in all this infrastructure. We’re gonna skyrocket the price of RAM and GPUs, and then at the end of the day, people are going to say, “That’s not actually worth the 20 bucks a month.”</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tan:</strong> I don’t necessarily see it as AI, per se, but I see the kind of value that I get out of it. So, for example, a ChatGPT subscription, or a Grok subscription, for that matter. I do see value in it, and that’s why I pay for it. And that’s the way I see it. I don’t see myself as paying for AI, per se. I see it as what am I getting out of a chatbot, for example, that can advise me on travel matters, health matters, whatever it is, my day-to-day, and stuff like that. Is that worth 20 bucks to me?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Because you’re a billionaire, right?</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Sure.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>I’m just saying, the marginal cost is meaningless to you.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>20 bucks is still 20 bucks, that’s right.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>I’m just saying.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Right.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>I think for a lot of people, that is meaningful, especially stacked on top of all the other money they pay. Basically, I’m saying, do you see that critique of AI as a bubble? That the investment has not yet delivered the value that will make it so obvious that the investment’s worth it?</strong></blockquote><blockquote>So I see that. I mean, huge amounts of investments are going into it. We are investing in AI, I think, as we speak. But I do see the potential at this point. In many cases, I mean, look at the number of paid subscribers for ChatGPT, for example. People do see the value in terms of whether it’s a chatbot AI, so on and so forth. I do think the potential is going to be realized.</blockquote><p>"Because you’re a billionaire" has stuck with me. Tan is one of many billionaires at the vanguard of the AI push, empty men whose only reference point and purpose in life is seemingly to make a line go up for as long as possible. And that push, as it stands, is almost entirely reliant on platforms like ChatGPT and Grok going from free, idle curiosities<a href="https://www.getmonetizely.com/blogs/the-subprime-ai-crisis-how-ed-zitrons-warning-reveals-the-path-to-sustainable-aisaas-pricing?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>to something millions of people pay a substantial amount of money for every month</u></a>.</p><p>I am not a billionaire, but I am a guy reliant on people paying a monthly subscription for something people used to get for free, and let me tell you: good luck guys. At its height in the 2010s, I was writing for an audience at Kotaku that could number between 20-30 million people every month. I am now co-founder of a website that, asking for $7 in return for video game blogs, has 5000 paying subscribers (<a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/" rel="noreferrer">thank you everyone</a>!).</p><p>That math works out for me because I am a normal person with normal person obligations like bills and groceries.<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/why-everybody-is-losing-money-on-ai/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>It absolutely does not work out for companies that are on the hook for billions in data centre and loans</u></a>, let alone<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-17/musk-seeks-up-to-134-billion-damages-from-openai-microsoft?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>lawsuits and licensing disputes</u></a>. To even entertain the thought that the AI bubble could be propped up in any way by subscription costs, let alone commit your entire business model to it,<a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-percent-chatgpt-users-pay?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>is insane to a normal person</u></a>!</p><p>But these aren't normal people. They're billionaires. And hearing Tan say "I do see value in it, and that’s why I pay for it", oblivious to what subscription costs (and fatigue) means to the average person on the street, made me think of this famous (if you're into basketball) line from Dwyane Wade's wife Gabrielle Union, where she explains how the multi-millionaire former pro athlete had no idea how much milk cost when he retired:</p><figure><blockquote>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bsjtqz/wades_wife_gabrielle_union_says_he_doesnt_know/?ref=aftermath.site">Wade's wife Gabrielle Union says he doesn't know how much milk costs or what happens at car washes: "He has no idea how much milk costs. He's like 'what is that, like $20?'"</a><br> by
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deadskin/?ref=aftermath.site">u/deadskin</a> in
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/?ref=aftermath.site">nba</a>
</blockquote>
</figure><p>That's a cute story!<a href="https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/40205465/dwyane-wade-inspired-daughter-unveils-new-transgender-youth-support-community?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Dwyane Wade seems like a nice guy</u></a>, and I'm sure he now knows exactly how much milk costs. He was not, like Tan, a billionaire entirely divorced from the common human experience, trying to force a lake-boiling, job-displacing plagiarism machine on the world against its collective wishes.</p><p>There are a lot of ideas going around right now about how we can best curb the power of the billionaire class. Capping personal incomes, increasing taxes and tighter regulation of the share markets are all good places to start, but maybe I can add another one on top (they'd have to do this as well as pay more tax): every person who earns over 999 million has to spend a year stuck with the rest of us, doing what amounts to community service, in so much as it forces them to be part of a <em>community</em>. They have to draw from a median salary, pay a mortgage, feed kids, commute to work and navigate the healthcare system, without their billions or associated support network to bail them out.</p><p>Let's see what dipshits like Tan think about subscription costs for AI slop when $20 is three hours' work. If that job hasn't been replaced with AI already.</p>
