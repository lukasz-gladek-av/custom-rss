            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sony-new-playstation-handheld-ps5-umd<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bloomberg is<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reporting</a> that Sony, fresh off the failure of the PlayStation Portal and having had eight years to survey the success of the Nintendo Switch, is <em>maybe </em>planning on launching a more serious handheld device. One that, instead of letting you beam your PS5 games to a portable screen, would just let you play PS5 games on the handheld directly.</p><p>The report, which is pretty thin, says that the Portal itself was once planned to be a standalone gaming handheld, like its predecessors the PSP and Vita. The fact it wasn't is probably what has most doomed it, something Sony is maybe taking onboard with these plans for a new handheld, plans that Bloomberg couch by saying are years away, and may not ever come to fruition at all.</p><p>Maybe they will, maybe they won't! I for one want them to though, and not just because both of Sony's previous dedicated handhelds were great portable gaming devices. It's because a new device--which I'm going to call the PlayStation Portalble until I'm ordered to stop--might be arriving at a moment in history when I can ask for the return of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Media_Disc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universal Media Disc</a> and have it not be a complete joke.</p><p>A device like this would be years away, for reasons like the fact the battery capacity for handheld PS5 games just isn't there yet; even the Steam Deck can only last a few hours, and its games can be fully scaled via their PC settings. A PS5 game just trying to <em>run </em>would be like going back in time to the Game Gear, chewing through entire packs of batteries by the minute. So there's time for this thing to arrive, for internal hardware to get smaller, for batteries to get more economical. Time for things to change, for trends to take shape.</p><p>If years away, it could be arriving at a time when the market, having long drifted towards the convenience of digital purchases--as evidenced by Sony's own PS5 re-release--would be having not just second thoughts about forever renting content, but third and fourth as well.<a href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/media/why-physical-media-is-having-a-moment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Physical media is coming back</a>, baby, and there wouldn't be many companies better poised to capitalise on a desire for proprietary physical media than Sony, the company that brought us everything from Betamax to the Blu-Ray to the...UMD.</p><p>With internal space at a premium in a handheld gaming device, storage expensive and money to be made selling weird discs that you also happen to be the only one making, the UMD's return would be <em>triumphant</em>. Watching a full-sized PS5 disc get awkwardly sucked into a PS5 is an unfulfilling experience. Slamming a UMD that contains a miniaturised PS5 game into the back of a new Sony handheld would <em>rule</em>. Especially if, like the original UMD, a successor format didn't just contain games, but movies as well!</p><p>Will any of this actually happen? Probably not! The device itself might not even get made, and even if it did, there's a greater chance it would be digital-only, because we live in hell. But a man can still dream. Of simpler times, and discs that came in cartridges, and the chance for Sony to re-release <em>The Last Of Us</em> for the 17th time...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-rumble-conor-mcgregor-hitman<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What a time it is to be an irredeemably awful rich dude. Aside from, you know, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/24/trump-picks-sexual-misconduct-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the obvious stuff</a>, dudes who should be mocked, derided, and generally excluded from polite society are getting up to all sorts of activities right now. Why, just today, streamer Guy “Dr Disrespect” Beahm and UFC fighter Conor McGregor, both known for being all bluster and no bite, faced the consequences of their respective sexual misconduct allegations – one more so than the other.</p><p>Today Beahm, demonetized on YouTube and booted from his own company after he was <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of (and partially confessed to)</a> exchanging inappropriate DMs with a minor, <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1861071895484879274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that he’s struck a deal with Rumble, the very bottom of the internet’s conspiracy-spackled slop barrel. This follows unsuccessful attempts at bargaining with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/15/a-dr-disrespect-kick-deal-would-be-a-waste-of-money-say-co-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kick</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DrDisrespectLive/comments/1gd1y71/youtube_suspends_dr_disrespects_requests_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>.</p><p>“Rumble is in a new era, and I’m laser-focused on expanding into two categories: gaming and crypto,” Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski said in a statement received by Aftermath. “Dr Disrespect will give a much-needed injection into our gaming category.”</p><p>The statement goes on to note that Beahm has entered into an agreement that “includes equity with milestones as a majority of its compensation,” so presumably, Rumble is hoping Beahm will help grow the platform, possibly by using his other channels as a funnel the way many Kick streamers do. Beahm will also “lead Rumble Gaming, acting as an advisor and helping to build the Rumble Gaming community,” which is a funny thing to say, because I can’t think of many instances where advisors were also de facto leaders, but whatever.</p><p>This was a predictable outcome, so much so that I predicted it <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right after Beahm began looking cooked</a> in June. At the time, I wrote:</p><blockquote><p>On Kick, Rumble, and in certain corners of YouTube, there’s something akin to an alternate universe of streamers, one that grew out of Twitch’s earlier, edgier tendencies but which that company has since sought to squelch. The core appeal of these creators is their ability to get away with shit. To harass and bother, to say the most out-of-pocket things they can think of, to push limits until all lines in the sand have eroded.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s obvious trainwreck appeal here, but some fans also look to these creators aspirationally, as a sort of avatar. If a big content creator can embrace an unhinged lifestyle and get whatever they want, maybe viewers can too. These sorts of viewers will always support somebody like Beahm, a 42-year-old man who behaves like a 16-year-old boy, because they see themselves in him. And though Beahm will probably lose viewership over this in aggregate regardless of whether he stays on YouTube or ends up somewhere else, the viewers who stick around will likely become bigger fans than ever. Because ultimately, this is not about morals or principles; it’s about people forming such a strong attachment to a creator that they feel like attacks against him are attacks against them as well and platforms that recognize they’ll make more money than they’ll lose by harnessing that ugly energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So Dr Disrespect is cooked in that he’s losing deals, sponsors, and an entire company, as well as his reputation as somebody who has not engaged in inappropriate conversation with a minor, a stunningly low bar to clear. He’s cooked in the mainstream sense. But he’s made a calculation that he can step away, take a breather, and return to an online audience large enough to continue supporting him. And he’s probably right.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Since returning to the significantly-dimmed limelight, Beahm has only leaned in to the idea that he’s the victim of a grand conspiracy to undermine his success, so he’ll fit right in on Rumble, a <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/11/20/twitch-kick-streaming-hours-watch-time-stats-streamlabs-stream-hatchet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vastly smaller platform</a> than Twitch, YouTube, or even Kick, one where mainstream castoffs like Russell Brand <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2024-04-29/russell-brand-baptized-christianity-rape-sexual-assault-allegations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flirt with fascism <em>and </em>The Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/laura-loomer-pawsitive-pet-food-b2615820.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a nonzero number of Trump associates eat dog food</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This will briefly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/rumble-rum-soars-after-inking-streaming-deal-with-dr-disrespect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">serve as good marketing</a> for Rumble before everyone stops caring in a week, at which point the internet’s far-right sinkhole will be out who-knows-how-many millions of dollars, because a single streamer, no matter how large, <a href="https://x.com/HUN2R/status/1861077598773584140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cannot generate the kind of revenue needed</a> to make up for these big money deals. <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/09/05/some-big-streamers-are-leaving-youtube-for-twitch-does-data-say-thats-the-right-move/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If trends hold</a>, Beahm will likely stream on Rumble until the conclusion of his contract and then go elsewhere, to whichever platform boasts the largest livestreaming audience – assuming he’s no longer radioactive in everybody’s eyes by that point. And who knows: Given how <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/influencers-coming-out-trump-supporters.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companies, brands, and influencers are already acting</a> in the wake of Trump’s reelection, he might be welcomed with open arms in a couple years.</p><p>On the other end of the shitty rich dude spectrum, Conor McGregor is at least having a sort-of bad time. The target of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/conor-mcgregor-ufc-champion-timeline-arrests-abuse-1234772835/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous assault allegations</a>, one finally stuck last week, with a Dublin High Court jury <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2024/11/22/24303310/report-conor-mcgregor-found-liable-of-sexual-assault-in-civil-case-ordered-to-pay-250k-in-damages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finding him liable for a sexual assault</a> that took place in 2018. He’s now on the hook for around $250,000 in damages, which is chump change to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2021/05/12/the-worlds-10-highest-paid-athletes-conor-mcgregor-leads-a-group-of-sports-stars-unfazed-by-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the highest-paid athletes in the world</a>, but at least we get to see him <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2024/11/22/24303376/conor-mcgregor-issues-statement-after-being-found-liable-of-sexual-assault-in-civil-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">throw a big ol’ baby fit about it</a>. Also, he’s been removed from <em>Hitman</em>, which contained a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_bhqjDDgus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mission</a> that saw Agent 47 stalk and assassinate the UFC’s gibbering-has-been-weight champion.</p><p>“In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately,” <em>Hitman </em>studio IO Interactive <a href="https://x.com/Hitman/status/1861049881160273921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a>. “We take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr. McGregor from our storefronts starting today.”</p><p>On a long enough timescale, I imagine McGregor’s career prospects will look a lot like Beahm’s, except with many, many more zeroes on his checks. Historically, the UFC has not only turned a blind eye to assault perpetrators but <a href="https://defector.com/dana-white-hits-his-wife-at-a-club" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embraced them</a>, offering <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2018/06/no-the-greg-hardy-situation-isnt-about-second-chances-or-redemption-its-about-money" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposed second chances</a> after athletes paid no meaningful penance. Even assuming McGregor never fights again – an outcome that looks more and more likely with every passing month after his previously-scheduled summer 2024 return was <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/40401460/conor-mcgregor-says-broken-toe-forced-ufc-303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled due to a broken toe</a> – he’s still got grubby fingers in <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/mma/conor-mcgregor-businesses-owned" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous other pies</a>. He is <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/ufc/2024/10/13/670b9d6f46163fc9328b45c5.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yacht-owningly wealthy</a>; he could retire from the public eye and shut the fuck up forever tomorrow, and he’d still be able to support his descendants for the next 1,000 years.</p><p>At least we can take solace in the fact that the gaping hole where his soul should be won’t allow him to, and he’ll never find lasting happiness. I just wish that the particular brand of misery embodied by the McGregors and Beahms of the world didn’t love the company of everybody else on planet Earth. That’d be nice. &nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-awards-epic-metahuman-fortnite<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic announced the latest round of in-game <em>Fortnite</em> voting for The Game Awards today, where players can check out the <em>Fortnite</em> islands up for an award and play a multiplayer mode in the voting area. Last year, the voting area featured a hologram of Game Awards host Geoff Keighley, as well as a model of him perched high above the proceedings. This year… um.</p><p>In a <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/2024-best-fortnite-island-the-game-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a>, Epic contributor Brian Crecente (who I think used to be Luke’s boss, but whom I have only met once at the Gawker funeral/party) explained that “This year’s digital Keighley is clearly much improved over 2023’s version. Where last year’s hologram look was created using greenscreen video capture, this year’s makes use of <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/metahuman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MetaHuman</a> to deliver a more realistic depiction.” MetaHuman is a feature in Epic’s Unreal Engine that allows users to create “high fidelity digital humans.”</p><p>Crecente writes that Keighley went to Manchester to be scanned for the model, and Keighley himself says in the blog that “The results speak for themselves, I truly feel like I have a digital double!”</p><p>This is that double in-game:</p><figure></figure><p>As far as I can tell, you only see digital Keighley once the first time you enter the mode, so I doublechecked against streamers that this wasn’t just something weird my graphics card was doing. Maybe I’m getting tripped up by how un-<em>Fortnite</em> the model looks in its reach for realism; something about seeing skin textures in <em>Fortnite</em> is hugely weird, and the proportions of the face don’t feel quite right, looking neither like Keighley nor a real face.&nbsp;</p><p>Curiously, I feel like he looks better in the trailer <em>Fortnite</em> released about the mode, which seems to maintain some of the flatness and lack of detail that I expect from <em>Fortnite</em> characters:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite Island 2024" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u3JnlvOR5Xc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While MetaHuman touts that it is creation “made easy,” I’m sure this was not easy to do, so I am not going to play armchair technician and claim I could have made something that looks less uncanny. But I also didn’t think last year’s hologram needed much improving–it looked like Keighley as a hologram, fitting with the mode and with the look of <em>Fortnite</em> in general:</p><figure></figure><p>In last year’s mode, there was also a digital version of Keighley in the gameplay area, which stood at the top of a pile of rocks that, try as I might, I couldn’t scale. I could never get close enough to take a picture, but here’s what he looked like in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChKvof3DP5U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a> from 2023:</p><figure><figcaption>Epic</figcaption></figure><p>In 2023, he looks like a version of himself in <em>Fortnite</em>! In 2024, he does not; he looks like an uncomfortably semi-realistic character squeezed in front of an unrealistic game mode where you shoot at floating crystals. I’m glad that, unlike last year, he’s not perched threateningly above me, where I would be unable to escape the mental image of his creepy eyes.</p><p>Maybe MetaHuman is a good tool for creators making realistic games in Unreal; I have no idea! But perhaps we didn’t need to see it used here.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
