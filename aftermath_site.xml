            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Labubus are everywhere — dangling from <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/lady-gaga-labubu-hermes-bag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lady Gaga’s Hermes bag</a>, selling for <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/02/us-news/this-is-the-most-expensive-labubu-on-ebay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than $10,000 on eBay</a>, <a href="https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/labubu-los-angeles-protests-ice-1200866" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protesting ICE raids</a>, and sold at 7-Eleven. But Chinese toy company Pop Mart is suing 7-Eleven, saying in a complaint <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/897729184/Labubu-lawsuit-via-Aftermath" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed in July in California</a> that the blind boxes sold at 7-Eleven stores are counterfeit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Pop Mart’s fuzzy, grinning plush toys are inspired by a series called <em>The Monsters</em>, designed by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung. Pop Mart started selling plush Labubu keychains in 2023, but they became a sensation in 2025. Pop Mart made $1.8 billion in 2024 thanks to a 1,200% increase in plush toy sales from 2023 to 2024, it says in the complaint. Labubu sales alone added up to $418 million, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-times-chinese-manufacturing-culture-propel-our-business-success-says-pop-marts-wang-ning-302509769.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pop Mart founder Wang Ning said in a recent interview</a>. Pop Mart says in its lawsuit that the “surge in sales” is “a trend that is only increasing in 2025 so far.”</p><figure><figcaption><em>Via lawsuit</em></figcaption></figure><p>Labubus are largely sold in themed blind boxes that include one of roughly a half-dozen or so options. For instance, an individual Have A Seat series blind box will include one of seven figures, and you won’t know what you’re getting until you open the sealed bag inside the box. One Labubu, with butter yellow fur, has its eyes squeezed shut. Another, with soft purple fuzz, also has its eyes shut — gently closed. The mint green Labubu’s wild eyes are open, colored a piercing teal.&nbsp;</p><p>The popularity of Labubus — and the built-in scarcity of low stock and the blind box system — means it can be relatively hard to get a Labubu. Or, at least, a Labubu that’s <em>definitely </em>real. There’s a growing market for counterfeit Labubus, colloquially called Lafufus, that have similar packaging but often have a low quality fake plush inside. Some people don’t really care; Lafufus have their own fanbase that loves them for their even more deranged look. (And for the price; the standard Labubu size typically costs around $20. Lafufus can be purchased for less than $10.) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/labubu-knockoff-lafufu-monsters-cost-counterfeit-fake-pop-mart-doll-2025-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Insider reported</a> in May that Lafufus are having their own cultural moment — the jank is kind of funny.&nbsp;</p><p>Lafufus are everywhere on the internet; you’re probably not going to get a real Labubu from, say, TikTok Shop or Temu. But they’re also popping up in 7-Elevens around the country.</p><p>Pop Mart shows in the lawsuit several instances of what it says are 7-Eleven stores selling fake Labubus. The packaging the company has collected looks real enough, but inside, the Lafufus are real busted. The proportions are all wrong, and their heads fit improperly into their fur suits, giving them bulbous foreheads. Faces are misprinted, leaving the iconic mischievous grin slightly askew. Some are missing eyes. In one especially disturbing instance, some Lafufu maker has seemingly transposed a Labubu head on a naked Kewpie body.</p><figure><figcaption><em>Via lawsuit</em></figcaption></figure><p>“Pop Mart does not offer its products in 7-Eleven stores, which are well known for offering snacks and everyday necessities, but not innovative, carefully managed, artist-designed toy experiences,” Pop Mart says in the complaint.</p><p>The big problem here for Pop Mart is that some people are likely seeing these products and buying them thinking they’re real Labubus — something the company says 7-Eleven is doing “knowingly, willfully, intentionally, and maliciously.” Pop Mart is suing on 17 different counts, including several different trademark, copyright, and trade dress violations, and is asking the court to force 7-Eleven to stop selling Lafufus and award Pop Mart damages for the infringement.</p><figure><figcaption><em>Via lawsuit</em></figcaption></figure><p>The fake Labubu crackdown doesn’t stop there, though: Chinese authorities <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/08/01/labubu-lafufu-china-counterfeit-crackdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have seized tens of thousands of fake plushies</a>. Pop Mart is also reportedly trying to trademark the word Lafufu, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/08/01/labubu-lafufu-china-counterfeit-crackdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Washington Post reported</a>, citing Chinese state media, in an effort to stop the fakes. U.K. police have seized “hundreds of thousands” of fake Labubus from its ports, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0qgnk7z8yo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to BBC</a>. The Better Business Bureau is also warning U.S. buyers about the influx of Lafufus; <a href="https://www.bbb.org/scamtracker/lookupscam?q=all%3Dlabubu%26from%3D0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 70 complaints have been lodged with the organization</a> against companies or stores selling fakes. On Pop Mart’s end, <a href="https://www.popmart.com/us/help/authenticity-check" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company has a page on its website for people to verify and authenticate their Labubus</a>, scanning both a QR code on the Labubu blind box and a QR code on the Labubu wash label.</p><p>The danger of it all, for Pop Mart, is that counterfeits are flooding the market and undermining its exorbitant profits. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0qgnk7z8yo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The BBC says Lafufus are dangerous</a> for kids because they’re so poorly made: The eyes and feet pop off so easily that they can become choking hazards. And so, the market for Lafufus is “going underground,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/29/lafufu-chinese-fake-labubu-plush-toy-doll-popmart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to The Guardian</a>, where elderly women slice open molded plastic monster heads to prepare them for stuffing.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-ziff-davis"><h3>IGN Lays Off 8 Staff, 12% Of Union</h3></a><p>The layoffs follow wider cuts at Ziff Davis, buyouts, and layoffs and departures at acquired sites</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve"><h3>Gabe Newell Bought A Yacht Company</h3></a><p>Valve's head honcho is now in the big boat business</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-chris-plante-sandwich-post-games"><h3>You Have To Hear Chris Plante’s Sandwich Story</h3></a><p>"It’s somehow getting on us, but we’re so happy that we’re not gonna die"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/labubu-lafufu-lawsuit-pop-mart-7-eleven]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week I saw several of my peers talking about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3308870/and_Roger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>and Roger</em></a>, a short game for PC and Switch that calls itself an “interactive novel.” It took me about an hour to play and costs just a few bucks, and it’s practically impossible to talk about it without thoroughly spoiling it, but I’m glad I checked it out.</p><p>As the game’s description explains, <em>and Roger</em> starts with a young girl named Sofia waking up to find a strange man in her house where her dad is supposed to be. It’s upsetting and creepy, though the eventual explanation you get radically changes the experience. The game’s simple art, pastel colors, and jaunty soundtrack offset this tone, making everything feel disorienting.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="“and Roger” 1st Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GrZMV5-Khz4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Most of <em>and Roger</em>’s gameplay is minigames, none of them particularly well-explained. As an example, in the early game Sofia brushes her teeth; you’re given several unexplained buttons to click, and you have to fumblingly parse out how to turn on the water, get toothpaste on your toothbrush, and actually brush. Trying to open a door involves choosing the right buttons from an onslaught of dots, and trying to dial a phone involves guessing at and then memorizing button presses. Later minigames involve tracing patterns or lines, some of which you can’t see at first.&nbsp;</p><p>As they’re clearly meant to, many of these minigames feel confusing and frustrating, though never enough to make the game itself feel that way. This is all meant to put you in Sofia’s shoes, outmatched by the tasks before her. It’s an evocative way to portray her distress, especially once the game’s real subject matter becomes clear.</p><p>I do want to touch on what that subject matter is, so stop reading here if you want to just go play the game for yourself. If you want to check it out but feel the need to be more prepared, I’ll say that there’s no kidnapping or child abuse in the game, as the setup and opening might seem to suggest.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SPOILERS FOLLOW.</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="and Roger - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R5Ink1cIvpo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It comes out later in the game that Sofia is actually an older woman suffering from dementia, and the game’s opening chapter is her experience of an encounter with her husband, Roger, who’s taking care of her. With this reveal, <em>and Roger</em>’s mechanics take on a new tone; they reflect the confusion Sofia feels as daily tasks become more challenging. From its dark beginning, the game becomes a more gentle and moving exploration of what it’s like to care for a declining loved one.</p><p>I found this hard subject matter to sit with: though I worked with caregivers for loved ones with dementia in a past career, it’s something I feel acutely anxious about as my parents age. Despite having professionally counselled others through it, my fear about the challenges and intimacy that will be required of me with my own family sometimes overwhelms me. (I watched about ten minutes of the movie <em>All Of Us Strangers</em> a few months ago, realized it was about parents, and promptly turned it off.)&nbsp;</p><p>There aren’t many narratives about cognitive decline from the point of view of the people experiencing them. Some of this is for obvious reasons, but I think it’s also just that it’s a hard thing to consider. I admired <em>and Roger</em>’s effort to really look at it, and to use game mechanics to try to portray what the experience might be like. The game doesn’t shy away from the hard parts–we see Roger struggle, and he admits to a few occasions when he physically lashed out at Sofia–but it also doesn’t portray the whole thing as a tragedy or Sofia as a burden. It’s a nuanced take for such a short game. I appreciated my time with it, even when it was tough.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/labubu-lafufu-lawsuit-pop-mart-7-eleven"><h3>Labubu To Lafufu: ‘See You In Court’</h3></a><p>Pop Mart is suing 7-Eleven for allegedly selling fake Labubus in its stores</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-ziff-davis"><h3>IGN Lays Off 8 Staff, 12% Of Union</h3></a><p>The layoffs follow wider cuts at Ziff Davis, buyouts, and layoffs and departures at acquired sites</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve"><h3>Gabe Newell Bought A Yacht Company</h3></a><p>Valve's head honcho is now in the big boat business</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-chris-plante-sandwich-post-games"><h3>You Have To Hear Chris Plante’s Sandwich Story</h3></a><p>"It’s somehow getting on us, but we’re so happy that we’re not gonna die"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/and-roger-switch-pc]]></content:encoded>
