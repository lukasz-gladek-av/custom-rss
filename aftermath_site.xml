            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/flcl-reanimated<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I love fan-animated projects. I love it when they do <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-fan-film-legend-goku-vegeta-broly-super-s-1849153117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what-if <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> and give Vegeta</a> his due. I love it when they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ndBoc6R8_A&amp;t=6s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emulate Saturday morning cartoons and <em>Dr. Slump</em></a>. I love it when they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf7bsmT-Jn0&amp;pp=ygUhaSBkb24ndCB3YW50IHRvIGJlIGEgbWFnaWNhbCBnaXJs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put a spin on magical girl tropes</a>. My favorite kind of animated project is when a group of artists unite to craft something that combines the polished flair of a professional animation studio with the charming, rough edges of fan works. <a href="https://youtu.be/p13E4a_Iy9Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>FLCL Reanimated</em></a> has been added to my pantheon of favorite anime fan projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A little while ago, I wrote a piece for Gizmodo<em> </em>about the oral history of <a href="http://www.bartkira.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Bartkira</em></a>, specifically how its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-history-behind-that-viral-bartkira-anime-trailer-2000533127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animated trailer came into being</a>. <em>Bartkira </em>was a collaborative fan project that started on Tumblr in 2013, in which 768 artists each contributed five pages to redraw six volumes of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/animation-cel-auction-akira-batman-bugs-bunny-disney-1851504043" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katsuhiro Otomo</a>’s <em>Akira </em>manga in distinctive art styles reminiscent of <em>The Simpsons</em>. It's all trippy to behold, especially with how seamlessly each painstakingly drawn manga panel blends into the next, creating an almost mural that encapsulates how each artist perceives the formative manga series in their unique styles. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SWt6OQ4Nl4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The animated trailer</a>, which had 31 animators working on it for nine months, is chef’s kiss. Now, history appears to be repeating itself once more with yet another group of artists who united their forces on the internet to reanimate one of anime’s most outlandish and special series, <em>FLCL</em>, just in time for its 25th anniversary.&nbsp;</p><p><em>FLCL Reanimated</em> was first announced back in 2021 when Twitter user Kobe Kendall, aka Sleptboi, sent out a feeler on an <em>FLCL </em>fan account asking if folks thought it’d be cool if <em>FLCL </em>got reanimated. Like <em>Bartkira</em>, <em>FLCL Reanimated</em> saw over 300 artists divvy up clips to remake <em>FLCL</em>’s fifth episode, “Brittle Bullet,” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/563432/flcl-reanimated-interview-premiere-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to <em>Polygon</em></a>. <em>Polygon </em>also notes that they went the extra mile by creating <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DImNjfCpmyS/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cover albums</a> and a <a href="https://heyzine.com/flip-book/d659cb0d2a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zine that emulated Newtype magazine</a> filled with behind-the-scenes production materials, which just so happens to be my favorite thing about an animated work. A joke that the creators poked fun at in a promotional video, the work began to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/flclreanimated.bsky.social/post/3lnnnvrizhk23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become a question of whether it would ever come out</a>. And come out, the episode did. Clocking in at just over 28 minutes, <em>FLCL Reanimated</em> is sick as hell.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FLCL REANIMATED" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p13E4a_Iy9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Admittedly, <em>FLCL </em>is an anime series that, despite watching, I’m still not entirely sure I comprehend on a strictly narrative basis. There’s a space-faring robot; a pink-haired, guitar-wielding, moped-riding lady who is also from space; and a boy with a rather obvious metaphor for puberty—a bulge on his forehead. From this bulge, the robot and various other oddities emerge, brought forth by the coaxing of said pink-haired cosmic lady. That’s all you need to know, plot-wise. All that matters is that the show is a fucking vibe filled with iconic one-liners, sick music, and fluid action choreography that only old school Gainax could’ve gotten away with in the span of six episode– a trick that’s proven to be diminishing returns whenever Adult Swim has attempted to recapture lightning in a bottle, <a href="https://kotaku.com/flcl-progressives-premiere-is-a-little-tame-1826196547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time and time again</a>, with its <a href="https://kotaku.com/flcl-fooly-cooly-grunge-adult-swim-premiere-review-1850809316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subsequent sequel series that no one asked for</a>. Fortunately, <em>FLCL Reanimated</em> does a superb job of showcasing how bonkers <a href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuya Tsurumaki’s directorial debut</a> was when it was first shown in the States on Toonami. Watching the fan-made episode was like gazing through a kaleidoscopic viewfinder, shifting effortlessly between surreal settings. Each flip revealed a new art style that ranged from dogmatically faithful renditions of its manga to quirky, <em>South Park</em>-esque cardboard cutouts, and an eclectic array of vibrant, kinetic visuals that brought a new texture to the already out-there anime series.</p><p>What’s more, like <em>Bartkira</em>, the lower third of the fan project features the social media handles of its artists, allowing viewers to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbk5weEd5Rk5rOEVZaDdRSGlvWTd1ZE1mb2l5Z3xBQ3Jtc0trQkV2dk5NT0FEc0wyMDBZWFNVbkN5SDlGRkRKUHk3dHR1UjlrVUxwNWV5VFNpTWh2b2NvVmRWdnNSQVNrRndLSGV0NE0xWWdfZURac2M0cUxROTV5QklQWmV4bVdFYnQzbktmMWsxVEZwM1NBSE9Maw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1f5EUWcc-zvLzgrIhc0xOZvTGAICyyfBuNg3ejwAM9vs%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&amp;v=p13E4a_Iy9Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explore more of their work</a>. The damn thing even has eyecatches that give off that kind of modern day Adult Swim Toonami commercial break vibe (and spoof commercials to boot). It’s a slight, old-hat anime touch that does wonders for making a series feel just that extra bit special. I’m particularly fond of the D.A.R.E. ad with Mamimi Samejima smoking a bowl.&nbsp;</p><p>Watching <em>FLCL Reanimated</em> absolutely delivered, reigniting the magic that makes <em>FLCL</em> a one-of-a-kind visual masterpiece. It showcased a stunning tapestry of creativity, proving fan artists can transcend the label of "fan art" to craft something extraordinary. Here's hoping it sparks a fresh wave of fan-animated projects.</p><p><em><strong>Correction 4/29/25, 12:28pm</strong>--An earlier version of this article misstated the number of artists involved in the project.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike"><h3>Almost Three Years After Neutrality Agreement, Negotiations Between Microsoft And Unionized Workers Aren’t Going Well</h3></a><p>"Although Microsoft tries to position itself as a good-faith employer, there’s another story being told behind the scenes at the bargaining table"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
