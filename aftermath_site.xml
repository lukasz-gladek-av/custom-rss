            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has closed <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> developer Boss Fight Entertainment, according to former staff. News spread about the closure on Thursday, just days after <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Netflix-Inc-_Earnings-Call_2025-10-21_English.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix's third quarter financial earnings call</a> on Tuesday. Boss Fight was acquired by Netflix in 2022.</p><p>"Well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure," co-founder and studio director David Rippy wrote in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7387225251513827328/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a>. "Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including<em> Squid Game: Unleashed</em> which hit #1 in 26 countries." David Luehamm, Netflix game development director, suggested in his own Boss Fight goodbye post on LinkedIn that the studio had been working on something new: "I wish you could see what we had cooking," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davelueh_after-10-great-years-working-at-boss-fight-activity-7387207936252502016-2UYI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he wrote</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Boss Fight was founded in 2013 and has largely focused on mobile games. Its first game under Netflix was <em>Dungeon Boss: Respawned</em>, followed by <em>Netflix Stories</em>, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/netflix-stories-mobile-games-shuts-down-1236350580/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which were visual novels based off Netflix shows</a>; <em>Money Heist: Ultimate Choice, </em>another visual novel based off a Netflix show; and <a href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em></a>, a battle royale game based the hit Netflix show that was released in December 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix did not provide a reply to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Boss Fight was the third independent game studio acquired by Netflix as it ramped up its ever-changing games strategy, following <em>Oxenfree</em> maker Night School Studio and mobile developer Next Games. Netflix bolstered its games strategy in 2022 by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23373053/netflix-video-game-studio-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening two studios in Finland</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and California</a>, respectively, <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/netflix-acquires-6th-gaming-studio-spry-fox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">then buying <em>Cozy Groze</em> maker Spry Fox</a>. Netflix closed the California studio in 2024; according to Game File, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was working on a triple A game</a>. Around that time, Netflix shook up its games program's leadership, shifting roles to land with former <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/netflix-games-president-alain-tascan-epic-1236081464/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games executive vice president Alain Tascan</a> taking the helm as President of Games.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix has spent the past several years hyping up the sorts of games Boss Fight had been making—specifically, <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>. In an <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Netflix-Inc-_Earnings-Call_2025-10-21_English.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earnings call</a> days before Boss Fight's closure, Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters used <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> as an example of its strategy for one of its several "verticals," which is centered on "immersive narrative games based on our own IP." The other verticals are games for kids, social games that play on the TV (like <em>Boggle Party</em> or <em>Pictionary</em>), and mainstream game ports like <em>Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em> is Netflix's most downloaded game, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflixs-ad-gaming-bets-focus-investors-seek-clarity-pay-off-2025-10-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Sensor Tower data reported by Reuters</a>.</p><p>"We're just starting to scratch the surface today," Peters said in the Tuesday earnings call. "We think there's much more we can ultimately do in this space. Yet we already see how this approach not only extends the audience's engagement with the story but it creates a synergy that reinforces both mediums, the interactive and the noninteractive side. It drives engagement, drives retention, and therefore, supports the business. So looking ahead, we're going to ramp our investment in this area judiciously based on demonstrating that we're ramping returns to the business, but we're extremely excited about the progress we've got ahead of us."</p><p>The strategy espoused Tuesday is the same <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that Tascan told The Verge in March</a>. But Boss Fight's shuttering doesn't necessarily make sense within the scope of Netflix's plan: It seemed to be doing exactly what Netflix said—and says—it wants. The game is available on mobile to everyone, even people who aren’t Netflix subscribers, which could serve as a kind of promotion for the streamer’s exclusive content. It certainly “extends the audience's engagement with the story” of Netflix’s hit show, casting players as competitors in <em>Squid Game</em>’s fight to the death. By Netflix's count, <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> reached number one in the <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/squid-game-by-the-numbers-how-player-456-took-over-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free action game category in more than 100 countries on the App Store</a> charts. AppMagic estimated in early 2025 that <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/netflixs-squid-game-unleashed-mobile-game-surpasses-10m-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> was downloaded more than 10 million times</a>, making it the fifth most popular Netflix game. <em>GTA: San Andreas</em>, <em>Storyteller</em>, <em>SpongeBob: Get Cooking</em>, and <em>Bloons TD</em> fill out the top four, but <em>Squid Game: Unleashed </em>is the only one of these five games developed in-house by Netflix.</p><p>Peters spoke about Netflix's gaming business at the Bloomberg Screentime event in Los Angeles in October, likening the slow growth of that part of the business to Netflix's expansion into the Japanese market where, by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflixs-ad-gaming-bets-focus-investors-seek-clarity-pay-off-2025-10-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a>' reporting, "only 2% of consumers knew the brand."</p><p>"We just did the 10th Anniversary in Japan ... but it took us a long time," Peters said at the event, as reported by Reuters. "The gaming situation is not dissimilar to that."&nbsp;</p><p>But people don't come to Netflix for games. It’s likely many people don't even know the company offers them—the disconnect between Netflix on your TV and its games on your phone doesn't necessarily work in favor of the company. Research company Omdia reported in June that Netflix’s games lineup increased user time spent by less than .5%, according to Reuters, which certainly doesn’t seem like a win for the extending audience engagement Peters spoke of in the earnings call. Netflix's strategy, as described on Tuesday in the financial earnings call, remains impossibly broad, even as Peters said the company was focusing its efforts on “a few identified verticals.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, it sounds like the social games played within the Netflix app, on TV screens, is what's stepping forward; Peters said that this holiday season Netflix is releasing a bunch of party games that play on the TV—<a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming/797589/netflix-tv-party-games-boggle-tetris-lego-party" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Boggle Party, Pictionary Game Night, LEGO Party, Tetris</em></a>—but are controlled by phones. That does make more sense than other games; people are already in the Netflix app, and games that are easy to get into and play are ultimately what users will see. But it doesn't solve the problem that most people, when opening Netflix, are looking for something to watch rather than play.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix's failure to become a meaningful platform for games isn’t the fault of anyone at the studio level. And whether or not <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> succeeded by whatever metric the <a href="https://aftermath.site/kaos-cancelled-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notoriously fickle company</a> set for it, there’s no denying it fits within Netflix’s strategy around the show, which has seen multiple spinoffs and tie-ins. But Netflix clearly doesn’t know precisely what it wants games to do on its platform, a problem well above the remit of the developers at Boss Fight who’ve lost their jobs. As usual, when executives flounder, it’s workers who pay the price.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon"><h3>What The Hell Is Microsoft Doing?</h3></a><p>"They added a new Clippy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another week, another baffling headline out of Microsoft. The latest is at least illustrative: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Bloomberg</a>, the company has set an across-the-board goal of 30 percent “accountability margins” – Microsoft’s weird, somehow-worse-sounding term for profit margins – which explains why its gaming division has been rampantly laying off employees, canceling games, and closing studios. So now we know the directive that informed numerous questionable decisions, but why keep doing it? On the latest Aftermath Hours, we wonder if Microsoft will ever find a way to right the ship.</p><p>This time around, we discuss the aforementioned recent revelation that Microsoft has been seeking a 30 percent profit margin from its gaming division since 2023. This borders on ludicrous compared to what the rest of the industry typically achieves and fully clears that bar in the case of Xbox, which managed a 12 percent profit margin in 2022. Now here we are in 2025, following <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-1900-people-at-activision-blizzard-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple rounds</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mass layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/were-still-feeling-aftershocks-from-microsofts-destructive-july-layoffs-and-cancellations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">project cancellations</a>, because while Xbox was profitable, it wasn’t profitable <em>enough</em>. We once again repeat what has become a common refrain: What is Microsoft thinking, especially as both the industry and the global economy enter increasingly uncertain times? And if Microsoft continues to pump out pricey hardware while laying off developers and shutting down studios, where will the money come from?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about TwitchCon and the security woes that became <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the story of this year’s event</a>. While the claim that TwitchCon had no security is definitively untrue, misogyny and sociopathic clip farming intrinsic to the modern platform ecosystem still managed to spill over into real life. How does Twitch handle that? At what point does TwitchCon become so much of a reputational risk that Twitch would be better off pulling the plug?&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we talk about both Mario (the video game character) and Luigi (Mangione).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can hire the finest legal minds of our generation to ensure that Luigi Mangione gets to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Magfest/comments/1odq4ss/luigi_mangione_recommends_letter_receiver_visit/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go back to MAGFest someday</a>.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> “What the fuck is Microsoft doing” is the refrain at every part of the business. What the fuck are you doing <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Gaza</a>? What the fuck are you doing <a href="https://aftermath.site/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-bethesda-microsoft-bds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with games</a>? What the fuck are you doing <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-price-increase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Game Pass</a>? What the fuck are you doing <a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-union-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cwa-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with AI</a>? What the fuck are you doing <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-windows-11-debloat-copilot-ultralite-good-version" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with your OS</a>? This is Microsoft right now in 2025: What the fuck are you doing? Constantly! With <a href="https://aftermath.site/windows-11-nope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows 10</a>! With everything!</p><p>They added a new Clippy. He looks like shit. He’s a little blob. Fuck you! I don’t want that!</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/804106/microsoft-mico-copilot-ai-assistant-clippy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Warren at The Verge said</a> [its name, Mico] is pronounced “Mee-co,” but you can’t do that, because it’s Microsoft. It’s a shortened version of your company name, but it’s not pronounced the same.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> So wait, this new Clippy has a name and everything? I need to look this up.</p><p>OK so, he’s an AI assistant. Of course. My first impression: He looks like shit – kinda like one of those little guys from <em>Mario Galaxy</em>, but sans any sort of personality. They sanded off every edge both literally and figuratively to make it as inoffensive as possible.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> This is what gets me. I still haven’t upgraded to Windows 11, but every time I’m like “I’ve gotta deal with this; I care about my device security,” it’s like “We’ve added all this AI shit.” What if I just don’t want it? You can sign up to back up your stuff, but you’ve gotta use OneDrive, and it’s only five gigs or something.</p><p>When we stopped using Windows 8 or whatever, few people were still using it. But this is crazy: 42 percent of users are still using Windows 10.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Sorry, I’m still over here reading about Mico. From The Verge article: “You can see it, it reacts as you speak to it, and if you talk about something sad you’ll see its facial expressions react almost immediately.”&nbsp;</p><p>Why would I want my little Clippy-adjacent fucking assistant guy to emotionally react to me saying something sad? Why would I want to say something sad when I’m like “Hey, can you open Excel for me?”</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Imagine if it got sad about the wrong thing. You’re like “Hey, I got a new haircut,” and it just [makes an unhappy face at you].&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s like “I don’t know about that one, man.” But that would actually be useful!</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> “You can make this thing sad,” as a selling point, feels very weird.<br><strong>Nathan:</strong> Right! It’s so bizarre! What a strange selling point, to say “This is why you should want this: because you can upset it.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/brainrot-roblox-court"><h3>Brainrot Goes To Court [Correction]</h3></a><p>Someone is trying to explain brainrot to a judge</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers"><h3>Beefed Up TwitchCon Security Couldn’t Stop The Internet’s Issues From Spilling Over Into Real Life</h3></a><p>A high-profile assault and toxic IRL streamers have forced the Twitch community to reckon with deeper-seated problems</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon]]></content:encoded>
