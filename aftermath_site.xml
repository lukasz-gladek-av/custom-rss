            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-phoenix-labs-layoffs-studio-closure-far-cry-dauntless<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I don’t believe any serious person really thought 2025 would magically be different <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/video-game-layoffs-2024-report-gdc-1236277739/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from 2024</a> in terms of video game industry layoffs, but if you are one of those people, I’m sorry. Today Ubisoft let nearly 200 workers go, closing yet another studio in the process, and <em>Dauntless </em>developer Phoenix Labs functionally turned to ash.</p><p>Ubisoft continued its valiant quest to “enhance operational efficiency and maximize value creation,” whatever that means, by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off 185 workers</a>, including the team at Ubisoft Leamington, which assisted on games like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>The Division</em>, and <em>Far Cry 5</em>. The company has also begun “targeted restructurings” at Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections. This follows two other studio closures in Osaka and San Francisco<a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-studio-closure-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> just last month</a> on the back of <em>XDefiant</em>'s shutdown, as well as the decision to “ramp down” production in Sydney – all of which resulted in nearly 300 layoffs.</p><p>Since late last year, rumors have swirled of a potential buyout from Tencent, which currently owns nine percent of Ubisoft. However, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Reuters</a>, Ubisoft has its sights set on a deal that would see the Guillemot family, which founded the company, retain control. Amid all of this, Ubisoft has faced “<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">softer than expected</a>” sales of blockbusters like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and multiple employee walkouts over issues like <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-strike-france-pay-yves-guillemot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fair pay</a> and <a href="https://uniglobalunion.org/news/ubisoft-workers-strike-france/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return-to-office mandates</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Phoenix Labs is against the ropes and a punch or two from going down, with the studio saying that the lion’s share of its workers are on the chopping block.</p><p>"Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs,” the company <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on LinkedIn</a>. “We have made the tough decision to part ways with the majority of the studio as part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations. We recognize and deeply appreciate the contributions of every individual impacted. Their talent, dedication, and creativity have left an indelible mark on our company and our games."</p><p>In 2023, Phoenix Labs was acquired by Forte Labs, a blockchain company. Last year, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Developer</a> reported that Forte cracked down on communication inside and outside of Phoenix Labs, going so far as to keep potential employees in the dark as to who actually owned the studio. That really smart and normal plan is evidently going well.</p><p>In <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January alone</a>, we’ve seen layoffs at additional studios like <em>Godfall </em>developer <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/counterplay-games-godfall-hit-with-layoffs.832239/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Counterplay</a> – which may or may not still be open – <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/splash-damage-jobs-at-risk-following-transformers-reactivate-cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Splash Damage</a>, and <a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/press-releases/eg7-undertakes-business-optimization-at-one-of-its-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Piranha</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result of <a href="https://aftermath.site/tiktok-ban-trump-bytedance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">myriad concerns</a> with which you’re likely familiar, January has felt like it’s lasted a year, which if nothing else is less than two or three years. February, by virtue of having fewer days in it than January, can’t possibly feel longer. So that’s something, unless February somehow turns out to be even more grueling than January, in which case it isn’t.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/escape-room-first-time"><h3>My First Escape Room Was Pretty Cool</h3></a><p>Please tell me everything about how you design them</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/oscars-emilia-perez-on-cinema-tim-heidecker"><h3>Stop Watching The Oscars</h3></a><p>They're bad, and you don't have to.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>As Aftermath’s resident hardware freak, my goal is to tell you about tools that I have bought and thoroughly enjoy. Sometimes, this process requires weeks of in depth testing and modification. Other times, it’s a pretty simple suggestion. Today is the latter: I love my NT Cutter cutting tool. It costs just over six dollars, is incredibly versatile, and I use it basically every single day. You should get one.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Tokyu Hands (Flagship store), Shibuya | Virtual Shopping Tokyo" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbpreAPHkio?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Here is an hour long tour of my favorite big chain in Japan. It's like I'm there. Skip to 10:49 for some pocket knives.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Of all the chain stores in Japan, the one I miss the most outside of combinis like Family Mart and Lawson is the DIY chain <a href="https://info.hands.net/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hands</a>, formerly known as Tokyu Hands. For Americans, imagine if Michaels, The Container Store and the now defunct Bed Bath and Beyond fused and was seven stories tall.&nbsp; Imagine a building full of all the tiny, beautiful tools needed to make hyper detailed Gunpla and model trains, do woodworking, and cook. The one in Shibuya has a map that looks like it came out of <em>Metroid</em>. I daydream about it sometimes.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>An NT Cutter Premium Evolution PMG series. I got this because I can't find my other knife and it costs slightly more. </figcaption></figure><p>I did not buy my NT Cutter at Hands, but going there does impress upon you how alienating and boring the experience of going into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_killer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">category killer</a> craft or hardware store can be in America. It also shows you, in case you could not guess, that Japan takes its knives and craft tools very seriously. This extends beyond kitchen knives&nbsp; to small pocket knives like kiridashi and razor blades. Japan takes this stuff so seriously that every time I look for a new tool I often add “Japanese” to the end the way people affix “reddit” to searches.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>These things come apart easily. They're simple, convenient and made in Osaka.</figcaption></figure><p>This is how I came across the much beloved NT Cutter and Olfa brands, the latter of which actually invented the iconic snap-off razor blade. Both OLFA and NT Cutter’s entry level items are quite cheap online, at around six dollars as of this writing. Both brands offer knives in a variety of colors and shapes. They both feature a notch at the end for snapping off the blade when it gets dull and a clip for fitting into a pocket. OLFA is well loved and you can’t go wrong either way, but I find the NT Cutter PRO AD-2P to be quite handsome with its distinctive red dot. I use mine every single day of my life and just ordered more because I lost mine somewhere; backups are so cheap that it’s basically a rounding error for me.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Japanese Cutting Tools 🇯🇵 OLFA • NT Cutter" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mSQUv3d4HA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A comparison between various OLFA and NT Cutter tools. </figcaption></figure></div><p>This does not take anything away from American utility knives. X-ACTO makes a bunch of great tools, and I hear good things about Lenox. And for precision work like model crafting, I know a bunch of people who don’t even mess around with utility knives and go straight for medical scalpels. But for a tiny everyday cutting, the knife I go back to the most is my NT Cutter. I love that little guy so much.</p><figure><figcaption>As a total aside, NT-Cutter makes some kind of blade disposal pyramid that I really want now.
