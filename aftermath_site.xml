            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-controversies-are-for-babies-and-racists<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Depending on what you read and where you read it, you may have heard that the release of <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-day-1-patch-notes-shrine-1851771221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> has been controversial</a>. That it's been plagued by one cultural faux pas after another, from<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/ubisoft-apologizes-for-using-a-real-life-reenactment-groups-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-concept-art-without-permission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> iffy concept art</a> to an<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> ill-advised statue</a> through to<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-yasuke-apology-sucks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sincere apologies to fans over lapses in historical accuracy</a>. This has all now culminated in the game, made primarily by Westerners but set in Japan, being spoken about in Japanese parliament.</p><p>Specifically, questions about <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-sneakily-tones-down-the-mess-players-can-make-across-japans-religious-sites-in-its-day-one-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the way the game allows players to destroy religious sites</a> were recently put to Japan’s Prime Minister by representative Kada Hiroyuki; the Prime Minister’s<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/03/21/new-assassins-creed-releases-to-strong-reviews-but-sparks-anti-woke-backlash-and-roils-japanese-government/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> seemingly stern reply, stripped of all context, sounded pretty bad</a> for Ubisoft and the game! So bad that, in an attempt to smooth things over, Ubisoft have since patched <em>Shadows</em>, removing the player's ability to smash up historic Japanese temples.</p><p><a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3303172/japanese-pm-ishiba-condemns-assassins-creed-video-game-over-cultural-disrespect-shrine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reading <em>some </em>headlines</a>, you'd think the game had made its biggest cultural misstep yet, and that this patch was a much-needed fix, alongside every other much-needed fix that has followed every other cultural misstep made by Ubisoft in the leadup to <em>Shadows</em>' release.</p><p>The thing is, though, it's all bullshit. Ubisoft didn’t have to patch this. You could smash up a temple in <em>Shadows </em>the same way you can smash up any room in the game, because the game lets you break every table and splinter every wooden door. There's also important context to be had concerning the exchange in Japanese parliament–mostly how unimportant it actually was–some of which can be found in this <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-prime-minister-of-japan-responded-to-a-question-about-assassins-creed-shadows-today-heres-whats-actually-going-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN story, </a>and more of which is covered in this thread by Jeffrey Hall, Lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies:</p><p>Or, for a more succinct version of events, there's:</p><p>If the vibes of this sound at all familiar, it's because that sound you're hearing is Ubisoft walking into the same rake the company has been walking into for almost the entire public life of this video game. Thanks to a multitude of confluent factors--the game stars a woman,<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-racism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the game stars a black man and is set in Japan</a>--there’s been an excruciatingly public "controversy" over the game for what feels like years now, not for normal people or for normal reasons, but simply because a subset of frothing-mouth internet weirdos don't like it, have convinced enough others to report on the idea that their opinion somehow matters, and Ubisoft just keeps on responding to them.</p><p>I can't believe Ubisoft keeps falling for the same old shit! <em>Assassin's Creed</em> has had religion in its sights, across multiple cultures and continents, for as long as it's been around, whether you're burning monasteries or <em>fighting the Pope</em>. And like I've said, the ability to "destroy" a temple in this game isn't an act of religious violence, it's simply an accidental, meaningless consequence of letting the player climb anything and sometimes break some tables. </p><p>These are absolute non-issues that require four seconds of context to dispel, but because there are some weebs out there who hate black people just as much as they love a particular idea of Japan, and at least one of them has written an email to a Japanese politician, suddenly this is an issue? And rather than explain it, Ubisoft just folds? <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-yasuke-apology-sucks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like I said last time</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The perfect response to dealing with shitheads like this is to simply live your life pretending they don't exist.<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-star-wars-controversy-ratings-this-is-all-terrible" target="_blank">&nbsp;Their opinions are ill-formed, bigoted and unsuitable for mainstream consumption, and so should be ignored at all costs</a>. Let them howl at the moon all they want, let their furious emails wash against the walls of your inbox, these people simply are not worth your time.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Every word of that still applies. You do not need to apologise, or make changes for, these people! It would not have taken an exhaustive knowledge of Japanese parliamentary politics,<a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/how-we-got-rolled-by-the-dishonest-fascists-of-gamergat-1649496579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> or reactionary letter-writing</a>, to know what was up here. Removing the ability to smash some stuff in one type of place but not all the others, in stark contrast to the rest of your series' decades-long stance on this, is just the weirdest line to draw. <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/assassins-creed-shadows-message-warning-animus-climbing-on-torii-gates-not-allowed-no-consequence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As is discouraging players from climbing over a Torii</a> (a Japanese temple gate) because <em>someone </em>is worried copycat tourists might try it; are there legitimate worries they’re going to climb over every historic castle, home and temple in the game as well?</p><p>It's embarrassing, <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-yasuke-apology-sucks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and just like last time</a>, I feel for everyone who actually worked on this game, to have it thrust once again--now, right as it's basking in<a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16792/assassins-creed-shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> positive review scores</a>--into the spotlight of the culture wars by spineless company leadership.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-story-yasuke-podcast-revie"><h3>Assassin’s Creed Shadows Is Impressive, But Does The Story Work?</h3></a><p>We love how Assassin's Creed Shadows looks and feels, but does it deliver on the story it seeks to tell?
