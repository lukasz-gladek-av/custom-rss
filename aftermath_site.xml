            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-tactical-takedown-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> came out last week and, being a turn-based tactics game, <a href="https://aftermath.site/strategy-game-turn-based-tactics-movement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I was both personally and professionally obligated</a> to try it out.</p><p>How does a series based on <em>TMNT</em>, which famously features loads of melee combat against hordes of shitty enemies, work in a tactics game, a genre usually known for cover, guns and careful planning? It embraces the chaos, asking you to take control of turn-based ninja turtles and spend a whole level running around slashing and smashing things.</p><p>To make things a little spicier than just an endless grind of close-quarters combat, <em>Tactical Takedown</em> has what I can best describe as a continually collapsing landscape, where sections of the map will disappear while others appear ahead of you. It's important to note that the game does this regardless of where you are; you don't trigger the collapse, it just happens to you in the middle of a fight, with the idea (I assume) being it continually ushers you through a level as though you were flying through a stage<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(arcade_game)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> from Konami's classic 1989 beat-em-up</a>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S0Ab1XckSRM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It makes the game breathless in its own turn-based way, as you can never just bunker down behind cover and get in a leisurely shootout. Since you're always taking damage (it's melee combat against a <em>lot </em>of bad guys, you can't avoid it) you have to always be moving to kill enemies and always be jumping to grab health items and always be thinking and always worrying about the impending collapse of the tiles you're currently standing on. I dig the idea! Any attempt to try something fresh with an established genre like this should be applauded, because as you might expect given how many turn-based games are called "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=xcom+like&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU1030AU1030&amp;oq=xcom+like&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIMCAEQIxgnGIAEGIoFMgwIAhAjGCcYgAQYigUyEwgDEC4YgwEYxwEYsQMY0QMYgAQyDQgEEAAYgwEYsQMYgAQyEwgFEC4YgwEYxwEYsQMY0QMYgAQyCggGEAAYsQMYgAQyDQgHEAAYgwEYsQMYgAQyEwgIEC4YgwEYxwEYsQMY0QMYgAQyCggJEAAYsQMYgATSAQgxMDgzajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XCOM-like</a>", innovation can sometimes be in short supply.</p><p>In this particular game's case, though...this is not what I play these kinds of games for. I am a languid gamer, an enjoyer of turn-based games for the serenity and contemplation they allow, and the amount of stuff <em>Tactical Takedown</em> was throwing in my face the entire time was just too much, too damn stressful. It often felt overwhelming in ways that I am actively trying to avoid with this genre, yet which in turn felt wasted on a game where everyone had to wait their turn instead of just <em>going at it</em>. </p><p>Not helping things are a lack of variety once the game's basics are laid out to you in the first couple of levels, and a few too many cut corners in terms of presentation. I'm not demanding AAA standards from my low-fi tactics games, but for something with a half-decent license, and which is drawing inspiration from one of the best-looking video games of the late 80s, the static visuals--the game looks more like a tabletop experience, with animation in short supply--were a little disappointing.</p><p>I get the design lure of bringing one game or genre's vibe into another--<a href="https://stonehandgames.com/the-great-air-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I've literally done this myself!</a>--and appreciate there may be many others who are far less precious about their genre expectations than I, but for me, here, the two just weren't a great fit, no mater how interesting the foundational idea might have been.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs"><h3>Another Day, Another Round Of Layoffs At EA</h3></a><p>Black Panther is canceled, and workers (once again) suffer the consequences</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-good"><h3>Parrying Is The Best Thing In Video Games</h3></a><p>Everybody’s gangsta until somebody parries your bullshit</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stop me if you’ve heard this one before, <a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-respawn-titanfall-layoffs-andrew-wilson-pay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost exactly one month ago</a>: EA, as part of an ongoing transition to <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/continuing-to-evolve-our-business-and-teams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focus on</a> “owned IP, sports, and massive online communities” – and, of course, a loving and committed relationship with making the line go up – has canceled a promising in-development project based on a big-name series, laying off numerous talented people in the process. Previously, <em>Titanfall </em>took a tumble. This time, it’s <em>Black Panther</em> that’s met a decidedly un-heroic end.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN reports</a> that EA has canceled a little-seen but eagerly anticipated<em> Black Panther </em>open-world action-adventure game and shut down Cliffhanger Games, a studio formed only a couple years ago in 2023. Some members of EA’s mobile and central teams are also on the chopping block. EA has not specified the exact number of people affected, but according to IGN, it’s “less than the roughly 300 roles cut last month across Respawn and EA's Fan Care teams.” In an email to staff, EA Entertainment president Laura Miele said recent shakeups are part of an effort to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities." She added that EA is attempting to find laid-off developers new roles within the company.</p><p>It’s worth noting that as of March 2025, EA <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wait-a-minute-eas-headcount-rose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employed 800 more people</a> than at the same time last year, meaning that the company is not shrinking – at least in terms of net employee count. Still, this is cold comfort to those impacted by layoffs, whose hard work now lines the wastebasket of history and who – more invisibly but no less crucially – see their teams scattered to the winds. These aren’t just talented individuals; they are rock-solid <em>teams</em>. Game making is a collective effort, honed over the course of multiple projects. It’s a process just as much as it’s an art, a daily trudge toward learning each others’ ins, outs, and idiosyncrasies.</p><p>Just to give you an idea of How Things Are Going on that front, Cliffhanger Games was made up of <em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor </em>vets coming from Monolith Productions. Monolith, you’ll remember, was working on a <em>Wonder Woman</em> game with WB until… that project was also canned, and Monolith, a decades-old studio, was <a href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unceremoniously sacrificed</a> at the altar of growth at all costs. In the span of just a few months, we went from multiple Monolith and Monolith-adjacent teams cooking in shared kitchens to zero. I’m sure at least a few folks will find new means of sticking together, but as long as this industry insists on viewing people as numbers – whether on a spreadsheet or as manpower to bolster a random live service game’s ceaseless maintenance machine – this will be the end result.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-good"><h3>Parrying Is The Best Thing In Video Games</h3></a><p>Everybody’s gangsta until somebody parries your bullshit</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
