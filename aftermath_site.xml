            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every couple of years I decide I’m going to learn to play chess, because it feels like the kind of thing a well-rounded adult knows how to do. Usually, I can mostly remember how all the pieces move, but I’ve never been great at thinking enough moves ahead to really <em>play</em> the game. So I’m not that good at <em>Below the Crown</em>, but, like regular chess, I keep throwing myself at it anyway.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1883920/Below_the_Crown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Below the Crown</em></a> is an upcoming early access game by Misfits Attic, the folks behind 2016’s <em>Duskers</em>. It’s a combination of a roguelike dungeon crawler and chess: Your characters are chess pieces, who follow the rules of the traditional game, but the board is a dungeon, full of walls and hazards. You have to get your king to a door to the next room of the dungeon, using them and other pieces you play via cards to capture the enemy pieces or put the enemy king in check.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Below the Crown - Official Reveal Trailer | The MIX Fall Game Showcase 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/40HNDcQ01uY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It’s not just chess on a weird board: as you progress, you get spell cards or can upgrade your pieces to have new abilities. I’ve used a spell to freeze troublesome opponents, transformed one of my pieces into a bishop to knock out a diagonal enemy, and upgraded a piece to be able to wrap around the board and have more movement options. The game also has a lot of tools to help you out–you can undo a limited number of moves, get a hint for the best move to make, and show unsafe spaces to help you plan. </p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Below the Crown - Official Gameplay Overview Trailer | Indie Fan Fest Fall 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/muhNLNbTBpE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The chess of it all comes from the thinking ahead, remembering how pieces move and imagining all the possible outcomes. At the same time, pieces’ upgrades and abilities mean you also have to think like a fantasy dungeon crawler or turn-based video game. These two genres work together to create a game that moves slowly and thoughtfully, but also has moments of action and clever strategy. The combination of traditional dungeon design and a sort of cyberpunk overlay and art style heighten the feeling that you’re playing something super <em>weird</em>, but also really cool. It hasn't made me any better at chess, which at this point in my life I don't think anything will, but it lets me <em>feel</em> like I'm playing chess while also playing kinds of games I'm a bit less hopeless at.</p><p><em>Below the Crown</em> has a Steam demo out now, and comes to early access November 10.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange"><h3>Baby Steps’ Manbreaker Did Not Break Me</h3></a><p>Baby Steps' Manbreaker is an optional, brutal challenge that is as much a test of your humility as it is your skill.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/epic-games-suing-two-fortnite-island-makers-over-inflated-bot-engagement"><h3>Epic Games Suing Two Fortnite Island Makers Over Inflated ‘Bot’ Engagement</h3></a><p>Epic Games says Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser made tens of thousands of dollars worth of ‘unwarranted payouts’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-kenji-iwaisawa-director-interview"><h3>100 Meters Director On Capturing The Art And Agony Of Track And Field Through Rotoscope Animation</h3></a><p>Kenji Iwaisawa hopes his film adaptation will be “the first of its kind” to bring the quiet intensity of track to the big screen</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending"><h3>Hades 2’s Story Doesn’t Change The Status Quo</h3></a><p>Melinoë's journey is more about acceptance than change</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/chess-dungeon-crawler-yeah]]></content:encoded>
