For one, it's held over a weekend, which is also the best time to go outside, see friends and hang out. Also there are also too many games spread over too many shows for even the most resolute of you to hope to sit there live and truly catch it all. </p><p>I found that this year, like any other year, the best thing to do was to skip it entirely and just catch up on trailers over the next few days at my own pace. In the spirit of this delayed (yet also emotionally restorative) approach, here are some of the coolest games I saw after SGF, not because <em>I saw them</em>, but because people I love and trust and who did blow their weekend watching commercials (thank you for your service) said "watch this trailer it's sick".</p><p><strong>WHEEL WORLD</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Wheel World - Official Release Date Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1DDmlRdgcNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>We’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/wheel-world-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written</a> about this game before,<a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-bike-trailer-pc-steam-xbox-ps-bicycle-game-italy-1850593884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> including a couple years back when it had a different name</a>. So not a brand new announcement, but still, I'm glad to see it's finally coming out, because it looks lovely.</p><hr><p><strong>PARALIVES</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Paralives - Release Date Trailer (Early Access)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uvGPV6qQuQM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I have also written about this game before.<a href="https://kotaku.com/paralives-a-new-sims-like-game-looks-cool-1843551132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> In, uh, 2020</a>. So I'm even gladder that this one is almost done, because while we could all do with a decent <em>Sims </em>competitor, it's <em>Paralives</em>' furniture and architecture tools that have got me most excited.</p><hr><p><strong>STRANGER THAN HEAVEN</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="STRANGER THAN HEAVEN - Title Reveal Teaser Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5L3XVVzsmHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Oh look, it's me writing up a RGG game announcement as the highlight of an event,<a href="https://aftermath.site/yakuzas-shopfronts-are-one-of-lifes-little-pleasures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> how off-brand</a>. From the original working title (<em>Project Century</em>) to the fact<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20jMxu3X6lA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> its trailers have been set 30 years apart</a> to the mysterious final revelation of the above clip, a lot of folks are thinking we're about to be signing up for some supernatural shenanigans. Just in case you've ever wanted to see a vampire kick a bicycle over a guy's head. </p><hr><p><strong>LEGO VOYAGERS</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="LEGO® VOYAGERS | Reveal Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bYggKzKdg08?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Builder's Journey</em> was <em>such a good LEGO game</em>, it was a shame to see it...well, not fail. It did really well by all accounts, but I feel like it deserved <em>more</em> recognition than it got when people's focus was perhaps diluted because it had<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Builder%27s_Journey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> such a staggered release schedule across various platforms</a>. Maybe the same team being given the chance to follow it up with <em>Voyagers</em>--a co-op adventure that looks to be making the absolute most of the license--will help make a bigger splash.</p><hr><p><strong>RELOOTED</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Relooted Announcement Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KgPxPfXb734?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>One of my<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqNBhMSzW3Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> favourite TV shows is called <em>Stuff The British Stole</em></a>. <em>Relooted</em> shares the same premise, only instead of asking for the return of historical relics nicely via the medium of television, you're taking the relics directly through the medium of heist.</p><hr><p><strong>MY ARMS ARE LONGER NOW</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="My Arms Are Longer Now | Frosty Games Fest 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RVdbXmz8U5s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Speaking of heists, here's another game about stealing stuff!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-lost-save-game-pass<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a minute there, Game Pass was one of the best deals in video games. Aside from easy access to the Xbox catalogue, you’d regularly be served games that you would either never try or tell yourself you would when there was a sale. <a href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-is-good-overture-annoucement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Lies of P</em></a><em> </em>was one of those games for me. Though I have since <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled Game Pass</a> because of Microsoft’s ongoing support of the genocide in Gaza, I wish I had done the sensible thing and bought the game on Steam to begin with, or at&nbsp; least archived my save, because not doing so screwed up my save<em>.</em></p><p><em>Lies of P: Overture </em>is a DLC expansion that was shadow-dropped last week. I have not beaten <em>Overture, </em>but my impressions based on what I’ve played is that Neowiz still has the juice. The DLC is brutal, they give P a shotgun arm, and the monsters are thoroughly disgusting. So far I’m happy.</p><figure><figcaption>Lads, we're back. Credit: NEOWIZ</figcaption></figure><p>But because I had previously played <em>Lies of P </em>on Game Pass, I realized when I got code for <em>Overture</em> that I had to fish out my old save file. I think I had assumed before canceling that I had bought the game on Steam during a sale but no, I hadn’t. Turns out my save file is tied to Microsoft’s service forever. What’s worse, <em>Lies of P </em>is no longer on Game Pass. So if I just wanted to get my save file using a trial of Game Pass, cancelling it, and transferring the save to Steam, I would need to buy the game first. Even beyond the ethics of supporting Microsoft, I’m not going to buy a game on their store voluntarily.&nbsp;</p><p>But wait, sometimes the save file is still on your computer! There’s <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3042416648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thorough guides</a> on how to convert a Game Pass save file to a Steam one, and I <em>had</em> installed it to play it not too long ago. Maybe it was still kicking around on my hard drive.</p><p>Though Game Pass is fine as a service, it is also a Microsoft product, meaning the way it installs on your PC is generally a nightmare. Unlike Steam, which just puts stuff in Program Files like an adult, you have to make sure “hidden items” are visible, go into your AppData folder and navigate to an obtusely-named folder in Packages. Even in ideal circumstances this would be annoying, but when I followed every available guide I was able to find the remnants of <em>Lies of P </em>on my hard drive, but not the one specific folder that would have contained my save. Either something had changed since the guide was written, something happened with my computer, or Windows had deleted the save off my drive.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Hope you're ready to do this stuff. Credit: Valve/Monkey</figcaption></figure><p>I am <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiesOfP/comments/1l5iwlr/can_i_get_my_save_back_from_gamepass_pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apparently not alone here</a>. I did find at least one other person who had been in the exact same situation on r/liesofp. I contemplated speed running through the entire game, since I have done that multiple times. I got to the end of the first chapter before I realized that I don’t have time to do that. This left one solution: download another person’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/liesofp/mods/94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meticulously curated save file </a>from NexusMods.</p><figure><figcaption>Hope you're ready to do this stuff. Credit: Valve</figcaption></figure><p>The save file worked wonderfully and contained every available weapon and potential item in the game. This is basically everything I could ask for, and I should state the person who uploaded that save is a saint. But doing that does feel a little wrong. This wasn’t <em>my Pinocchio</em>, and though I can respec him, it felt like living in another person’s skin. What’s more, this file is on its third playthrough, and every added layer of New Game Plus makes the game harder, so even though I am well positioned gear-wise for the DLC, everything in it hits like an 18-wheeler. Apparently, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiesOfP/comments/1l6d9ki/i_need_ng1_save_file/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at least one other person is in this situation as well</a>.</p><p>At the end of the day this whole mess could have been avoided. Archiving is ultimately my responsibility, and I’m going to <a href="https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start running it on a schedule</a>. I knew the DLC was coming up, and I wish I had had the foresight to just back up my saves or buy the game on Steam to begin with. Because if you play a game on a service where you don’t own the game, can you even say that your experiences are yours?</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/best-indie-games-summer-game-fest-2025"><h3>Seven Cool Video Games I Saw During (Well, After) Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>From LEGO to bicycles to...whatever the Yakuza guys are doing next</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-demo"><h3>Baby Steps Makes Me Feel Bad That I Stopped Meditating</h3></a><p>When did I become the least patient person in the world</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
