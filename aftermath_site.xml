This thin, telescoping rod a few feet long was a staple of game shows from the 70s. They haven’t made that microphone, or really any like it, for decades, but they should, not just because the parts are cheap, but for an entirely different reason: TikTok.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Match Game - Gene's Microphone" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3D2onJTja_c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Holding a tiny lav microphone with your hand became kinda a meme a while back among annoying TikTok interviewers. Though this feels like it’s designed in a lab to aggravate anybody with a film production background, I also see the point: lavalier mics–the tiny, wireless mics frequently pinned to the lapel of a shirt–got tremendously cheap in the last few years. What used to be a substantial investment (I have some Sennheiser eW100s gathering dust in a closet) has now gotten silly cheap with companies like Røde, DJI, and Hollyland all offering solid quality wireless options for online content creators. What’s more, the spectacle of using one incorrectly became a purposefully irritating meme unto itself. It also serves a practical purpose: it’s slightly less alarming or formal to a stranger on the street than a stick mic.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Match Game: The Day Gene's Mic Grew" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BkrlEIaQrkw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This was also the appeal of the Long Ass 70s mic. Bob Barker is the name most people associate with it, but Gene Rayburn from <em>Match Game</em> used one. As far as I can tell it is <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lukpac/28666027418/in/album-72157694426924062" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Sony ECM-51</a>, an electret condenser mic set to the end of a telescoping pole. My understanding from a bunch of forum posts is that the capsule is based on the <a href="https://tapeop.com/reviews/gear/43/ecm-50-mic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony ECM-50</a> lav mic, a lineage that continues today with the <a href="https://pro.sony/ue_US/products/lavalier-and-headset-microphones/ecm-55b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony ECM-55B</a>, which is still in production although Sony has long since exited the Long Ass 70s Mic game. If they don’t decide to jump on it, someone else should.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bob Barker Has a Minor Mic Malfunction Before a Game of TEMPTATION - The Price is Right 1982" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7wLgiNFaprM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Due to the ECM-51’s legacy and novelty as being <em>the</em> game show mic, a properly functioning unit goes for <a href="https://reverb.com/item/4073559-vintage-sony-ecm-51-bob-barker-telescoping-condenser-microphone-works-great-screen-battery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of money</a>. Sony and a handful of other companies also made similar but less noticeable mics, and other gooseneck style mics exist. But designing a replica using off the shelf lavaliers and parts should not be impossible. If smartly done, you could even potentially update it for wireless functionality.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Opening the package for my Sony ECM-51 microphone" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0IsGcAtqkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Here is my most Millennial-coded plea: the long ass game show mic deserves a second chance. It has a form factor that’s iconic and visually striking. It’s weird, it’s sleek, and it’s vaguely disarming in a memey way. It serves a distinct purpose that content creators have accidentally discovered via reverse engineering. I need someone to bring back the long ass 70s mic, because if they don’t, I’ll be forced to make one from scratch myself.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/soccer-mommy-stardew-valley"><h3>Soccer Mommy’s Guide To Stardew Valley, The Coziest Video Game Ever</h3></a><p>The open-hearted indie rocker plays the farming game for the romance</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
