            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/avatar-disney-concept-artist<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday the official social media account of the <em>Avatar </em>series <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zacharyberger.bsky.social/post/3lap2l5awjk2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted some concept art by creature designer Zachary Berger</a>, which was then shared by the main Disney account, putting the image in front of potentially <em>hundreds of thousands </em>of people.&nbsp;</p><p>That's extremely commonâ€“big companies use art to hype and sell their stuff all the timeâ€“but what made this stand out was the fact that <a href="https://linktr.ee/artofzachary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Berger was directly credited</a>. That almost never happens!</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:vvcleiau3hx7bx4ojnokhl5q/app.bsky.feed.post/3lap2l5awjk2w" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreighcbx76skscshdv6e4x3qiffboguo7xpm5ovhljsrr636ubfqc5e"><p lang="en">Well, this is a career first - so cool to have artwork shared by the official accounts and actually have my name credited!! ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯Speaks volumes about Dylan Cole, Ben Procter, Aashrita Kamath and the rest of the leadership for making sure the team receives proper credit!!</p>â€” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vvcleiau3hx7bx4ojnokhl5q?ref_src=embed">Zachary Berger (@zacharyberger.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vvcleiau3hx7bx4ojnokhl5q/post/3lap2l5awjk2w?ref_src=embed">2024-11-11T19:30:30.422Z</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Think about it: whenever you see a piece of production art featured in a social media post or a press release or a game announcement at a big televised showcase, all you ever see is the art. You never know who made it, whether it was created by an individual or a small team (or even a studio).&nbsp;</p><p>This isn't an accident! The companies who own these games never bother to credit the artist, because the art isn't seen as <em>art</em>. It's a brick, a piece of company property, which is why even <em>years </em>after a project is finished--or thrown in the bin before it can even reach that point--<a href="https://aftermath.site/most-video-game-artwork-will-never-be-seen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artists working in video games aren't allowed to share things they've created</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In this rare exception to the rule, Berger tells us the crediting was likely down to the fact that many of his bosses on the project come from an art background, like production designers Aashrita Kamath and Dylan Cole. "I have been working in the entertainment/film industry for around a decade and a half, and this has NEVER happened to me", Berger says. "It is an incredible reminder that we work with an amazing group of people who genuinely care about their team."</p><p>So this is cool! And if Avatar and Disney can do it, then anyone can do it, including big games publishers and marketing companies. More of this please!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
