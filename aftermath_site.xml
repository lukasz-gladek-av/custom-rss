            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some moments force you to step back and take stock of a situation, and last week was as good (read: bad) as any: Microsoft announced that it’s<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> laying off another 9,000 people</a>, many of them in games. Meanwhile, Windows has been repeatedly enshittified, Office sucks, Xbox is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everywhere and nowhere all at once</a>, and the company is forcing AI down everybody’s throats, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ai-is-no-longer-optional-microsoft-is-allegedly-pressuring-employees-to-use-ai-tools-through-manager-evaluations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including those of its remaining employees</a>. It is also <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aiding and abetting a genocide in Gaza</a> via its Azure cloud and AI services. Nobody asked for this, and we don’t have to put up with it.</p><p>Recently, Luke argued that Microsoft should try <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-phil-spencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off one person</a>, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, instead of thousands. I don’t hate this idea! But I also immediately saw people reply to Luke’s piece by saying that Xbox president Sarah Bond and/or Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty are the real problem; Spencer is merely the smug face of this flailing operation. That in mind, I come to you with a slightly different argument: No matter who’s in charge, there’s no salvaging Microsoft or Xbox. The entire enterprise is rotten to the core.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if we keep our focus squarely on games, we’re talking about a behemoth that chose to scoop up a mindbogglingly large chunk of fertile game development soil. Recent standouts include the entirety of Activision Blizzard (an operation spanning well over 20 studios), all of Zenimax/Bethesda (which includes subsidiaries like id Software and Arkane), Double Fine, Obsidian, and inXile – all with no apparent long-term plan beyond digging a very deep hole. The story of Microsoft’s tenuous grip on third place has <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not been the games</a>; instead, it’s one of <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cuts</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closures</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>OK, that’s not entirely fair. Microsoft did sort of have a plan: Game Pass, a subscription service that was supposed to become the Netflix of games, but which so far has yet to transform the gaming landscape the way the latter did for TV and film. What if it did, though? What was the long-term play? Arkane founder (and current WolfEye Studios creative director) Raphael Colantonio recently summed it up by declaring the whole enterprise “unsustainable,” echoing a sentiment shared by many in the industry <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflix-of-games-a-threat-to-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for years</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think Game Pass is an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by [Microsoft's] ‘infinite money,’ but at some point reality has to hit," he <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941512826687980019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “I don’t think GP can co-exist with other models; they’ll either kill everyone else or give up.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft has proven <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-confirms-game-pass-cannibalizes-sales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hesitant to publicly admit</a> what common sense would infer to be true: Games included in a relatively cheap – <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though increasingly expensive</a> – subscription package sell less. Microsoft, meanwhile, insists that Game Pass is at least profitable on its own terms, but Colantonio believes otherwise.</p><p>"Game Pass is only [profitable] if you ignore the 100 billions that MS spent in acquiring content for GP such as Zenimax and Activision," he <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941599266004259310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Game Business’ Chris Dring added another layer to this dynamic: “I asked for clarification on the 'Game Pass is profitable' claim, and was told no first-party costs are included,” he <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1941933309900013850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “What they don’t count is the lost revenue that Xbox’s first-party studios are seeing as a result of the service. I have to imagine if first-party studios received similar compensation [to third-party studios on Game Pass], that profitability might not be correct.”</p><p>All of which is to say: Outside of funding indies – money that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/romero-games-reportedly-met-with-microsoft-just-a-day-before-the-publisher-pulled-funding-for-the-studio-and-there-was-no-mention-of-the-decision-that-put-over-100-people-out-of-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be drying up</a> – Microsoft’s presence has in the long run proven actively detrimental to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-delay-doesnt-mean-the-games-industrys-in-trouble-its-already-dead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what remains of the video game industry</a>, in some ways by design. As massive mega-corporations are wont to do, it viewed games as a spigot from which to fill its buckets with capital. The drought it left in its wake – closed studios, laid off employees, a dearth of future opportunities, and a less functional approach to game sales – would be none of its concern. And what do we have to show for it? A first-party slate that, outside of gems like <em>Avowed</em>, is more defined by misses (<em>Crackdown 3</em>), curious absences (<em>Fable</em>), and cancellations (<em>Scalebound</em>, <em>Everwild</em>, <em>Perfect Dark</em>) than anything resembling hits.</p><p>There’s just no reason to support Microsoft’s gaming endeavors at this point. It’s had plenty of time to get things right; it’s not going to. The company’s other endeavors aren’t looking great, either. I’m not saying you’ve got to uninstall Windows right this second, but there’s a wider, better world out there than the misanthropic product universe Microsoft would very much like us all to remain confined to. The best time to start divesting from Microsoft was years ago, or when its products first began sustaining Israel’s endless assault on Palestinians, or yesterday. The second best time is now.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-kotaku-sold-endless-mode-microsoft"><h3>Games Media Actually Had A Good Week, For Once</h3></a><p>"Kotaku was sold to what is essentially a mom ‘n’ pop media company; Paste is owned by a guy"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-game-pass-unsustainable]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The anime and manga industry might not flaunt romances between its creators, but it certainly has its share of “it couples.” Arguably, the most beloved is the duo of <a href="https://x.com/catsuka/status/1882592418966675501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hunter X Hunter’s </em>Yoshihiro Togashi and<em> Sailor Moon’s </em>Naoko Takeuchi</a>. But during Anime Expo and Japan Expo weekend, I witnessed a quieter but equally powerful couple in <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> creator Hideaki Anno and his wife, acclaimed manga artist <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/2340/Moyoco_Anno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moyoco</a>, who showed off their bond in the most anime way imaginable: having Hideaki’s Studio Khara produce an animated short honoring the 20th anniversary of Moyoco's magical girl series, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-07-04/moyoco-anno-sugar-sugar-rune-manga-gets-new-anime-projects/.226309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Sugar Sugar Rune</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In tandem with Khara’s release of a CG prologue of <em>Sugar Sugar Rune</em>— directed by <em>Evangelion: 3.0+1.0: Thrice Upon A Time</em> CG director Yusuke Matsui—came with the announcement of the series getting a full anime adaptation. But as far as I and my Twitter timeline were concerned, the real headline wasn’t the adaptation. It was Hideaki being anime’s reigning “wife guy.” What I didn’t realize at the time though was that this sweet gesture was just one of many adorable, deeply supportive moments the Annos have shared over their 23-year marriage. Turns out, the couple’s love story has been quietly unfolding like a real life slice-of-life series, and they might just be my new favorite couple in the industry.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="『シュガシュガルーン』連載20周年記念短編映像「SUGAR SUGAR RUNE　Les deux sorcières」（ シュガシュガルーン  レ・ドゥー・ソルシエール）" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qidzapjAMVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In my own sleuthing on the couple over the weekend as Aftermath’s resident anime correspondent, I stumbled across this gem of a Twitter post. It referenced an old interview with Hideaki Anno, where he was asked about his ideal woman. Without hesitation, he simply replied, “My wife, of course.”</p><p>While this answer was the best he could have given, it hit me a little harder than I expected.&nbsp;Anno, like his mentor Hayao Miyazaki, is often reduced online to a caricature of himself—a brooding auteur with a mecha fixation and a backlog of unresolved self-esteem issues poured especially thick into <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>’s Shinji Ikari.&nbsp;</p><p>This was something else. This was the sign of a man who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideaki-anno-the-final-challenge-of-evangelion-is-the-inside-look-into-anime-creation-fans-need/1100-6495833/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">routinely oscillates between perfectionism and overwork</a> being visibly healed by his partner’s love. Somewhat tastelessly, some fans have joked about Moyoco needing to divorce him or something so his downward depressive spiral would yield another work like <em>Eva</em>, missing the entire point of how their partnership gave way to the rehabilitating theme of the <em>Rebuild </em>movies. The remakes of <em>Evangelion</em>’s narrative in movie form immortalized Anno’s love for Moyoco through <a href="https://evangelion.fandom.com/wiki/Mari_Makinami_Illustrious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mari Illustrious Makinami. </a><a href="https://note.com/anno_moyoco/n/n5d5c137b64ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Despite Moyoco and Khara’s pushing back</a> on Mari being literally Moyoco, she is still <em>a lot</em> like Moyoco.</p><p>On a surface level, Mari’s addition to the sequel-meets-remake animated films disrupted the long-standing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/comments/9u7ybg/rei_vs_asuka/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rei vs Asuka</a> discourse <em>Eva </em>fans are still debating over (<a href="https://youtu.be/abnEeNWxzNM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the correct answer is Misato</a>). However, knowing the real-life inspiration behind Mari makes her role resonate differently with me now. It’s not a stretch to see Shinji as a stand-in for Hideaki himself—an emotionally withdrawn guy burdened by legacy and locked in a strained relationship with his father. And then Mari comes parachuting into his life (<a href="https://youtu.be/4qK87ftbU5A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">literally</a>). She’s bold, irreverent, blunt, and tonally different from anything in the series. She doesn’t just shift the narrative into uncharted waters; she shifts its emotional current for the better as a chaotic symbol of new transformation breaking through the static of an otherwise doomed narrative.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Evangelion 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time ENDING" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XMmcwrb8OIs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In <em>Thrice Upon a Time</em>, Mari is the one who reaches out to a once-doomed kid along the way with gentle nudges as he finally makes peace with his father and steps into adulthood. Given that Mari was modeled after Moyoco, its ending, which shows the two as grown-ups <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmcwrb8OIs&amp;pp=ygUkdGhyaWNlIHVwb24gYSB0aW1lIGV2YW5nZWxpb24gZW5kaW5n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaving a train station hand in hand</a>, becomes even more meaningful. It also helps that his wife was a <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/3786/Shin_Evangelion_Movie_%7C%7C/characters#staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">character designer for the film</a> and is a <a href="https://www.khara.co.jp/info-en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managing director at Khara</a> alongside Anno’s friends <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-kazuya-tsurumaki-interview-2000593812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuya Tsurumaki</a>, Hiroyasu Kobayashi, and Nobuo Kawakami.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Characters from "Neon Genesis Evangelion" drawn by Moyoco Anno (Happy Mania, Sugar Sugar Rune,...) who is also Hideaki Anno's wife. <a href="https://t.co/6uht0UJ1nM">pic.twitter.com/6uht0UJ1nM</a></p>— Otaking 🇵🇸 (@TheOtaking) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheOtaking/status/1533526622057422851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2022</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Hideaki and Moyoco’s love is a collaborative and creative two-way street. Beyond drawing her take on <em>Eva</em>'s<em> </em>characters and <a href="https://x.com/anno_moyoco/status/765873763850125313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actors in <em>Shin Godzilla</em></a>, Moyoco has also pulled a page from <a href="https://x.com/ShinEyeZehUhh/status/1846632512044351530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Takeuchi’s playbook</a> in penning an autobiographical manga called <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-02-16/moyoco-anno-insufficient-direction-manga-launches-project" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Insufficient Direction</em></a>. In it, she chronicles the quirks and joys of being married to Hideaki. My favorite moments from the manga was when she revealed that Anno wore <em>Kamen Rider</em> cosplay at their wedding, and that she helped him overcome his picky eating tendencies by introducing zucchini into his diet.&nbsp;</p><p>In a world where Hideaki is so often reduced to a creative who's at his best when he’s going through it like anime’s Adele, it’s genuinely heartwarming to see a different portrait emerge online of him, one which paints him in a softer hue. What’s more, Moyoco didn’t just “fix” Hideaki, as many have joked about online. As she notes, being with him helped her embrace her otaku soul. For me, their relationship is a rare kind of alchemy where their personal and professional lives manage to converge in ways that are equally healing and wildly creative.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-kotaku-sold-endless-mode-microsoft"><h3>Games Media Actually Had A Good Week, For Once</h3></a><p>"Kotaku was sold to what is essentially a mom ‘n’ pop media company; Paste is owned by a guy"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/hideaki-anno-is-animes-ultimate-wife-guy]]></content:encoded>
