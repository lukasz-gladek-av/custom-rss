            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/my-famicase-exhibition-2025-meteor-tokyo-japan<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every year, <a href="https://super-meteor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meteor in Tokyo</a> run a cool little exhibition where artists imagine an interesting/funny video game and design a cartridge for it, even though the game itself does not exist. Yet as you're about to see, with the 2025 show now up and running, many of them are so good that you will <em>want </em>them to exist.</p><p>The exhibition, called Famicase, has been running for <em>ages</em>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/famicase-meteor-art-famicom-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is the 19th successive year I've covered it</a>, and it never fails to disappoint. Some of the games look neat, others look terrifying, others still (often my faves) are simply shining examples of video game typography.</p><p>There are actual cartridges hanging on Meteor's walls if you're lucky enough to be able to visit in person, but since most of us can't, the best we can do is<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://famicase.com/25/index.html" target="_blank">&nbsp;admire them from afar courtesy of Meteor's online showcase. You can view them all there, and definitely should</a> (you can also <a href="https://super-meteor.com/?pid=186219428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buy a book!</a>), but for now I'd also just like to highlight some of my favourites:</p><figure><figcaption>By Ena Kim | Home: "It's a warm spring day and life at the cottage is full of wonder."</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>By Trevor Bassett | RING: "RING is an ambient puzzle game that invites you to explore and uncover hidden images. Reveal a deeper meaning as a narrative slowly emerges as you find out where, or who, the rings are coming from."</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>By burisan2023 | エイシャキング・ストーリー</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>By Samuel Weeks | re-visit: "'Remember everything you lost.'

Like the legend of their ancestors, they embarked on a fantastic journey to the West. Through this game, you will become one of them and enjoy the unique magical story."</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>By Skyler Holt | Special Spirit: "Each thinks themselves special, but truly you are--or were. What has happened? Once radiant, the glow has now dimmed. Once mighty, but now diminished. Will you awaken from this slumber of the soul? You are needed. You are missed. Please return to us, Special Spirit."</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>By Jeff Wiggins | RE-FORM: "Forma Series 03 ̶ RE-FORM.
