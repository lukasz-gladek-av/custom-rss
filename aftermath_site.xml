            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-interview-gamechat-discord-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been about a week since Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct, which showcased the console, its upcoming slate of games, and (<a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-direct-price" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eventually</a>) the price. Since then, the internet has been buzzing with both amazement and anger, as fans debate whether new games like <em>Mario Kart World</em> are really worth their higher price tags.</p><p>But Devon Pritchard, Nintendo of America’s VP of Sales, thinks games are only one part of the Switch 2 equation. During an interview with her last Thursday at the Switch 2 preview event in NYC, Pritchard repeatedly stressed that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/gamechat/?srsltid=AfmBOoouUG-qIzczTbXZ6C3DY1Uuxy3OO9AjZMQQkrhcGCoMHZjHeK6n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameChat</a>, the system’s voice- and video-chatting app, is as important as any game, and justifies the higher prices.</p><p>“The [console’s] price is commensurate with the value that the system provides,” she said when asked about the price increase. “And with these social experiences, the Nintendo Switch 2 provides value.”</p><p>Taken at face value, it seems obvious why Nintendo gave GameChat such a flashy introduction during the Direct, and why Switch 2 development director Sumikazu Ono <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-17-gamechat-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calls it the console’s “defining feature:”</a> It’s a new feature that could entice Switch owners to upgrade to the new console, and maybe even buy an official Nintendo webcam. It adds value to the Switch 2 beyond just its expected hardware improvements, like Pritchard says.&nbsp;</p><p>But you could say that about any new feature, including ones that <em>don’t</em> require you to (eventually) pay for an extra Nintendo Switch Online subscription on top of your console. When I asked Pritchard what an ultimately paid service like GameChat offers compared to free apps like Discord, which so many gamers are already using, she said that GameChat’s superiority comes from convenience: “You can imagine that [with third-party apps] your gaming experience starts to involve multiple devices, services, platforms. GameChat is integrated into your gameplay experience.”</p><p>GameChat is indeed integrated into the system — it’s even got its own button. By encouraging players to use their Switch 2 as a singular platform for both gaming and social interaction, Nintendo is integrating players into its ecosystem. That’s simpler to set up and use, sure, but it’s also a strategy that’s become increasingly prevalent over the last decade, as companies like Apple and Google — both of which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12828846/apple-s-greatest-product-is-its-ecosystem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have spent billions to build their respective ecosystems</a> — compete for market share and users’ time. The more versatile an ecosystem is, the stickier it gets. And the stickier it is, the more money it makes, and the less its competitors do.</p><p>Until now, Nintendo has largely eschewed the ecosystem idea beyond its exclusive games. Take the Switch, which had no real social platforms, barely any streaming apps, few ways to share your screenshots; <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-direct-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-metroid-prime-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was a gaming machine</a>. Nintendo wants the Switch 2 to be more than that — in Pritchard’s words, the new console has “two propositions coming out of it.” It’s both a gaming machine and a potential social hub.</p><p>GameChat means more time spent with Nintendo, and less with Discord. The Nintendo Music app, as simple as it may be, means more time with Nintendo, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-nintendo-music-app-is-quickly-becoming-my-main-music-player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and less with YouTube or Spotify</a>. The Nintendo Today smartphone app means more time with Nintendo, and less with an independent news outlet.&nbsp;</p><p>It could also give Nintendo a brand new way to advertise its games: When asked why GameChat will succeed when Nintendo’s past attempts at integrated voice-chat — the WiiSpeak and the Wii U Chat app — didn’t, she told me that it’ll function as “word of mouth” advertising, comparing it to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-streamers-are-leading-the-narrative-for-games-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finding new games by watching Twitch streamers</a>.</p><p>“For example, let’s say you show me a game on GameChat,” she said. “I’ll have the ability to find my way to the eShop to learn more about that game. And so it provides a unique way to open up the library of titles to players.”</p><p>It doesn’t hurt that once the GameChat free trial ends next March, players are actually going to start <em>paying</em> for those passive advertisements. It’s a win-win for Nintendo — assuming that people use the service, which isn’t a guarantee; I’m not sure how many games a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-explains-why-switch-2-gamechat-frame-rate-looked-like-that/1100-6530653/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low-FPS livestream</a> can sell.</p><p>But that’s why Nintendo is pushing GameChat so hard. There’s little chance GameChat will dethrone Discord as the go-to voice-chatting app, even for Switch users. But if it does succeed, it could mean an explosion of new Nintendo Switch Online users, and a huge step forward for Nintendo’s ecosystem.</p><p><em>William Antonelli (he/she/they) is a tech and gaming journalist based in New York City.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/adin-ross-twitch-unbanned-dan-clancy-explains<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the tail end of March, over two years after being given the boot from Twitch, Adin Ross was suddenly unbanned. This came as a surprise to many viewers – and not a pleasant one.</p><p>Ross’ first tenure on the platform came to an end in early 2023, not long after he began cozying up to the likes of professional misogynist and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/andrew-tate-arrests-explained.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assault/trafficking allegations</a> magnet Andrew Tate. Things did not seem on track to improve, with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/adin-ross-andrew-tate-white-supremacists-1234705845/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a> writing a couple months after Ross’ Twitch suspension that he platformed an anonymous neo-Nazi on Kick. As recently as October of 2024, he <a href="https://x.com/BenjaminGoggin/status/1841823020576293197/video/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platformed white nationalist Nick Fuentes</a>, who proceeded to engage in Holocaust denial during the broadcast, as he is wont to do. Ross was also accused of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-i-failed-adin-ross-apologizes-accused-hitler-salute-viral-clip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nazi saluting some fans earlier this year</a>, which is the same year he <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-this-fault-adin-ross-takes-accountability-x-community-saying-evilest-things" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swore he’d turn over a new leaf</a>, at least in regard to chat moderation.&nbsp;</p><p>"I feel defeated tryna even repair things or explain stuff because there’s no explaining,” Ross <a href="https://x.com/AR15thed3mon/status/1899217716130599138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a> after the Nazi salute clip, originally from earlier this year, went viral in March. “I’m pictured the way I’m pictured and it sucks, sorry to everyone I have failed."&nbsp;</p><p>It is not difficult to imagine why Twitch employees, like Twitch viewers, were upset that Ross has been permitted to return to his old, significantly more visible stomping grounds. After all, his recent actions do not exactly scream “reformed.” During a Twitch all-hands meeting that took place last week, of which Aftermath has viewed video, one employee voiced their incredulity to Twitch CEO Dan Clancy.</p><p>"What evidence did you evaluate that Adin Ross had reformed enough since his ban to justify him being unbanned?” the employee asked. “To be transparent, this is one of the decisions we've made that I've disagreed with the most. I strongly believe that this opens the wider community to harm and sends a signal that we will allow the sort of vitriol Adin has been known to perpetuate."&nbsp;</p><p>Clancy largely replied in platitudes and rules-speak, which we’ll get to in a second. But the last part of his response is the most interesting, so let’s start there:</p><p>“I can say this emphatically to everyone: This is [in] no way, shape, or form based upon any business considerations whatsoever,” Clancy said during the meeting. “This isn't even remotely related to a business. It's about deciding about when you can give someone a second chance – and then giving them a chance, but if they don't live up to our expectations, we can take action. So in terms of this opening the wider community to harm, I think that if he doesn't live up to our community guidelines, then he won't still be on Twitch."</p><p>This line of thought is worth scrutinizing, because it’s unlikely that having Adin Ross and his army of disaffected boys back in town is <em>bad </em>for business. Indeed, it could even prove beneficial for Twitch in the long run if the company – and Ross – play their cards right. For one, Ross is undoubtedly a needle mover; his <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-adin-ross-donald-trump-kick-stream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 Kick stream with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump</a>, a masterclass in the art of shameless suck-uppery, peaked at over 580,000 concurrent viewers. For two, the far-right grift is in right now all across the internet, even on Twitch, where Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt’s daily missives decrying DEI and Democrats have installed him as the new politics king over deposed leftist himbo sensation Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker. Hate is against Twitch’s community guidelines – unless you <a href="https://aftermath.site/nickmercs-twitch-ban-transphobia-slur" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">know how to word it correctly</a>.</p><p>Lastly and perhaps most importantly, Ross has crossover appeal; one of the biggest creators <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-kai-cenat-trying-get-adin-ross-unbanned-twitch-one-last-time-amid-rumors-leaving-kick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advocating for his return</a> from exile was Kai Cenat, livestreaming’s biggest star of the past few years and a bonafide <em>real </em>celebrity at this point (though I guess now the two are <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/adin-ross-shades-twitch-streamers-who-abandoned-him-during-two-year-ban-3174580/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maybe beefing</a> over the notion that Cenat didn’t try hard enough to help him get unbanned? I don’t know, man; it’s beside the point). Ross is also buds with manosphere-adjacent luminaries like Jake Paul and UFC president Dana White. Basically, he’s a terrible, irritating link in a lot of lucrative chains.</p><p>If you were Clancy, the head of a company that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/twitch-amazon-video-games-investment-9020db87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everybody knows isn’t profitable</a> – and that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/10/12/amazon-twitch-streamer-70-30-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains in thrall</a> to Jeff Bezos, one of history’s most bottom-line-obsessed overlords – and you were not being disingenuous about your purpose, which is always to make decisions motivated first and foremost by business considerations, you could do quite a bit worse than this.&nbsp;</p><p>The remainder of Clancy’s explanation reiterated his philosophy on the idea of indefinite bans, which he’s outlined elsewhere and which he does seem to really believe in, at least insofar as it allows him to be <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-profitable-layoffs-interview-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nominally friendly with everyone regardless of ideological bent</a>.</p><p>“Adin's been banned for over two years,” Clancy said. “He was banned for having a certain number of strikes on his account rather than a singular offense that [led to] indefinite suspension. It's important to note these suspensions are indefinite, not permanent. They've always been thought of as indefinite. Many organizations use indefinite suspensions. In basketball, Draymond Green was indefinitely suspended from the NBA and then let back on.”</p><p>On Clancy’s watch, Twitch has been allowing indefinite suspensions – and the black marks on streamers’ records left behind by prior suspensions – to expire. Outside of a few select <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3llkq2h2wv224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“high severity harms”</a> like violent content and youth safety, indefinitely suspended streamers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3llkps6psis24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can apply to have their accounts reinstated</a> after six months. Clancy said that Ross passed the test.</p><p>“We have a team that looks into this, and it is always a challenging line. We do believe that it's important for people to be able to change the way they have behaved in the past. I think that's a critical component, and we try to assess the likelihood that you will behave consistent with our guidelines,” he said. “In this case, Adin has made a number of public statements about trying to change where he's been. We've gotten feedback from various people about him trying to change. As always with this, we will see how it works out.”</p><p>Clancy added that Ross will find himself under extra scrutiny for the time being and that he’s looking at fewer potential strikes before he’s out again.</p><p>“In general, for those who are unaware, when people come back from suspensions such as this, we also hold them to a fairly high standard,” Clancy said. “It's not like they start off from ground zero. The severity of any enforcement actions or otherwise might be more severe given where we're at.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-interview-gamechat-discord-price"><h3>With The Switch 2, Even Nintendo Wants To Trap You In An Ecosystem</h3></a><p>Like Sony, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Valve, Epic, and everyone else before it</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/games-writing-words-that-are-bad"><h3>Games Writing Words I Hate</h3></a><p>Let's get pedantic, my favorite thing to be</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
