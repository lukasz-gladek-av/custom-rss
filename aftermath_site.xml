            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'll admit my heart skipped a couple beats during Wednesday's Sony State of Play presentation: Once, when a presenter mentioned <em>The Last of Us</em> and I thought we were somehow going to get another remake, and again when I heard the phrase "Deus Ex" and briefly imagined that, <a href="https://aftermath.site/eidos-deus-ex-embracer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">against all odds</a>, a new game might be in the works. It's not, but a remaster is. On this week's Aftermath Hours, we talk about whether that's a good or bad thing.</p><p>This week, Chris and I are joined by Aftermath contributor Isaiah. We open with Chris being unable to resist talking more about <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-problems-runback-criticism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong</a></em>, and he also tells us how he's finding <em>Silent Hill f</em>. Then, Chris and Isaiah talk some <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/kiss-or-die-netflix-review-comedy-variety-tv-yakuza-like-a-dragon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yakuza</a></em> while I listen politely, because I have to stop trying to play games <a href="https://aftermath.site/crusader-kings-3-help-why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke likes</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to State of Play. Does Insomniac’s <em>Wolverine</em> need all that blood? Isaiah explains how the presentation's focus on the game's <a href="https://www.polygon.com/marvel-wolverine-blood-tech-insomniac-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood tech</a> might hit different to Marvel fans. Then we ask whether we need a <em>Deus Ex </em>remaster when it basically just makes a game from 2000 look like a game from 2004. Also, Chris is really into those <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/introducing-pulse-elevate-sony-interactive-entertainments-first-wireless-speakers-for-desktop-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speakers</a>.</p><p>After that, we talk about the continued fallout from Charlie Kirk’s assassination, with some game devs <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-gamergate-ghost-of-yotei-probablymonsters-fired" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing their jobs</a> over their comments about it, though not as many as in other fields. We also talk about what’s known about <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/the-ice-shooters-motive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the shooter at a Dallas ICE facility</a> this week, and how it feels like meme culture has taken on the role that video games once played in being blamed for violence. We also discuss <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/microsoft-blocks-israels-use-of-its-technology-in-mass-surveillance-of-palestinians" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft no longer letting the Israeli military use its tech for surveillance of Palestinians</a>, on the back of protest movements and reporting by The Guardian. It’s not enough, but it’s a start.</p><p>Chris then praises his new AirPods before we get to this week’s mailbag, where we give horror anime recommendations and discuss our favorite bridges.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank">Spotify</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.
