            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was only in May--just two months ago!--that Polygon, once one of the internet's most prestigious and successful video game websites,<a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> was sold to Valnet, a media company that runs publications that can generously be called content farms</a>.</p><p>It hasn't taken long for the latter's influence to start showing on the former.</p><p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/613513/sponsored-dive-into-cyberpunk-action-off-the-grid-hits-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This</a> is the first story published under the tag "<a href="https://www.polygon.com/advertiser-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Advertiser Content</a>" (and is also the first Polygon story published by<a href="https://www.polygon.com/authors/josh-coulson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> this author</a>), but you can bet it won't be the last. And while stories like this are nothing new--sponsored content has long run on many other sites,<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/the-nvidia-blackwell-guide-to-doom-the-dark-ages-best-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> like PC Gamer</a>--efforts are normally made to either make the stories look different to a site's regular content or, in the case of the PC Gamer<em> </em>ad I just linked to, be about something that's clearly not written by the outlet's regular team.</p><p>This Polygon piece looks just like a regular news item, and is worded exactly like you'd expect something appearing on a Valnet site to be worded, the only points of difference being that tiny (though brightly coloured) "Advertiser Content" badge and the ghastly sentence "This content was produced in collaboration with Valnet Inc. and the sponsor, Gunzilla Games."</p><p>Fun fact: the game being advertised here, <em>Off The Grid</em>,<a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-gunzilla" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> is from the same company that now owns Game Informer</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UPDATE 12:40am ET, July 18</strong>: <em>A very similar piece, though with different wording, <a href="https://kotaku.com/off-the-grid-steam-neill-blomkamp-game-1851786461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was also published on Kotaku</a></em>. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse"><h3>â€˜Friendslopâ€™ Isnâ€™t Real, But People Love Posting About It Anyway</h3></a><p>But people are still intent on dunking on the idea of someone saying "friendslop" and meaning it.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lets-plays-sleep-youtube"><h3>Is Falling Asleep To Letâ€™s Plays Medically Approved Gamer Melatonin Or Nah</h3></a><p>A gamer neurologist discusses whether YouTubers are onto something with this Millennial-meets-Gen-Z craze</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/polygon-valnet-off-the-grid-gunzilla-rip-this-sucks]]></content:encoded>
