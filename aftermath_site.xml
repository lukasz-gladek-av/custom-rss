            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-microsoft-muse-ai-xbox-avowed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What a week Microsoft has had. On one hand, it published a clear game of the year contender in <a href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-subtitles-lore-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Avowed</em></a>, a fantasy role-playing game jam-packed with surprises and inventive touches. On the other, it <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-muse-ai-phil-spencer-dipshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Muse</a>, a game-making tool no one asked for that serves as additional proof that generative AI’s time is running out. The contrast here is stark: <em>Avowed </em>is such a revelatory experience in large part because its world feels <a href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-dawnshore-lighthouse-obsidian-microsoft-xbox-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meticulously crafted</a> by a human team with a specific vision in mind. Tools like Muse threaten to displace those people. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>We begin the episode champing at the bit to talk about <em>Avowed</em>, but first, The News: NetEase shocked the game-playing public by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-director-and-entire-seattle-design-team-laid-off-netease-tells-fans-not-to-worry-about-the-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off</a> members of the team behind <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, the biggest breakout success story to come out of the live service sector in years. What happened? Well, decaying relations between the United States and China, for one, but also a seismic <a href="https://nikopartners.com/chinese-video-game-companies-are-adapting-their-us-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shift in how Chinese companies are developing games</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we discuss Microsoft’s new Muse AI, which it intends on shoehorning into game development projects – a plan you will not be surprised to learn that nobody likes! Game developers <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/xbox-muse-generative-ai-developers-say-nobody-will-want-this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">least of all</a>! This is especially pertinent considering that Microsoft just published <em>Avowed</em>, a fantasy role-playing game that’s so good because it was crafted by human hands in a way that feels tangible for every second of the experience.&nbsp;</p><p>We then talk about all the things we like about <em>Avowed</em>: The world design, the combat, the (slightly wonky) progression, and even the fact that your main character is a weird-looking cop who everyone regards with suspicion. Lastly, we decide which game console would work best as a house (Gamecube for humans, PlayStation 4 or 5 <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-repairmen-explain-why-cockroaches-love-ps4s-1794393470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for roaches</a>).</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can write so many blogs about <em>Avowed </em>that companies will finally attempt to succeed at the Video Game Industry Value People Challenge (Impossible).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> [Microsoft] might as well just be an AI company at this point. They have services – whatever. The degree to which Microsoft is all in on this shit is so troubling that I worry from an existential perspective what happens when it all drops out. I wonder what happens to the game studios, I wonder what happens to Xbox, I wonder what happens to the very good games they seem to be investing in. It’s gonna tank a lot of things, and I know it’s small-minded to narrow it down to just this thing, but I’m looking at what’s in front of me, and I don’t want to lose that.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> The [Muse] announcement almost felt like it was under duress, like it was a hostage video in some ways. Not Phil Spencer’s performance and input specifically, but just the packaging around the whole thing suggests that Microsoft is so overextended on AI.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> They’ve got to put it in everything, in every corner of their business.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Yep. “Xbox, it’s your turn. You need to come up with something. We need a name for it. We need some videos. Sell AI.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The crux of all of this – and this was true with <a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-ai-demo-imagination-creation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA’s AI demonstration last year</a>, too; the one with all the cardboard boxes that looked like dogshit – is that companies keep going back to this notion of “We’re going to give you something that will help you come up with ideas.” That’s the one thing nobody is lacking! There are so many ideas! There are too many ideas!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Have you ever talked to a stranger at GameStop? They will give you ideas for video games unprompted.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Admittedly, they’re not very good, but…&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Yeah, often with the caveat of “I don’t know how to program or do much of anything, but…” But there’s no shortage of imagination. It’s not the expensive thing you need to automate. This is the thing: Games are so hard to make well that all they have is, like, a Magic Eight Ball or whatever the fuck they’re coming up with. It’s bad.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think it’s especially pertinent because we’ve all been playing <em>Avowed</em>, and one of the standout qualities of it is that it feels very deliberately handcrafted. You can feel the human touch of that entire studio everywhere you go in that game. And I saw somebody on Bluesky talking about it last night, saying that, in some ways, because it feels so designed, it does add this element of artificiality to it. It feels like a video game. But that’s not a bad thing in this case. I think it really accentuates the game's positive qualities.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>The number one way they’re probably describing that is that you associate a game in that engine and in this setting with being a sprawling open-world <em>Skyrim </em>or <em>Witcher </em>kind of thing where you can ride your horse or walk around for days on end and not see anything.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> And you have all these big, empty landscapes.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>This is a theme park RPG. This is a small open world, and you cannot walk over a hill or turn a corner without running into someone who’s in trouble or a bunch of mushroom monsters or something like that. There’s no vast wilderness here. There’s something everywhere. Because it’s not trying to be a realistic landscape, it’s like “This is a video game. You’ve got swords and spells, and you want to hit shit, and you want to kill things, and you want to save people. We are gonna put this stuff everywhere, and it’s gonna be super cool because you can do something at all times.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> And [Obsidian is basically saying] “It’s gonna be so rich with things that we have written, that matter to us to convey.” The fact that that is everywhere, that it suffuses the whole project, is indicative of where their priorities lie compared to these other open-world games that are very big and sprawling but are maybe lacking in substance in other areas.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-obsidian-magic-gun-combat"><h3>I Love Being A Gun-Wielding Wizard In Avowed</h3></a><p>The only thing more fun than talking my way out of problems is shooting people.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-dei-remove-website-cowards"><h3>IGN’s Parent Company Ziff Davis Removes ‘DEI’ Mentions From Its Website</h3></a><p>Some sections mentioning diversity 'have been removed from the website entirely'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/avowed-obsidian-magic-gun-combat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I play fiddly role playing games, I usually like to talk my way out of problems. But what’s really surprised me about <em>Avowed</em> is how fun it is to be a wizard with a gun.</p><p><em>Avowed’s</em> combat systems really intimidated me at first. I’m playing a character with high perception and intelligence, which opens up a lot of interesting conversation options. Between that and the simplicity of just hitting things with a sword and blocking them with a shield, I figured I wouldn’t waste my energy fighting when I didn’t have to.&nbsp;</p><p>I changed my mind on this once I finally got my hands on a gun, inspired by advice from Chris Person. The novelty of having a gun in a robust fantasy world is hilarious enough—but you can also dual wield basically every weapon, as well as mix and match. Putting a grimoire in my off hand and using a pistol as my main weapon, ranged combat becomes a thrill. As enemies rush at me through a narrow corridor, I trap them in place with a spell, then I open my palm and spray them with fire, burning them and giving them a status effect that delivers damage over time. As if that wasn’t enough, I shoot them in the fucking head.</p><p>As a combat-agnostic player, I’ve surprised myself by my willingness to try and re-try combat encounters in <em>Avowed</em>. It isn’t just setting trapped enemies on fire and then putting pellets in their brains, it’s the way that elemental magic works with other characters and on the <a href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-dawnshore-lighthouse-obsidian-microsoft-xbox-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">environment</a>. When you hit enemies with a spell that freezes them, your companions can then shatter them with their own weapons. That same ice spell can also freeze water, giving you temporary platforms to climb to find new vantage points for shooting, burning, freezing and electrifying enemies. The more I play, the more possibilities open up. One unique pistol delivers electric damage, and then can be enchanted to deliver shock damage to nearby enemies. There is nothing that I want more than to be able to add electrocution to my repertoire of trapping, burning and shooting my many enemies in the Living Lands.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-subtitles-lore-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Talking</a> your way out of problems is still incredibly fun in <em>Avowed</em>, and I won’t stop trying to weasel my way out of combat if I can. With conversation trees this robust, why not exhaust them? But as Teddy Roosevelt once said—speak softly, and carry a big stick.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-microsoft-muse-ai-xbox-avowed"><h3>Microsoft’s New ‘Muse’ AI Is Doubly Bad Because Avowed Is So Good</h3></a><p>"The [Muse] announcement almost felt like it was under duress, like it was a hostage video in some ways"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-dei-remove-website-cowards"><h3>IGN’s Parent Company Ziff Davis Removes ‘DEI’ Mentions From Its Website</h3></a><p>Some sections mentioning diversity 'have been removed from the website entirely'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
