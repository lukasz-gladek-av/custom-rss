            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/but-i-like-to-slide-the-joy-con<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This morning, Nintendo<a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-rumors-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> finally</a> announced the Switch 2, or at least showed a console that looks a lot like everyone thought it would and set a Direct with more details for April. The hardware-minded among us are certainly rushing to analyze every frame of the trailer, but I am a simple man with a simple complaint: I still want to slide in the Joy-Con.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 – First-look trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itpcsQQvgAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In the trailer above, you can see that instead of sliding the Joy-Con into place from the top of the console like the current Switch, they click in from the sides. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-reportedly-revealed-in-alleged-image-leak-and-internet-sleuths-are-trying-to-work-out-what-it-all-means" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a> wrote of an alleged leak of the controllers back in January that “[the] new Joy-Con allegedly ditch the railed lock method used by the current Switch in favor of electromagnetic suction controllers,” though in the trailer there appears to be a connector.</p><p>We’ll know more about how and why this all works in April, but if you’ll allow me to engage in the internet-old tradition of complaining about things I don’t know much about, I don’t like it! I want to slide the Joy-Con. Is it the best connection system in the world? No. Some players have found that the rail <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/rci8im/tips_to_protect_the_console_rails_from_bending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bends</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/q8zgrt/switch_oled_joycon_wobble/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wiggles</a>, and it’s certainly not a seamless glide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But still, sliding the Joy-Con in feels like the aesthetic heart of my experience of the Switch, a stance that’s backed up by the animation that opens every <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKlRN2YpxRE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch game</a> trailer of a Joy-Con sliding into place vertically. In those trailers, this is accompanied by the sharp “click” that’s triggered a Pavlovian response in me ever since the initial Switch reveal. In today’s trailer, that “click” is replaced by a rounder, somewhat echoey sound. Of course, neither of these are what the actual Joy-Con sound like, and the latter might just be an aesthetic choice for the trailer rather than a new “official” Switch sound.</p><p>This raises some obvious questions: Is Nintendo going to make a new animation? Are we going to get a new Switch sound? I will grudgingly say that change is good because that’s how therapists advise me to think about life, but aren’t we facing enough change these days? I like the little animation. I like the little click. I like to slide my Joy-Con into place like I’m dropping into a world-defining battle in the <em>Power Rangers</em> mech before I spend a whole evening giving people gifts in <em>Stardew Valley</em> when I should be doing something else.</p><p>Fine, fine–change <em>is</em> good, and hopefully the Switch 2 makes many much-needed improvements. While I like to slide the Joy-Con in to connect it, it can be a little annoying to detach; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> writes that it’s possible the new design will allow a button press to push the Joy-Con away from the console instead of clumsily sliding it back out, which sounds much nicer. There’s no mention in the trailer of fixes for Joy-Con drift, but I suppose I’m willing to sacrifice my beloved slide in exchange for a controller that reliably does what I want it to. There’s speculation that the Joy-Con can be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used like a computer mouse</a>, which is… I don’t know, cool I guess? Time marches forward, and things change, and perhaps a new generation will look at old Switch trailers with their slide animation with the same bafflement of my little nieces and nephews when I make a “hanging up the phone” gesture in front of them.</p><p>RIP, Joy-Con slide. I’ll miss you.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/luke-plunkett-aftermath-game-of-the-year-2024"><h3>Luke’s Favourite Video Games Of 2024</h3></a><p>From archaeologists to Barnsworth, it was a good year</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/diy-speaker-pioneer-dennis-murphy-andrew-jones"><h3>The Affordable Accuracy Monitor Is Everything That DIY Should Be</h3></a><p>Dennis Murphy's mod to the now-discontinued Andrew Jones Pioneer speakers are the perfect combination of price and performance.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
