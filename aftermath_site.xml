The history of Manga Video itself is a fascinating and complex topic, an offshoot of the legendary record label Island Records. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AnimEigo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimEigo</a> recently interviewed both Andy Frain and Guinness separately. If you have any interest in the early history of anime distribution, both videos are a fascinating deep dive with two people who have <em>very </em>different tellings of how things went down.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Laurence Guinness stated that members of Bush worked on The Guyver, although the company "Mad Dog Winston" is credited.

The Manga Video dub of <em>Space Pirate Cobra </em>was rescored using the music by Swiss duo Yello (most notable for the song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jJkdRaa04g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oh Yeah</a>” from <em>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</em>), and Guinness claims in the video that Gavin Rossdale and Nigel Pulsford from Bush were commissioned to work on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNRRjiINRKA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intro</a> for <em>The Guyver</em> (although if they do not appear to be credit in the original release.) </p><p><strong>(Update: the company "<a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/153787-Mad-Dog-Winston-Music-Ltd?redirected=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mad Dog Winston</a>" is listed as the publishing company for Bush. This is who is credited in the Manga Video release, so this does scan with Guinness' telling.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Anime Business - Andy Frain and the story of Manga Video" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ToXPQL1CDOs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The Spice Girls revelation comes near the end of Guiness’ interview. For a brief time Manga Video experimented with not just distributing anime but co-production as well. At one point Guinness mentions that a Wu-Tang Clan anime called <em>The Imperial Warrior</em> was far along but never materialized. He then goes on to several production stills from what he claims is a pitch for a Spice Girls anime produced by Production I.G, the studio that would produce both Patlabor movies, <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, and much more. </p><figure><figcaption>Credit: <a href="https://youtu.be/RKAljpMpnj4?si=UhR6jo-WeV_LAI6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimEigo</a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Credit: <a href="https://youtu.be/RKAljpMpnj4?si=UhR6jo-WeV_LAI6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimEigo</a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Credit: <a href="https://youtu.be/RKAljpMpnj4?si=UhR6jo-WeV_LAI6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimEigo</a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Credit: <a href="https://youtu.be/RKAljpMpnj4?si=UhR6jo-WeV_LAI6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimEigo</a></figcaption></figure><p>It’s unproductive to mourn things that might have never been, but looking at production cells of Baby Spice running from a T-Rex like child Gohan, the whole crew posted up like Dirty Pair, or Posh Spice looking sick as hell on a motorcycle in front of a pre-9/11 skyline hurts to think about. Manga Video had bigger problems near the end and would eventually fall apart, but if the Spice Girl anime had snuck by like that, imagine how sick it would have been.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lollipop-chainsaw-game-reboot-anime-woke-nonsense-dei-back-in-my-day"><h3>Let’s All Read A Shitty Video Game Press Release Together</h3></a><p>'The development process will prioritize staying true to the distinctive tone and spirit of the original work, without...'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ozzy-osbourne-death-blizzcon-2009-world-of-warcraft"><h3>Ozzy Osbourne Played A Video Game Convention In 2009, And It Ruled</h3></a><p>"The kids had a great time.
