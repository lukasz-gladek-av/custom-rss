            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-deal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SAG-AFTRA, the union representing video game voice actors who have been on strike since <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">July 2024</a>, announced early Tuesday that it's <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a tentative agreement</a> with video game companies.</p><p>The tentative agreement still needs to be reviewed by SAG-AFTRA's National Board and ratified by members. The union says that members will remain on strike until a strike suspension agreement is signed, which the union expects "will be finalized with employers soon."</p><p>“Everyone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike," SAG-AFTRA  National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in the press release. "Patience and persistence has resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary A.I. guardrails that defend performers’ livelihoods in the A.I. age, alongside other important gains."</p><p>Video game voice actors initially struck over an inability to come to an agreement on the use of AI, after voting to authorize a strike in <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 2023</a>. In January 2024, the union signed a <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftras-ai-voice-acting-deal-was-a-powder-keg-waiting-to-go-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contentious deal</a> with AI company Replica. At an <a href="https://aftermath.site/voice-actor-picket-sag-aftra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early picket</a> in August, striking union member and negotiator Zeke Alton told Aftermath, “If we can’t get protection [against unfair uses of AI], then it sets a precedent where no one can get protection.” Since then, SAG-AFTRA has signed interim agreements with <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-the-game-awards-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">136 video game productions</a> containing AI protections. But through the course of the strike, the union failed to come to agreements with major companies such as Activision, EA, Epic, WB, Take 2, and Insomniac.</p><p>“Our video game performers stood strong against the biggest employers in one of the world’s most lucrative industries," SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said in the press release. "Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal."</p><p><em><strong>Correction 6/10/25, 1am</strong>--An initial version of this article misstated when SAG-AFTRA signed the deal with Replica.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-demo"><h3>Baby Steps Makes Me Feel Bad That I Stopped Meditating</h3></a><p>When did I become the least patient person in the world</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoff-keighleys-yellow-sneakers"><h3>You Can Always Count On Sneakers</h3></a><p>The one thing you can count on Summer Game Fest for</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/felt-that-boxing"><h3>Nope, No, No Thank You</h3></a><p>I love this idea, please keep it away from me</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
