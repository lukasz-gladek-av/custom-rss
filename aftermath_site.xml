Let's get through it together.</p><p>What's going to happen today? Who knows. Will we know who won tonight? Almost certainly not. Is that going to stop me from obsessively inhaling every possible snippet of information and guesses and talking heads for the next god knows how many days? Nope! I am going to have very bad boundaries and experience every possible emotion and generally drive myself bonkers.</p><p>I hope you are making far more healthy choices.
