            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/agent-47-hitman-assassin-cost-hire<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hitman</em>'s Agent 47 is the world's premier assassin, a man able to blend in with his surroundings at will, to get within arm's reach of the most secure and often most <em>dangerous </em>people on the planet. For much of his career he's been a man on a mission, but I have recently been wondering how much it would cost to hire him for a single job.</p><p>Me being able to entertain this possibility is canon! At the end of <em>Hitman 3</em> he and Diana essentially go off grid, leaving Providence behind to continue their work together as <a href="https://aftermath.site/hitman-freelancer-the-best-kind-of-hitman-is-more-hitman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freelancers</a>.<a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Which I'm assuming doesn't pay as well as a staff job</a>, but if the gig economy has come for <em>us</em>, then it has come for Agent 47 as well.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like us</a>–and this is one of the only times I can make such a comparison, at least until I get balder–Agent 47 now has to worry about doing his own taxes, quoting for jobs and just generally living the small business hustle. His work pays (presumably) a lot more than ours does, so I’m sure he’ll be fine, but still, the leap from Providence employee to small business owner will be a challenge for him.</p><p>Which also means Agent 47's loss could be our gain. Prior to the events of <em>Hitman 3</em> he only worked in the shadows, the most lethal puppet on a string on the planet, a plaything of the powerful in their struggles against the...also powerful, but slightly more evil. If anyone else<em> </em>needed work done back then we'd have had to hire an assassin out of the phonebook, or Facebook Marketplace, or the dark web, or know a guy who knew a guy, all of which were just as likely to see us end up in prison as the target whacked.</p><p>These days though, Agent 47 is just out there for hire! He could, and presumably <em>would </em>(after repeated quicksaves and reloads, anyway) be able to do any job on the planet provided the pay was right.</p><p>Which leads me to wonder: <em>hypothetically speaking</em>, how much would a contract cost? Would Agent 47 charge per kill? Would he charge according to the complexity of the job? Would he scout out the target and present them with a series of quotes, escalating in cost owing to factors like difficulty and comedic value? Would the prospective clients get a certain number of "body in a storage closet" dumps for free, and exceeding that value would result in a surcharge per body?</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/19bp6yz/how_much_do_you_think_it_costs_to_hire_47/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve seen people ask this before</a>, pointing to contract values from previous games and coming up with ballpark figures. <em>Silent Assassin</em>, released in 2002, has Agent 47 saying his standard rate is $100,000, while 2006’s <em>Blood Money</em> paid between $100,000 and $600,000 per job. That’s a while ago though, and Providence probably took a substantial cut of that, so it doesn’t really help with what his rates would be in 2025, particularly given the inflationary and cost-of-living crisis we’re all currently living through.&nbsp;</p><p>And while<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/uruno4/how_expensive_is_a_hitman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> there are publicly available rates for actual hitmen</a>, I suspect that many of those are based on hitmen who were caught, and who also appear to be at the entry level of this particular market. The mafia hiring a guy to whack another guy outside a deli would not cost the same as a single career professional infiltrating an 18th century mansion, sneaking past 72 guards, hacking a security network and executing a renegade tech mogul.&nbsp;</p><p>So yeah, I have no idea how much it would cost to hire Agent 47! I just wonder sometimes, that's all. Please feel free to chime in with your own educated guesses below.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/youtube-inspiration-tab-ai-slop"><h3>YouTube’s New AI Is Inspiring Content Creators To Make Their Videos Boring</h3></a><p>Once again asking, begging, perhaps even pleading the question "Who is this for"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition"><h3>In Defense Of Techwear</h3></a><p>It's where form meets function</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/youtube-inspiration-tab-ai-slop<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last month, YouTube introduced a new generative AI-powered “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDbJGw_Xzos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inspiration</a>” tab for creators. Like so many other gen AI products foisted on us by our increasingly shameless tech overlords, it has proven to be a solution looking for a problem. To creators producing <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samitsarkar.bsky.social/post/3lgcdhviffs2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">award-winning journalistic work</a>, for example, it has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/doomquasar.bsky.social/post/3lgdxgvtodc2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> absolute bangers like “Ranking the most iconic video game villains” and “Top 5 hidden video game secrets revealed.”</p><p>Before we get into more suggestions YouTubers have shared with Aftermath, I want to point out what I feel is the funniest part of this whole thing: Each YouTube-generated video idea is also rated in terms of potential audience interest. The above two suggestions, given to Polygon’s Simone de Rochefort, are considered “very low interest” and “low interest,” respectively. <em>Most </em>suggestions I’ve come across so far, in fact, have been dubbed total snoozers by the system itself. Why would anybody use this?</p><p>Perhaps YouTube is trying to motivate people to spend time with the Inspiration tab’s “Let’s brainstorm” module, which allows you to suggest a topic to get YouTube’s creativity-corroding juices flowing. You can then click on a video to see an outline, titles, and a spread of AI slop thumbnails. In its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDbJGw_Xzos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> introducing the feature, YouTube noted that you can further refine these suggestions with prompts of your own, like “incorporate humor.” Whose humor? At what pace? To what specific end? Who cares. The robot will add a packet of Humor Powder to your gruel, and you’ll like it.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s grim stuff, especially considering <a href="https://x.com/bcmerchant/status/1882151046606475356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companies like Netflix</a>’s documented interest in bulldozing through concerns like licensing and taste to churn out endless – and endlessly bland – buckets of AI mush. YouTube evidently wants actual creators to function as cogs in that machine, which will eventually replace them if the unimaginative soul voids currently running our world have their way.&nbsp;</p><p>But on the upside, this stuff sucks! A lot! That has been and will remain a massive impediment to generative AI’s widespread adoption, which fills me with hope that the AI bubble is on a one-way collision course with a very big needle. That in mind, let’s have a laugh at its expense.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s the Inspiration tab of YouTube video essayist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JacobGeller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Geller</a>:</p><figure><figcaption>Jacob Geller</figcaption></figure><p>Once again, we’re working with bottom-of-the-barrel ideas like “Games that don’t age well” and “Video games that deserve a sequel,” but I want to give special recognition to “How video games teach us about life,” which is accompanied by this incredible thumbnail:</p><figure><figcaption>Jacob Geller</figcaption></figure><p>Honestly, I’d be more likely to click on a video titled "How viideo qvormes teach us aboul tde" than the original suggestion, so maybe YouTube is onto something here.</p><p>“Fdrogttten NENS GEMS," which YouTube’s AI thought would be up Retronauts co-host <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrIttXi0WgLXHI1poCk0D6g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeremy Parish</a>’s alley, is similarly exceptional:</p><figure><figcaption>Jeremy Parish</figcaption></figure><p>I, too, love the Nintendo Entertainment Nintendo System.</p><p>You will not be surprised to learn that an overarching theme of YouTube’s video ideas is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hmsnofun.bsky.social/post/3lgdzdbvda22o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rehashing what creators have already posted before</a>, down to the title. Except, as per usual, generative AI can’t actually understand anything, so it seems to be playing mix and match with titles and ideas. Take, for example, these masterpieces offered to GameSpot associate editor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thecrawl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brendan Hesse</a>:</p><figure><figcaption>Brendan Hesse</figcaption></figure><p>"I already made basically all these videos, including 'Lunacid vs The Crawl,'” Hesse told Aftermath, "but it wasn't a versus; it was just an interview."</p><p>Indie-focused YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/wanderbots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wander</a> received a selection of ideas that seemed to be based on recent high-performing videos, but again, with little rhyme or reason. This resulted in entirely made-up games like <em>Digseum Artifactor Excavator</em> and <em>Eldritch Museum Entity</em>:</p><figure><figcaption>Wander</figcaption></figure><p>George "Chairman George" Weidman of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bunnyhopshow/featured" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Bunnyhop</a> believes the AI is skimming titles and basically nothing else of substance.</p><p>"I especially like how after making a video essay titled 'The Boisterous Bibliography of <em>Pentiment</em>,' it suggests I make a video titled 'The Boisterous Bibliography of Other Games,'" Weidman told Aftermath. "It doesn't seem to be scraping the YouTuber's script transcriptions or bio pages for topics we might be interested in, just flashy titles and thumbnails. These suggestions are just spitting back out what are the already-existing SEO optimization trends, and it's funny how one of those trends seems to be an aspirationally highbrow appeal that so many Gamer video essays strive for."</p><p>Suggested video outlines are also a trip. YouTube asked games writer and hobbyist YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/cbake76" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Baker</a> to take a walk down memory lane and hark back to all the “iconic” voice acting of <em>Spider-Man</em> games from the days before games really had voice acting:</p><figure><figcaption>Chris Baker</figcaption></figure><p>Baker’s AI-generated thumbnails – one of which seems to depict Spider-Man using his hand like a phone or perhaps Spider-Man yanking his own head off – are also really something:</p><figure><figcaption>Chris Baker</figcaption></figure><p>Are you feeling inspired? I sure am.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition"><h3>In Defense Of Techwear</h3></a><p>It's where form meets function</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tiktok-ban-trump-bytedance"><h3>What A Stupid Journey That Was</h3></a><p>TikTok's whirlwind death and resurrection are a preview of what's to come</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
