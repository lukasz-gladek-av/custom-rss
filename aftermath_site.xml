            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For well over 20 years the website Adventure Gamers was home to all kinds of writing and discussions about a genre that, while having enjoyed something of a renaissance in this "bring back all the old games" era we're living through now, also went through one hell of a drought in the 2000s.</p><p>Whether it was news, reviews or just being home to a popular forum, Adventure Gamers was for many a cozy little internet hangout, whether you were talking about the classics (Sierra and Lucasarts) or more modern series like Telltale's efforts. While the website still technically exists, I'm using past tense for a reason here, because in recent weeks the whole thing has basically gone to shit.</p><p>Earlier this month the site's forums, and its decades of history, were wiped without notice, along with AG's user reviews of games. While some of the content has been saved in web archives, to delete that past at all, let alone without warning, is an extremely shitty move from the site's owners.</p><figure></figure><p>Or, should I say new owners, because while there is scant public information about a recent sale,<a href="https://exagforumites.freeforums.net/thread/2/start" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> discussions among the community suggest that the site has recently been sold</a>, appears to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuregames/comments/1lat2la/comment/mxnfu97/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishing</a> AI-generated content (all bylines have been removed from the site’s articles) and that former writers have been<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuregames/comments/1lat2la/adventure_gamers_is_a_gambling_site_now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> asking</a> to have their names removed from AG's masthead, to no avail.</p><p>No sooner had the forums and archives been deleted than the site began leaning hard into online betting, with four of the six menu items at the top of the page leading to stuff like "Online Casinos" and "Poker Sites".</p><figure></figure><p>Also the site's "About Us" page has <a href="https://adventuregamers.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently been edited to read</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About Us</strong></p><p>Adventure Gamers&nbsp;has long been recognized as the largest English-language website dedicated to the adventure game genre. Since our founding, we’ve provided trusted, in-depth coverage of puzzle-driven narrative games, from classics like Zork, King’s Quest, and Monkey Island, to the latest releases redefining the genre for modern players.</p><p>But as the digital entertainment world evolves, so do we.</p><p><strong>Expanding Into the Gambling Industry</strong></p><p>Recognizing the growing convergence between gaming and gambling, Adventure Gamers has expanded its coverage to include the online gambling sector.</p><p>With increasing overlap in design, technology, and user engagement between video games and online betting platforms, this evolution is a natural fit for our expertise.</p><p>Our team includes seasoned reviewers and industry analysts with years of experience in both video game journalism and online gambling.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In an age when some folks would rather <a href="https://youtu.be/cFRuiVw4pKs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“marry” an AI</a>, I’m closing in on four years with my real-life partner: learning, growing, and trying to be mindful of how <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/533198/split-fiction-review-pc-ps5-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">differently the world works from her point of view</a>. That is, until she casually revealed her fucked up high-society Oreo-consuming routine, and I had to drop all “wife guy” pretences and call her a weirdo.&nbsp;</p><p>For starters, my partner doesn’t eat normal Oreos, Double Stuf, More Stuf, or any of the other flavors that would make sense to have a preference for. No, she eats the lemon creme-flavored Oreo Thins. That's fine; whatever rocks your boat. In all seriousness, she explained it to me as a part of her <a href="https://embrace-autism.com/an-introduction-to-audhd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AuDHD</a> where, to her, the OG Oreo cookie tastes like “dirt, sand, and dry.” It could be worse; she could be the type of person I was in college, who would eat Oreos with soda instead of milk—a choice I’m paying for with my recent dentist visit. What’s got me cross isn’t the why, but the how of my partner’s Oreo eating habit. Here’s documentation of my partner's Oreo eating ritual:</p><h2>Step One: Twisting the cookie in half</h2><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>The least surprising part of my partner’s demonstration, which I immediately felt compelled to document because of its next step, involves her splitting the cookie in two. While doing so, she revealed that this step’s success rate, contrary to my reservations about its narrow margin for error, exponentially improves with the thin version of the cookie, as opposed to the original or Double Stuf options, due to the ratio of creme to cookie wafer.&nbsp;</p><p>“I do my best to evenly get all of the creme on one side and have an empty shell on the other,” she said, noticing how my face scrunched up when she referred to the halves of the cookies as “shells.”&nbsp;</p><h2>Step 2: Fancy feasting</h2><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>The next step in my partner’s process involves, as she puts it, “using the empty one like a little chip, dipping into the lemon creme.” However, that’s only one of the methods she uses. While this is her all but putting her pinky up and scraping creme off the cookie like it was a makeshift charcuterie board, method two sees her strip-mining the creme cookie chip until it's barren, using her teeth to make marks on it until all of the “stuf” is gone, and then eating the cookies straight out.&nbsp;</p><h2>But why?</h2><figure><figcaption><span>Isaiah Colbert</span></figcaption></figure><p>My partner doesn't know when her Oreo-eating ritual started. But she remembers eating them this way as a child, after getting the ick from eating them the pedestrian way. That includes a disdain for the dipping-in-milk process because she dislikes both when the Oreo gets soggy and when its crumbs sink to the bottom of the cup, i.e., the whole point of why folks do that.&nbsp;</p><p>“When they would always bring the Oreos out for all of us, all my cousins or whoever else would dip them in milk and eat them the regular way. I never liked that,” she said. “I thought the cookie was too thick. I thought it tasted like dirt.”&nbsp;</p><p>Why lemon-flavored Oreos? Well, she says she randomly saw them in the grocery store and realized they were better suited for her than the mainstream option. They had the right flavor profile and the perfect balance of cookie and creme to add to the thrill of “peeling it off perfectly.”&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s the perfect amount of cookie, the perfect amount of lemon creme. It’s not too much of either. These are my favorites,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite my teasing, her response to why she eats Oreos the way she does is beautiful.&nbsp;</p><p>“It's just a part of who I am,” she said after finishing off her cookie. “I've never really questioned it, I never thought it was weird, it’s just something I do.”</p><p>In writing this, her Oreo revelation doesn’t come as a surprise, considering the first time we went grocery shopping together. She sincerely asked me what I used my vanilla almond milk for, and was taken aback by my response, “To drink.” And yet, despite knowing some of her other quirks—like the time I watched in silent outrage as she scraped the frosting off her cake and lobbed it straight into the trash—I wasn’t fully prepared for her lore drop show-and-tell. At least now we’ve established a system: she gets her Oreos, and any rejected frosting is referred to me instead of being thrown away. Everyone wins.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/adventure-gamers-online-casino-gambling-website-sale-parasite-seo"><h3>Adventure Games, Poker And Casinos Do Not ‘Overlap’, You Weirdos</h3></a><p>No normal person could type 'Recognizing the growing convergence between gaming and gambling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dont-rank-cuomo-video-game"><h3>Experience The Joy Of Rejecting Andrew Cuomo Through A Video Game</h3></a><p>Robert Yang's latest browser game lets you, too, not rank Andrew Cuomo for NYC mayor</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gamestop-trading-card-game-problems-scalpers"><h3>GameStop’s Expanding Trading Card Business Could Make A Tough Situation For Workers Worse</h3></a><p>“Unlike hardware, it has high margin potential,” GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen said to shareholders</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/siivagunner-youtube-channel-high-quality-rips"><h3>SiIvaGunner Is An Elaborate Game Music Joke Collective And One Of The Best Parts Of YouTube</h3></a><p>SiIvagunner started as YouTube elaborate in-joke about game music on YouTube and has evolved into a volunteer, Discord-managed democratic artist collective.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/partner-weird-oreos]]></content:encoded>
