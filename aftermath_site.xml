            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>G/O Media has sold gaming site Kotaku to European company Keleops, which previously purchased Kotaku sister site Gizmodo in 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/02/kotaku-sale-keleops-go-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axios</a> reports that the site's staff will stay on and that the new owner plans to make hires. The price of the deal was not disclosed.</p><p>In a press release sent to Aftermath, Keleops CEO Jean-Guillaume Kleis wrote, “We are thrilled to welcome the entire Kotaku team to Keleops." Kleis continued, “Kotaku isn’t just a brand—it’s a home for gamers and a place where the culture keeps moving forward. We are honored to shape its future."</p><p>Private equity firm Great Hill Partners (stay with me here) purchased Kotaku's parent company, then called Gizmodo Media Group, in <a href="https://www.greathillpartners.com/media/great-hill-partners-acquires-gizmodo-media-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2019</a> from Univision. Univision <a href="https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/univision-gawker-sold-135-million-1201838638/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased it</a>, then called Gawker Media Group, in 2016 after the company <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/10/481565188/gawker-files-for-bankruptcy-it-faces-140-million-court-penalty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declared bankruptcy</a> following a <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/15010575/hulk-hogan-wins-115-million-jury-gawker-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">verdict</a> in a trial with wrestler Hulk Hogan. Under G/O Media CEO and noted <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/11/jim-spanfeller-is-a-herb-rise-fall-blog-post-deadspin.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">herb</a> Jim Spanfeller, the sites saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190802151610/https://deadspin.com/this-is-how-things-work-now-at-g-o-media-1836908201/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mass employee exoduses</a> (including the founders of Aftermath), pages choked with <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/farmers-insurance-pulls-million-dollar-ad-campaign-with-go-media-after-editorial-staff-raises-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ads</a>, and frequent conflict between staff and leadership, including a<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/business/gizmodo-media-strike.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> union strike in 2022.</a></p><p>Following Kotaku EIC Stephen Totilo's departure in early <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/02/05/kotaku-stephen-totilo-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021</a>, I served as interim EIC until the hire of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/05/27/new-kotaku-editor-chief-patricia-hernandez/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patricia Hernandez</a> in June of that year. Hernandez was reportedly <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/go-media-fires-kotaku-editor-in-chief-patricia-hernandez" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired</a> in August of 2023. Subsequent EIC Jen Glennon resigned in March <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024</a> after leadership attempted to institute new rules emphasizing guides coverage, never Kotaku's focus area, over news. Kotaku saw <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-layoffs-go-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a> later that year.</p><p>The Root is now the only site in G/O's stable. IGN owner <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/13/business/media/lifehacker-ziff-davis.html" target="_blank">Ziff Davis</a> bought Lifehacker in 2023. <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/jezebel-acquired-paste-magazine-1235812182/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paste bought Jezebel</a>, following its closure and staff layoffs, in 2023, as well as <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/paste-magazine/paste-media-acquires-av-club" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The A/V Club</a> in 2024. Deadspin was sold to a <a href="https://www.404media.co/who-owns-deadspin-now-lineup-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gambling media company</a> in 2024, after its staff was also laid off (and well after its former staff <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/01/775548069/after-days-of-resignations-the-last-of-the-deadspin-staff-have-quit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quit en masse</a> and formed <a href="https://defector.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defector</a>). <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/the-onion-sold-global-tetrahedron-1235982383/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Onion</a> was sold in 2024 and is run by former NBC reporter Ben Collins. Static Media bought <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/media-deals/2024/03/26/go-media-av-club-takeout-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Takeout</a> in 2024 and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/static-media-drives-further-into-auto-vertical-with-acquisition-of-jalopnik-302383435.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jalopnik</a> in 2025. Most recently, G/O sold <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/04/quartz-sold-redbrick-go-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quartz and commerce site The Inventory</a> in 2025.</p><p>While G/O still owns The Root, it also issued a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/business/media/kotaku-go-media-sale.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> suggesting it's winding down operations, with Spanfeller writing that "it became clear to our investors that it was time to move on." Spanfeller also couldn't resist taking a shot at the union, praising unions for "add[ing] value to editorial employees’ positions" while also writing that "the core methods that unions work with (or rather against) companies working hard to change with the times is counterproductive to both their membership as well as the companies as a whole.”&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully Kotaku employees do not care what Jim Spanfeller has to say, because he is no longer their boss! I am simply thrilled for Kotaku's staff and excited for their future; Gizmodo appears to be thriving, and I'm hopeful Kotaku will do the same. I'm looking forward to the site's talented journalists getting back to making a good outlet that people like without having to fight executives and private equity goons to do it.</p><p><em>This story has been updated</em>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july"><h3>Layoffs Begin At Xbox [Updating]</h3></a><p>Heavy cuts are expected in Microsoft's gaming division</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-shower-handles"><h3>An In-Depth Examination Of Death Stranding 2’s Shower Handles</h3></a><p>Death Stranding 1 &amp; 2 both feature beautiful mechanical design.
