Where previously games had to list any and all uses of AI, there's now a divide between what you no longer need to fess up to (basically coding that Valve says would make development more "efficient") and what you do (anything that's public-facing, like art or writing). Seems almost impossible to police and delineate, but what do I know!</p><figure><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/simoncarless_interestingly-pc-video-game-platform-steam-activity-7417944215675908096-OGNg/?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Interestingly, PC video game platform Steam just significantly rewrote - but did NOT remove - its &amp;#39;does your game have AI in it?&amp;#39; dev disclosure form.

The headline is that Valve’s making it clearer that ‘AI powered tools’ (like code helpers) do not trigger the need to disclose any use - “Efficiency gains through the use of [AI powered dev tools] is not the focus of this section.” Otherwise, devs still have to disclose two different types of AI use: - “AI to generate content for the game”, whether it be the game itself, the store page, or marketing materials. (A freeform box allows devs to describe this purely in text form of their choosing.) - “AI content generated during gameplay” - a simple tickbox on whether the game itself generates AI-created “images, audio, text and other content”. Valve’s labeling decision is an outlier on game platforms, but fits with their internal rules on how they would want to be informed if they were a player. | 34 comments on LinkedIn</p><p><span>LinkedIn</span><span>Simon Carless</span></p></div></a></figure>
