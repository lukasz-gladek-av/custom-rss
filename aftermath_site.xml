  <article>
    <p>This week, Gita, Riley, and Chris talk about many games that came out recently that will never win a Game Award, and what our attitudes about the event are.&nbsp;First, the enigmatic Ys-alike <em>Angeline Era</em>, a beautiful game with <a href="https://even-kei.medium.com/divest-from-the-video-games-industry-814a1381092d?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">thoughtful</a> <a href="https://melodicambient.substack.com/p/the-book-of-bumpslash-action-level?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">design</a>. Second, the toe tapping <em>Rhythm Doctor</em> which feels like it takes cues from <em>Rhythm Tengoku</em> and iNIS games like <em>Ouendan</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we discuss <em>Skate Story</em>, Faustian <em>Tony Hawk</em> with an incredible soundtrack that reminds us of <em>Arctic Eggs</em>. We give a shoutout to <em>Demonschool</em>, which has surprisingly good combat. Finally we discuss <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em>, the Dark Pac-Man game (announced at The Game Awards) that came out over the summer and has shockingly deep roots in <a href="https://ugsf-series.com/en/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">UGSF lore</a>.</p><p>Lastly, we shout out <em>Nightreign</em> as one of our favorite games of the year and talk about its freaky new characters. We also answer your questions about peppermint treats, the NY game dev scene, AI and more!</p>

Each week, games journalism veterans Luke Plunkett, Nathan Grayson, Chris Person, Riley MacLeod, and Gita Jackson – though not always all at once, because that’s too many people for a podcast – break down video game news, Remember Some Games, and learn about Chris’ frankly incredible number of special interests. Sometimes we even bring on guests from both inside and outside the video game industry! I don’t know what else to tell you; it’s a great time. Simply by reading this description, you’re already wasting time that you could be spending listening to the show. Head to aftermath.site for more info. </p>
