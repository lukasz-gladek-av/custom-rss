            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like many of you, I was once a guy who either thought he could build his own PC, or knew a guy who knew some stuff and who offered to scrounge some parts together for a bargain price. I lived a formative part of my life like this, and let me tell you, it fuckin <em>sucked</em>.</p><p>Whether it was my own bumbling hands or the ultimately unqualified bluster of A Guy, for years my PC gaming life was plagued by hardware conflicts, <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-dont-understand-my-pc-which-i-built" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part failures</a>, a need to constantly be <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-bought-the-wrong-graphics-card-and-i-am-full-of-regret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgrading</a> one part or another and just a general sense I was living on a knife's edge, always one bootup or overclock away from something dying and needing to be replaced. It was stressful when everything was going OK and it was a huge pain in the ass when it wasn't, and considering video games are supposed to be a fun and cool way to relax, I was not having a great time.</p><p>So a decade ago (August 2015), with "getting to enjoy <em>The Witcher 3's</em> visuals as God intended" foremost in my mind, I decided I was going to stop being such a tight-fisted weirdo with my time and money, suck it up, risk the ridicule of friends and peers and just buy a prebuilt PC. Yes, they were more expensive, which meant yes, I was getting less PC for my buck, but given the hell I'd been living through for years previously, I figured it would be money well spent.</p><p>A decade later I am happy to report that it was indeed money well spent, and that I have finally found peace. I have just <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-keep-my-pc-on-the-floor-where-it-belongs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought</a> my third prebuilt PC in that time, and whatever extra money I've poured into having someone else put the things together has been more than worth it. In that decade, do you know how many times I've had a part fail, or had a weird driver conflict, or mystery reboot cycle, or have <em>anything </em>go wrong? Across three computers and a decade spent using them all day for work and playing games all night and on weekends?</p><p>Not one! Not a single issue. I paid some guys a premium of probably $300 per PC to make sure everything fit and worked and that the cables were braided nicely and that's exactly what they've done, and I couldn't be happier. I turn my PC on and it works, every time! I play games on it for years at a time and nothing ever goes wrong! All three times a big box got delivered to my door and I opened it up and plugged it in and everything was set up and already running!</p><p>I recognise there's a degree of privilege to this scenario; the fact I was scrounging for parts in my 20s then spending extra for the luxury of convenience in my mid-30s and beyond says as much about my income situation as it does my desire for convenience, not to mention the fact I'm lucky enough to be able to claim a new gaming PC as a tax deduction.</p><p>Even taking that into account, though, I cannot recommend it enough. I know there are already loads of people reading this more skilled and knowledgeable about this stuff than me, thinking "building a PC isn't hard, you big baby", or that the need to save $300 overrides all other considerations, and I get that. But also: have you ever considered that instead of me "blowing" hundreds of dollars per PC I have actually invested that money in peace-of-mind? One of the best things you can <em>ever </em>spend money on?</p><figure><figcaption>My latest PC, with a Fractal North case.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like video game adaptations, live-action anime adaptations get a bad rap for being so rancid that fans preemptively sling shit at their creators for having the audacity to attempt them. Having been a card-carrying member of that camp for years, when I tuned into <em>Bet</em>, Netflix’s live-action take on <em>Kakegurui</em>, I expected an irredeemable trainwreck. What I got instead was a surprisingly entertaining, campy fever dream. I take pride in contributing to getting it greenlit for a second season.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bet | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R7xl9QjtNDc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Developed by Simon Berry, <em>Bet</em> reimagines Homura Kawamoto and Tōru Naomura’s 2014 psychological drama series <em>Kakegurui: Compulsive Gambler</em>. The original manga follows Yumeko Jabami, a precocious high school transfer student at a prestigious academy where one’s social status is determined by underground gambling. Think <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em>’s early manga chaos meets <a href="https://kotaku.com/12-things-to-check-out-after-youve-binged-squid-game-1847875371/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kaiji</em></a>’s debt-riddled death games. The anime adaptation by Mappa in 2017 catapulted the series into pop culture prominence, and I even ranked it as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-anime-ranked-decade-attack-on-titan-demon-slayer-1850117910/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30th best anime of the decade</a> at the other website.</p><p>Visually, <em>Bet </em>is Netflix’s CW-esque answer to <em>Riverdale </em>with BBC’s<em> Sherlock</em> levels of overproduction. Its set design and costuming go hard—like, somebody put their whole bussy into it hard. Sure, the show is still campy and wacky, just like its source material, but it leans into that chaos rather than apologizing for it. Unlike Hollywood's more infamous anime misfires (cough cough <em>Dragon Ball Evolution</em> and <em>The Last Airbender</em>), Bet embraces its eccentricity with pride, and while being a more palatable thing to have folks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS7mdn4DFuc&amp;pp=ygUaa2FrZWd1cnVpIGd1biBzY2VuZSBtaWRhcmk%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walk in on you watching</a> than its anime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p><em>Bet</em> doesn’t just cosplay the source material—it remixes it by Americanizing it in the most contemporary camp way possible. And in doing so, <em>Bet </em>fixes things that even the manga and anime never quite nailed. Mainly, how it handled adapting three characters from the source material.&nbsp;</p><p>First off is actor Miku Martineau’s Yumeko. In the anime, she’s a manic enigma who gets turned on by the danger of gambling even when the odds are stacked against her. With each episode, she inexplicably wins every game (even when her opponents are cheating), making the viewing experience bereft of emotional stakes. <em>Bet </em>gives her gravity. While she’s still as much a thrill-seeker as her counterpart, her backstory as a girl haunted by the murder of her parents and her quest for revenge, wrapped in that grief, is lampshaded at the start of the show, giving viewers a tangible character to root for from the get-go.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kakegurui | Trailer [HD] | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cTlHQiRNVl0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In contrast, the anime takes forever and a day to reveal that plot point. Thanks to this change, Yumeko’s highs and lows feel earned. Every rare stumble, recalibration, and fight from beneath make her victories feel like actual triumphs instead of a narrative inevitability.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there's Ryan, the race-swapped version of Ryota, played by Black actor Ayo Solanke. In the manga and anime, Ryota is basically a glorified background character whose only purpose is to react to all the wild shit Yumeko does as an analogue for the audience. <em>Bet</em> gives Ryan his own arc where his one-sided crush on Yumeko, in tandem with his own family issues, gives him a seat at the table as a character with as much agency, if not more so, than the show’s leading lady. Even original show moments where the series feels like it's dipping into eye-rolling territory, like a plot line where the school places bets on Ryan losing his virginity to Yumeko, are played with emotional maturity and care. Where the anime would have Yumeko handwave away the danger her gambling has on her cohorts, like a bullishly written Batman, <em>Bet</em>’s Yumeko doesn’t unwittingly gamble with her friends' lives like an asshole.</p><p>Another character I was surprised by was how much I loved Netflix’s adaptation compared to the anime was <em>Bet</em>’s reimagined version of the early villain, <a href="https://kakegurui.fandom.com/wiki/Itsuki_Sumeragi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Itsuki Sumeragi</a>. In the anime, Itsuki is a one-note sadist who takes joy in collecting her victims’ fingernails as trophies. But the adaptation transforms her into <a href="https://kakegurui.fandom.com/wiki/Suki_Hennessey#Appearance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suki Hennessey</a>, a gender-nonconforming character with a shady influencer past, akin to James Charles. Suki actor <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dnybackact/video/7523628335675575557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Sutherland</a> might as well have been Denzel Washington, given how he chewed up the scenery in every scene he was in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Yumeko Accepts Mary’s Challenge to Skirmish | Bet | Netflix Philippines" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MSASvyra1ZQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Bet</em>’s whole vibe isn’t far off from Netflix’s live-action <em>Death Note</em>—which, yes, features Margaret Qualley for some reason—but Bet scratches the same “if this anime took place in America” itch with more confidence. And, unlike Death Note, which survives almost entirely on the galaxy-brained casting of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMHFlD65hY4&amp;pp=ygUXd2lsbGVtIGRhZm9lIGRlYXRoIG5vdGU%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Willem Dafoe as Ryuk</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1mcQ6CzXo8&amp;pp=ygUcbGFrZWl0aCBzdGFuZmllbGQgZGVhdGggbm90ZQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LaKeith Stanfield as L</a>, <em>Bet</em> doesn’t hedge its bets on a single saving grace. It’s just top-to-bottom unpapologetic cringe, as it was meant to be.</p><p>My inciting incident that convinced me and my friend to watch the series was our collective curiosity about how WWE champion Seth Rollins would make a cameo in the series—a cameo that, out of context, reeked to us of shameless brand synergy following Netflix’s own hosting of WWE Raw. Spoiler: <a href="https://x.com/25_Saurav/status/1906705868831228331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rollins’ already cunty wardrobe</a> and shrill, whiny tone fit right into the show’s madness as another brilliant point of casting.&nbsp;</p><p>In comparison to <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-one-piece-yu-yu-hakusho-anime-live-action-netfl-1850050620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other upcoming live-action anime projects </a>fans are biting their nails to the nub in anxiety over, <em>Kakegurui </em>isn’t a sacred cow in the grander anime community. It’s a weird, horny, and chaotic mess—and <em>Bet </em>understands that. It doesn’t try to sanitize it. Instead, it Westernizes it in ways that feel playful rather than disrespectful. Like <a href="https://kotaku.com/one-piece-netflix-live-action-oda-luffy-review-anime-1850788857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em></a> being a similar&nbsp; to <em>Percy Jackson</em>’s whimsical energy or <em>Death Note</em> morphing into <em>Final Destination</em>, <em>Bet </em>knows where not to overstep and where to play loudly within its adaptation.&nbsp;</p><p>So if Netflix’s export of live-action anime series going forward is going to lean into CW-style camp, then I welcome it as a chaotic but valuable addition to the anime and manga ecosystem. Adaptations like <em>Bet </em>aren’t slop or guilty pleasures—they’re gateways where normies could join in the fold and check out the anime and manga that inspired them. If Netflix’s <em>One Piece</em> live-action series could become a talking point on <em>The View</em>, pulling normies like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceLiveAction/comments/16t4ric/actually_insane_whoopi_goldberg_gave_a_raving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whoopi Goldberg into Luffy’s warm light</a>, then why not let lesser-known titles like <em>Kakegurui </em>get their moment alongside shonen royalty? <em>Bet </em>was wildly fun, and if that fun gets more folks to check out the manga and anime, then let the cringe renaissance continue.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-demonschool-delay-silksong"><h3>Why Demonschool Got Delayed, Even Though It’s Nothing Like Silksong</h3></a><p>"It’s frustrating because we’ve really tried very hard to let people know that this game exists"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/long-story-short-bojack-netflix"><h3>Long Story Short Is A Lot, In A Good Way</h3></a><p>The new family drama from the creators of Bojack Horseman is funny, moving, and just the right amount of intense</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/vivi-is-screwing-up-magic-the-gathering-and-you-know-what-good-for-him"><h3>Vivi Is Screwing Up Magic: The Gathering, And You Know What?
