But at several points during the event the glasses--which make every person wearing them look like they're about to get stuffed in a locker--either failed to do what they were asked, hung or just broke down completely.</p><p>Here, for example, is an attempt to make a steak sauce using the power of AI:</p><figure><video controls="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/09/meta_sauce.mp4"></video></figure><p>And here, in another showcase of the unlimited potential of artificial intelligence being worn on your face, is an attempt at making a video call:</p><figure><video controls="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/09/failed-call.mp4"></video></figure><p>Even the stuff that <em>did</em> work--because it was pre-recorded--made everyone involved look like the worst people in a room, any room, at any time:</p><figure><video controls="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/09/conversation-focus.mp4"></video></figure><p>Meta has<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/02/big-tech-ai-spending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> so far spent billions on AI technology</a>, and plans to<a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-stock-price-ai-spending-broadcom-49ead3b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> spend a further $600 billion in the next three years</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-unions-microsoft-layoffs-mmo-elder-scrolls"><h3>Months After Microsoft Layoffs, Zenimax Unions Never Stopped Fighting For Impacted Workers</h3></a><p>They won more time at the company, improved severance, recall rights, and saved a few jobs</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/samuel-deats-anime-animation-horses-kiss-scene"><h3>What’s Harder To Draw: Horses Or Kisses?
