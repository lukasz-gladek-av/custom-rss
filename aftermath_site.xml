            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behind every great manga series is an artist, or mangaka, who more often than not opts to hide their face and let their work speak for itself. In print, readers will spot their presence in playful author blurbs tucked inside volumes or the prefaces of their new chapters in weekly magazines like <em>Shonen Jump</em>, where artists like Eiichiro Oda write bite-sized anecdotes about their week, accompanied by a quirky caricature of themselves. However, when the spotlight of their work demands more exposure—be it a fan event or a press interview tied to their anime—many mangaka go to impressive lengths to conceal their faces.</p><p>Contrary to the fame-forward culture of Western “auteurs,” where directors gladly bask in the limelight during press tours, many mangaka choose to keep a low profile for a simple reason: they like their privacy. Between <a href="https://gizmodo.com/jujutsu-kaisen-leaks-271-manga-spoiler-culture-2000503868" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">toxic fandom backlash</a>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/racists-are-trying-to-make-dan-da-dan-the-latest-front-in-their-culture-war-2000536054" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">culture war dogpiling</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-thousand-death-threats-against-a-popular-anime-creato-631792221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online threats over creative choices</a>, and <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-04-09/woman-arrested-for-threatening-one-piece-creator-oda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">death threats</a>, keeping their face out of public view isn’t vanity, it’s protection. When the industry already <a href="https://kotaku.com/hunter-x-hunter-berserk-nana-vagabond-hiatus-manga-1849184744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blurs the line between work life and private life</a>, that boundary becomes essential.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ChnkvDUQqv4?feature=share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s also amusing</a> when a creator like <em>Nier: Automata</em> director Yoko Taro’s career, which has leaned into anonymity, leads to improvising a new disguise after he <a href="https://kotaku.com/yoko-taro-mask-nier-automata-emil-lost-anime-expo-2023-1850603039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost his titular mask at Anime Expo 2023</a>. Who doesn’t love a good disguise? In the spirit of that, here’s my top five favorite mangaka disguises. Honorable mention goes to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/witch-hat-ateliers-creator-shares-her-inspirations-and-aspirations-for-its-anime-2000514254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Witch Hat Atelier</em> creator Kamome Shirahama</a>, who, during a virtual interview for her anime adaptation, sent over a headshot so absurdly charming it had me doubled over laughing.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Kamome Shirahama/KODANSHA/ Witch Hat Atelier Committee</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Dandadan’s Yukinobu Tatsu</h2><p>As a creator who got his start as an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/chainsaw-mans-influence-can-already-be-felt-beyond-its-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assistant to mangaka like <em>Chainsaw Man</em> creator Tatsuki Fujimoto’s <em>Fire Punch</em></a> and fellow assistant <a href="https://kotaku.com/hell-s-paradise-manga-shonen-jump-seinen-yuji-kaku-horr-1848618482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuji Kaku’s <em>Hell’s Paradise: Jigokuraku</em></a>, <a href="https://dandadan.fandom.com/wiki/Yukinobu_Tatsu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yukinobu Tatsu</a>’s series <a href="https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-science-saru-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dandadan</em></a> quickly strapped a rocket to his back, propelling him into the mainstream. Instead of opting for one of his characters to digitally stand in for himself, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Rr_asBvOB8&amp;t=1667s&amp;pp=0gcJCdAJAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fujimoto does with Pochita</a>, Tatsu’s disguise is both puzzling and provocative. It’s just a mask with eggs and sausages on its face. I’ve no clue what compelled him to make a <em>Purge</em>-adjacent breakfast mask his visage, but I can’t fault him for choosing a disguise that gets me in the mood for a Denny’s Grand Slam whenever I see him make a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vizmedia/video/7426415811906112811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video appearance to promote <em>Dandadan</em>’s anime</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Fullmetal Alchemist’s Hiromu Arakawa</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Interview with Hiromu Arakawa, author of &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; (2017) [EngSub]" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9W2z9RqAtAM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiromu_Arakawa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hiromu Arakawa</a> is, without exaggeration, one of the greatest mangaka to ever do it. She’s the mind behind <em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em>, a series whose anime adaptation is often considered the gold standard thanks to its tight plotting, emotionally resonant characters (especially its women), sharp political themes, and side-splitting moments of levity. Despite being a goat, Arakawa, ever the unapologetic farm girl, fully leans into her roots in the most charming way possible: disguising herself as a bespectacled cow. Whether it’s her author’s headshot or her face superimposed in video interviews, she always appears as a bookish bovine. It’s funny, it’s adorable, and it makes her long-running milk agenda in <em>FMA</em>—where she insists Ed could’ve outgrown his short king phase with a proper calcium intake—all the more iconic.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jujutsu Kaisen’s Gege Akutami&nbsp;</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="【公式】漫道コバヤシ#74 漫画大賞2020グランプリ 芥見下々『呪術廻戦』-蒼-" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CoE6ptLsfaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Before the <a href="https://aftermath.site/jujutsu-kaisen-magneto-xavier-gojo-geto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em></a> fandom went full nutso mode over how the story wrapped up—raging about character deaths, narrative choices, and backseat quarterbacking over how they would’ve written it—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gege_Akutami" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gege Akutami</a> was already well acquainted with the dark side of success. Few modern mangaka have endured the level of fan backlash Akutami has, all for creating one of today’s most popular shonen series.&nbsp;</p><p>Long before the firestorm, though, Akutami leaned into anonymity early in the most on-brand way possible: showing up to interviews in full <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Kokichi_Muta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mechamaru</a> cosplay. Akutami’s disguise isn’t just clever, it’s a perfect meta nod. The cyborg character remotely operates the automaton from the safe refuge of his hidden base. Not even his allies know what his real face looks like. Akutami also gets bonus points for his commitment to the disguise. That papier-mache mech head looks sweaty and uncomfortable to sit in for any period of time.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Apothecary Diaries’ Natsu Hyuga&nbsp;</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Apothecary Diaries Special - ANIME MANGA EXPLOSION _ NHK WORLD-JAPAN_1_RESOLUTION" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9uxG4DmJq_g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Like Akutami, <a href="https://aftermath.site/apothecary-diaries-frog-scene" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Apothecary Diaries</em></a> light novel author<a href="https://kusuriya.fandom.com/wiki/Natsu_Hy%C5%ABga" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Natsu Hyuga</a> takes a full-body approach to her public appearance disguise. Instead of taking on the appearance of one of her characters, Hyuga’s disguise goes the route of an anthropomorphic mascot with Uririn, a wild boar piglet who waddles around whenever she’s making a public appearance. Though judging by her social media, her disguise might as well be how she walks through life, because her Twitter account is <a href="https://x.com/NaMelanza/status/1923319036324008173/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">littered with candid images of her in disguise</a> lounging on sofas, <a href="https://x.com/NaMelanza/status/1913236149583372422/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imbibing</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/NaMelanza/status/1894446566876090590/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gaming</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Beastars’ Paru Itagaki</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Paru Itagaki Interview [OTAQUEST CONNECT]" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wD_D2CrHG0o?start=130&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Just when you think being <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/d69ch8/keisuke_itagaki_creator_of_grappler_baki_paru/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the daughter of <em>Baki The Grappler</em> author Keisuke Itagaki</a> couldn’t make you any cooler, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/beastars-caps-off-netflixs-fall-anime-season-in-spectacular-fashion-2000535938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Beastars</em></a><em> </em>creator Paru Itagaki ups the ante with a chicken head. Not just any chicken, mind you, but <a href="https://beastars.fandom.com/wiki/Legom#:~:text=Legom%20is%20a%20somewhat%20stocky,as%20her%20pajamas%20on%20occasion." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legom</a>, the leghorn from her series, who takes pride in providing the sustenance for protagonist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGtr50yzvc0&amp;pp=ygUNYmVhc3RhcnMgZWdncw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legoshi’s balanced breakfast</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Hell Yes Another Excellent Climbing Game]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hell-yes-another-excellent-climbing-game.1228176/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I love a rock climbing game, despite the fact that I have hardly climbed at all since moving back to New York. Every climbing game seems to have its own unique take on the sport, from <a href="https://aftermath.site/new-heights-climbing-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hyper-realistic</a> to <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-would-live-in-this-climbing-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fantastical</a>, from <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-game-jusant-gets-rock-climbing-right" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enjoying the view</a> to <a href="https://aftermath.site/cairn-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focusing on what’s under your hands and feet</a>. The take of recent indie game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Peak</em></a> leans toward both fantasy and simplicity, doing away with the affectations of other climbing games to make things both easier and more difficult.</p><p>It’s pretty clear to me that <em>Peak</em> wants to be played co-op, and honestly I might have given up on my solo session if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurogamer</a> hadn't praised playing it alone. The game opens with your plane crashing on a mysterious island, where you have to climb from a beach to a plume of smoke at the top of a mountain. With friends, I could see this being a hilarious or back-stabbing adventure; alone, I at first found it a bit challenging to make progress while managing my character’s weight and stamina. Without a friend to boost or pull me up a lengthy rock face, or companions to spread the weight of gear around with, I had to spend a lot of time circling the mountain looking for short climbs. But eventually I got the hang of it, making it to the top of the mountain and opening up new, more challenging areas to scale.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="PEAK Trailer: OUT NOW!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jrlUVhLBjG0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Peak</em> has its own approach to climbing mechanics. Instead of looking for handholds or routes, you can basically climb anything simply by pressing a button to attach to it. This relative ease is made complicated by your stamina bar, which, unlike other climbing games that use stamina as one of several meters, is the entire deciding factor in how far you can climb. You have just the one bar, and then things take chunks out of it: how much stuff is in your backpack, being hungry, getting injured. Each of these is represented by its own color and symbol, making it easy to understand why your whole stamina bar isn’t available.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aggro Crab/Landfall: The meter in the bottom left shows the impact of certain conditions on your stamina</figcaption></figure><p>Less easy is what you’re supposed to do about it, which is where a lot of the fun of <em>Peak</em> comes in. Dealing with hunger is particularly complex; in addition to packaged food you can find in suitcases scattered around the world, there’s also edible plants and fruits. They’ll all address your hunger, but they have hidden effects too. In my time with the game, desperate for food so I could regain stamina and make progress, I made my situation worse by carrying heavy coconut halves, or poisoned myself with mysterious berries. Other foods have positive effects; if you’re encountering something for the first time, there’s no way to know what it will do except try it out.</p><p>There’s also plenty of environmental hazards: In the first level, I regularly slipped on jellyfish if I wasn’t careful to scoot around them. In the second mountain, a jungle slope replete with rain and thorny vines, I wandered into…<em>something</em>: my screen went purple and my poison meter shot up, and of course I tumbled to my death. The mountains change on regular intervals, so while enough play will probably undo the mystery of these hazards, there’s still new things to discover and overcome.</p><p>All of this means that, alone, I frequently felt like I couldn’t make any progress when situations had taken too much out of my stamina and there was no one to help me address it. On the standard difficulty there’s also a time limit, enforced by rising fog, though you can lower the difficulty to turn it off. But once I accepted that I couldn’t make the long climbs of other games and had to get a bit more creative, <em>Peak</em>’s solo gameplay opened up to me. It became less about brute forcing my way up as quickly as possible and more about exploring and learning the land, strategically choosing my path to make little pieces of progress. And, the higher I got, the more tense things got: the riskier climbs and jumps felt, the more stressful deciding whether to eat a new food became. Every pathway and item required a careful balancing of risk versus reward, while the game’s straightforward mechanic and bright colors kept things feeling more goofy than grim.</p><p>I’m enjoying <em>Peak</em> on my own, though I’d love to try it out with friends. <em>Peak </em>started life as a game jam game between developers <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-crab-has-a-gun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aggro Crab</a> and Landfall, and has gone on to sell <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/im-gonna-crash-out-new-climbing-game-peak-has-sold-1-million-copies-in-less-than-a-week-outperforming-its-developers-most-popular-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one million copies</a> in its first week, which means probably someone I know owns it and can be convinced to listen to me wax poetic about climbing while we fling and drop each other to our dooms.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-sexual-exploitation-of-children-lawsuit-safety"><h3>Roblox Accused Of Allowing Sexual Exploitation In Four Separate Lawsuits</h3></a><p>All four — and more reportedly incoming, lawyers say — are filed by the same law firm</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review"><h3>Lies Of P: Overture Is The Best Parts Of The Game Executed With Confidence</h3></a><p>Lies of P: Overture proves the success of the first game was no fluke, and establishes a bold house style.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/peak-climbing-impressions-review]]></content:encoded>
