            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After a short hiatus, we are <em>back </em>this week with a fresh entry<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in our What I Do<em> </em>series, a collection of blogs</a> explaining just what, exactly, individuals working in the video game industry do every day.</p><p>There's nothing I love more for this feature than getting <em>deeply </em>specific, so it's with great pleasure today that I introduce Ben Taels, who has spent a big chunk of his career working as a User Experience Researcher at places like Epic Games. And if you think that involves focus-testing or experiments in dopamine release, Ben is here to share his experiences and dispel some myths.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett: Hey Ben, thanks for taking the time out to chat with us! Tell us all about yourself.</strong></p><p><strong>Ben Taels</strong>: I am from a small town in New Zealand and my first contact with video games was when my dad borrowed a Sinclair computer from a friend. It had this plane game on it (that you had to manually program in) where you had to clean, via dropping bombs, a landing field before your plane reached the bottom of the screen. When I say plane I mean single pixel moving from left to right and then right to left. It was really, really hard, but also amazing. I then had an Atari, an Amiga, and then a Mac. I didn't want the Mac, because I wanted to play <em>DOOM</em>! Luckily I found <em>Marathon</em> (by Bungie) and then all was well. In fact, l would go on to be the game reviewer for New Zealand's best (only) Mac publication, <em>MacGuide Magazine</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>When I wasn't playing video games or TTRPGs I was really interested in biology and animal behaviour. As such, I enrolled in an animal behaviour course at university and even worked for a year as a zoo keeper at a local zoo. The course was jointly taught by the biology and psychology departments and via the psych department I was also exposed to the idea of “human factors psychology”, which is a branch of psychology that studies technology and humans and as a principle believes that technology should be made for humans and the capabilities of humans. That is to say that people shouldn't have to suffer or struggle because of technology asking them to do things humans aren't physically or cognitively good at. Human factors also acknowledges that behaviour is systemic and arises from a web of interactions. Therefore the designers and owners (governments, businesses, etc) of those systems have the biggest responsibility for the outcomes of those systems.</p><figure><blockquote><p>A focus group/test is a specific methodology where you get a group of people together and get them to talk about a product, design, or idea. It is a flawed method, and not one I use or recommend.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Human factors psychology really spoke to me. There are so many systems out there that don't seem to care about the people interacting with them at all, and that should change. So I did a master’s in human factors, focused on road safety. Then after some time working for the NZ government as a road safety scientist I discovered that games UX research existed within the games industry! It was a pretty new field back then and the most prominent lab was at Microsoft. So I wrote them a message and they very kindly replied, put me through an interview loop, and then let me know, amongst other things, that really I needed a PhD (no longer the case, but the field was newer back then). I had always wanted one of those, so I headed off to the Netherlands, got a PhD, and more importantly also was lucky to find my partner while in Europe!&nbsp;</p><p>My PhD in human factors psych was also focused on traffic safety, but I always kept an eye on the games UX research world and taught some courses about UXR to game design students at a local university in the Netherlands. I also gave some talks at GDC EU. I was then lucky enough to get my first role as a Games UX Researcher and entered the games industry around 12 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: So you've worked in the same space for over a decade, what was the last job title you had?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: My first role was as a Games UX Researcher at a consultancy in the UK called Player Research. We worked mainly with indies and mobile game companies, and in the two and a half years I was there I worked on around 75 games.</p><p>I then moved on to Epic Games in the USA, around nine years ago. I started as a Researcher, but then moved into management of the UX Research team. My move to leadership happened a little while before <em>Fortnite Battle Royale</em> came out, and most recently my title was Director, User Experience Research.&nbsp;</p><p>I left Epic a few months ago to move back to NZ for lifestyle and family reasons.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: Across both your user experience roles, both as a researcher and managing a team, what did your job actually involve? Like, on both a daily basis and a more long-term basis?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: As Director, User Experience Research, I viewed my main role as making sure my team was happy, healthy, having fun (we work on games so fun should be part of the work environment!), and had what they needed to do their job. Effectively as the top level of the UXR team system my role was to design it as a positive place to be. This also included knowing what the priorities were, where the work is most needed, and advocating for games user experience research and my team.&nbsp;</p><p>To talk more broadly about what games user experience research can do, I see it as typically having four main functions:&nbsp;</p><p>UX research with external players: There are a range of methods that can be deployed here, but the most important and valuable is running observational UX tests with external players and users. The primary goal of this is to put real, representative, players/users into contact with the in-development games and products to observe and research what happens. These players are not familiar with the game and therefore better represent the behaviours of the player population. Another aspect of this can be checking to help make sure the game is accessible for a range of players e.g., looking at things like is the UI colour blind friendly? Are simulation sickness triggers minimized? etc.</p><p>Competitive and UX analysis: This is where UX researchers use their training and education to examine a game or product for what makes it work and what may be issues. This can be a full description of a single game or looking at a particular mechanic or system (for example crafting systems) across multiple games.</p><p>Internal playtesting: Setting up, running, and collecting and sharing data on the results of internal (employee) playtests. This can also include being involved in the technical side of making sure in-development builds are ready and working. The goals of internal playtests are to let developers play/use and provide feedback on games and products being developed at the company. This is important as it lets teams experience what they and others have been working on and fosters a feedback culture. At some companies this function is owned by QA, and at others by UXR.&nbsp;</p><p>Survey research: Creating, sending, and analyzing surveys. Surveys can be sent via email (to people who opted in) and/or built directly into games (for example has <em>Fortnite Battle Royale</em> ever asked you how powerful you thought bananas were?). The goals of this function is to find out how players were feeling and thinking via representative surveys. In the banana example, by having players rate the banana, alongside also collecting ratings for, say, the Kamehameha, it can give comparison points and context for the data.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>As someone who loves research it is also really fulfilling to be able to take the knowledge I have of why, cognitively speaking, a motorist may not see a cyclist at an intersection and be able to use that to investigate why a UI element or enemy in a game may also not stand out.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Across the functions above, ultimately, the goal of user experience research is to be a partner to other devs and help them make sure their design intent/vision is reaching the players/users. So for example, is a new game mechanic clear? Can players use it the way the designer intends? Is it too easy to use? Then once it is out, is it being received and interacted with as intended?</p><p>One example of a UX test finding from during my consulting days was a game where at a certain point you had to "press tab". I watched a player in a lab not press tab over and over and then went to talk to them. At that point they told me they had seen the instruction, but couldn't see a tab (as in a tab in a browser) anywhere in the UI to press. Which was an important lesson in how mental models can differ, particularly in a world where often the "tab" button on keyboards may not be labeled and its use is relatively rare.&nbsp;</p><p>Another way to look at it is that the goal of user experience research is to use the scientific method and what is known about how psychology and physiology to:</p><p>- Help make sure the intended game/product design is being experienced. Including that the friction/difficulty the designers want is being achieved.</p><p>- Help make sure any unintended friction that gets in the way of, or blocks, the intended design is found and addressed.</p><p>- Finally to help find any unexpected/emergent experiences that may not have been fully intended, but are awesome.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we use the above data to help inform design. I do want to flag the use of "inform" there as very intentional vs the idea of "data driven" design. I have found that data is a poor driver, as it is often short sighted, lacks context, and is overly reactive. Where data really shines is when it is used, in partnership with the expertise of other devs, to inform a design. It is here that data can contribute to long term views and mesh well with the art of games.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: That's certainly a lot! Out of all that, what would you say was the thing you loved most about the job?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: The clear answer is the people I have had the privilege of working with in my career so far. They are all just the best people; smart, funny, and awesome to work with.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, to be able to raise players' issues and concerns and to highlight what they think is cool is another wonderful thing. To see a game come through UX tests, design iterations, reach players, and then see the behaviour we saw in the lab also being shown by millions of players and to know they are loving it! That is really a great feeling. To have the collaborative process of game design come together.</p><p>As someone who loves research it is also really fulfilling to be able to take the knowledge I have of why, cognitively speaking, a motorist may not see a cyclist at an intersection and be able to use that to investigate why a UI element or enemy in a game may also not stand out. Every survey, every UX test and every playtest, it is just exciting to me to see the data, whether it is surprising or completely expected.</p><p><strong>LP: On the flipside, what are the downsides? Are there any challenges you would face regularly, and are there fresh ones you see coming on the horizon?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: A regular challenge would be dealing with the misconception that UXR dumbs down games and makes them easy. Also, that we are all inherently evil and working to manipulate players into spending money. Neither of these is true about UXR.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the reason I have worked in games UXR and not, say, microwave UX, is that games can be designed to be hard in a way that just isn't the goal for consumer UX. Games can be confusing and challenging. If that is the intent of the designer, then that is what we work to support in UXR. In my 12+ years working in games UX research I have far more often highlighted that some design element was too easy for players than I have said something was too hard.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of the manipulation I do understand where that comes from. So much of the online world now has been made to intentionally work against the user. But absolutely that is not what I am interested in, nor is it what games user experience researchers should be supporting. Our goal is to represent the players. This means if something around purchasing is unclear it is our job to find that and point it out.&nbsp;</p><p>Two other things regularly bug me. One is calling what games user research does “focus testing” or “focus groups”. A focus group/test is a specific methodology where you get a group of people together and get them to talk about a product, design, or idea. It is a flawed method, and not one I use or recommend. If I were to pick one method that is most representative for UXR it would be observational research. Watching people play and writing down what happens to collect their actual behaviour i.e., not what they say they do, but what they actually do. So, please if you are going to generalize say: we do playtesting or UX testing, not focus tests.&nbsp;</p><p>The other is when people throw around scientific terms like "hit of dopamine" or "dopamine rush". Dopamine just simply doesn't work like that at all. Also we really shouldn't be using drug metaphors in general when talking about games.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: Thanks so much again for your time. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we sign off? Shout outs to peers, advice for folks, ill tidings for the industry?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: If anything I have said above is interesting to you, you should check out <a href="https://www.gamesur.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games User Research,</a> which is best place to go on the Internet for information on games UX research, including an active Discord server for connecting with and talking with others in the field.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, a big thanks to my previous teammates, colleagues, and teachers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><figure><figcaption><span>RoseRodionova / Shutterstock / Visa / Mastercard / PayPal / Aftermath</span></figcaption></figure></p></div><div><p>If you work at a Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, or PayPal call center, your past few days might have taken on a recurring theme. Since last week’s sudden <a href="https://aftermath.site/itch-io-nsfw-adult-content-remove-payment-processors-collective-shout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">de-indexing of almost all NSFW content</a> sent shockwaves through indie game storefront Itch.io, concerned creators and fans have been organizing to call the aforementioned reportedly-responsible companies and voice their displeasure en masse. Coordinating across BlueSky, Twitter, Discord, and Reddit, their rationale is simple: If Collective Shout, the activist group that has claimed responsibility for adult game removals on Itch <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-introduces-new-rule-prohibiting-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-that-might-make-visa-or-mastercard-unhappy-financial-deplatforming-in-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and Steam</a>, could move the needle with <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/steam_campaign_history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,067 emails to payment processors</a>, a much larger group can tug the needle right back.</p><p>Of course, this relies on some pretty big assumptions: 1) That Collective Shout, which claims to fight "against the objectification of women and the sexualization of girls" but which over the years has largely set its sights on <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/ban-prn-on-x?fbclid=IwY2xjawL2DW5leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFJcFJvcm1BVnUwRXZheW1TAR501XhzQorP36fB8s4Keaz5DdvdnQd0yg7qBpXK9MBJyXd3QylZOo3WCYJR6g_aem_CE1Moq-4XPj6QYrWKVQhcA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banning porn</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/29/mastercard-visa-backlash-adult-games-removed-online-stores-steam-itchio-ntwnfb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwear ads</a>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/australian-anti-porn-group-claims-responsibility-for-steams-new-censorship-rules-in-victory-against-porn-sick-brain-rotted-pedo-gamer-fetishists-and-things-only-get-weirder-from-there/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concert tours, and various video games</a>, can be taken at face value and is not exaggerating its involvement to boost its own profile (Collective Shout has mentioned Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal, and Itch has named Stripe, PayPal, and Collective Shout, but none of those financial companies have directly indicated that Collective Shout’s pressure swayed them). And 2) that Collective Shout’s success was born of numbers and persistence, rather than a system rigged in its favor – propped up by squeamish, puritanical companies that were ready to take action the moment a semi-notable third-party tugged on their sleeve.</p><p>Still, those providing phone numbers, pre-written scripts, and entire websites to the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/tell-mastercard-visa-activist-groups-stop-controlling-what-we-can-watch-read-or-play" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of thousands of people</a> opposed to censorship on Steam and Itch say they at least have to try.</p><p>“Outside of boosting posts and donating to causes via social media, I haven't been involved with something like this to this extent before,” Dieselbrain, a former artist who created <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dieselbrain.bsky.social/post/3luxwaqn4gs2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a resource-rich anti-censorship cheat sheet</a>, told Aftermath. “I decided to do this because seeing how quickly payment processors were moving to pressure platforms like Steam and Itch just made me realize that we need to start organizing more concretely. In many ways I'd rather be doing literally anything else, but livelihoods and expression are under fire from many different points of attack, so something had to be done.”</p><p>“I think an outrage like this was inevitable,” Cereza, an artist and developer who created a <a href="https://stop-paypros.neocities.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">site called Stop-Paypros</a>, told Aftermath. “This was just the boiling point for a [lot of] people, me included. Itch.io is one of the most creator-friendly websites I've ever seen and a godsend for aspiring creatives like me. Watching itch.io being forced to delist all of these works felt like yet another opportunity closing in front of me. … If payment processors don't listen to the outrage right now, I think it'll only delay their troubles in the future.”</p><p>The pages community stewards like Dieselbrain and Cerza have put together advise trying to phone all four – and in some cases even more – targets each day and prepare those who’ve heeded the call for the long haul. "This is a marathon, not a race," reads Dieselbrain's cheat sheet. "Clogging their phone lines for an extended period, over a month at the absolute least, will almost guarantee that these companies will at least have to pay attention to the backlash."</p><p>Void, a Vtuber and artist who’s put together <a href="https://anti-censorship-campaign.carrd.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a website</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Ms9GVmFD7K" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord</a> to aid the cause, concurs.</p><p>"The most important thing is to keep talking about this,” he told Aftermath. “We have momentum and we need to keep it. This can't just be something we all forget about by next week. Meaningful change only happens if we work together and don't give up!”</p><p>Different guides offer different approaches, starting with basic by-the-book talking points but in some cases getting craftier. For example, Cereza’s page includes an oblivious option (“I'm calling because a few days ago I wanted to buy a game that was a bit uh... on the adult side of things, but now I can't buy it anymore. I asked around and got told to call here, cause apparently you guys told [STEAM/ITCH.IO] that they couldn't sell adult games anymore?”) as well as some sterner alternatives for those with the stomach to get under customer service reps’ skin (“If these changes aren't made then I, along with many others will be forced to seek other options for processing payments. If [PAYMENT PROCESSOR] continues to impede on legitimate businesses, free speech and users' freedom to purchase legal goods, I will press as many opportunistic law firms as possible and kick off a class action lawsuit against your company.”)</p><figure><blockquote><p>[PayPal] put me on a 16.5 hour silent hold yesterday.</p></blockquote></figure><p>It’s difficult to say just how many people have spent the past several days tying up the lines of card companies and payment processors, but the movement has made itself visible enough to gain support from larger industry bodies like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/videogameworkers.bsky.social/post/3lv2foxkkac22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Communications Workers of America</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/igda-seriously-alarmed-by-recent-crackdown-on-nsfw-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the International Game Developers Association</a>. Additionally, its most vocal proponents have reported a shift in how representatives treat them. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brlka.com/post/3lut2e2mbl22g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Late last week</a>, callers say reps were already telling them that they weren’t alone in expressing their specific concern, but otherwise maintained a chill, professional demeanor. Now, midway through this week, Visa and Mastercard reps have apparently taken to shunting incensed Steam and Itch users down scripts of their own and, in some cases, expressing impatience or frustration.&nbsp;</p><p>“Visa was hit and miss – either respectful or defensive; it went from respectful to defensive with each passing day,” Trepe, a member of Void’s anti-censorship Discord who said that they’ve made over 20 calls in total, told Aftermath. “When they were defensive, they didn't bother answering my question. They did ‘promise me’ a callback, but I have a feeling they just lied.”</p><p>Trepe went on to say that during one call they got yelled at, and in others, reps immediately ended the call.&nbsp;</p><p>Another repeat caller, Henrick, told Aftermath that generally escalating the issue to a supervisor – rather than a rank-and-file rep – has required a specific ask and that, even then, that hasn’t fully worked; at best, they’ve received a confirmation number for their case. At worst, well…</p><p>“[PayPal] put me on a 16.5 hour silent hold yesterday,” Henrick said to Aftermath.</p><p>It’s not difficult to find similar <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dismalwether.bsky.social/post/3lv2vbve7ok2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anecdotes</a> on sites like BlueSky – <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/caraellison.bsky.social/post/3luzxqyotzk2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some supportive</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sammynona.bsky.social/post/3lv4onz727227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">others less so</a> – suggesting that at least some of those on the front (phone) lines are starting to buckle under the pressure.</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, and Stripe for more information. The former three did not reply as of this publishing, while a spokesperson for the latter – who seemed exceedingly familiar with the Steam/Itch situation – pointed to the adult section of <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stripe’s prohibited businesses list</a>.</p><p>"Stripe has a policy against commenting on users,” the representative told Aftermath. “Generally speaking, we take action when we conclude that users violate our terms of service. We do not support adult content."&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/mastercard-rules.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastercard’s “illegal or brand-damaging transactions” policy</a> forbids “the sale of a product or service, including an image, which is patently offensive and lacks serious artistic value (such as, by way of example and not limitation, images of nonconsensual sexual behavior, sexual exploitation of a minor, nonconsensual mutilation of a person or body part, and bestiality), or any other material that the Corporation deems unacceptable to sell in connection with a Mark.”&nbsp;</p><p>These policies often lean on terms like “illegal,” but experts in payment processors and censorship say the reality of the situation is far less black and white.</p><p>"I think the reason that activist organizations tend to target payment companies is that they're seen as the weakest link in providing online content payment services,” Rainey Reitman, special advisor to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and author of forthcoming book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807019119?tag=bpress-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Transaction Denied: Big Finance's Power to Punish Speech</em></a>, told Aftermath. “They don't really care about most individual accounts, because they're not making that much money, in the grand scheme of things, off of any one account. So any hassle that's going to cause them, like a headache or bad publicity or potential scrutiny from regulators, they just wash their hands of it. There's no consequences for them in shutting off accounts in the United States; they don't have an obligation to provide services to people or even to provide an explanation when they choose to end a financial relationship, except in a very limited number of circumstances."</p><p>While beleaguered call center workers are an unintended casualty of this potentially ceaseless dustup between companies and campaigners, the real goal is to deprive companies of time and money. In an ideal world, those spearheading the anti-censorship movement hope, companies will eventually reverse course. This might sound like a pipe dream, but it’s not unprecedented: In 2021, following backlash from users, OnlyFans <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-says-it-will-no-longer-ban-porn-after-backlash-from-users.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reversed a decision to ban porn</a> prompted by banks and payment companies. "Thank you to everyone for making your voices heard," OnlyFans <a href="https://x.com/OnlyFans/status/1430499277302816773" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter at the time</a>. "We have secured assurances [from banking partners] necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned October 1 policy change."&nbsp;</p><p>"I haven't seen backlash like this to this sort of censorship pressure since something similar happened with OnlyFans a few years back, and that backlash <em>was </em>able to turn that situation around," said Deiselbrain. "I think people are hitting a breaking point and they're sick of these kinds of draconian policies."</p><figure><blockquote><p>I haven't seen backlash like this to this sort of censorship pressure since something similar happened with OnlyFans a few years back.</p></blockquote></figure><p>According to Mike Stabile, director of policy at a trade association for the adult industry called the <a href="https://www.freespeechcoalition.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Free Speech Coalition</a>, the OnlyFans situation provides few surefire takeaways, but it does demonstrate a lack of legal and moral authority that companies like Visa and Mastercard disguise with official-sounding-but-vague terms of service.</p><p>"OnlyFans has been sort of tight-lipped about what actually happened [when it reversed its porn ban], but several days before OnlyFans made that decision, [Congresswoman Ann Wagner] had sent a letter to the Department of Justice saying that there was exploitation happening on OnlyFans,” Stabile told Aftermath. “The claims were really sort of without evidence, but it generated headlines and attention, which makes bankers nervous. ... They don't want to lose Visa and Mastercard, right? They don't want to be excluded from those networks. The threat of costly government investigations or bad PR can sometimes make them nervous enough where they were going to pull back from working with a specific platform."</p><p>"But the idea that it's just about what's legal is ridiculous,” he added. “It's not about what the law allows you to process. These are often very subjective rules around what falls outside the brand guidelines for Visa and Mastercard. And even if something doesn't fall outside the brand guidelines, it may just be something that is uncomfortable. ... [Questions of] 'Is this inside the bounds? Is this outside the bounds? Should we be processing that? Should we not be processing that?' are often incredibly subjective."</p><p>Stabile speculated that specific game removals on Steam and new rules on both Steam and Itch are meant to bring video games in line with what card companies and payment processors would be comfortable with in real-life porn. But that approach, he noted, doesn’t really stand up to prolonged scrutiny: "The difference is that you can't shoot anybody in real life, but there are plenty of games in which you can do that,” he said. “The stuff [companies] are talking about is entirely legal. It's legal to have in a book, it's legal to have in a game. They are making decisions based on their brand, based on public pressure from anti-porn groups, and that can be reversed."</p><p>Itch now finds itself waiting on the outcome of some of those subjective determinations to decide when, how, and which NSFW content will return to the store, according to site founder and owner Leaf Corcoran.</p><p>"The situation is evolving as we await final determinations from our current payment processors, Stripe and PayPal,” Corcoran wrote in <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content#addendum-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an FAQ on Itch</a>. “There are still unknowns that prevent us from providing a fixed timeline."</p><p>Where Steam, a platform on which every product page is reviewed before going live, was able to target specific games and issue new policies relatively quickly, Itch, an open platform, has been forced to conduct “a broader review.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Every payments platform is built on many layers of different partners, from banks to card networks,” Corcoran told Aftermath. “When we got a policy notice from Visa, it went up that chain before arriving in our inbox. Each layer has a team that decides if they are willing to continue doing business with us. When we received the notice, we were told that those teams were likely actively clicking around on our site to determine if itch.io is a business they can support. It was incredibly critical that we addressed problematic pages as fast as possible. The changes we are making to our platform have to convince them that we've taken the violation seriously and that we're committed to a solution that will avoid any future issues.”&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout this process, Itch has also been hit with backlash from creators who feel abandoned in the face of an outside incursion. Some have pointed out, though, that Itch’s relatively small team is at least keeping the public abreast of its progress and methodology – that it’s less walled-off than, say, Steam. Corcoran can see where the critics are coming from.</p><p>"Honestly, I feel like our communication has been lacking,” he said. “I've personally been prioritizing critical platform updates over communicating externally. We've done our initial audit and implemented product changes, so I had a moment [earlier this week] to update our users on what's going on. We owe it to our developers to keep them updated while pages are deindexed."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Reps at these companies are very much aware of what's going on. I can only hope that this can lead to a positive change for creators. The work the community is doing is incredibly impressive and should be celebrated.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Corcoran cheers the movement to get card companies and payment processors to reverse their decision, though if it’s causing them to waver, they’ve yet to communicate it to him: "No one at any of the companies we're in touch with has mentioned [all the calls and messages] to us yet. I do see on social media, though, that reps at these companies are very much aware of what's going on. I can only hope that this can lead to a positive change for creators. The work the community is doing is incredibly impressive and should be celebrated. I think it's important that these discussions are happening."</p><p>In the long run, Corcoran plans to “start working with more financial partners that are equipped to handle the kind of content we have.”&nbsp;</p><p>“It's our own fault for not having additional relationships with payment processors in place to avoid interruptions like this,” he said.</p><p>That will hopefully mean NSFW games can continue to flourish on the platform – that The Great Deindexing will be remembered as merely an interruption before a return to regularly scheduled programming. In the meantime, however, games that do not include content card companies and payment processors might find objectionable appear to have run afoul of the rules on both <a href="https://myosuki.itch.io/girls-girls-girls/comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Itch</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dirtlord77.bsky.social/post/3lv2264j6sk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> – a nightmare scenario that some see as the beginning of a slippery slope. <em>VILE: Exhumed</em>, a deeply personal horror game that was recently banned from Steam, has game makers feeling especially on edge.</p><p>"I am extremely disappointed to let you know that <em>VILE: Exhumed</em> has been fully removed and banned for sale on Steam," wrote the game’s creator, Cara Cadaver, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dirtlord77.bsky.social/post/3lv2264j6sk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on BlueSky</a>. "I want to be clear: <em>VILE: Exhumed</em> was not banned for its use of gore in storytelling or the violent themes. It was banned for 'sexual content with depictions of real people,' which, if you have played it, you know is all implied, making this all feel even worse."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="VILE: Exhumed | Release Date Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSbDTr-g_sE?start=5&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Other developers of games that explore adult themes, like <em>Tryhard</em>, <em>Zugzwang</em>, and <em>Hurt Me Plenty</em> creator Robert Yang – whose games were also deindexed on Itch – have found hope in the movement to push back against bank companies and payment processors but believe that this might be a sign that it’s time to think bigger.</p><p>“In the long run, maybe the only way to prevent payment processor censorship is to distribute games without payment, non-commercially,” Yang told Aftermath. “But obviously people need money to survive. Maybe we have to imagine other ways of supporting artists.”</p><p>At the heart of all of this is a question: What <em>are </em>the companies that handle our transactions? Are they merely utilities, like gas or electricity, or should they play a greater role in shaping society? It’s one that’s being asked in court right now, as part of a case focused on <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-tentatively-dismisses-visa-from-pornhub-sex-trafficking-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Visa, Pornhub, and sex trafficking</a>.</p><p>“[The case] is trying to hold Visa accountable for sex trafficking by providing financial services to advertising on PornHub, which is a sweeping and mind-boggling accusation,” said Reitman. “Are you going to hold the water company accountable for sex trafficking, for providing water to PornHub? It just doesn't make any sense. With that said, it's still in the courts. We'll see how the courts sort that out, and it might be a long time before we get an answer about it, but it's possible that some of these financial companies are watching that case and wondering what might be in the future for them."</p><p>Naomi Clark, game designer and chair at the NYU Game Center, believes that the PornHub case is just one tendril of a much larger beast.</p><p>"These matters currently exist in a kind of legal and regulatory ambiguity where it's not entirely clear who could be held liable for some kind of vague ‘harm’ stemming from explicit content,” Clark told Aftermath. “Certainly the situation with [adult] content on Tumblr, on OnlyFans, and the lawsuit against PornHub's owner MindGeek show how varied these outcomes can be. In the case of MindGeek, you had one judge saying in 2022 that Visa could be named in that lawsuit as a defendant even though they were just processing payments, and another judge earlier this year saying the opposite in the same case, dismissing Visa as a defendant because in his view they're only a utility company."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Are you going to hold the water company accountable for sex trafficking, for providing water to PornHub? It just doesn't make any sense.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Then there’s FOSTA and SESTA, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/woodhull-freedom-foundation-et-al-v-united-states#take-action" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-sex work, pro-censorship laws</a> disguised as anti-trafficking bills that leave companies and online platforms vulnerable.</p><p>"Nobody really knows whether SESTA and FOSTA could be stretched to prohibit any kind of fictional content that could be perceived as ‘promoting sex trafficking’ or how broad that could get,” said Clark. “In many ways legal and government systems have abdicated setting guidelines, but we clearly have an incredibly litigious executive in the White House who favors abusing the law and lawsuits and regulatory power to prohibit speech he and cronies don't like, so that sets the tone."</p><p>The end result? Fear.</p><p>"We are in a time of fear, uncertainty, and doubt – even for top risk management, compliance, and legal executives in corporate settings,” said Clark. “There's been a lot of ‘We will just ignore this as long as we can look the other way,’ and Collective Shout pierced that bubble. But I don't think even the people at the top have a clear idea of what the safe or sensible thing to do is."</p><p>This is why Reitman believes that even if the movement to pressure bank companies and payment processors to stop meddling in Steam and Itch’s affairs does not succeed overnight – or ever – it’s still worthwhile.</p><p>“I think the more pressure the public can put on companies like Visa and Mastercard the better, because right now I fear that these financial companies only hear from people who are calling on them to engage in more censorship,” she said. “So these phone calls can be a powerful counter narrative.”</p><p>"There's this bigger societal question, which is, do we think that payment services and financial companies should ever be weighing in on online speech issues, or should just be neutral intermediaries that provide financial services?” she continued. “I would argue quite strongly for the latter. … There are any number of people who are closer to the content, who are better able to judge whether or not that content should exist. Financial companies are so far removed that they can't really weigh in on these issues."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-user-experience-ux-research"><h3>‘Dopamine Simply Doesn’t Work Like That’: An Interview With A User Experience Researcher</h3></a><p>'Part of the reason I have worked in games UXR and not, say, microwave UX, is that games can be designed to be hard'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/clues-by-sam-wordle-daily-puzzle-game"><h3>Clues By Sam Is My Favorite Daily Puzzle Game</h3></a><p>It’s a nice little thing to do as my last thing before falling asleep.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/new-york-times-video-games-ai-nyt"><h3>The New York Times Will Never Learn</h3></a><p>We kept getting fed the same bullshit, and it’s being laundered in the same kind of stories</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/anime-manga-disney-jail-netflix-fragrant-flower"><h3>The World Is Conspiring Against Me Legally Experiencing The Fragrant Flower Blooms With Dignity</h3></a><p>The enshittification of manga and anime have reached absurd new heights, courtesy of Netflix and Kodansha’s collective bullshit.
