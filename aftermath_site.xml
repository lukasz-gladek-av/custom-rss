            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-dead-inside-do-not-enter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In July 2024<a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-closed-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> we bid farewell to Kotaku Australia, a very good website that suffered a long and undeserved demise at the hands of inept ownership</a>. Now, in March 2025, the domain "kotaku.com.au" is once again active, but sadly/predictably, in the worst way imaginable.</p><p>Rather than bring back the team behind the video games-oriented site, or even relaunching a hollowed-out version of the same idea, the new website is home to "The Kotaku Times", one of the saddest examples of domain-parking and SEO exploitation I've ever seen. There's the outline of a website there, but none of it is by or for human beings.</p><figure><figcaption>It will not surprise you to find that the zombie site there now does not really cover...any what it says it covers</figcaption></figure><p>OK, so. First, "Kotaku" isn't a real word! It was a kinda-racist name dreamt up by Gawker Media over 20 years ago; it makes no sense outside its original context, so it's already obvious this website only exists to try to skim off old backlinks and searches. Second, this isn't even a video games website, it's a shell posting SEO garbage like "Best Hair Bonnets for Sleeping in 2025" and "How to Create a Winning Business Plan: Step-by-Step Guide".</p><figure></figure><p>Third, every byline is by the same author, "Damian O'Gallagher",<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-o-gallagher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> someone who I am not convinced exists</a> despite claiming to have been a freelance writer for a decade, and could just be a cover for whatever AI slop is throwing all these unrelated, garbage articles together, which even when they're talking about specific video games are full of AI-generated images. All of which sucks, but also makes sense when you see<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonlavery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the domain is now registered to an Australia "SEO Specialist"</a>.</p><p>Seeing a beloved website close down was bad enough. Seeing its domain brought back as this shambling corpse of a website, the dead internet in all its rotting glory, is even worse.</p><p>(Thanks<a href="https://web-cdn.bsky.app/profile/vook64.bsky.social/post/3lkkhz45urc2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Vooks</a>)</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/monster-hunter-movie"><h3>That Live Action Monster Hunter Movie Kinda Rips</h3></a><p>Who wouldâ€™ve thought Paul W.S.
