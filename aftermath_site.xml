You might not know him by name, but you absolutely know him for his work.</p><p>During a decades-long partnership with his twin brother Tim, Greg helped produce famous pieces for everything from Marvel to <em>Lord of the Rings</em> to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> to metal album covers.</p><figure></figure><p>The Hildebrandts are perhaps best known, though, for their work in movies, and in particular their iconic <em>Star Wars</em> theatrical poster, featuring Luke and Leia in a heroic pose while Vader looms menacingly behind them.&nbsp;</p><p>If you've ever thought Leia doesn't look much like Carrie Fisher here, that's because she was never supposed to: Greg's first wife Diana Stankowski was the model for the painting, which the pair <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/greg-hildebrandt-dead-star-wars-lord-of-the-rings-marvel-1236051862/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">produced in a "feverish" 36 hours against a tight deadline</a>.</p><figure></figure><p>And if you're thinking this sure looks like that <em>other </em>Star Wars theatrical painting, that's because itâ€™s the second of three "types" of posters commissioned by Lucasfilm for the majority of <em>A New Hope's global</em> releases. It followed<a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Jung" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Tom Jung's original</a>, and was <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Chantrell?file=Star_Wars_style_C_poster_1977.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">itself followed by Tom Chantrell's piece</a> (which you might also recognise as the cover art for <em>Super Star Wars</em> on the SNES).</p><p>Greg died last week after battling "serious" side effects linked to his heart medication. Tim passed away in June 2006.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
