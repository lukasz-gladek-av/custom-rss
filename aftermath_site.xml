            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In February, <em>Civilization VII</em> released to what feels like (the internet wasn't around in the 90s!) the worst reception in series history,<a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> its major new features dividing fans and distancing the game from what many have long loved about it</a>. Now,<a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> even as the team at Firaxis work to update the game</a>, many of them are being laid off.</p><p>After a number of former Firaxis staff like artists, writers and producers, predominantly from the <em>Civ VII</em> team, began posting earlier today that they'd been let go,<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-confirms-layoffs-at-civilization-developer-firaxis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 2K confirmed with Game Developer</a> that there had been a "staff reduction today at Firaxis Games", with the site estimating that "dozens of workers have been impacted by the cuts".</p><p>Using absolutely meaningless filler words as cover for the move, 2K said the layoffs were part of an effort to increase "adaptability, collaboration, and creativity" at Firaxis, none of which sound like they can be boosted by laying off dozens of the people who worked there.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As I said in my <em>Civ VII</em> review</a>, its development sounded like a mess, which would be a strategic misstep made at levels far above those affected today by layoffs:</p><blockquote><p>It's clear something has gone very wrong during the game's development. There are now multiple<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i3wpql/vii_release_ui_spotted/#lightbox" target="_blank">&nbsp;examples</a>, both from early demos in 2024 and hidden in the final game's<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://imgur.com/a/y4pQqYr" target="_blank">&nbsp;code</a>, of&nbsp;<em>Civ VII</em>&nbsp;once having an almost&nbsp;<em>entirely&nbsp;</em>different interface. For that aspect of the game to have been overhauled so close to release sure would explain why things look so bland and rushed--one of my earliest notes from playing this was "looks like an iPad version of&nbsp;<em>Civ V</em>"--and why the interface was the first thing&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/" target="_blank">Firaxis have said</a>&nbsp;they'd be fixing, because what if they're not really fixing it at all, but just...finishing it.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The game sold well, however,<a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2025/02/07/civilization-7-record-pre-orders-take-two-q3-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reportedly breaking pre-order records for the series</a>. In May,<a href="https://aftermath.site/take-two-zelnick-layoffs-roll7-intercept" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick</a> said he had been "thrilled with Civ 7 so far", with the game currently sitting in the<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1kluj5q/civilization_vii_is_so_far_the_8th_bestselling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> top 10 best-selling games of 2025 list</a>. And <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/civilization-7-studio-firaxis-confirms-layoffs-as-it-optimizes-its-development-process-for-adaptability-collaboration-and-creativity-which-is-somehow-even-worse-than-just-saying-agility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a statement issued to PC Gamer</a>, 2K and Firaxis say they "continue to work hard on title updates and patches" for <em>Civ VII</em>, "to ensure it aligns with the needs of our players".</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">But this is the industry as it operates in 2025</a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762933/bioshock-cloud-chamber-take-two-2k-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially at Take-Two</a>); it's hard imagining an alternate timeline where the game broke both critical and sales records and there still  weren’t some kind of layoffs, because that's just what happens now. That's the only lever the people in charge of these companies ever want to pull.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/football-manager-26-fm26-sports-interactive-womens-league-wsl-nwsl"><h3>More Sports Games Should Take A Year Off</h3></a><p>It gives you the time to, for example, add around 35,000 new players to a game</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/play-for-peace-bundle-palestine-aid-fundraiser"><h3>10 Months In The Making, Play For Peace Bundle Launches To Raise Money for Palestinian Aid</h3></a><p>‘It was important that our charity's proceeds directly went to Palestinian relief efforts’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/32-9-long-handheld-amd-pc-steamdeck"><h3>Long Handheld</h3></a><p>ᗡ□□□□□□□□□□□□D</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/civilization-7-civ-vii-layoffs-firaxis-2k-take-two]]></content:encoded>
