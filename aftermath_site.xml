            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/quartz-ai-articles-go-media<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, several staffers at G/O Media (which previously employed all of us here at Aftermath) pointed out the proliferation of AI-generated articles on news site Quartz. Written in a style that would get a high school “introduction to writing” student a B for effort, they… I can’t even think of a good way to sum them up, the whole thing just sucks.</p><p>As of publishing, the “<a href="https://qz.com/author/quartz-intelligence-newsroom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quartz Intelligence Newsroom</a>” has written 22 articles today, running the gamut from earnings reports to Reddit communities banning Twitter posts to the Sackler settlement to, delightfully, a couple articles about how much AI sucks. Quartz has been running AI-generated articles for months, but prior to yesterday, they appear to have been limited to summaries of earnings reports rather than news articles. Boilerplate at the bottom of these articles notes that “This is the first phase of an experimental new version of reporting. While we strive for accuracy and timeliness, due to the experimental nature of this technology we cannot guarantee that we’ll always be successful in that regard.”</p><figure><figcaption>Quartz</figcaption></figure><p>The articles, to their credit, do cite where the AI is gathering its information from. But even this is surface level: the <a href="https://qz.com/elon-musk-nazi-salute-hand-gesture-reddit-x-twitter-1851746934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit </a>article, for instance, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lgj3icyeo22i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cites </a>Yahoo and the New York Post, but the Yahoo post is actually a repub from the Daytona Beach News-Journal, and the Post article cites NBC News as its own source. I cannot imagine how this game of telephone could go wrong, especially when letting a robot write news about contentious public figures and rapidly changing events.</p><p>G/O previously experimented with AI-generated articles back in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/8/23788162/gizmodo-g-o-media-ai-generated-articles-star-wars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023</a>, most memorably producing a chronological list of <em>Star Wars</em> entries that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230706053620/https://gizmodo.com/a-chronological-list-of-star-wars-movies-tv-shows-1850592566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t chronological</a>, and a bunch of <a href="https://defector.com/go-media-bot-blogs-may-be-unreadable-but-at-least-theyre-incorrect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">garbage</a> on The AV Club and Deadspin. None of these sites are owned by G/O anymore; Quartz is one of three sites that are still standing, as well as commerce site The Inventory. Of those remaining sites, Kotaku saw layoffs back in <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-layoffs-go-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November</a>, and The Root recently made the news when, following the death of a writer, the site’s deputy editor <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/01/08/2025/root-writers-pressed-to-write-more-to-offset-colleagues-death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked staffers to write more to compensate</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of which makes Quartz’s use of AI just more proof–not that you need it–of how little G/O cares about the people who work there, and how little it thinks of its audience’s intelligence. (What self-respecting reader <em>wouldn’t</em> feel their knowledge of the world had been enriched after reading a <a href="https://qz.com/google-uk-fake-reviews-1851747419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">line</a> like “By focusing on the elimination of fake reviews, both entities aim to bolster the integrity of the digital marketplace, thereby preserving consumer trust and ensuring fair competition among businesses.”?)&nbsp;</p><p>While I at first vainly attempted to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lgj3cutphs2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parse</a> the logic behind this, one interpretation is that news stories have the best potential to generate traffic, which could pave the way for G/O to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lgj3jcrhk22d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tout increased traffic numbers</a> to potential buyers and show off the power of its AI technology in the process. As long as a buyer doesn’t look too closely at the actual AI-generated articles, or pay any attention to the response to them (easy to do now that G/O sites no longer have comments), they could fall for the con. </p><p>Anyone tricked into reading this slop (which I suppose now also includes me, hate-reading it), is just helping Jim Spanfeller and his cronies continue destroying a once-beloved network in the most embarrassing way possible. But hey, to quote <a href="https://qz.com/meta-stock-price-target-analysts-mark-zuckerberg-ai-1851747648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an AI article</a> that went up as I was writing this, “The strategic focus on AI by Zuckerberg is poised to potentially influence investor sentiment and may further enhance Meta’s competitive edge.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/oscars-emilia-perez-on-cinema-tim-heidecker"><h3>Stop Watching The Oscars</h3></a><p>They're bad, and you don't have to.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s right, it’s Christmas for Tinseltown, the Academy Awards! Another dogshit year where the worst movie you’ve ever seen is likely to sweep the show, leaving you with your head in your hands as you overlook your cheese plate.</p><p>I stopped watching the Oscars a couple years ago. I used to make a <em>huge</em> deal out of it, inviting people over and making a spread of hors d'oeuvres. After many years of disappointments, I learned to stop giving a fuck. Now each year on Oscar night, I watch the <em>On Cinema, At The Cinema</em> Oscar special instead of the award ceremony. This live comedy special takes place on the same night as the Oscars every year and is the culmination of each season of <em>On Cinema, At The Cinema</em>, a comedy web show produced by and starring Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington. I’ve <a href="https://kotaku.com/on-cinema-is-funny-because-its-about-everything-but-cin-1838970609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sung the praises of this bizarre program</a> many, many times, but the main appeal is that Heidecker and Turkington express the same level of disdain for the Hollywood establishment that I also have. Their Oscar special has the same level of respect for cinema that Academy voters have, which is to say not much at all. At least Heidecker and Turkington are funny.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Oscar Medley | On Cinema 4th Annual LIVE Oscar Special | Adult Swim" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lei2iNKSeeg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>On this week’s pod, Chris and I spent a lot of time talking about this year’s Oscar frontrunner, <em>Emilia Perez</em>. Despite looking like absolute dookie, this film has been nominated for 13 awards including Best Picture. You may know the film from a bizarre excerpt that keeps going viral where Zoe Saldana sings badly about sex change operations. Yes, that’s right—this movie is about trans people, starring a trans actress, but <a href="https://glaad.org/emilia-perez-is-not-good-trans-representation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a way that feels incredibly transphobic</a>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Zoe Saldaña - La Vaginoplastia (From Emilia Pérez Oscar Nominee - Best Picture)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kaChl7eJoEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Chris and I just about lost our minds talking about this stupid fucking movie and the inevitability of it winning Best Picture. If you don’t work in media and are similarly dreading this future, just watch the On Cinema, At the Cinema Oscar Special instead. You will simply have a better time.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>,<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.
