            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m finally playing <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>. I’ve had a good time so far climbing all over the game’s Vatican map and getting into clumsy fistfights, but one thing that hasn’t been such a good time are the quests that involve the in-game camera, because I hate in-game cameras.</p><p>(Spoilers for the first quest and some early side missions of <em>Indiana Jones</em>.)</p><p>Early on in the game, you have to purchase a camera. You need it to move the story forward, but it’s also used in side activities: you’ll overhear some nuns wishing they had a photo of Indy’s pal Father Antonio, so you can go snap a pic and give it to them. A priest is bummed he didn’t get a photo of the Sistine Chapel, so you can take one for him. As I wandered the Vatican, I’d constantly get prompts that there was something I could take a picture of; I’d equip my camera, raise it to my face, and swing the viewfinder around until the game told me what it wanted me to snap.</p><figure></figure><p>These kinds of tasks in games drive me nuts. I’ve always chalked this up to being primarily a PC gamer–my whole machine is basically a camera, able to take screenshots with a single button press, so in-game cameras make a simple task more clunky by throwing a bunch of interface stuff in the way. I hate having to swap things around in my inventory just to <em>look</em> at something, the task I’m already mainly engaged in through playing a first-person game. I hate trying to figure out what a game wants me to take a picture of and then trying to take whatever the game thinks is an acceptable picture of it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Indiana Jones</em>’ implementation of this task at least <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3ldf5ohpbdk23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guides you </a>toward the correct framing by giving you a viewfinder to line up with, and it also gives you visual and audio prompts when there’s something photographable nearby. But last night, when I was playing through the area under the Vatican, I kept getting photo prompts as I was busy evading fascists and trying to escape the labyrinthian area; really not the time to stop for photos! (I should also mention that I’m playing on keyboard and mouse despite the game suggesting I don’t, which makes pulling things out of my inventory slightly more cumbersome than I imagine it is with a controller.) So far, most of the game's camerawork has been optional, so as long as I can deal with ignoring the little prompt, I can mostly pretend it doesn’t exist. I’m not sure how long that will last, though. </p><p>I complained about these quests on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3ldeyxhhy622r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>, where many people defended their love of in-game camera quests, or games like <em>Umurangi Generation</em> or <em>Pokemon Snap</em> that are <em>just</em> about taking pictures. I support all of this! I’m envious that you are able to find joy where I am not, through a very popular mechanic that many people seem to like. I know that my dislike of in-game camera quests is a narrow personal gripe, getting into “<a href="https://aftermath.site/i-hate-double-jump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hating double jump</a>” territory, and I appreciate hearing why other people like them because maybe, one day, I can learn to like them too. Please teach me your ways or, failing that, at least help me feel like less of a killjoy by admitting that you don't like them either.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-2024-future-class-game-changer-geoff-keighley"><h3>With The Future Class On Hold, The Game Awards’ Attempts At Doing Good Produce Mixed Results</h3></a><p>Geoff Keighley wants to be perceived as an agent of change for the better, but he's propped up by the status quo</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
