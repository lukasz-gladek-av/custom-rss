            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/strategy-game-turn-based-tactics-movement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As I have already made clear on this website</a>, there are few things I love more in video games than moving guys around a map. Today, I would like to pay tribute to my favourite entry in the MGAM genre: <em>Order of Battle</em>, a turn-based WW2 tactics game first released in 2015.</p><p><em>Order of Battle</em> is basically a more modern version of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzer_General" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the classic <em>Panzer General</em></a>. With hex maps, turn-based gameplay and a probability-based resolution to battles, it basically plays the same as a round of <em>Advance Wars</em> or <em>Fire Emblem</em>, only you have Sherman tanks and paratroopers instead of wizards and hero characters.</p><p>I will say here that, before we go any further, this game has <em>problems</em>. For one, not long after launch it adopted what was at the time a fairly controversial release model where the base game (including a simple tutorial) was free, and players were then asked to buy each campaign individually. That's pretty normal by 2025 standards, but back then it pissed a lot of people off!</p><p>It also suffers from the same problem a lot of Second World War games do in that in trying to give you access to multiple factions--you can play scripted campaigns as both the Germans and Japanese--they end up inadvertently putting the player in charge of stuff like...genocides and the advances that led to the Rape of Nanking.<a href="https://kotaku.com/hey-history-games-the-nazis-were-the-bad-guys-1842463381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Things here are nowhere near as glib as they are in, say, <em>Panzer Corps 2</em>, which almost revels in it</a>, but it's still uncomfortable to be so focused on moving little guys around a map when what came after those guys, even if the game never mentions it, was <em>a holocaust</em>.</p><p>(Given the purchasing model mentioned above though, you absolutely never have to play those campaigns, and there are loads available, including the most interesting ones, for the Americans and British.)</p><p>Even as a game, it has issues! A big part of <em>Order of Battle</em>, and one of the things that separates it from <em>Panzer General</em>, is that it includes both a visible frontline (which ebbs and flows depending where each of your units is on the map), and the ability to sever your opponent's supply lines by cutting across theirs, which can slow units down and even starve them of ammo, making them easier to mop up. It sounds great in theory--<a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-of-command-ii-is-a-really-solid-world-war-two-str-1839842115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and is something the rival <em>Unity of Command</em> series is actually able to do well</a>--but its implementation in <em>OoB </em>is maddening, because it allows a single unit to cut off an entire army's supply lines, across thousands of miles of frontline, which is just some bullshit both from an authenticity standpoint as well as gameplay one.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Order of Battle - Burma Road Trailer 2017" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOVHV7_IYPU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>All of which is to say that I love this game so much I do not really care about any of those things, at least not enough to stop me enjoying the game, because something <em>Order of Battle</em> does <em>very </em>well is let you move guys around a map. It excels at it. Everything about it is perfect. The way you can snap between selected units, the speed at which you can make them move, the little vrooms or marching boot sounds as they zoom off down a road, the way you can get a guy moving then click on the next guy and start <em>him </em>moving while the last guy is <em>still </em>moving, creating an endless succession of guys moving across the map all at once, it's wonderful.</p><p><em>Order of Battle</em> gives you the tangible thrill of being in command without any of the responsibility. Look at all these guys go! It doesn't matter if they stumble into an ambush, that's life, the point is that it was fun getting them there in the first place. You don't have to write letters to grieving mothers back home, and even if you did, their sons died doing what they did best: moving six hexes straight into enemy crossfire because their commander was too bust enjoying the cute noises they made while doing it.</p><p>What's also cool in <em>Order of Battle</em> is the sheer scale and variety of maps you get to move across. Ignoring the German and Japanese campaigns, there are still so many different ways you can fight this war as the British, Americans and Soviet Union, from the deserts of Africa to the snowy wastelands of Finland to the jungles of Burma. Each of those locations has different types of map, with different climates and different sizes. There are defensive maps, which are the worst, because they involve the least amount of moving guys around. There are dense urban struggles, vast open steppes that your tanks can soar across and, best of all, some big naval invasion maps which let you move ships, then have some of those ships turn into guys, then you get to move <em>those guys</em> around on land.</p><p>I don't want to discredit the rest of the game here (<a href="https://kotaku.com/order-of-battle-world-war-ii-the-kotaku-review-1795749182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even if this isn't a review, I've done that already</a>), as <em>Order of Battle</em> also has a neat experience system where your units can grow and improve (and be upgraded with better gear) throughout a campaign, and many missions feature some wild attempts at scripting, some of which works magnificently, others which...well, they tried. Campaigns are a pleasure to play through on a tactical basis, not just a vroom vroom basis, and for all the times this game stumbles I admire the way it's able to pick itself up again and keep going given it was developed with what appear to be quite limited resources.</p><p>But yeah, for everything it does well, there's nothing it does better than letting me move guys around a map. So thank you, <em>Order of Battle</em>, for being the best in the MGAM business.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse"><h3>‘Friendslop’ Isn’t Real, But People Love Posting About It Anyway</h3></a><p>But people are still intent on dunking on the idea of someone saying "friendslop" and meaning it.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lets-plays-sleep-youtube"><h3>Is Falling Asleep To Let’s Plays Medically Approved Gamer Melatonin Or Nah</h3></a><p>A gamer neurologist discusses whether YouTubers are onto something with this Millennial-meets-Gen-Z craze</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms"><h3>A Salute To The 13%</h3></a><p>Let them live a little</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/order-of-battle-ww2-turn-based-tactics-game-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like a lot of people, I mocked the term “friendslop” the first time that I heard it. It’s inherently funny to think of somebody getting upset about games that are made to give you an excuse to spend time with a few buddies. But as the term spread on social media, snowballing into a flurry of dunks and discourse, I started to realize that the term, said genuinely, had never actually existed at all. What does exist are platform dynamics, and the righteous dopamine hits they provide that have led to an entire cycle of people tilting at windmills.</p><p>“I call this genre of game ‘Friendslop,’” <a href="https://x.com/wooosaaaahhhhh/status/1901717577056780478" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote Twitter</a> user @wooosaaaahhhhh over images of <em>Lethal Company</em>, <em>R.E.P.O, </em>and <em>Content Warning </em>back in March, before coining another, even more deliberately nonsense term: “Its sole focus of existence is friendfarming.” In a follow up they attempted to clarify: “Ok so since this is actually getting hella traction I'll say I hope people see the word ‘friendfarming’ n realize I'm fucking joking LOL.” People did not.</p><p>The Tweet went viral, almost entirely through people taking it seriously. As it spread, the replies and quote tweets became a sea of derision: Anyone using the term “friendslop” surely had no friends to play with, people said. At first the backlash was mainly thousands of these mocking Twitter responses, but that changed after the release of <a href="https://aftermath.site/peak-climbing-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Peak</em></a> in June.</p><p>Having sold more than 5 million copies, <em>Peak</em> it also picked up a lot of interest in games media, which <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/peak-steam-landcrab-friendslop-update-interview-nick-kaman-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started to connect it</a> to the idea of “friendslop” becoming a catch-all term for co-op indie games. While it was once primarily used for horror extraction games, the inclusion of a current popular darling expanded the discourse around the term—<a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/article/not-every-co-op-game-is-friendslop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and made it more defensive</a>. As the discourse spread, Bluesky also took to mocking the supposed term, and it became a trending topic among commentary YouTubers and TikTokers, who took on the same contemptuous tone.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t have to call out randoms on the internet for this: In late June, a friend who I’ve been playing <em>Peak</em> with introduced the term to the group chat. I replied, “Me when I hate whimsy and joy and also literally ?????my friends???????” I, too, felt defensive of <em>Peak</em>, and it was also fun to mock the idea of the hypothetical miserable internet user who didn’t know how to find the enjoyment in playing it with good buddies.</p><figure></figure><p>I assumed the word, and the internet slapfights about it, would die off. I was wrong. It made me wonder if anyone was using it seriously, particularly on YouTube or Twitch, where contrarianism is lucrative. But I couldn’t find anyone responding to any specific video, or any big Twitch streamers using it. I couldn’t find a single example of someone saying “friendslop” except for as a joke or or a defense of the “genre.” Maybe they’re out there, but if they are, they’re absolutely buried under people who despise the term. Great news everybody! False alarm!</p><p>But people are still intent on dunking on the idea of someone using it, because ghost dunking is just as satisfying as real dunking. There’s no dopamine hit in quietly knowing that <em>Peak </em>and <em>Lethal Company </em>are just popular games to play with friends, safe from gamer slander. There is plenty of dopamine in saying “this guy has no friends lol” and getting 15 likes.&nbsp;</p><p>In <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe5641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2021 study</a>, researchers found that “positive social feedback for outrage expressions increases the likelihood of future outrage expressions.” In other words, the success of having a popular post yelling at something makes you more likely to do it again in the future. In this case, it’s a very low stakes situation, made up of the combination of people wanting to laugh at a silly term and to defend the honor of games without AAA polish that are mainly about collaboration and just hanging out, rather than the intense competition of some other multiplayer games. It’s also a collective outrage that people can participate in without having to think about the horror of the world like so many other collective outrages, and instead just reminisce on good times with good pals. But it’s still an example of the dopamine of discourse cycles making people get wildly carried away, sometimes based on absolutely nothing.</p><p>When we’re having an entire conversation that’s just barking at ghosts, it’s a good time to think about how these platforms impact more important discussions. To pick a recent example, it’s easy to post something popular about Microsoft’s recent layoffs. It’s more difficult to <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">avoid covering their games</a> as a gesture of solidarity towards the BDS boycott. To avoid talking about something by definition lacks engagement, so many people keep implicitly supporting Microsoft products. In short, posting about layoffs generates likes, and so does posting about how cool <em>DOOM</em> is. Therefore many people do both.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>Online discussion is all spurred by what does generate engagement, whether or not it's helpful or even true. For example, how we talk about generative AI. To be clear, among other issues, genAI broadly <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2479545-ai-hallucinations-are-getting-worse-and-theyre-here-to-stay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn’t work</a>. But when a (not yet peer reviewed) paper looked at the cognitive impacts, <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/your-brain-on-chatgpt/overview/#faq-is-it-safe-to-say-that-llms-are-in-essence-making-us-dumber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their FAQ</a> asked people to avoid saying that it causes “brain damage” or makes people “stupid.” Nevertheless, that paper has been passed around by people claiming it shows “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgKmmGDx75U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ChatGPT is DESTROYING our brains</a>,” and causing “<a href="https://x.com/itsalexvacca/status/1935343874421178762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cognitive bankruptcy</a>,”&nbsp; because it is an easy way to generate views, likes, and retweets.&nbsp;</p><p>In a 4000 word breakdown of what the study actually indicates, <a href="https://devonprice.medium.com/there-is-no-evidence-that-ai-causes-brain-damage-not-yet-anyway-7dcb0f4d667b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">educator and writer Devon Price</a> laments how it’s been misused, citing another study that shows that false news travels more quickly than truth on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is foolish, and defeatist, to say that today’s students have brain damage from using ChatGPT,” says Price, and it undermines the idea that “we can set things right at any time.” There’s plenty of genuine reasons not to use genAI without spreading falsehoods.</p><p>The fact that so much of social media is outrage, towards real or imagined slights, contributes to the&nbsp; everyday, grinding unpleasantness of how we use it; discourse cycles along with pile ons, doomposting, and so on aren’t the fault of individuals but instead symptoms of the same engagement-chasing platform designs that led to the defensive discourse around “friendslop.” They simply feel good—at least in the short term. But stewing in frustration, whether it be about a major news event or a made up genre term, only leads to a more negative experience in the long run. Even though platforms hook us in with the dopamine of easy outrage, taking a step back to double check whether something is entirely shadowboxing is still an option. So is just kicking back and enjoying a game of <em>Peak </em>with your friends.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lets-plays-sleep-youtube"><h3>Is Falling Asleep To Let’s Plays Medically Approved Gamer Melatonin Or Nah</h3></a><p>A gamer neurologist discusses whether YouTubers are onto something with this Millennial-meets-Gen-Z craze</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms"><h3>A Salute To The 13%</h3></a><p>Let them live a little</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse]]></content:encoded>
