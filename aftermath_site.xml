      <p>Toys? Sweaters? Those are gifts of Christmas Past. You should take a look around at the state of the world, at tariffs and shipping costs for material goods, and consider giving a gift that can be enjoyed by anyone on the planet, wherever they are and however they use the internet.</p><p>I'm of course talking about an Aftermath gift subscription, which can be purchased <a href="https://aftermath.site/gift-subscription/" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and will grant the lucky recipient a whole year of access at our 'Member' tier, which lets them read every blog, score an invite to our community Discord, unlocks merch discounts and even includes a link to their own full-text RSS feed of the site.</p><p>As an added bonus, the money spent on the subscription will also go toward supporting Aftermath's full-time staff, contributors and freelancers, allowing us to continue the access-free, no-bullshit work you've come to expect from a worker-owned, reader-supported website. </p><p><strong>Note 1</strong>: To have the subscription delivered on a specific day, make sure to select the desired 'Start Date' on the purchase form. You as the giver will be charged immediately upon purchase, but the recipient won't be notified (and their sub won't start) until the selected date. If the date is left as today's date, they'll be emailed (and their sub will begin) immediately. </p><p><strong>Note 2</strong>: Gift subs can't be purchased for readers with existing paid subscriptions because...our system already recognises them as paid subscribers. They can be <em>purchased </em>by anyone though, whether they're an existing subscriber or not.</p><div>
