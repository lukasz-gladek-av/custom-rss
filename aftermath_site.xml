      <p>Activision Blizzard is suing two alleged <em>Call of Duty</em> hack makers who—despite several cease-and-desists—won't stop making hacks, according to a new lawsuit. The company is also targeting the people who sell their hacking software. <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/995333407/Activision-Blizzard-Snitched-To-Hack-Maker-s-Mom?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Activision Blizzard filed a complaint in California</u></a> on Friday targeting the makers of two&nbsp; <em>Call of Duty</em> hacks called Zenith and Devware. The hackers, known online as Wolfy and Noziex, have sold more than 28,000 licenses for the Zenith hack since September 2025, according to Activision Blizzard's complaint.</p><p>Lawyers say the Zenith hack is responsible for a recent exploit that took down five <em>Call of Duty</em> servers in May. Zenith allows players to target enemies, see through walls to better locate enemy players, and access all in-game items. It also includes what Activision Blizzard's lawyers call a "rage" feature that lets the cheating player kick others from multiplayer servers—"or to crash Activision's dedicated multiplayer servers," write the lawyers, which happened in May. Activision Blizzard has been trying to stop the two hackers since 2023, sending several cease-and-desist letters to the hackers <em>and</em> by calling one of the hackers' mothers to alert her of her son's behavior.</p><p>Wolfy, whose real name is Julian Angel Valenzuela, and Noziex, who is called A.R. in the complaint because he's a minor, started working together in 2023 on an earlier version of Zenith called Devware. Devware was popular, lawyers say, because it gave players access to paid cosmetic items for free. They continued to add features to the Devware hack, including the ability to disconnect players. "In other words, by using the Devware Hack, mean-spirited players could harass others by causing them to lose their connection to the COD Games or cause their COD Games' software to crash or stop working," lawyers write. Not only does this kick players from matches, but the disconnected players can get punished for leaving games early.</p><p>Activision Blizzard lawyers say the two sold "tens or hundreds of thousands of copies" of the hack. Activision Blizzard sent its first cease-and-desist, according to the complaint, in 2024. Wolfy, in response, posted online that Activision Blizzard "can't stop me and I aint stopping." Noziex joked about making shirts of the cease-and-desist. They continued to sell hacks, Activision Blizzard lawyers say.</p><p>In June 2024, Activision Blizzard lawyers called Wolfy's mom and told her about her son's behavior online. Activision Blizzard counsel called again days later and spoke to someone who claimed to be a brother's friend, per the complaint. That day, Activision Blizzard's lawyers called the home again and spoke to the mother, "who claimed to have no memory of the conversation four days prior," lawyers wrote in the complaint. Wolfy shut down the Devware server shortly after, saying that he was complying with a cease-and-desist from Activision Blizzard.</p><p>But Activision Blizzard claims he did not stop selling hacks. The complaint claims that the two hackers pretended to sell the Devware Discord server to another company, which lawyers say was a "front"&nbsp; to start selling a new hack—the Zenith hacking software, which basically included the same features as the Devware hack. They partnered with hack resellers to sell the software, lawyers say. Websites linked in the complaint appear to be no longer active, but a version of the Zenith hack appears to sell for $50 for a three-month subscription on third-party cheating websites.&nbsp;</p><p>Activision Blizzard sent another cease-and-desist in March 2025, and Wolfy again posted online that he's not "providing any services related to Activision Publishing," per the complaint. Activision Blizzard's lawyers say nothing's changed in his behavior since then—and then there were the "two high-profile cyber-attacks which caused the multiplayer servers for <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</em>" to crash. Activision Blizzard's lawyers say Wolfy used Zenith to do those attacks. In November 2025, Activision Blizzard sent <em>another</em> cease-and-desist letter. He didn't respond, Activision Blizzard's lawyers say, and instead Wolfy posted online: "I AM BACK."</p><p>Activision Blizzard's lawyers say the hacking software has caused "loss of player revenues," and has forced the company to spend lots of time and money on taking on the hackers, banning users who use the software, and employing people to "police the games to detect the COD Hacks." The damage, lawyers say, is in the millions of dollars.</p><p>Lawyers are asking the court to force the two hackers to stop making hacking software, and for the resellers to stop selling them and to destroy the software. They're also looking for damages for trafficking in circumvention devices, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, intentional interference with contractual relations, and unfair competition.</p><p>In 2024, Activision <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/activision-awarded-14-5-million-in-call-of-duty-cheatmaker-suit?ref=aftermath.site"><u>won a $14.5 million judgement against the makers of a hack called EngineOwning</u></a>. The company is also suing 24-year-old Tennessee man Ryan Rothholz for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-25/call-of-duty-activision-blizzard-hacking-lawsuit?ref=aftermath.site"><u>his alleged role in creating the Lergware hacking software</u></a>. That case is ongoing; in February, the court denied Rothholz's motion to dismiss. </p>
