In a short statement posted to accompany the video below, DF say "We [now] answer to nobody but you, the audience. We are fully independent, we’re proud of that, we think it’s the future of games media". </p><div><figure><p><iframe title="DF Direct Special: Digital Foundry Leaves IGN, Now Fully Independent - So What Happens Next?" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tl7bIJ2yu4I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/merge-maestro-addictive-roguelite-ios-puzzle-game"><h3>Oh No, Merge Maestro Is Going To Be A Problem</h3></a><p>Merge Maestro is an addictive, deck builder that's easy to pick up and surprisingly complex.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I woke up this morning to a surprise: my colleague Riley MacLeod, having seen my excited social media posts yesterday (I got a new PC!),<a href="https://aftermath.site/pc-desk-floor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> had written a whole blog post about how I keep my PC on the floor</a>.<br></p><p>In a 600-word piece that is more an indictment on New York City than a commentary on my PC or its placement, Riley worries about two main factors potentially affecting my new purchase: cockroaches and dust,<a href="https://kotaku.com/console-repairmen-explain-why-cockroaches-love-ps4s-1794393470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> citing a 2018 Kotaku blog about roaches getting inside a PlayStation 4</a>.</p><p>I don't know how to tell you this Riley, aside from pointing at this company's needlessly complicated ownership and taxation situation thanks to its international composition, but I don't live in New York City, and this is not a PlayStation 4. I live in a <a href="https://region.com.au/canberrans-shiver-through-a-record-breaking-june-with-more-chilly-days-on-the-way/882396/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cold</a>, dry, Australian city that doesn't have a cockroach problem, and I live in a house where I vacuum the floor and keep a clean office. My last PC, which was kept in the exact same spot, only had to be properly dusted out <em>once </em>in its five-year lifespan. And it also had a glass side panel, meaning I could be kept very much up-to-speed on its dust situation!</p><p>Besides, leaving all that peripheral stuff aside...how the fuck am I supposed to keep this thing on my desk? It's huge, and would take up like 1/3 of my desk's usable free space, space I need for actual desk items like microphones, speakers, headphones, a mouse pad and my keyboard. It's also heavy, and even with its fancy case and modern fans, surprisingly noisy once you get really close to it. Which I would be if I sat it on my desk, right next to my <em>head</em>.</p><p>Riley ended his blog charitably, in a 'just asking questions' kinda way, asking people for their opinions on the matter. As someone for whom this wasn't even a question, not even the remotest possibility, something that never even once entered into my head when plugging it in, I'll do no such thing; if you keep your PC on your desk the only question I'll ask is <em>is everything OK?</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/digital-foundry-ign-ziff-davis-eurogamer-patreon"><h3>Good For Digital Foundry</h3></a><p>'We answer to nobody but you, the audience'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/merge-maestro-addictive-roguelite-ios-puzzle-game"><h3>Oh No, Merge Maestro Is Going To Be A Problem</h3></a><p>Merge Maestro is an addictive, deck builder that's easy to pick up and surprisingly complex.
