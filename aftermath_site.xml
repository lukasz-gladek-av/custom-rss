            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here at Aftermath, we only pick winners, as evidenced by our decision to become the first video game website ever (to our knowledge) to <a href="https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-mayor-nyc-adrew-cuomo-eric-adams-minecraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endorse a political candidate</a> in newly minted NYC Democratic mayor-in-waiting Zohran Mamdani. The pick was a no-brainer: He speaks his mind, he wants to make the city cheaper, and he <a href="https://x.com/PanasonicDX4500/status/1937982130178691098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">probably knows who Sephiroth is</a>. But, contrary to popular belief, he’s not our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/new-york-city-might-get-its-first-gamer-mayor-years-before-winning-the-democratic-primary-11-year-old-zohran-mamdani-had-his-heart-set-on-simcity-3000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>first</em></a><em> </em>gamer mayor. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we relay some unfortunate facts.</p><p>This time around, we celebrate Mamdani’s win by bringing on a whopping TWO guests: First, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxrn.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Max Rivlin-Nadler</a> joins us to talk about how <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hell Gate</a> – a fellow worker-owned publication – punched well above its weight during this election, <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/mayoralforum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">organizing a forum</a> that leading Democratic candidates (excluding Andrew Cuomo) showed up to and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFqqr2hmqZc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosting an election night livestream</a> that aired in bars across the city.&nbsp;</p><p>Then former Kotaku writer turned professional <em>Genshin Impact</em> advocate turned laid off person (hire them!) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/six6jiang.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sisi Jiang</a> comes on to share their experience knocking on over 1,000 doors for the Mamdani campaign – part of a wider canvassing effort that resulted in an unprecedented turnout for a leftist candidate. Lastly, using the <a href="https://x.com/souljagoyteller/status/1937816227692597617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scant information available</a>, we attempt to divine what kind of gamer Mamdani is.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can get Mamdani on the show, or at least pester his people until they let us ask him who he mains in <em>Super Smash Bros</em>.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Some people have been making the assertion that Zohran is going to be our gamer mayor, simply because of his age and because he knows what <em>FIFA </em>is. But I have really bad news: Unfortunately, our first gamer mayor – at least, in terms of policy – is Eric Adams, who did actually invest millions into gaming-related initiatives.&nbsp;</p><p>Those include a degree program in game making, regular student <em>Minecraft </em>tournaments that were about combatting climate change, and most recently the NYC Video Game Festival, which took place in May and kicked off the so-called “Summer Of Games,” which encompasses a bunch of events that have happened in previous years, but packages them all together as a New York City initiative. Regrettably, considering his many other sins, Eric Adams has been kinda good on this.</p><p><strong>Sisi:</strong> You know what? This is exactly what gamers deserve. We don’t deserve a good gamer mayor; we deserve Eric Adams, gamer mayor – the same mayor who said random shit like “All my haters are the waiters at my table of success.” That is the most gamer mayor behavior.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> But I don’t think he knows games. If you tried to ask him Mario lore, he’d be like “Well, he’s the king of the Mushroom Kingdom.” He’d know enough culturally to lie about it, but it would all be just slightly off. [You’d have to tell him] “Mario’s not the king of the Mushroom Kingdom. It’s a different guy.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Even just the other day, he <a href="https://aftermath.site/kai-cenat-eric-adams-nyc-fanum-nypd-giveaway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met up with Kai Cenat</a>, one of the most popular streamers on Twitch. When he entered the room, you can hear Eric Adams saying “I just want my video game,” and it’s like, did you think you were gonna get a video game out of meeting with a Twitch streamer? Are you making a joke? The context is not fully there, but it’s a very odd thing for him to say when walking to shake hands with Kai.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’d be funny if he knew who Kefka was, but he doesn’t know who Sephiroth is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-dlc-success-bonus"><h3>Bucking The Industry Trend Of Post-Launch Layoffs, Lies Of P Devs Received $7,500 Bonuses, Switch 2s</h3></a><p>"This bonus payout is both a celebration of that achievement and a significant turning point as the Lies of P franchise progresses to its next stage.”</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/drumeo-youtube-covers"><h3>YouTube Channel Drumeo’s Freestyle Drum Covers Make Me Want To Take My Shirt Off And Yell “Hell Yeah”</h3></a><p>You haven’t lived until you’ve heard this particular cover of Bring Me The Horizon’s “Can You Feel My Heart”
