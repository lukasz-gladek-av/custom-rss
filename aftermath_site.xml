      <p>When <em>Helldivers 2</em> first launched on PC, its installation size was a whopping 154GG. It is now, thanks to the magic of Going Back And Taking A Look At Things, a measly 23GB. Please, God, let this be the one good trend in video games for 2026.</p><p>Developer Arrowhead first announced plans to shrink the PC version's size down<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286?l=english&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>last month</u></a>, saying that 154GB figure was "roughly three times larger than the same game installed on consoles!" The reason given for this was that the team wanted to support older mechanical hard drives found on older PCs (all modern consoles have solid state drives), and so in order to give players with those HDDs a playable experience, they "duplicated" a bunch of assets like textures and sound effects, so that a mechanical hard drive didn't need to go reaching all over its surface area just to respond to what was happening at speed on the screen.</p><p>Which sounds wonderful in theory, but months of analytics post-release<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>have revealed</u></a> that not only are a small number of <em>Helldivers 2 </em>players actually using a mechanical HDD--around 11%--but that the pre-release industry standard figures Arrowhead used to make the decision to accommodate them in the first place were off.</p><p>They've found that it's the generation of levels causing the biggest slowdown, not the constant loading of assets, and that their projections for how slow HDD users were going to find things were also "very conservative". So a new "slim" version of the game is now being tested in a public beta (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371?ref=aftermath.site"><u>which you can join here</u></a>), clocking in at just 23GB, and this version--optimised for everyone--will only "result in minimal changes to load times - seconds at most".</p><p>I'm fascinated by this. We live in an age where video game studios and publishers <em>obsess </em>over metrics, yet these numbers were so wrong! And in fixing them, a major video game is going to free up so much precious space–<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/ssds/its-not-just-ram-ssds-could-soon-cost-way-more-too-and-its-all-downhill-from-here/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>something that could get very expensive soon</u></a>--that I can install at least 13 indie city-builders where those 131GB used to be!</p>

      <p>Earlier today, Humble followed in the hoofprints of <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-steam-santa-ragione-horses-ban/"><u>Steam</u></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/"><u>Epic</u></a> by yanking bafflingly controversial art game <em>Horses </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too?ref=aftermath.site"><u>from its digital shelves</u></a> – in this case after the storefront had already made it available for purchase. Now, mere hours later, Humble has relisted <em>Horses</em>.</p><p>IGN’s Rebekah Valentine <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/duckvalentine.bsky.social/post/3m74exeicds2c?ref=aftermath.site"><u>broke the news</u></a>, which was immediately met with a collective “Huh.” Aftermath reached out to Humble for more information but did not receive a reply as of this publishing.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking to Aftermath, Santa Ragione co-founder and director Pietro Righi Riva said that Humble temporarily pulled <em>Horses </em>to reevaluate it, but found no reason to set that decision in stone.</p><p>"In short, their team saw the press coverage and temporarily delisted <em>Horses </em>to reevaluate it," Riva said. "After a full review they determined that while the content is heavy, nothing in the game warrants removal from their store."</p><p>"We are grateful to Humble for having reconsidered and for taking the time to check out the game, although I wish they had informed us that this process was ongoing!" he added. "We are happy that it has been resolved with the game being back on the store, and we wish Steam and Epic would also reconsider their stance based on the actual game contents."</p><p><em>Horses</em>, which contains censored nudity and adult themes like sexual assault and slavery, remains banned on Steam and Epic. This despite the fact that it is far tamer than many widely distributed films and on level even with some popular games. Santa Ragione, the award-winning indie studio behind <em>Horses</em>, has categorized this sudden lack of access to PC gaming’s largest consumer bases as <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>an existential threat</u></a> and railed against what it describes as “preemptive censorship.” </p><p>Meanwhile, let’s have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jessenorris.xboxera.com/post/3m73zbtxusc2v?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a quick look at what else Steam is stocking these days</u></a> (warning: <strong>NSFW</strong>). Phew, no double standards here.</p><p><em>Horses </em>can be purchased on <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Itch</u></a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses?ref=aftermath.site"><u>GOG</u></a>, and now, once again, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Humble</u></a>.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/"><div><p>Horror Game Horses Removed From Epic Games Store, Too</p><p>Santa Ragione said Horses is now banned from both Steam and Epic Games Store, but available on GOG.</p><p><span>Nicole Carpenter</span></p></div></a></figure>
