            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-video-game-history-foundation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unless there’s imminently mineable gold in the hills of a remaster or re-release, the video game industry rarely displays interest in its own history. Last year, the Video Game History Foundation <a href="https://gamehistory.org/87percent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a study</a> showing that 87 percent of classic video games released in the US verge on inaccessible. That makes the archival work done by the VGHF all the more important, but the road to long-term preservation is full of potholes. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk to VGHF founder and director Frank Cifaldi about what those look like and <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how you can help</a>.</p><p>In an uncommon twist, Frank joins us near the end of the episode, because he had multiple other podcasts to be on the day we recorded (he’s very important). We discuss the unique needs of a video game archive – for example, remote access to games, something the US Copyright Office recently <a href="https://gamehistory.org/dmca-2024-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refused to grant</a> after a three-year effort on the part of the VGHF and the Software Preservation Network – and what the Foundation has been able to accomplish this year despite a government and industry that often fail to recognize the importance of its work.&nbsp;</p><p>Also on this episode: We (minus Frank) talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-studio-closure-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft’s decision to pull the plug on <em>XDefiant</em></a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/openai-future-chatgpt-pc-gamer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI’s increasingly money-hungry forays</a> into <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-chatgpt-pro-subscription/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subscriptions</a> (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/ads-might-be-coming-to-chatgpt-despite-sam-altman-not-being-a-fan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maybe ads</a>), and our various hyperfixations in <a href="https://aftermath.site/oh-no-i-bought-a-candy-cab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Candy Cabs</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-outlaws-review-impressions-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>. Oh, and speaking of hyperfixations, Chris says that New Year's resolutions are just an amateur hour version of a real project, so take that, me and everybody else.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can help preserve video game history via a format accessible to and beloved by all: blogs.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> As we reach the end of the year and people are reflecting on what they’ve done – and especially going into <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your funding drive</a> – what has the Video Game History Foundation accomplished this year? What have been your focuses, and what have you managed to achieve?</p><p><strong>Frank:</strong> This year has been a lot of building for the future internally, so not very interesting at the outset things. But the actual labor on this <a href="https://gamehistory.org/introducing-the-vghf-digital-library/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital library</a>, the actual building of the tools that do correct character recognition for magazines [has been a focus]. That one’s OCRAP, right Phil? What’s that stand for?</p><p><strong>VGHF library director Phil Salvador [off screen]:</strong> Optical Character Recognition For Archival Purposes.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That’s so good.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Frank:</strong> It talks to another tool called BUBSY. Something you overhear pretty often here are phrases like “Should we give BUBSY admin access?” and it’s an actual, real thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Building those tools out for our library launch has been a lot of our focus. But beyond that, I think the biggest public-facing thing is that we testified in front of the Copyright Office to try to lift copyright restrictions for libraries and archives to provide remote access to video games, which is something that is not legal to do in any scenario unless you have explicit copyright permission from the copyright holder. That didn’t end up going through. I don’t know if I want to rant publicly about my real thoughts about what went down there, but that’s kind of building off some other work we’ve done to raise awareness of preservation issues.</p><p>A lot of people saw a study we put out last year which was able to demonstrate that nine out of ten classic games are out of print. You can’t buy them. That’s something that I think any one of us here kind of inherently knew, but that the industry wasn’t acknowledging. The last time we tried to get a copyright exemption, [rightsholder groups] were able to successfully argue to the Copyright Office that the industry does a great job of keeping its history in print. So that’s why we did this study to be like “No, you don’t.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What did [the Entertainment Software Association and others associated with rightsholders] <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/can-an-online-library-of-classic-video-games-ever-be-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argue this time</a>? Now that the study is out there, how did they once again say “No, everything is fine”?</p><p><strong>Frank: </strong>The argument basically comes down to “We believe there will be market harm if people can play video games remotely through a library.” That people will stop buying video games because they can play some games for free.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> That’s a pretty insane argument, but OK.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The MS-DOS version of <em>Muppet Treasure Island</em> must be protected.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Otherwise I won’t buy the 18th <em>Skyrim </em>re-release.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Frank:</strong> Right, if they can play <em>Muppet Treasure Island</em>, they’re not gonna buy <em>Indiana Jones</em>.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Simple as that!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I was wondering about this in relation to other recent developments: I’m sure you saw that GOG is having to delist the <em>Warcraft </em>games because Blizzard put out their own remasters, but GOG said they’re still going to continue to update them to run on modern hardware [as part of <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/the-gog-preservation-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its Preservation Program</a>]. GOG is a store. Their number one goal is not to preserve history; it’s to make money. But do you think efforts like that still matter? Are they still important in the grand scheme of things?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Frank: </strong>I’ve been saying for a long time that there are many forms of preservation, and some of them can be commercial. I think there’s a cultural preservation element to re-releasing games, for example. That is a form of cultural preservation: keeping franchises in the public eye.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t think you meant to be reductive, but GOG has a commercial interest, of course, but it’s coming from a place of caring.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Oh yeah, they obviously care a lot.</p><p><strong>Frank: </strong>That said, this is the job of an archive. I would never trust a commercial entity for permanent preservation – or at least an attempt at permanent preservation. I’m really glad they’re doing it. It is a temporary solution for a real problem. I don’t believe that GOG lasts forever, whereas I think a well-funded archive might. And I’m not even necessarily saying ours; we’re not that well-funded yet.&nbsp;</p><p>But the point is, that is the job of a library and an archivist historically. Kind of going back to even the [ESA] thing – how the availability of old stuff for free would hurt the current market – I think we live in a world where if a library was a new idea, everyone would laugh it off.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Oh, definitely. They’d be like “That’s socialism!”</p><p><strong>Frank:</strong> Right, exactly. So it doesn’t surprise me that it’s a tremendous uphill battle to modernize the concept of a library. It makes a lot of sense to me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/akg-perception-p220-p420-mod-neumann-u87-clone<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As keen readers of the site may know, I cannot abide using a <a href="https://aftermath.site/dont-buy-a-yeti-mic-please-logitech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad microphone</a> when there are so many good mics that are plentiful. You can get a great sound out of something that costs less than $100 bucks, but when you dig deeper than that into the world of DIY, the value proposition gets more interesting. There’s a rich, gorgeous world out there of hand crafting microphones, but that is a daunting topic for another blog. Instead, I wanna tell you about a simple, 10 minute modification that takes a relatively inexpensive microphone and brings it shockingly close to one of the greatest microphones of all time: the Neumann U 87.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="AKG Perception 5 Minute u87 Clone Mod vs u87ai Comparison Will Surprise You" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EgVcD-3OVes?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A direct comparison between the modded AKG Perception vs. a real Neumann U 87 ai.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The mod in question comes from the depths of the GroupDIY forums – a go-to destination for DIY microphone information. Here you can unlock all sorts of information about who makes the best capsules, replica bodies from alibaba, and full replicas of older PCBS. This particular mod was originally pioneered by well-known tinkerer and poster kingkorg, who discovered in 2017 that if you take AKG Perception P220 (and to an extent, many other mics in the same line) and swap or add a single capacitor, you get very close to the legendary U 87.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="AKG Perception 420 / 220 Mod" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GmNyNM4rA_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A video walkthrough of how to modify the Perception. Note that the mod for the Perception 200/220 is slightly different than the Perception 400/420. </figcaption></figure></div><p>If you don’t know the Neumann U 87, it’s one of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumann_U_87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> most famous vocal microphones ever made</a>. It was introduced in 1967, going through various iterations. The current model, the U 87 Ai, goes for about $3,595, slightly less used. There are countless clones of it – tinkerers love to try to make them from scratch. The AKG Perception, on the other hand, costs about $140 new and far less used. The reason this mod works is that much of the AKG Perception line is a close replica of the U 87. The problem is that the microphone capsule, while quite good on its own, is slightly brighter than the one being cloned. This one capacitor mod fixes that. While it does not make the mic identical to the Neumann (there is more to mic design than a circuit, for example the body and <a href="https://groupdiy.com/threads/akg-perception-p220-to-neumann-u87-5-min-mod-p200-p100-p400-p420.67473/post-1099560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the headbasket</a>) it gets it very close for $140 plus one mouser or digikey order. In a direct shootout, it’s kinda shocking.</p><figure><figcaption>Kingkorg’s measurements of the P220 before and after modding. For the money, that's very close.

Basically you open up the mic, remove the stock 220pf stock capacitor, and swap in a 680pf capacitor (or 870pF for a sound closer to the u67). It can be done with either a cheap film capacitor, or something pricier like Wima FKP or MKP. Others had luck with 0805 NP0(C0G) surface mount capacitors. <a href="https://groupdiy.com/threads/akg-perception-p220-to-neumann-u87-5-min-mod-p200-p100-p400-p420.67473/post-1120655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">But you don’t need a fancy capacitor for it; any ceramic cap will do.</a></p><p>If you are a bit wary of desoldering, which is unquestionably the most annoying part of working on electronics, people in the thread report that you can simply <a href="https://groupdiy.com/threads/akg-perception-p220-to-neumann-u87-5-min-mod-p200-p100-p400-p420.67473/post-1045611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">add an additional 470pF capacitor in parallel</a> with the one already there, no desoldering required. This is what I actually ended up doing.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="AKG P420  - Modified!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZFwtcQ23OIM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Another satisfied customer.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Do I need a Neumann clone? Not particularly. I mainly use dynamic mics and have more than enough of those. But because the AKG Perception series is one of the best selling mic lines out there, and tons of them have entered circulation, I was able to score a beat up Perception 200 for $40 dollars on eBay. Secondary markets are lousy with these things, and it is a cheap way to experiment and pass the savings on to you, the Aftermath reader. What’s more, my good friends at the <a href="https://www.skulltenders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skulltenders podcast</a> needed a condenser mic, and were able to snag one. It worked so well that my friend who did the mod for them <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/emkultra64.bsky.social/post/3lcntvndwbk2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got one herself.</a></p><figure><figcaption>This is all&nbsp;I had to do to smooth this bad boy out. The P400/P420 has a slightly different layout but it's roughly the same idea.</figcaption></figure><p>Doing the mod was comically easy, at least for me. You open up the body of the mic by using a pair of pliers to unscrew the ring securing the shell. Once you open it up, everything is already there for you; no need to remove the boards, the capsule or even the headbasket. It was as simple as soldering a cheap 470 pF capacitor over the existing capacitor. It should be noted that the PCBs for the P200/P220 are slightly different from the P400/P420 and so the capacitor you need to solder over is in two different places depending on your model. Also, <a href="https://groupdiy.com/threads/akg-perception-p220-to-neumann-u87-5-min-mod-p200-p100-p400-p420.67473/#post-857101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not all mics in the Perception series appear to be compatible</a> (the Perception 120 is a different mic altogether, and the Perception 820 is a tube mic).&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="AKG Perception Series Comparison Shopping Guide" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkWP_ez319g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A comparison of the different mics from the AKG Perception line. Most of the mics have minor differences, although the AKG 120 and 820 are far different.</figcaption></figure></div><p>In a side-by-side comparison, the results blew me away. The hash tinniness of the mic that held back an otherwise great capsule is no longer present, instead exposing a rich low end. It turned an <a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/akg-perception-200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already well-liked microphone</a> into something I would be proud to give to any vocalist. Is it a Neumann? I don’t think so, and also I don’t have one for testing because I don’t have $3,595 burning a hole in my pocket. But it’s certainly worth the $40 dollars plus maybe $10 dollar bulk capacitor order, and definitely a good value given that one of the mics is 90 times more expensive than the other.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p>https://twitter.com/Papapishu/status/1865111084652261788</p><figcaption>My comparison between the two mics. You can also hear <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/post/3lcnuuv3iqk2m">the difference on Bluesky.</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Others in the thread agree. Five years after posting the thread on GroupDIY the creator of the mod, kingkorg, noted that, despite having access to genuine Neumanns, the friends he gave the modded Perception to <a href="https://groupdiy.com/threads/akg-perception-p220-to-neumann-u87-5-min-mod-p200-p100-p400-p420.67473/post-1109409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still return to it year after year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
