            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kotaku-layoffs-go-media<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>G/O Media, a network that owns websites but also knows nothing about running websites, has made further cuts at the already-beleaguered Kotaku, with a number of writers announcing today that they had been laid off.</p><p>Willa Rowe and Moises Taveras, two writers who only joined the site earlier this year, were abruptly laid off by management this afternoon. Also announcing their departure from Kotaku today, albeit on their own terms, was Senior Editor Alyssa Mercante,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alyssamerc.bsky.social/post/3laevatgogi2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> who posted</a> that after two years at the site she was moving on.</p><p>The layoffs and the departure of Mercante leave Kotaku with just six full-time staff, including an Editor-in-Chief who only joined a few months ago<a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> after his predecessor resigned in protest over G/O Media's management of the site</a>. They follow several rounds of layoffs to have already taken place in 2024, affecting both editorial staff and writers.</p><p>"G/O Media’s management is once again punishing workers for its own bad decisions", Managing Editor Carolyn Petit<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/carolynmichelle.bsky.social/post/3laexmv7nl62g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> wrote</a> on Bluesky. "Management mandated that some writers stick to ‘service’ posts, and now that the numbers aren’t panning out (surprise, surprise!), two of those writers have been laid off. Cruel and misguided."</p><p>Kotaku is one of the last remaining websites in G/O Media's portfolio, following the recent sale of everything from <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/the-onion-sold-global-tetrahedron-1235982383/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Onion</a> to <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/media-deals/2024/10/21/jalopnik-cars-acquisition-static" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jalopnik</a> to<a href="https://deadspin.com/the-adults-in-the-room-1837487584/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> whatever was left of Deadspin</a>. Its masthead is now down to just a handful of writers and editors, with much of the site's service work now being handed off to freelancers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/take-two-interactive-strauss-zelnick-ftc-grand-theft-auto<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week, <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> publisher Take-Two – whose CEO, Strauss Zelnick, six months ago <a href="https://aftermath.site/take-two-zelnick-layoffs-roll7-intercept" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied closing two studios</a> for what could best be described as no apparent reason – confirmed that it closed those two studios. <em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em> developer Intercept Games and <em>Rollerdrome </em>creator <a href="https://aftermath.site/kerbal-space-program-2-olliolli-rollerdrome-roll7-take-two" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roll7</a> Studios <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-on-private-division-sale-those-projects-were-smaller-were-in-the-business-of-big-hits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are no more</a>. This follows new financial results in which Take-Two also announced the sale of its indie-focused Private Division label to an undisclosed buyer. Anyway, you will not be surprised to learn that Zelnick is thrilled that Trump just got reelected.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-sells-tales-of-the-shire-developer-private-division-strauss-zelnick-on-trump-election-1236202964/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Variety</a>, Zelnick, whose management company <a href="https://www.dealpointdata.com/corp/docf/000130/000130817924000655/index1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> $43,742,000 in fees and stock options from Take-Two this fiscal year, said he anticipates a “more sensible” Federal Trade Commission under incoming President/fascist cosplayer Donald Trump.</p><p>"I think that the President-elect has made it very plain that he believes in reducing regulation,” Zelnick said. “I do believe that the FTC was misguided during President Biden’s term, and I do think that the FTC tried to impede some transactions that were beneficial for both the companies in question and the economy at large, and the FTC lost all those cases since. So I do think that, depending on what the specific topic is, deregulation can be a positive, and I am certainly looking forward to [a] more sensible FTC.”</p><p>That’s one way of putting it. Another might be “a toothless FTC,” or a return to a status quo that allowed gargantuan mergers to soar through unimpeded. Under FTC chair Lina Khan, nominated by Biden in 2021, the regulatory body fought to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/ftc-announces-rule-banning-noncompetes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ban non-compete clauses</a>, launched <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/ftc-sues-amazon-illegally-maintaining-monopoly-power" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lawsuit against Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-sues-prescription-drug-middlemen-artificially-inflating-insulin-drug-prices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued healthcare companies</a> engaging in sketchy behavior, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-18/biden-antitrust-enforcers-set-new-record-for-merger-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blocked a record number of mergers</a> in an attempt to stem the tide of monopoly power in the United States.</p><p>One such merger – which eventually went through – was Microsoft’s $68.7 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard, which the FTC argued could harm consumers by substantially lessening competition in the gaming space. Regulatory scrutiny from both the FTC and the European Commission forced Microsoft to make several concessions, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23915780/ubisoft-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cloud-gaming-rights-deal-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a cloud gaming deal with Ubisoft</a>. The FTC has since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/18/24201576/ftc-microsoft-xbox-game-pass-price-increases-standard-tier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">challenged</a> Microsoft on its <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mass layoff of 1,900 employees in early 2024</a> and Game Pass’ <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horrible, convoluted pricing schemes</a>.</p><p>I doubt Zelnick is the only video game CEO – or any kind of CEO – who is excited to return to the days when stuff like this rarely happened. I’m sure they will all wield this newfound lack of oversight responsibly and definitely not send <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the rot economy</a>, already a slippery slope of sludge, into overdrive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
