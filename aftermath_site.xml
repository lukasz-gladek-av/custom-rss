            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/parrying-bad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Long before parrying became the topic of the day thanks to <em>Clair Obscur</em>, I was a firm believer in a truth many of you are just now discovering: parrying is bad, and video games should stop having it.</p><p>And look: I get that I’m known on this site for <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-hate-double-jump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unpopular opinions</a> about <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved mechanics</a>, but with anti-parry sentiment at an all-time high, you might be feeling more open to my point of view. Many haters of <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s parry system are coming from the pro-parry camp, taking umbrage with the timing or animations compared to other games. But rather than filling your head with <em>more</em> parry thoughts, rather than ranking games with some unnecessary rubric, rather than playing armchair developer to Sandfall and getting into arguments on Steam forums, you could join a righteous cause (mine) and free yourself from this problem altogether.</p><p>Parrying in video games sucks. It features in <a href="https://gamerant.com/soulslike-games-best-parry-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many games</a> with hand-to-hand combat, giving you the opportunity to deflect an enemy’s attack and, unlike a dodge that just keeps you from taking damage, knock an enemy off-balance or do some damage of your own. I can see why the promise of the parry is appealing, but think about the reality: It is precise and finicky, relying on an audio cue or narrow timing window to perform successfully. If you’re in a hectic combat situation, you already have enough to pay attention to.</p><p>I won’t hide the fact that my stance is informed by the fact that I am terrible at parrying. But I would argue this is not my fault. In real life, I briefly took a fencing class in college, so I understand the <em>concept</em> of what it is to parry, and it is an action I have pulled off with variable success in the physical world. But, whatever the boosters might say, I don’t think this action translates well to video games. In third-person games like <em>Clair Obscur</em>, it can be hard to understand when precisely you should parry; these kinds of games have to give you wind-ups and clues to help you know when to enter into their simulation of objects moving through space. Parrying is inherently a first-person activity; if you are seeing it in third-person it means you’re not part of the parrying situation, and as such have no need to know when someone should parry. Mind your own business!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In first-person games, like my <a href="https://aftermath.site/stealth-game-no-detection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved</a> <em>Dishonored</em> and its betrayal via parry inclusion, the sort of calculations you’d do in the physical world are functionally impossible when ported to the virtual. In real life, you inherently sort of <em>know </em>how to work with the length of a sword, how fast it’s moving, how long your own sword is, and how far away you are. The oft-overlooked miracle that is moving your body through space is just <em>what bodies do in space</em>; when you remove the bodies and the space, the whole concept basically falls apart. Video games have to turn parrying into an animation that must be entered into correctly; they have to introduce all those clues you’re required to parse, turning the whole thing into some kind of cruel rhythm game, because there is no way to recreate actual parrying. You lose the spontaneity, the freedom, the responsiveness imparted to you as a bonus gift for having a human body. And you then use that human body to fumble through some cruel shadow of “parrying” with your fingers, cheapening not just the idea of the parry, but the full potential of your human form.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When discussing my stance with my Aftermath colleagues, the conversation quickly devolved into points about iframes and hit boxes; i.e., shit for sickos. Do you want to be a sicko? Do you want to have to not just learn about but <em>care about</em> ticky-tacky coder stuff when you are just a person trying to play a video game? Any mechanic that requires a fine appreciation of code is not a mechanic for the people; it is an exercise in exclusion and elitism. Are those your values? Is that the side of history you want to stand on?</p><p>You don’t need any of this shit. Even if you aren’t like me, a man who doesn’t care for the finer points of video game combat and just wants to look at cool monsters while mashing buttons, surely you must recognize that video game combat is sufficient without the addition of the hateful parry. Consider the <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/compare/MAT.6.28-33#:~:text=Matthew%206%3A28%2D33%20New,arrayed%20like%20one%20of%20these." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lilies of the field</a> and be satisfied with what you have. Acknowledge the abundance already before you. Simplify your life. Reject the parry.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-good"><h3>Parrying Is The Best Thing In Video Games</h3></a><p>Everybody’s gangsta until somebody parries your bullshit</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/doom-bathroom-renovation-something-awful-for-sale"><h3>Please Know That The House With The Doom Bathroom Is For Sale</h3></a><p>Calling it a 'uniquely remodeled home' seems like an understatement</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hockey-stickhandling-video-game-dangleverse"><h3>This Video Game Is Also a Hockey Training Tool</h3></a><p>Dangleverse, which I've been using to practice hockey off the rink, is in beta right now</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/parrying-good<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gaming, much like life, offers a range of responses to sticky situations, especially in action games. Whether it’s an boss slowly walking toward you or a fighting game rival ready to signal the choir to “<a href="https://youtu.be/GqM_-p_wK_U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">somebody’s getting fucked</a>,” players typically face three choices: freeze — staying locked in place eating shit until their foe drops a combo; flight — playing footsies, creating distance, and reassessing a smarter angle of attack; or fight, meeting the challenge head-on, pressing buttons, and praying you get a couple good hits in edgewise. But there’s a hidden fourth response — fawning, the art of appeasing stress to sidestep conflict, where you play the role of the immovable object to an unstoppable force. You don’t flinch, you don’t dodge, you don’t flee. You stand firm, nullifying attacks with pure precision, proving that you can see through your adversaries' nonsense and that countering it is light work for you. In my twisted mind, this response is the quintessential instinct behind parrying, the ultimate flex in video games.</p><p>Parrying is one, if not the, most satisfying mechanics in video games. Unlike its more reserved cousin, the block, parrying is the golden child of combat-oriented games—the one who earns a spot at the adults’ table at family get-togethers, gets their cheek lovingly pinched by grandma as she dotes on her favorite little pookie bear whenever it recounts moments where it took a high-risk gamble that paid off thanks to its uncanny ability to turn defence into dominance.&nbsp;</p><p>Parrying is my favorite thing in gaming. Although it may not be the safest option in battle, it yields the greatest reward by willingly putting yourself in harm's way and coming out the other end unscathed. The only thing dashed against the rocks in the wake of a well-timed parry is your opponent’s pride.&nbsp;</p><p>As the parry-er, the mechanic is one of the most empowering elements you can earn in gaming. It’s an art that proves your ability to get the proverbial camel through the eye of a needle, shutting down an enemy’s offense before it starts. In the most Pavlovian sense, games like <a href="https://youtu.be/8NqX3Kj6qec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> reinforce a successful parry with a sharp, satisfying clang. This soundbite, like the high-pitch ding of a headshot in a shooter, is like the game patting you on the head for being the smartest (and most disrespectful) player in the room. Congrats, you just effortlessly batted that attack away like it’s nothing. Your dick is huge.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="RULES OF NATURE" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WM33Hr94SKw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Games hold up their end of the deal by rewarding this mastery of fisticuffs. A well-timed parry can leave an opponent wide open for an all-out assault, like <a href="https://youtu.be/QkWa-hxv3A4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tekken 8</em>’s universal low parry</a>. It can also signal fun times ahead, serving as a flashy preamble to bombastic games like <a href="https://youtu.be/q2MHp6_SSMs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</em></a>, a great equalizer in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/563522/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-ps5-pc-xbox#comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>, a <a href="https://youtu.be/R2Lboca6KUQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">damage multiplier in<em> Sea of Stars</em></a>, or even the only path to victory in games like <a href="https://youtu.be/R2Lboca6KUQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Battle Fantasia</em></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Parries are so quintessential to an action game’s depth that they’ve become a staple across the genre. While not all parries are made the same, many have narrow timing windows, with high scrutiny for what counts as a parry. Some games introduce the elusive perfect parry, which completely dismantles an enemy with a devastating stun effect by countering at the very last second. Games like <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> act as an ideal introduction to the killer mechanic, weaving parrying into its rhythmic gameplay to help players intuitively grasp the timing. This instinct naturally develops over time. Parrying is almost like using The Force, but instead of blindly firing into the Death Star, you’re tapping into the rhythm of an enemy’s attacks, finding the perfect beat to cut in, and executing a devastating counter, turning defence into a dominant dance of health-bar draining syncopation.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ICONIC Esports Moments: EVO Moment 37 - &quot;The Daigo Parry&quot; (Street Fighter)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/klaWV-szmnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Witnessing a parry is just as hype as executing one. Case in point: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzS96auqau0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evo moment #37</a>—the legendary fighting game showdown where Daigo pulled off an almost impossible comeback against Justin Wong in <em>Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike</em>. Instead of holding back and blocking, which would have led to inevitable chip damage and defeat, Daigo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzS96auqau0&amp;pp=ygUNZXZvIG1vbWVudCAzNw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parried every hit from Chun-Li’s super</a>, Houyoku-Sen, with surgical precision. Fifteen strikes on the ground and mid-air nullified in the FGC’s most remarkable display of a player hard reading their opponent in the clutch, creating the perfect opening to punish and steal victory from the jaws of defeat.</p><p>One of my absolute favorite parries in games is <a href="https://youtu.be/NnkDgq_E1qQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kiryu Kazuma’s Tiger Drop</a> in the <em>Yakuza</em>/<em>Like a Dragon</em> series. Tiger Drop is so absurdly powerful that the subsequent titles use it as the carrot on the stick as one of the final items in its skill tree, with flavor text that casually reminds players that it negates all damage. A fact made even funnier when you remember Kiryu patented it in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mc_hQr-2sk&amp;pp=ygUOa2lyeXUgdnMgdGlnZXI%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fight against two tigers</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dante VS Vergil DMD SSS motivation" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p79oSkNMhIY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>And then there’s Dante’s <a href="https://devilmaycry.fandom.com/wiki/Royalguard_Style#Devil_May_Cry_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">royalguard</a>, a technique that teeters between being a block and a parry (but we’ll count it). The <em>Devil May Cry</em> wahoo pizza man builds up negated damage with a calm, kung fu stance before detonating it straight back onto his enemies. In the manga, Dante himself admits to hating the move, saying its busted style robs him of the joy of testing out his flashy rolodex of weapons and fighting styles in his arsenal. But in battle, it’s the ultimate “nuh uh,” capable of <a href="https://youtu.be/ShFPq_eDS7U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ending a boss fight before it even begins</a>.</p><p>Parrying is the ultimate risk-reward gamble, a mechanic that adds an irresistible layer of challenge to action games. It’s the moment where the player stops being the hunted, flips the script, standing ten toes down against the storm and seizing control. With perfect timing, the player orchestrates the flow of combat, shifting momentum in their favor like a benevolent hand tipping the scales of battle. Parrying is challenging to master, but then again, nothing as euphorically gratifying ever comes easy.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/doom-bathroom-renovation-something-awful-for-sale"><h3>Please Know That The House With The Doom Bathroom Is For Sale</h3></a><p>Calling it a 'uniquely remodeled home' seems like an understatement</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hockey-stickhandling-video-game-dangleverse"><h3>This Video Game Is Also a Hockey Training Tool</h3></a><p>Dangleverse, which I've been using to practice hockey off the rink, is in beta right now</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
