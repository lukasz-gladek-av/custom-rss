            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Last Friday evening, despite the bitter cold, around 50 people gathered outside <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> developer Rockstar’s office in Manhattan to protest <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-union-protest-rockstar/"><u>the October firing of 34 workers in the UK and Scotland</u></a> who had engaged in union organizing activity. Chants like “Steal lambos, not wages” were accompanied by signs that read “No workers, no <em>GTA</em>” and “Bad boss = bad game.”&nbsp;</p><p>The protest was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/techworkerscoalition.org/post/3m7bkgt7d5s2w?ref=aftermath.site"><u>put on by the Tech Workers Coalition</u></a>, a labor rights group with chapters around the US. Gershom (who declined to share his last name), a developer with the Tech Workers Coalition, told Aftermath that the goal of the protest was to keep pressure on Rockstar and show support for fired workers as they head into a UK court hearing this week.</p><p>"We're connected with the Rockstar workers in the UK who were fired, and they asked us to help organize international solidarity actions to show Rockstar that it can't hide attacks on workers in one country anywhere else,” Gershom said. “We want to take it to the New York offices and show [the bosses] that no matter where they are, we're gonna be here letting people know what they're doing to their workers and letting their customers know what they're doing to their workers."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The crowd was largely made up of members from supportive organizations like the Democratic Socialists Of America (DSA) and unions like Industrial Workers Of The World (IWW), United Auto Workers (UAW), and Communications Workers Of America (CWA), the latter of which has played a pivotal role in <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-unions-microsoft-layoffs-mmo-elder-scrolls/"><u>unionizing thousands of workers across Microsoft</u></a>. Independent Workers’ Union Of Great Britain (IWGB) – which is helping Rockstar workers organize and, now, <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-union-protest-rockstar/"><u>pursue legal action against Rockstar</u></a> – did not have a presence, as it is predominantly based in the UK.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>"It's important that we stand against all of those threats as a single workers' movement."</blockquote><p>"I was available, so I came," Marcin, a member of IWW, told Aftermath. "I always knew that Rockstar was not a very good company in terms of treating their workers [well], but goddamn. The whole gaming industry, the working conditions are very toxic. Crunch culture ... is in my opinion inhumane and quite abusive. I don't think anybody should be treated that way."</p><p>Tech workers from companies like Google and Meta marched alongside grad workers from Columbia University.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Employers across industries right now are firing people without cause, whether that's due to manufactured austerity crises or in response to organizing – or some combination,” Johanna, a member of Student Workers Of Columbia-UAW who said she was fired for organizing earlier this year, told Aftermath. “And it's important that we stand against all of those threats as a single workers' movement. … It's a cliche, but what happens to one of us happens to all of us."</p><p>Others in attendance could attest to the effectiveness of unions banding together. Dannel Jurado, a member, steward, and collective bargaining committee member of Kickstarter United – which just <a href="https://www.opeiulocal153.org/news/kickstarter-united-nyc-opeiu-153-declares-victory-and-ends-40-day-strike?ref=aftermath.site"><u>ended a 42-day strike</u></a> after securing an escalating minimum salary floor tied to cost of living and a codified 32-hour, 4-day workweek, among other things – told Aftermath that a “pay it forward” mentality informed his decision to join the Rockstar protest.</p><p>"It was really heartening to see folks come out from Starbucks – who are clearly on strike – and CODE-CWA, especially the Google folks and the <a href="https://aftermath.site/times-tech-guild-strike-wordle/"><u>New York Times Tech Guild</u></a> folks,” Jurado said of Kickstarter’s strike. “We saw people come out from RA unions; we have in our local a bunch of RA unions who really came out in support of us. Student groups as well. We saw teamsters come out. Amazon labor folks."</p><p>"Today's the day we ratified our second contract we went on strike for,” he continued. “In a discussion during that meeting, we told each other 'We can't shut up about this. We can't shut up about our contract, about how union solidarity gets the goods.' It's a big deal for us to be out here because we saw that when we were trying to organize strike rallies across the country – which we did successfully in Boston, New York, and Seattle – we saw folks who came out just to support us. Every single person counts, whether they knew what our message was or not."</p><p>Game developers, however, were few and far between at the protest, which according to Gershom came together at the last second and largely drew on established connections between tech workers and unions, as opposed to NYC’s local game dev scene.&nbsp;</p><p>“What we're all out here to do is help give those workers support,” said Gershom. “They asked us to do this earlier than we would have otherwise, because it's not just about bad publicity. They're gonna be walking into court there in Britain. They want to be able to know and see photos all around the world of people standing there with them.”</p><p>After the protest, organizers and others in attendance spoke of hypothetical links that had yet to be hammered into the chain: For example, major motion picture guilds like SAG-AFTRA and IATSE have every reason to support Rockstar workers considering how much Hollywood talent Rockstar’s games draw on. One SAG member was in attendance, Sarah Elmaleh – negotiating chair on <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-deal/"><u>the union’s recent, voice actor strike-ending interactive media agreement</u></a> – but of her own accord as opposed to in any official capacity.</p><p>"I was [in town] for the holidays, and I was like 'Oh shit, maybe I can go help,'" Elmaleh told Aftermath. "I know that some of [the fired Rockstar workers] have been at this company longer than I've been doing voiceover, and that's a long time. So it seems very clear to me that they know how to take care of their company's information, and they love what they do and they want to make this game. Every union that's not quite started up yet is vulnerable, and they deserve other folks who've enjoyed long-term benefits and protections from that right to stand up and support their right to do that."</p><blockquote>"It seems very clear to me that [Rockstar workers] know how to take care of their company's information, and they love what they do and they want to make this game."</blockquote><p>As evidenced by both the nascent state of unions in the video game industry and the relative lack of game worker presence at a demonstration ostensibly dedicated to game workers, organizing is a long, sometimes diffuse process. But even where a series about stealing cars and going really, really fast is concerned, slow and steady wins the race.</p><p>"There's a difference between developers and performers, but we're both game workers,” said Elmaleh. “We both work on games. Breaking down that boundary is really important to us understanding the conditions we both work under to support each other in light of that. … It can be scary when you're doing something like this, and bodies and support and voices make you feel less alone and make you less vulnerable to being picked off. It's really crucial that we do this together. That's time tested." </p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-union-protest-rockstar/"><div><p>Following Firings And Grand Theft Auto VI Delay, Union Plans To Keep Pressure On Rockstar</p><p>“When companies do something like this, you can’t just slink away and hide anymore”</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>After months of meaning to get around to it, I finally pulled the plug on my Spotify subscription last week. There wasn't any one reason I wanted out, just an ever-growing collection of back-breaking straws:<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-12/spotify-boycott-daniel-ek-ai-music-military-tech-fenn-wilson/105765846?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>the CEO's support of genocide</u></a> was a big one, but you can throw in everything from its<a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/a-complete-guide-to-quitting-spotify?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>poor artist pay</u></a> to layoffs to, well,<a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ex-spotify-employee-exposes-wrapped-decay-2400-human-storytellers-replaced-cold-ai-logic-1760414?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>the fact the whole company just seems pretty terrible</u></a>.</p><p>A major factor in delaying the decision wasn't because none of that mattered to me--it all did!--but because having used various streaming services for almost 15 years now, changing them felt like work that I just didn't have time for. I had so many playlists and liked songs and albums to move, and the last time I'd done this--when I'd left Google Play Music for Spotify,<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/10/rip-google-play-music-2011-2020/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>after the former rebranded to YouTube Music and became a worse service in the process</u></a>--it had been a disaster, involving a ton of messing around and a ton of lost music.</p><figure><blockquote>

</blockquote>
</figure><p>But every man has his limits, and so last week–<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/03/spotify-wrapped-ai-create-your-own-playlists?ref=aftermath.site"><u>maybe it was just seeing everyone talking about their Spotify Wrapped, which sucks</u></a>--I finally pulled the pin, remembering it was just the latest in a succession of moves in my life where I've tried, however I can, to start putting my money where my mouth is. In the last couple of years I've installed solar on my roof, I've moved both my banking and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superannuation_in_Australia?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>superannuation</u></a><u> </u>(which is roughly an Australian 401K) to more<a href="https://www.bankaust.com.au/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>responsible</u></a><a href="https://www.australianethical.com.au/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>providers</u></a> and sold two gas-powered cars to buy a single electric vehicle. If I could do all <em>that</em>, I could move a fucking music service.</p><p>The act of cancelling my Spotify subscription itself was the easy part; the only speedbump ended up being the fact that, having been on an all-encompassing family plan, my daughter (who uses it as a kind of social media platform with her friends, exchanging playlists, etc) didn't want to budge. So we got her an individual membership and cut her loose from our plans; I'm not the kind of parent who is going to force my kids to go along with an ideological decision they can't fully grasp, so she can make the call on her own time as she gets older and, hopefully, a bit wiser.</p><blockquote>I found myself not looking for the best streaming platform, just trying to find the least worst. </blockquote><p>The hard part was choosing what to replace it with. Especially since I had some pretty stringent requirements. Spotify had worked for everyone, everywhere, so its successor needed to factor in that it was going to be providing music for me, my wife and my 12 year-old son, all of whom had different use cases. I have a Pixel, my wife has an iPhone, I listen to music on my desktop PC a lot, she prefers the kitchen speaker, I listen to a lot of music that might not be in every service's library and she doesn't, and our car runs on Google's Android Automotive, which has a limited selection of native music apps.</p><p>Given that last point, our first stop was YouTube Music. As YouTube Premium subscribers--you have to watch so many videos in this line of work that if I had to sit through ads I'd have lost years of my life--I already had access to YouTube Music, and it was also installed on my car. I quickly found that in the five years since I'd stopped using it little had changed: the app sucked shit, and the music quality was even worse, so it was almost instantly struck off the list.</p><p>Next was, uh, hrm.<a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/a-complete-guide-to-quitting-spotify?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>I'd read through Brian Merchant's excellent guide to cancelling Spotify earlier in the week</u></a>, and had also put out a call on social media for replacement suggestions, so had more than a few options to consider, but all of them seemed deeply compromised in some way. I just wasn't feeling Deezer, Amazon Music can go to hell and Tidal, while doing some things I liked (like paying artists more, and offering welcome sound quality options) had an app design and sharing features that just didn't sell me on it either.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:nhqvuggd6ebasluetrqfab6n/app.bsky.feed.post/3m74by6hv5s23" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreifrs32ex4jnxq4bm22bmjw5pyfsxdrht6pibrkl4djujh6r7pbqpe"><p lang="en">been shopping for a spotify alternative this week and this is grim stuff. its either volatile small guys who will be dead or bought out in 18 months or trying to decide which major tech platform you hate the least</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:nhqvuggd6ebasluetrqfab6n?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Luke Plunkett (@lukeplunkett.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:nhqvuggd6ebasluetrqfab6n/post/3m74by6hv5s23?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-12-03T20:23:29.531Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>It felt like every platform I was considering was either owned by the worst people on Earth, run by the worst people on Earth, looked like they weren't going to be around much longer or had huge holes in their offering that made them substantially less useful to me having just come off Spotify's ubiquity. Free of a contract and only now surveying the music streaming landscape in its entirety like this, it was bleak! This is what we've come to, this is the point these platforms and the economy driving them have led us to, a point where I found myself not looking for the best streaming platform, just trying to find the least worst.</p><p>Things seemed so bad that I considered making the next logical jump altogether, which was ditching streaming entirely. Maybe I could just start running a media server, put all my Bandcamp purchases and rips on there and go back to how I listened to music in 2007. If I was really worried about principles, I'd realise streaming as a concept is inherently fucked, that even in best-case scenarios it's all exploitative to artists, and that I needed to cut that cord completely.</p><p>But I am an imperfect man confronting a difficult situation: my whole family is now hooked on the convenience, on the recommendations and new release updates and playlist algorithms. Even if I could bring myself to make the break, there's little chance I'd be able to convince my wife and son to start screwing around with a media server and plugging a thumb drive into one of our car's USB slots.</p><p>So, streaming platforms it was.</p><p>Taking price, cross-platform compatibility, family plans, sound quality, artist pay, company ownership and user experience into account, and excluding the platforms I'd already dabbled in and struck off the list, I ended up with two services to pit against each other for my money: Apple Music and Qobuz.</p><p>Qobuz seemed great on paper! The folks there seem to genuinely care about music and artists in a way no other service (aside from maybe Tidal) do, and on average they paid artists <em>way </em>more than Spotify. But man, in AUD terms their pricing for their top tier (the one I was interested in) was <em>steep</em>. I realise the hypocrisy here of<a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/"> <u>someone who regularly begs for money on the internet saying this</u></a>, someone who fully understands you can't pay other people properly unless you yourself are paid properly, but the AUD$37.49 per month Qobuz were asking for was just too much when I've already got that YouTube Premium subscription (and my daughter's Spotify) on the books. I also thought the mobile app, where I'd be using it a <em>lot</em>, wasn't great.</p><p>Which left me with one last option to try out: Apple Music. The cons here were enough to give me pause: my personal devices are almost all Google-based, there was no native car support (though there wasn't for Qobuz either), no podcast support within the same app and Apple, while not as genocide-friendly as Spotify, were still run by a guy who has<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/16/silicon-valley-ceo-trump-business-00564524?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>repeatedly embarrassed himself bending the knee</u></a>.</p><p>The pros were that Apple paid artists twice as much as Spotify, offered some lovely high-quality formats and the design of their app is lightyears ahead of the competition. So I took the plunge, installed it on a bunch of devices, kicked off a family plan and so far, so good.</p><p>The lossless audio sounds incredible on my car's sound system (even if I have to plug in my phone and use Android Auto to enjoy it). I love the desktop app, and the mobile app is beautiful. In a very Apple way everything is simple, clear and just <em>works</em>. Compared to YouTube Music's woes and Spotify's bloat, it's been a genuine pleasure opening up Apple Music and just...playing some music.</p><p>The best part though, and this would apply to anyone moving to or from any major platform these days, is that in the years since my last transition the process of transplanting your library has gotten a lot easier. I paid $5 for a one-month Soundiiz membership, hooked it up to both platforms and within 10 minutes I had copied my whole library over–albums, playlists, the works. My music collection in Apple Music now looks exactly like it did on Spotify without skipping a beat.</p><p>Actually that's not quite true; my library had been <em>improved </em>a little, with two of my favourite albums of all time now back in my collection (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/20/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie-interview-leaving-spotify-free-music?ref=aftermath.site"><u>King Gizzard had pulled both <em>Infest The Rat's Nest</em> and <em>PetroDragonic Apocalypse</em> in protest over Spotify's military investments</u></a>).</p><figure></figure><p>The whole experience ended up being much more painless on a technical level than I'd been expecting, but then, it had also wound up being more depressing than I'd bargained for. It feels like my move to Apple Music isn't the permanent one I'd been hoping for; it's more convenient at the moment, but it's far from a perfect situation. I know, in my heart, that I need to go back to just buying music off artists, ditching convenience for something that actually helps the people making the music I love so much.</p><p>The problem is that, like so many other things that are easy and ruinous in our lives at the moment--Netflix, Game Pass, etc--it's just too easy. I can't give up hours-long feeds of lo-fi electronic music while I work at my desk, or the luxury of being able to skip through entire artist catalogues in my car whenever the fancy takes me. Even though I've now made a slightly more palatable decision on where to spend my money, I am still part of the problem.</p><figure><a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/a-complete-guide-to-quitting-spotify?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>How to quit Spotify</p><p>This Black Friday, here’s a guide to finding the best Spotify alternative</p><p><span>Brian Merchant</span></p></div></a></figure>
