      <p>I may have just been reminded to<a href="https://aftermath.site/master-commander-total-war-rts-strategy/"> <u>never judge a book by its cover</u></a>, but sometimes the cover is so bad that I can't help it.</p><p>A few years back EA Sports and FIFA, who had collaborated for decades on the globe-conquering <em>FIFA </em>series of video games, split. EA now makes its own series, <em>EA Sports FC</em>, and FIFA--when not engaging in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:FIFA_controversies?ref=aftermath.site"><u>blatant corruption and cronyism</u></a> with <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2026/02/02/infantino-trump-s-compliant-underling-in-the-lead-up-to-the-2026-world-cup_6750030_23.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>some of the worst people on Earth</u></a>--had to find a new partner if they wanted to make some money in the video game space (which they do, all FIFA cares about is making money, see earlier comments).</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/medieval-iii-total-war-fifa-netflix-delphi-announce/"><div><p>I’m Taking It As A Bad Sign That Two Big Games Were Announced With No Screenshots</p><p>One game overthought it, the other knew exactly what it was doing</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><p>Late last year, it was announced they'd found one! As <a href="https://aftermath.site/medieval-iii-total-war-fifa-netflix-delphi-announce/" rel="noreferrer">I said in December</a>:</p><blockquote>Earlier today Netflix<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/fifa-mens-world-cup-2026-game-on-netflix?ref=aftermath.site">&nbsp;<u>announced</u></a><u>&nbsp;</u>that Delphi, a company you've likely never heard of (they're relatively new, and their only public credit is as support on IO's upcoming&nbsp;<em>007&nbsp;</em>game) will be both developing and publishing a new FIFA game.</blockquote><p>That was all we knew at the time, but now,<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/meet-delphi-interactive-the-publisherdeveloper-behind-the-new-fifa-game?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>courtesy of an interview Delphi recently conducted with GI.biz</u></a>, we know more. And what we know <em>sucks</em>.</p><blockquote>"Delphi has evolved into a full-fledged developer and publisher," [executive producer] Tang-Peronard says. "We believe in a lean, highly experienced core team, supported by best-in-class co-development and outsourcing partners." For FIFA, that includes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.refactorgames.com/?ref=aftermath.site#about">Refactor Games</a>, based at Delphi's LA headquarters, part-owned by Delphi and backed by venture capital giant A16z's Speedrun fund. Founded in 2021, it launched physics-heavy American football title&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1488560/Football_Simulator/?ref=aftermath.site">Football Simulator</a>&nbsp;into Early Access in 2022. The studio employs alumni of VR dev Survios and blockchain dev N3TWORK.</blockquote><p>A16z is Andreessen Horowitz, a terrible company even by venture capital's vampiric standards, <a href="https://www.thedissident.news/the-techno-fascist-soul-of-marc-andreessen/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">run</a> by<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/major-tech-investor-calls-architect-of-fascism-a-saint-in-unhinged-manifesto/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>some of the most overt technofascists</u></a> operating<a href="https://www.tni.org/en/article/the-rise-of-the-techno-tyrants?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>in Silicon Valley today</u></a>. Refactor's site boasts of hires from rights licensing company OneTeam (whose partners are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6393997/2025/05/30/federal-agents-investigation-mlbpa-nflpa-oneteam/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">currently under investigation by the FBI</a>) and N3TWORK (a blockchain studio), and their single published sports game, <em>Football Simulator</em>,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1488560/Football_Simulator/?ref=aftermath.site#app_reviews_hash"> <u>is not exactly a smash hit</u></a>.</p><p>None of that guarantees anything! For all we know a new <em>FIFA</em> could turn out to be the sleeper hit of the decade, a true middle finger to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit/" rel="noreferrer">complacent AAA sports gaming</a>, a rebirth of the FIFA brand and a reward for the millions of gamers exhausted by EA's near-monopoly on the sport.</p><p>Or, you know, it could show FIFA have no idea what they're doing, and they're going to get exactly the game they deserve for it.</p>
