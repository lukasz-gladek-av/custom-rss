            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-awards-trailer-ad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s Game Awards day, when many of us stay up far too late watching an overly-long awards show that every so often remembers it’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-many-game-awards-acceptance-speeches-could-have-taken-place-while-kojima-was-talking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposed to be an awards show</a>. Yesterday, IGN reporter Rebekah Valentine asked what marks the difference between a Game Awards ad and a Game Awards trailer, and now I’m bringing that question to you.</p><p>“Whenever TGAs are on, there are some trailers where everyone is like ‘oh yeah, trailer!’ and others where everyone goes ‘ew commercial’ and tunes out. Setting aside the fact that they are all, yes, technically commercials, what exactly is the differentiator for people in an event like this? “ Valentine asked on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/duckvalentine.bsky.social/post/3ld2qnxjdis2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>. I said this was an interesting question and should be a blog, but since I’m not the editor of every games journalist out there and cannot in fact assign them blogs, she replied that<em> </em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/duckvalentine.bsky.social/post/3ld2r6pn2vk2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>I </em>should blog it</a> instead. So here we are.</p><p>I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3ld2r5e2e222d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posited</a> that one difference is whether a video is about a game that’s already out (ad) or one that’s upcoming (trailer). <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seamoosi.bsky.social/post/3ld2spy6du22x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lots</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ld2qst46qk2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sporkyreeve.bsky.social/post/3ld2sujbtnk2j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vitzpatel.bsky.social/post/3ld2srxvgtc26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people</a> in Valentine’s replies shared this sentiment. I also suggested it had to do with the presentation of the video–whether Geoff says “world premiere” or someone who made the game introduces it, or whether it just plays in a string of videos about computers and <em>Fortnite</em> battle passes. This, too, was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/applecider.bsky.social/post/3ld2roizrbc2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markmedina.bsky.social/post/3ld2rrgpwoc2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/michaelroleary.bsky.social/post/3ld2sd4xnq22r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sentiment</a>.</p><p>Other folks said it was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianaltano.bsky.social/post/3ld2ta7bmfk25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vibes</a> or the sense of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/antoinebordeleau.bsky.social/post/3ld2r34ajrc23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artistry</a> behind the trailer; there’s a narrative to a trailer, or a purpose beyond just telling you something exists to buy. But of course, one purpose of <em>every</em> trailer is telling you that there’s something you can buy, though that thing might not exist yet. And, of course, there can also be an artistry to ads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>More than <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heathercoles.bsky.social/post/3ld2sen6slk2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ejsponge61.bsky.social/post/3ld2rtcwmxs2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">person</a> said something along the lines of “if I like it, it’s a trailer,” which I find to be an accurate and refreshing bit of honesty. I’d guess the only people who want to get excited about ads are, well, people who make ads. And since the trailers are the “events” of The Game Awards, turning the thing you’re excited about into a “trailer” and thus an “event” can make it feel like you watched a “good” Game Awards where a lot of things happened, instead of a show stuffed with ads.</p><p>The more I think about it, the more I'm partial to this line of reasoning: One of the weird things about The Game Awards, at least from the perspective of someone who's had to cover it, is that it's something that's happening where not a lot of things actually <em>happen</em>. Barring the semi-regular <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/23501270/elden-ring-goty-stage-rushed-bill-clinton-arrest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stage-intruding</a> and the occasional excellent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/13/23507234/flute-guy-pedro-eustache-interview-the-game-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">musical performance</a>, what <em>are</em> The Game Awards as an event? Is delineating between an ad and a trailer a way to assert narrative and agency into the formless swirl of forced hype that defines the event? (Barring the obvious option that you simply <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do not have to watch it</a> at all.) Is the search for trailers humankind's deeper search for structure and meaning? </p><p>I appreciate the opportunity to turn Geoff’s Day of Hype into a philosophical exercise, so weigh in in the comments. I wrote the blog. I hope you’re happy, Reb.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
