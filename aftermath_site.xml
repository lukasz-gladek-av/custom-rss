            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/twitch-emote-artists-ai<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Twitch emotes are, essentially, the language of the Amazon-owned streaming platform. It’s become customary for streamers to provide unique emotes for their communities to use in chat, so much so that a secondary economy has been built up around Twitch. For years, Twitch emotes (and other stream art) has been a space for artists to make money from their work. Emote artists were in high demand during the pandemic, when more people took to Twitch; demand has slowed since then, but there’s something else threatening artists: the proliferation of AI art.</p><p>Generative AI art tools scrape publicly available art — be it illustrations or photos — to create images. That’s art theft, <a href="https://www.zhangjingna.com/blog/class-action-lawsuit-artists-v-stability-deviantart-midjourney-runway-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to a group of artists suing AI companies like Stability AI, Midjourney, and others</a>. (Don’t forget <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the catastrophic environmental impact of AI, </a>too.) Twitch has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1h8me3p/twitchs_new_holiday_global_emote_is_ai_generated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused recently</a> of introducing AI-made global emote and category banners. While the emote hasn’t been confirmed as AI, some of the category banners are: You can find the images used on Adobe’s stock image page, where at least one, of a Corgi on a treadmill, <a href="https://stock.adobe.com/search?filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aphoto%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aillustration%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Azip_vector%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Avideo%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Atemplate%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3A3d%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aimage%5D=1&amp;k=corgi+on+treadmill&amp;order=relevance&amp;search_page=1&amp;search_type=usertyped&amp;acp=&amp;aco=corgi+on+treadmill&amp;get_facets=0&amp;asset_id=926933857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is most definitely AI</a>. Twitch has not responded to Aftermath’s request for comment.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Really glad the Fitness and Health category image was changed to an AI generated dog running on a backwards treadmill from Adobe Stock photos. Incredible move from Twitch. Very impressed. <a href="https://t.co/NR0WfQZy1J">pic.twitter.com/NR0WfQZy1J</a></p>— Pirate Software (@PirateSoftware) <a href="https://twitter.com/PirateSoftware/status/1924921642398220661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>The impact of AI on Twitch emote artists varies: some emote artists Aftermath spoke to said their communities value art, and that they haven’t seen a major impact. Others, <a href="https://x.com/Laghardra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like French artist Laghardra</a>, say their business is struggling. Laghardra said they have created more than 2,000 emotes for hundreds of different streamers, but that AI-generated art has slowed their business. “Unfortunately, over the past year, AI-generated emotes have flooded Twitch and sales platforms like Etsy and Ko-Fi,” they said. “You can now find packs of 50 emotes for less than €10, whereas the average price per emote from an artist is typically €15–18.”</p><p>Laghardra continued, “The offer is very appealing, and we simply can't compete. That's why, after six years in this profession, I can no longer make a living from it. My revenue has dropped significantly, and some of my former clients are now creating their own AI-generated emotes — even using mine as inspiration.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://x.com/PlurpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plurp</a>, another emote and YouTube thumbnail artist, said there has been a decrease in demand for emotes, but attributes it to the post-pandemic decrease of streaming in general, as well as an increase of bots on Twitter offering art and pushing out actual artists. Twitter has been a space for artists to connect with potential buyers, but Jay, <a href="https://x.com/jootics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an emote artist</a>, told Aftermath that AI has likely made these bot-based scammers' job much easier. "[Bots] are what make [an] artist's life hell," Jay said.</p><p>Several emote artists, <a href="https://vgen.co/NanaFromHell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including Nana Jiei</a>, said the VTubing community is propping up their businesses. “VTubers mainly do not support AI-generated images and I am very happy and thankful about that,” Jiei said. “My client-base is very keen when it comes to full customization of their emotes and would want them specifically tailor-made for them and their brands.” Still, Jiei is worried about Twitch emotes and art outside the VTubing community; people want “cheaper and fast mass-produced emotes done via the use of AI.”</p><p>Taya, an artist who works largely with VTubers, agreed: "The people that are using AI art were never my customers to begin with," she said. Taya said it's not even really about the money — her rates are so low that she's "undervaluing her time" to ensure people can have art. "These people have never had the care to support small artist[s] and give jobs to real people for their art because they don’t have the same level of passion as the people who do art and pay for art," Taya said.</p><p>Artists — and people committed to human artwork — are turning to marketplaces like <a href="https://vgen.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VGen</a>, an art marketplace tailored specifically toward VTubers and streamers looking to commission art. The platform is specifically for human-made art; no generative AI is allowed on the platform. Artists are able to promote their work to people who value human-made art, and streamers can ensure they’re not getting something generated by AI — a little piece of art that can set a stream apart.</p><p>And if people are still turning elsewhere after being educated on AI use, some artists said a little shaming doesn't hurt. "I’d say that if you use AI emotes, the [artist] community will degrade you which will, in turn, push you to commission a real artist," <a href="https://x.com/artdragonz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an emote artist named Kat said</a>. Other artists emphasized this point, too, especially in the VTuber space.</p><p>“Emotes have real power and reach,” Lagharda said. “Tomorrow, you could gain 10 more viewers just because someone used a cool emote in another person’s chat. It’s amazing that such a small, complex piece of artwork can create that kind of effect.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs"><h3>Another Day, Another Round Of Layoffs At EA</h3></a><p>Black Panther is canceled, and workers (once again) suffer the consequences</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ushimitsu-gao-beastars"><h3>Ushimitsu Gao Is A Ghost Cuckold Romance Manga For Folks Who Defend Beastars (Me)</h3></a><p>Paru Itagaki let her freak flag fly with Beastars.
