            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/balatro-golden-needle-challenge-how-to-beat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>The Golden Needle, how I loathe you. Credit: LocalThunk</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p><em>Balatro</em> and I had come to an agreement. I was only allowed to interact with it under certain conditions. I was almost free of its grasp again when I hit the cruelest scenario of all: Golden Needle.&nbsp; I was trapped in a prison of my own creation until I found a way to win.</p><p>Some context: I had previously banished <em>Balatro</em> from my personal computer. If it’s on there, like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> before it,<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-nerve-of-balatro-for-being-this-good" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> work just doesn’t get done</a>. I knew instinctively that the mobile version was going to be far more insidious, and largely resisted its call until I had a six-hour Thanksgiving train ride to my parents I needed to kill. So I allowed it back into my system under the condition that I delete it immediately from my phone after the holiday was over.&nbsp;</p><p>This arrangement largely worked until I tried to reinstall the game for a Christmas train ride and found out that cloud saves were nonfunctional for a huge portion of users on iOS. This is a huge issue and you will see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1fq287j/careful_with_cloud_save/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tons of pissed off reddit threads on the topic</a>. All that progress I had previously was gone. Lucky, the developers were smart enough to include an option in the menu that lets you just unlock everything. The problem with that is that I am goal oriented when playing <em>Balatro</em>, and with nothing to unlock I decided to go after the 20 “challenges,” custom scenarios built into a special mode in the game.</p><p>Most of the challenges in <em>Balatro</em> are fun and fairly straightforward. The Rich Get Richer starts you off with $100 and vouchers that max out your interest, but limits your scorable chips to the amount of money you have. Medusa gives you a single, indestructible <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Marble_Joker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marble Joker</a>, which rapidly fills your deck with stone cards. Fragile gives you a deck of entirely glass cards and gives you <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Oops!_All_6s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two jokers that double all probabilities</a>, which makes glass cards break every time. Each of these scenarios forces the player to work around the limitations of their deck and often upend how the game is played.&nbsp;</p><p>Challenges are fair for the most part until you get to the last three and the difficulty skyrockets tremendously. Cruelty forces you to operate at a disadvantage – small blinds and big blinds give no reward money. This sucks but is very reliably beatable. Jokerless forces the player to operate without jokers. This also sucks, but there are ways to get to the end without jokers – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1bx1jhf/comment/kyae510/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">building on four of a kind or straights, which scale more aggressively</a>. Of the three, Golden Needle is the cruelest.</p><p>Golden Needle<em> </em>starts you off with a <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Credit_Card" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit Card</a> joker and $10, allowing you to go -$20 in debt. Each used discard costs you $1. You have six discards a round, and can only play one hand each round. Welcome to hell.</p><figure><figcaption>These Jokers all become far more powerful in Golden Needle. Credit: Localthunk </figcaption></figure><p>What makes Golden Needle<em> </em>so frustrating is that it is the scenario most dependent on random chance. You get past the first round by aggressively cycling through one of the few hands that can beat it – usually a high end straight, flush or full house. What you pull in the first shop determines how you must proceed, if you can at all.</p><p>Golden Needle also subtly changes the way you play the game. Certain MVP jokers that would carry you through the game, jokers that get stronger each hand like <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Ride_the_Bus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ride The Bus</a> or <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Spare_Trousers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spare Trousers</a>, do not scale fast enough to account for the scenario. Conversely, other jokers that shine in a scenario with one hand and six discards become elevated in importance – jokers like <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acrobat </a>(which gives you a 3x multiplier on the final hand), <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Dusk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dusk</a> (retriggers the final hand), <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Ice_Cream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ice Cream</a> (which gives you a massive chip bump but reduces every hand played) and <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Castle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Castle </a>(gains +3 chips every time a specific suit is discarded).&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Oh COME ON. Credit: Localthunk.</figcaption></figure><p>The constant financial drain of discarding means maintaining a functioning economy becomes twice as hard, and you are forced to take a risk to pull yourself out of debt, or function exclusively in the negative. On top of this, certain <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Blinds_and_Antes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boss blinds</a> like The Mouth or The Needle become irrelevant, while others like The Water will destroy you outright. This unique combination of pure chance and elevated strategy mean that you not only have to be lucky, you also have to be good. Every round played is on a knife’s edge. One move and you are done.</p><figure><figcaption>Here's what worked. Flushes. Credit: LocalThunk</figcaption></figure><p>That’s where I was for days: refusing to delete <em>Balatro</em> until I bested Golden Needle. Through a series of convoluted circumstances I engineered a prison of gaming that I could technically leave but refused to out of pride. I have gotten to the final round multiple times, only to come up short by inches. And this morning, as I was writing this, it finally happened. A combination of the <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Banner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banner</a>, <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acrobat</a> and <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Onyx_Agate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Onyx Agate</a> while focusing on juicing flushes (which is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1bbh75a/how_to_win_chips_and_influence_mult_a_thorough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">normally a bad idea</a> but far more viable due to the number of discards in this specific scenario) carried me through to Ante 8. The joy I felt was sublime.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I'm finally free. Credit: LocalThunk</figcaption></figure><p>I love and hate you, Golden Needle,<em> </em>and now I have defeated you. Time to delete <em>Balatro</em> until my next train ride.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/star-reporter-talent-pr-washington-post"><h3>The Myth Of The Star Reporter</h3></a><p>Good journalism isn't created in a vacuum</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck"><h3>Too Big</h3></a><p>Unless you are a giant</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/star-reporter-talent-pr-washington-post<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, The Washington Post (former employer of Nathan Grayson and me) laid off less than<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/washington-post-layoffs-1236249871/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 100 people</a> on the business side, the latest <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2025/01/04/washington-post-trump-bezos-cartoonist-resigns/52d8560e-caeb-11ef-a9b8-74e0b395057f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upheaval</a> at the Jeff Bezos-owned paper that’s struggling with the unique problem of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/25/jeff-bezos-killed-washington-post-endorsement-of-kamala-harris-.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what it wants to be</a> during the upcoming Trump administration, and the much less unique problem of how to get people to pay money for journalism. Among those laid off were, reportedly, most of The Post’s <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeff-bezos-crisis-hit-washington-post-axes-dozens-in-cash-crunch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PR team</a>; a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxtani.bsky.social/post/3lf6gudz25k2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memo</a> about a new PR strategy reads in part,</p><blockquote><p>Talent-driven journalism is the future of media, and personalities and creators will lead the way...</p><p>Effective immediately, we are repositioning the entire Post PR division to build and launch our Star Talent Unit. We will stop the dedicated practice of publicity for our journalism across broadcast and traditional media outlets…</p><p>The core focus of our team will be to ensure our audiences know who our journalists are and rely even more on these trusted voices... We will also be working closely with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2024/12/20/introducing-wp-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WP Ventures</a>, expanding our talent roster to include creators.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wagatwe.com/post/3lf6njrkztc2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stevemullis.bsky.social/post/3lf6jir2df22a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alone</a> in being <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lf6hgee5tk2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horrified</a> by the phrase “Star Talent Unit.” While it’s not clear yet precisely what this new approach will look like, the name and the mention of "creators and personalities," alongside the intention to hire more, suggest The Post could lean in on promoting whoever it considers its biggest personalities instead of the paper’s work more holistically. On its face, such a move would make a kind of sense; I think most journalists would admit influencers and content creators are <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/04/nx-s1-5246011/influencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nibbling our lunch</a> when it comes to engagement and subscriber money, especially among <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/18/media/news-influencers-social-media-conservative-study/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">younger audiences</a>. And I think we’d all admit that borrowing some of these personalities’ promotion strategies is an <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/2/1/24056883/tiktok-self-promotion-artist-career-how-to-build-following" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unfortunate necessity</a> these days, especially on the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of the “star reporter” is a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031975/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long</a>-<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051036/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standing</a> <a href="https://bojackhorseman.fandom.com/wiki/Paige_Sinclair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">image</a> that’s been present in every newsroom I’ve worked at or known people who work at: your biggest names who do the site’s most high-profile work, and as such are afforded the autonomy, time, and pay (maybe– we’re still talking about journalism here) to do so. They do the kinds of stories that go wide, that audiences talk about, that can effect change in your beats. They become the people your site is known for and come to feel <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/abeewords.bsky.social/post/3lf6hopqtcs23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">essential</a> to, the people readers take to the comments section to declare a site “over” if they leave. Sometimes, especially these days, these folks strike out on their own, realizing they can use the name they’ve built in a newsroom to get paid by readers directly. Other times, an organization will bend over backwards to keep them, which may or may not go well for them and the people they work with.</p><p>I’m not going to pretend star power isn’t real: there are writers out there with unique strengths and compelling personalities and savvy self-promotion skills. When you’re an editor or team leader, as I’ve been, you don’t serve those writers, your outlet, or your audience by clipping their wings, but you have to balance that against the needs and strengths of everyone on your team, including those whose talents or interests lie in less flashy areas. I always wanted as best I could to give each of my writers the assignments they wanted and the things they’d excel at, to put them on the work that would be the best for both them and the outlet. This isn’t always possible: there are only so many of the biggest games of the year to review or events to cover; if everyone is heads-down in long-term reporting or ambitious criticism, no stories are going up while that work gets done; sometimes, there is just workaday news to write or videos to make or admin work to do, to keep your site functioning or to keep the suits above you happy about your page views or, simply, to serve your audience and keep them informed.&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, you want to give everyone on your staff the time and opportunity to shine at what they shine at, and to acknowledge and promote that work accordingly, but I’m not sure–and I’ll regretfully include myself in this–I’ve ever seen that fully work out. Just as much as “star” reporters can elevate an outlet, they can wreak havoc inside it too. Resentments flourish; even in the most well-managed scenarios, it’s natural to be jealous of someone who you think gets more freedom and attention than you do. People can behave badly, leading to mercurial “stars” and mistreated or bitter colleagues. A “star” can, intentionally or not, claim a beat or style of work and crowd others out of it. Colleagues can feel like they have to, or be made to, pick up the slack while someone does long-term work without ever getting their own shot at it. A site can go from being a team of journalists to feeling like a “star” or two and their support staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When the big stories from the big names go up, they can seem to an audience like the work of whoever is on the byline, when in reality <em>everything</em> that goes on the page is the product, to some extent, of everyone who works at an outlet. Great journalism doesn’t happen in a vacuum; colleagues talk a story over, point a reporter to sources, lend their expertise, give feedback, edit, suggest a headline, provide art. They write the day-to-day stories readers need, and those stories help keep the lights on and make the money that pays for the more ambitious work. The “star reporter” builds on the work and reputation of an outlet to do their work, from the kinds of stories they pursue to the sources who’ll be willing to talk to them. A good newsroom and its leaders acknowledge this, internally and externally, when a big story goes live. A handful of people’s names might be on the page, but that story is the work of everyone who works on that team, and everyone had some hand in its impact and success. A good leader, and a good organization, doesn’t leave those teammates behind or use them to build up other people’s names.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m saying this all from my perch at a version of the situation I’m warning against, an independent outlet built, at least in part, on name recognition and thus some version of star power. It’s likely you were willing to pay for Aftermath because you heard of the people who work here; you heard of us because an outlet and its team supported us in learning to make the work you’re paying for. You could see Aftermath and our worker-owned outlet peers as a success story of the very thing The Post could pursue, some kind of triumph of personal branding alongside the democratizing power of the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>But you could also read it, more pessimistically but maybe more honestly, as a damning example of what it takes to still make journalism these days. Things weren’t going <em>so well </em>that the five of us and our colleagues at other outlets all decided there was a way to make them go even better; our organizations failed us, or didn’t want us anymore, and we went independent because it was that or leave the field. I’m aware, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3ld267tue7s2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every day</a>, that everyone can’t do that, that there’s a view of our sites that sees us building our own little islands and leaving others behind. I fully believe independent organizations like Aftermath and our peers are paving the way for democratic workplaces that live our values and prioritize our audiences. But we aren’t, or aren’t yet, a working alternative to the system crumbling around us, one that creates a reliable future for journalists and journalism as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>We have to undertake all the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3le3qy5qyp22u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burnout-inducing</a> self-promotion and name recognition and cultivation of reader relationships as a survival mechanism as much as a unique strength of our space. The Post’s PR pivot has the potential to embrace the worst of that, to cut even more people out of having a satisfying, stable future in journalism by combining the harshest requirements of independent spheres with established journalism’s own worst habits of competition and “star power” myths. A focus on “star talent” wouldn’t serve those supposed “stars”--as we’ve <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/10/g-s1-27366/taylor-lorenz-leaves-washington-post-after-rift-with-editors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already seen</a>, why would someone submit themselves to the strictures of an organization when even the organization is telling them their personal value will get them farther? And it wouldn’t serve the people who don’t get to be the “star talent,” who might feel their work is devalued or that they’re playing second fiddle to whoever the paper decides is worth promoting. And why would <em>anyone</em> in this situation put their efforts into The Post, or any outlet, as a whole, if that outlet's PR strategy promotes the opposite?</p><p>There’s no denying things both in established journalism and outside of it are bleak. It’s naive to be dedicated to an outlet that could fold or cut you at any moment, and it’s exhausting to add self-promotion to any writer’s already endless to-do list. One of the most well-resourced news organizations in the world should be looking for alternatives to how things currently stand, not just creating another version.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/balatro-golden-needle-challenge-how-to-beat"><h3>Balatro’s Golden Needle Became A Prison</h3></a><p>Balatro's Golden Needle challenge, which requires both luck and skill, trapped me in a gameplay torment of my own creation.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck"><h3>Too Big</h3></a><p>Unless you are a giant</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
