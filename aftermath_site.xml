            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Old heads or students of games media might remember a site called GameZone, which while never a titan in the industry had managed to survive in one way or another since 1994, enjoying various periods of success throughout, which is an <em>incredible</em> achievement in such a volatile field. Sadly in recent months it appears to have been all but killed off by its owners, with archives spanning decades wiped in favour of front page content that doesn’t feel like it was written by or for human beings.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite appearing long dormant--its featured content for most of 2025, like a PS5 review, was years out of date, its<a href="https://www.facebook.com/gamezone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Facebook page hasn't posted since January 2024</a> and its<a href="https://www.youtube.com/GAMEZONE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> YouTube channel hadn't been updated since 2019</a>--in the early months of this year users could still visit GameZone and access decades of older features and reviews. One of the oldest articles I could find a link for via the Wayback Machine was a review for <em>Tiberian Sun</em>, which came out in 1999!</p><figure><figcaption>A snapshot of what GameZone looked like in 2005</figcaption></figure><p>This continuity wasn't just a legacy archive for a long-running site and for games media in general, but was also a way for games writers and those who have since moved to other positions in the media and games industries to link back to their old work. If you go searching through the footnotes of Wikipedia, especially for articles on older games, you'll often find GameZone mentioned, whether it's<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Def_Jam:_Fight_for_NY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Def Jam: Fight for NY</em></a> or<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons:_Hit_%26_Run" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</em></a>.</p><p>Luckily those Wikipedia links point to archived copies of those articles, because GameZone's own backlinks are now dead. With the site having been redesigned in the last few months, GameZone has removed the ability to search the site, and its archives now only contain 12 stories, some of which feature AI-generated imagery (like the example below), and many of which are bylined by Javier Lassus, who is a "Solutions Engineer" and web developer at a company called Playwire. Other posts have Louis Barbati's byline, who is also a "Solutions Engineer" at Playwire, and another whose resume has a lot of customer service and web development on it. If someone told me all their posts--with their bullet points, generic text and rambling on about unrelated topics--had also been written by AI, I would not raise either of my eyebrows.</p><p>(I contacted Playwire for comment on this but at time of publishing have not heard back.)</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Gabe brought to my attention that GameZone, the website I wrote at for five years and became Editor-in-Chief of, has seemingly erased every article ever written for the site.</p><p>This includes thousands of news articles, reviews, rare interviews, and features I wrote. <a href="https://t.co/JFqPDt1vtK">https://t.co/JFqPDt1vtK</a></p></div>— Cade Onder (@Cade_Onder) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cade_Onder/status/1972424612974903752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>I spoke to Gabe Reisinger, a former writer for GameZone, and Cade Onder, its last functional EIC who departed in late 2020, and neither of them say they were given even a courtesy heads-up that years of their work was going to be deleted by the site's owners.</p><p>Playwire,<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/new-coo-for-playwire-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the company that has owned GameZone for years</a>, isn't really a traditional media publisher; they're an ad company, and recently<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7255204402938966017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> celebrated inking a sales deal with the Gamurs network</a>, a<a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-escapist-siliconera-destructoid-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> group of websites we have covered a few times before</a>. Having left the site (Facebook page aside) long dormant, it’s unclear why Playwire decided to reboot it now, at a time when<a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the prospects for games media websites are as dire as they've ever been</a>, even if the plan is to juice stuff via things like SEO.</p><figure><figcaption>A snapshot of what GameZone looks like in October 2025</figcaption></figure><p>The redesigned site still boasts of its 1994 heritage at the foot of the front page, saying:</p><blockquote><p>Founded in 1994, GameZone has been working to bring gamers everything there is to know about the games industry, from reviews on the latest game releases to breaking news and rumors. In addition to gaming, we bring relevant culture and entertainment news.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>But when I contacted the email tips line right next to that text to ask about the redesign and its content, the email bounced back with an "Address not found" error.</p><p>Look, GameZone wasn't a relevant games media resource in 2025. It hadn't been meaningfully updated in years, and seemed to exist solely to juice some social media accounts with large legacy followings and as an archive for 30 years’ worth of video game journalism. But that last point was important! This is history, of the industry and the medium and of all the work everyone who wrote for GameZone since 1994 had put in, and to have it all just deleted like that without notice doesn't just suck, it should--<a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as I've said before</a>--be something that has some consequences.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-review"><h3>100 Meters Is A Soulful Gem About The Poetry Of Running</h3></a><p>Studio Rock’N Roll Mountain’s rotoscope take on Uoto’s track manga unearths raw truths and soulful cadence with every thunderous footfall</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange"><h3>Baby Steps’ Manbreaker Did Not Break Me</h3></a><p>Baby Steps' Manbreaker is an optional, brutal challenge that is as much a test of your humility as it is your skill.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-patch-notes-impaled-swordfishes"><h3>Good Patch Notes</h3></a><p>"The trash chute now ignores impaled swordfishes"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/gamezone-video-game-journalism-reviews-archives]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For decades, anime has routinely spun athleticism into artistic spectacle, be it ping pong duels, basketball games, or wacky, high-octane races that blur the line between vehicular sport and myth. <em>100 Meters</em>, the latest theatrical release from GKids and Studio <a href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-kenji-iwaisawa-director-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rock’N Roll Mountain</a>, doesn’t chase flash. Adapted from Uoto’s manga <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Meters_(manga)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hyakuemo</em></a>, this rotoscoped-driven gem trades bombast for breadth, offering a quietly powerful and inspiring view of an athlete's ambition fighting underneath the pitfalls of competition, burnout, and career-threatening injury.&nbsp;</p><p>At its core are Togashi, a prodigy whose speed and natural-born athleticism feel God-sent, and Komiya, a scrappy underdog fueled by grit alone. Their friendship-turned-rivalry unfolds across years, framed not by medals or podium envy but by a single refrained question: Why do you run? While the film explicitly answers this question, it never feels like it needs to. It's evident in the way the characters’ bodies move—whether they’re leading the pack, trailing behind chasing glory, or simply chasing each other.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="劇場アニメ『ひゃくえむ。』本編冒頭映像６分特別公開！【大ヒット上映中】" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ObspfdX4jGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Like <a href="https://aftermath.site/look-back-gkids-tatsuki-fujimoto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Look Back</em></a>, <em>100 Meters</em> scratches the itch of watching two people from wildly different walks of life wrestle with maintaining their passion. But where Tatsuki Fujimoto’s work spirals into grief and artistic obsession, <em>100 Meters</em> stays grounded in the purity of the 100-meter dash, a brutally simple sport where runners have just ten seconds to prove they’re the fastest and etch their name into history. If someone’s a hair quicker, or your body fails you, you’re forgotten in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</p><p>Although <em>100 Meters</em> flirts with the ephemeral glory of being the best in a sport predicated on “who’s on top right now” over who once was, it never wallows in the futility of the Sisyphean pursuit of greatness. Even in its most agonizing defeats and major setbacks, it refuses to become grim. Instead, it finds beauty in the act of picking yourself back up and starting again—to compete not for legacy, but for love. For the joy of movement, and to run shoulder to shoulder with the like-minded people beside you.&nbsp;</p><p>What makes <em>100 Meters</em> truly magnificent is how, despite being about track and field, it refuses to embellish or exaggerate its modest place in sports. The stands aren’t packed; races aren’t roared over outside of the confines of its niche fandom. The sport isn’t the celestial body around which the universe revolves. It’s just something that <em>100 Meters</em>’ characters collectively chose.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Rock'N Roll Mountain/GKids</span></figcaption></figure><p>Visually, <em>100 Meters’</em> rotoscope animation—arguably the biggest selling point— is sublime. With herculean production feats like a three-minute and 40-second one-shot long take totaling <a href="https://x.com/ROCKNROLL_MT/status/1970718588081189235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">approximately 9,830 animation cels</a> across foreground and background layers, Rock’N Roll’s craftsmanship is undeniable. But its rotoscoping truly sings in the film’s quieter moments. Subtle gestures, flickers of emotion, and the rhythmic ebb and flow of movement—both in anguish and elation—are illustrated with painterly grace.&nbsp;</p><p>Complementing this is the film’s soft watercolor background art, where every brushstroke and stain evokes the cozy tactility of a Little Golden Book, tying its visual poetry together with warmth and texture. A texture that erupts from the frame with rapturous adrenaline as its ensemble hits its eighth gear, diving headlong into their runner’s high to finish out strong with primal ferocity.&nbsp;</p><p><em>100 Meters</em> doesn’t grandstand. It just runs. And in doing so, it discovers something achingly beautiful and universal in the blur of its poetry.</p><hr><p><em>100 Meters hits</em> select theaters on October 10 and will be available nationwide from October 12 to October 14.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chess-dungeon-crawler-yeah"><h3>Chess Dungeon Crawler, Yeah</h3></a><p>Below the Crown combines roguelike hallmarks with chess</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange"><h3>Baby Steps’ Manbreaker Did Not Break Me</h3></a><p>Baby Steps' Manbreaker is an optional, brutal challenge that is as much a test of your humility as it is your skill.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-patch-notes-impaled-swordfishes"><h3>Good Patch Notes</h3></a><p>"The trash chute now ignores impaled swordfishes"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/epic-games-suing-two-fortnite-island-makers-over-inflated-bot-engagement"><h3>Epic Games Suing Two Fortnite Island Makers Over Inflated ‘Bot’ Engagement</h3></a><p>Epic Games says Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser made tens of thousands of dollars worth of ‘unwarranted payouts’</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-review]]></content:encoded>
