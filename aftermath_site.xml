            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Last Friday evening, despite the bitter cold, around 50 people gathered outside <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> developer Rockstar’s office in Manhattan to protest <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-union-protest-rockstar/"><u>the October firing of 34 workers in the UK and Scotland</u></a> who had engaged in union organizing activity. Chants like “Steal lambos, not wages” were accompanied by signs that read “No workers, no <em>GTA</em>” and “Bad boss = bad game.”&nbsp;</p><p>The protest was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/techworkerscoalition.org/post/3m7bkgt7d5s2w?ref=aftermath.site"><u>put on by the Tech Workers Coalition</u></a>, a labor rights group with chapters around the US. Gershom (who declined to share his last name), a developer with the Tech Workers Coalition, told Aftermath that the goal of the protest was to keep pressure on Rockstar and show support for fired workers as they head into a UK court hearing this week.</p><p>"We're connected with the Rockstar workers in the UK who were fired, and they asked us to help organize international solidarity actions to show Rockstar that it can't hide attacks on workers in one country anywhere else,” Gershom said. “We want to take it to the New York offices and show [the bosses] that no matter where they are, we're gonna be here letting people know what they're doing to their workers and letting their customers know what they're doing to their workers."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The crowd was largely made up of members from supportive organizations like the Democratic Socialists Of America (DSA) and unions like Industrial Workers Of The World (IWW), United Auto Workers (UAW), and Communications Workers Of America (CWA), the latter of which has played a pivotal role in <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-unions-microsoft-layoffs-mmo-elder-scrolls/"><u>unionizing thousands of workers across Microsoft</u></a>. Independent Workers’ Union Of Great Britain (IWGB) – which is helping Rockstar workers organize and, now, <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-union-protest-rockstar/"><u>pursue legal action against Rockstar</u></a> – did not have a presence, as it is predominantly based in the UK.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>"It's important that we stand against all of those threats as a single workers' movement."</blockquote><p>"I was available, so I came," Marcin, a member of IWW, told Aftermath. "I always knew that Rockstar was not a very good company in terms of treating their workers [well], but goddamn. The whole gaming industry, the working conditions are very toxic. Crunch culture ... is in my opinion inhumane and quite abusive. I don't think anybody should be treated that way."</p><p>Tech workers from companies like Google and Meta marched alongside grad workers from Columbia University.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Employers across industries right now are firing people without cause, whether that's due to manufactured austerity crises or in response to organizing – or some combination,” Johanna, a member of Student Workers Of Columbia-UAW who said she was fired for organizing earlier this year, told Aftermath. “And it's important that we stand against all of those threats as a single workers' movement. … It's a cliche, but what happens to one of us happens to all of us."</p><p>Others in attendance could attest to the effectiveness of unions banding together. Dannel Jurado, a member, steward, and collective bargaining committee member of Kickstarter United – which just <a href="https://www.opeiulocal153.org/news/kickstarter-united-nyc-opeiu-153-declares-victory-and-ends-40-day-strike?ref=aftermath.site"><u>ended a 42-day strike</u></a> after securing an escalating minimum salary floor tied to cost of living and a codified 32-hour, 4-day workweek, among other things – told Aftermath that a “pay it forward” mentality informed his decision to join the Rockstar protest.</p><p>"It was really heartening to see folks come out from Starbucks – who are clearly on strike – and CODE-CWA, especially the Google folks and the <a href="https://aftermath.site/times-tech-guild-strike-wordle/"><u>New York Times Tech Guild</u></a> folks,” Jurado said of Kickstarter’s strike. “We saw people come out from RA unions; we have in our local a bunch of RA unions who really came out in support of us. Student groups as well. We saw teamsters come out. Amazon labor folks."</p><p>"Today's the day we ratified our second contract we went on strike for,” he continued. “In a discussion during that meeting, we told each other 'We can't shut up about this. We can't shut up about our contract, about how union solidarity gets the goods.' It's a big deal for us to be out here because we saw that when we were trying to organize strike rallies across the country – which we did successfully in Boston, New York, and Seattle – we saw folks who came out just to support us. Every single person counts, whether they knew what our message was or not."</p><p>Game developers, however, were few and far between at the protest, which according to Gershom came together at the last second and largely drew on established connections between tech workers and unions, as opposed to NYC’s local game dev scene.&nbsp;</p><p>“What we're all out here to do is help give those workers support,” said Gershom. “They asked us to do this earlier than we would have otherwise, because it's not just about bad publicity. They're gonna be walking into court there in Britain. They want to be able to know and see photos all around the world of people standing there with them.”</p><p>After the protest, organizers and others in attendance spoke of hypothetical links that had yet to be hammered into the chain: For example, major motion picture guilds like SAG-AFTRA and IATSE have every reason to support Rockstar workers considering how much Hollywood talent Rockstar’s games draw on. One SAG member was in attendance, Sarah Elmaleh – negotiating chair on <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-deal/"><u>the union’s recent, voice actor strike-ending interactive media agreement</u></a> – but of her own accord as opposed to in any official capacity.</p><p>"I was [in town] for the holidays, and I was like 'Oh shit, maybe I can go help,'" Elmaleh told Aftermath. "I know that some of [the fired Rockstar workers] have been at this company longer than I've been doing voiceover, and that's a long time. So it seems very clear to me that they know how to take care of their company's information, and they love what they do and they want to make this game. Every union that's not quite started up yet is vulnerable, and they deserve other folks who've enjoyed long-term benefits and protections from that right to stand up and support their right to do that."</p><blockquote>"It seems very clear to me that [Rockstar workers] know how to take care of their company's information, and they love what they do and they want to make this game."</blockquote><p>As evidenced by both the nascent state of unions in the video game industry and the relative lack of game worker presence at a demonstration ostensibly dedicated to game workers, organizing is a long, sometimes diffuse process. But even where a series about stealing cars and going really, really fast is concerned, slow and steady wins the race.</p><p>"There's a difference between developers and performers, but we're both game workers,” said Elmaleh. “We both work on games. Breaking down that boundary is really important to us understanding the conditions we both work under to support each other in light of that. … It can be scary when you're doing something like this, and bodies and support and voices make you feel less alone and make you less vulnerable to being picked off. It's really crucial that we do this together. That's time tested." </p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-union-protest-rockstar/"><div><p>Following Firings And Grand Theft Auto VI Delay, Union Plans To Keep Pressure On Rockstar</p><p>“When companies do something like this, you can’t just slink away and hide anymore”</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>After months of meaning to get around to it, I finally pulled the plug on my Spotify subscription last week. There wasn't any one reason I wanted out, just an ever-growing collection of back-breaking straws:<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-12/spotify-boycott-daniel-ek-ai-music-military-tech-fenn-wilson/105765846?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>the CEO's support of genocide</u></a> was a big one, but you can throw in everything from its<a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/a-complete-guide-to-quitting-spotify?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>poor artist pay</u></a> to layoffs to, well,<a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ex-spotify-employee-exposes-wrapped-decay-2400-human-storytellers-replaced-cold-ai-logic-1760414?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>the fact the whole company just seems pretty terrible</u></a>.</p><p>A major factor in delaying the decision wasn't because none of that mattered to me--it all did!--but because having used various streaming services for almost 15 years now, changing them felt like work that I just didn't have time for. I had so many playlists and liked songs and albums to move, and the last time I'd done this--when I'd left Google Play Music for Spotify,<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/10/rip-google-play-music-2011-2020/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>after the former rebranded to YouTube Music and became a worse service in the process</u></a>--it had been a disaster, involving a ton of messing around and a ton of lost music.</p><figure><blockquote>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1phag1t/spotify_now_features_ai_band_clones/?ref=aftermath.site">Spotify now features AI band clones</a><br> by

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/?ref=aftermath.site">Music</a>
</blockquote>
</figure><p>But every man has his limits, and so last week–<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/03/spotify-wrapped-ai-create-your-own-playlists?ref=aftermath.site"><u>maybe it was just seeing everyone talking about their Spotify Wrapped, which sucks</u></a>--I finally pulled the pin, remembering it was just the latest in a succession of moves in my life where I've tried, however I can, to start putting my money where my mouth is. In the last couple of years I've installed solar on my roof, I've moved both my banking and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superannuation_in_Australia?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>superannuation</u></a><u> </u>(which is roughly an Australian 401K) to more<a href="https://www.bankaust.com.au/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>responsible</u></a><a href="https://www.australianethical.com.au/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>providers</u></a> and sold two gas-powered cars to buy a single electric vehicle. If I could do all <em>that</em>, I could move a fucking music service.</p><p>The act of cancelling my Spotify subscription itself was the easy part; the only speedbump ended up being the fact that, having been on an all-encompassing family plan, my daughter (who uses it as a kind of social media platform with her friends, exchanging playlists, etc) didn't want to budge. So we got her an individual membership and cut her loose from our plans; I'm not the kind of parent who is going to force my kids to go along with an ideological decision they can't fully grasp, so she can make the call on her own time as she gets older and, hopefully, a bit wiser.</p><blockquote>I found myself not looking for the best streaming platform, just trying to find the least worst. </blockquote><p>The hard part was choosing what to replace it with. Especially since I had some pretty stringent requirements. Spotify had worked for everyone, everywhere, so its successor needed to factor in that it was going to be providing music for me, my wife and my 12 year-old son, all of whom had different use cases. I have a Pixel, my wife has an iPhone, I listen to music on my desktop PC a lot, she prefers the kitchen speaker, I listen to a lot of music that might not be in every service's library and she doesn't, and our car runs on Google's Android Automotive, which has a limited selection of native music apps.</p><p>Given that last point, our first stop was YouTube Music. As YouTube Premium subscribers--you have to watch so many videos in this line of work that if I had to sit through ads I'd have lost years of my life--I already had access to YouTube Music, and it was also installed on my car. I quickly found that in the five years since I'd stopped using it little had changed: the app sucked shit, and the music quality was even worse, so it was almost instantly struck off the list.</p><p>Next was, uh, hrm.<a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/a-complete-guide-to-quitting-spotify?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>I'd read through Brian Merchant's excellent guide to cancelling Spotify earlier in the week</u></a>, and had also put out a call on social media for replacement suggestions, so had more than a few options to consider, but all of them seemed deeply compromised in some way. I just wasn't feeling Deezer, Amazon Music can go to hell and Tidal, while doing some things I liked (like paying artists more, and offering welcome sound quality options) had an app design and sharing features that just didn't sell me on it either.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:nhqvuggd6ebasluetrqfab6n/app.bsky.feed.post/3m74by6hv5s23" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreifrs32ex4jnxq4bm22bmjw5pyfsxdrht6pibrkl4djujh6r7pbqpe"><p lang="en">been shopping for a spotify alternative this week and this is grim stuff. its either volatile small guys who will be dead or bought out in 18 months or trying to decide which major tech platform you hate the least</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:nhqvuggd6ebasluetrqfab6n?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Luke Plunkett (@lukeplunkett.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:nhqvuggd6ebasluetrqfab6n/post/3m74by6hv5s23?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-12-03T20:23:29.531Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>It felt like every platform I was considering was either owned by the worst people on Earth, run by the worst people on Earth, looked like they weren't going to be around much longer or had huge holes in their offering that made them substantially less useful to me having just come off Spotify's ubiquity. Free of a contract and only now surveying the music streaming landscape in its entirety like this, it was bleak! This is what we've come to, this is the point these platforms and the economy driving them have led us to, a point where I found myself not looking for the best streaming platform, just trying to find the least worst.</p><p>Things seemed so bad that I considered making the next logical jump altogether, which was ditching streaming entirely. Maybe I could just start running a media server, put all my Bandcamp purchases and rips on there and go back to how I listened to music in 2007. If I was really worried about principles, I'd realise streaming as a concept is inherently fucked, that even in best-case scenarios it's all exploitative to artists, and that I needed to cut that cord completely.</p><p>But I am an imperfect man confronting a difficult situation: my whole family is now hooked on the convenience, on the recommendations and new release updates and playlist algorithms. Even if I could bring myself to make the break, there's little chance I'd be able to convince my wife and son to start screwing around with a media server and plugging a thumb drive into one of our car's USB slots.</p><p>So, streaming platforms it was.</p><p>Taking price, cross-platform compatibility, family plans, sound quality, artist pay, company ownership and user experience into account, and excluding the platforms I'd already dabbled in and struck off the list, I ended up with two services to pit against each other for my money: Apple Music and Qobuz.</p><p>Qobuz seemed great on paper! The folks there seem to genuinely care about music and artists in a way no other service (aside from maybe Tidal) do, and on average they paid artists <em>way </em>more than Spotify. But man, in AUD terms their pricing for their top tier (the one I was interested in) was <em>steep</em>. I realise the hypocrisy here of<a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/"> <u>someone who regularly begs for money on the internet saying this</u></a>, someone who fully understands you can't pay other people properly unless you yourself are paid properly, but the AUD$37.49 per month Qobuz were asking for was just too much when I've already got that YouTube Premium subscription (and my daughter's Spotify) on the books. I also thought the mobile app, where I'd be using it a <em>lot</em>, wasn't great.</p><p>Which left me with one last option to try out: Apple Music. The cons here were enough to give me pause: my personal devices are almost all Google-based, there was no native car support (though there wasn't for Qobuz either), no podcast support within the same app and Apple, while not as genocide-friendly as Spotify, were still run by a guy who has<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/16/silicon-valley-ceo-trump-business-00564524?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>repeatedly embarrassed himself bending the knee</u></a>.</p><p>The pros were that Apple paid artists twice as much as Spotify, offered some lovely high-quality formats and the design of their app is lightyears ahead of the competition. So I took the plunge, installed it on a bunch of devices, kicked off a family plan and so far, so good.</p><p>The lossless audio sounds incredible on my car's sound system (even if I have to plug in my phone and use Android Auto to enjoy it). I love the desktop app, and the mobile app is beautiful. In a very Apple way everything is simple, clear and just <em>works</em>. Compared to YouTube Music's woes and Spotify's bloat, it's been a genuine pleasure opening up Apple Music and just...playing some music.</p><p>The best part though, and this would apply to anyone moving to or from any major platform these days, is that in the years since my last transition the process of transplanting your library has gotten a lot easier. I paid $5 for a one-month Soundiiz membership, hooked it up to both platforms and within 10 minutes I had copied my whole library over–albums, playlists, the works. My music collection in Apple Music now looks exactly like it did on Spotify without skipping a beat.</p><p>Actually that's not quite true; my library had been <em>improved </em>a little, with two of my favourite albums of all time now back in my collection (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/20/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie-interview-leaving-spotify-free-music?ref=aftermath.site"><u>King Gizzard had pulled both <em>Infest The Rat's Nest</em> and <em>PetroDragonic Apocalypse</em> in protest over Spotify's military investments</u></a>).</p><figure></figure><p>The whole experience ended up being much more painless on a technical level than I'd been expecting, but then, it had also wound up being more depressing than I'd bargained for. It feels like my move to Apple Music isn't the permanent one I'd been hoping for; it's more convenient at the moment, but it's far from a perfect situation. I know, in my heart, that I need to go back to just buying music off artists, ditching convenience for something that actually helps the people making the music I love so much.</p><p>The problem is that, like so many other things that are easy and ruinous in our lives at the moment--Netflix, Game Pass, etc--it's just too easy. I can't give up hours-long feeds of lo-fi electronic music while I work at my desk, or the luxury of being able to skip through entire artist catalogues in my car whenever the fancy takes me. Even though I've now made a slightly more palatable decision on where to spend my money, I am still part of the problem.</p><figure><a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/a-complete-guide-to-quitting-spotify?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>How to quit Spotify</p><p>This Black Friday, here’s a guide to finding the best Spotify alternative</p><p><span>Brian Merchant</span></p></div></a></figure>

      <p>Kensuke Ushio, composer for anime works like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2tk1gzE8eo&amp;list=OLAK5uy_lPmRxtxp5_nE_qX-3vUHoGf2sFeGfB_9Q&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Devilman Crybaby</u></em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYURSz_GF7Y&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nq91NTOs3Pj9IdQOWyE_iVM_sPhqZVVAE&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Dan Da Dan</u></em></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04aZ3zbSR98&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nRZk9UF7eJVjPKrziCvEYewFRgUMcS4bE&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Ping Pong The Animation</u></em></a>, has earned a strong reputation for sonic excellence among anime aficionados. But when the <em>Chainsaw Man</em> composer first read <a href="https://aftermath.site/chainsaw-man-reze-arc-tatsuki-fujimoto-the-bible/"><u>Tatsuki Fujimoto’s lauded Shonen Jump series</u></a>, his reaction was a common refrain for anyone who read the series: “I fell in love with it, but at the same time I also thought, this is insane.” As the battle-tested connective tissue for for the tonal ping pong between heartbreak and action of the TV series, pressure was on for Ushio to cook up a soundtrack as musically insane enough to underscore its first theatrical film, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/chainsaw-man-the-movie-reze-arc-review-anime-mappa-2000675933?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</u></em></a><em>. </em>It's safe to say Ushio cooked up yet another generational banger—this time of the peak emotional damage variety.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/24ib7cbOsm0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Listening to the Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc OST be like"></iframe></figure><p><em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em> might go down as one of, if not the, anime film of 2025. The film, which adapts arguably the manga’s most devastating arc, is a literal battle for one’s heart. More specifically, hero Denji is caught in his first brush with genuine love with an enigmatic and explosive manic pixie dream girl, Reze, while keeping his heart from getting ripped from his chest in a cataclysmic battle with the Bomb Devil. For <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em>, the score’s identity owes a lot to <em>Chainsaw Man</em> manga author Fujimoto’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23324559/movies-like-chainsaw-man-influences-watch-streaming/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>unbridled love of cinema</u></a>. Appropriately, its genre-blending score further enriches the first theatrical movie for the series. Just in time for the film's <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-12-07/sony-releases-chainsaw-man-reze-arc-film-on-digital-on-december-9/.231765?ref=aftermath.site"><u>home video arrival</u></a>, I spoke with Ushio to ask him how he orchestrated the remarkably moving score for <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em>.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EPaoHkV0dYw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="CHAINSAW MAN – THE MOVIE: REZE ARC - New Trailer | DUB (HD)"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert:</strong> <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc </em>introduces a tonal shift in <em>Chainsaw Man</em>’s story. One that’s more romantic and tragic. How did you approach scoring this film differently from the TV series? Were there sonic motifs or textures you deliberately abandoned or accentuated?</p><p><strong>Kensuke Ushio:</strong> For the movie, I wanted to use a full orchestra extensively. From the very beginning, even during the production of the TV series, we all talked about how the <em>Reze Arc</em> might become a movie. If we were going to make the <em>Reze Arc</em> into a movie, I thought it would be best to use a large orchestra in an environment capable of properly reproducing everything from soft to loud sounds, using good speakers. The overall planning for the entire <em>Chainsaw Man </em>franchise has been done to a certain extent, so for this film, I consciously decided to use a large orchestra.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> Are you a fan of the <em>Chainsaw Man</em> manga yourself? If so, what aspects of it resonate with you as its anime series composer? How does it compare to other series you’ve scored in terms of how it invites musical interpretation?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> I knew about <em>Chainsaw Man</em>. That being said, in Japan, sometimes they run campaigns (on manga sites, etc.) where the first three chapters of a manga are free… So I only initially read through those. I didn’t properly read the entire story until after I got the offer as composer. After reading, I fell in love with it, but at the same time I also thought, this is insane. Like when the characters start discussing “<a href="https://youtu.be/h5HGyS373bo?list=PLRe9ARNnYSY7jDfcQFiycXWGBPhFFC7n5&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>killing Denji off</u></a>,” (a line that also comes up in the Arc), or how every girl Denji falls in love with tries to kill him, or turning the page to find tons of people dead. I thought it was such a mess. But that’s what I found so appealing, and I decided to make that kind of chaos, which isn’t found in other works, the core concept of my compositions. Ideas like this, born directly from the source material, really felt unique to this work.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote>— kensuke ushio (@agraph) <a href="https://twitter.com/agraph/status/1968968423183913310?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">September 19, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Were you given access to early cuts or storyboards of the film to guide your scoring, or did you work from mood briefs and thematic direction alone when composing its original soundtrack?</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> In the earliest stages, I composed music using materials like storyboards and what are called “setting documents” —things like, “the character has this kind of face,” “we’ll use these colors,” or “this is the final look we’re aiming for.” I also worked on the music alongside the script. Partway through, a rough cut version comes in, so I watch that and then refine things further. This time, the sound director was <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=208&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Mr. [Yasushi] Nagura</u></a>, a colleague I’ve worked with on projects like <em>A Silent Voice </em>and <em>Liz and the Blue Bird</em>. He understands my character and work as a composer well, so he gave me plenty of freedom and breathing room, which, thanks to that, made me able to compose freely.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>How does your process shift when you’re composing with visual materials versus prompts? Do you find that one approach opens up more unexpected, creatively rich possibilities than the other?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> It isn’t so much a matter of artistic sensibility and process as it is a professional skill issue. Specifically, when someone says something like, “The music should start here in the footage and develop from here,” the length they are referring to is the footage’s duration—not four bars or eight bars—so it’s completely non-musical. So then, you end up having to fit music into spaces like three bars, one beat, and 0.5 seconds. When creating purely from imagination, I can work in musical units. But film scoring—matching sound to film—is a job that involves tackling these impossible demands, and that’s really the fundamental difference. Film scoring is tough in that sense, yet conversely, scales like three measures, one beat, and 0.5 seconds are timeframes I'd never conceive of myself, so in that way, it feels creative. But at the same time, I think it's an incredibly difficult process.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">たのしー <a href="https://t.co/jfWDpwPNNE?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/jfWDpwPNNE</a></p>— kensuke ushio (@agraph) <a href="https://twitter.com/agraph/status/1996479484695036376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">December 4, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>The anime series is known for its fragmented, industrial sound that’s equal parts jagged and visceral in short bursts. In contrast, how did the film’s format and pacing influence your compositional choices?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> That’s a tough question. This film, <em>Chainsaw Man: The Movie – Reze Arc</em>, is a 100-minute work. That means the story has to unfold at a pretty brisk pace. Now, this might stray a bit from your question's intent, but the music in the film has the function of making 5 minutes feel like 10, or 7 minutes feel like 3. So, for example, I compose each piece thinking about things like, “Let's make it feel like a slow date with Makima-san,” or “Let's make the battle feel like it ends in an instant.” The film's overall structure starts with a boy-meets-girl introduction, builds to a grand epic battle, and culminates in a poignant ending. We crafted it to feel like climbing a hill, gradually building momentum. That's a major difference from the TV series.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/popVaqPlOFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc | OST -  02 - our film"></iframe></figure><p>Also, I’m usually a dance music artist, and last year I performed live with <em>Chainsaw Man</em> tracks. The feeling of keeping audiences dancing nonstop to <em>Chainsaw Man </em>tracks in nightclubs across Europe and Japan has really influenced how I structure the music, especially in the latter half. That aspect might be particularly special this time around.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Did the longer runtime allow for more thematic development or restraint to underscore scenes?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> There are two perspectives here—a broad one and a detailed one. Broadly speaking, if a 100-minute film had a new melody every second or minute, it would become overwhelming. So we used a technique called a leitmotif, where one melody is reused in various ways; that's how we approached it. But on the other hand, the final battle scene is essentially one long battle throughout the latter half. You know how DJs who only play big hits get annoying, right? So for that part, I aimed for restraint, or rather, structured it with a mix of pace and tension.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c7kh-Tj1jOs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="CHAINSAW MAN - THE MOVIE: REZE ARC Clip - Bomb Devil Face Off"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Is there a particular track from the <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em> score you feel most emotionally attached to? What about its structure, instrumentation, or context makes it resonate with you personally?　</p><p><strong>KU: </strong>It’s not quite the same as having sentimental attachment, but if we're talking personal taste, there's a song called “<a href="https://youtu.be/Q5qwsqnwDEQ?si=kBskLNcl2vyaqLYC&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>slow summer eve</u></a>” (Track 13). That piano tone… how to describe it? Like an old music practice room with dust dancing in the setting sun...I've loved upright pianos with that kind of tone forever, since I was a kid... I've spent all this time honing my craft just to achieve that tone and that kind of phrasing. So, I think it's wonderful that a song like that came to be in a movie loved by so many people.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mWacdcatC9o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="”Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc” Official Teaser ／ 劇場版『チェンソーマン レゼ篇』公式ティザーPV"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>“In the Pool” stands out as the longest track on the <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em> album, and arguably one of its most emotionally charged. It carries this dreamlike quality that’s romantic and suspended in time with its strings and piano riffs—yet there’s a subtle menace that creeps in toward the end. It later reprises in “In the Sea,” echoing the emotional fallout of Reze and Denji. How did you arrive at that particular piano motif—one that feels equally romantic and haunting? Was it born from the visual rhythm of the scene from the film or manga, a thematic suggestion, or something more intuitive in your creative process?</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> By the time we made the teaser trailer announcing the upcoming <em>Reze Arc</em> film at the end of 2023’s JUMP FESTA, this song and the song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR7Szd_qY0c&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nszyFgNx1NresQcnH_P8qL7DoWhe0j1pg&amp;index=28&amp;pp=8AUB&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Reze</u></a>” (Track 28) had already been completed. While discussing which track to use for the teaser, we decided the song that would eventually become “in the pool” had a theme that was too deep and heavy to use effectively in a teaser, it was too profound for that purpose. So, we chose “Reze” instead, as it sounded more beautiful and light. However, both Director <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=79001&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>[Tatsuya] Yoshihara</u></a> and I absolutely loved the song that inspired “in the pool.” We kept saying until the very end that we wanted to use this one for the teaser, so we absolutely wanted to use that song in the film. Director Yoshihara and I called the song that became “in the pool” “our song” (laughs).</p><p>At that stage, there was still no script, no storyboards, no structure—nothing. The track was made intuitively, thinking about the character of Reze.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pzkm1EmgmMI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc | OST -  09 - in the pool"></iframe></figure><p>Your observation about “in the pool” becoming increasingly unsettling towards the end is spot on. While “in the pool” starts with a bittersweet melody like “boy meets girl,” towards the end, it incorporates chords reminiscent of late Romantic composers, or perhaps modern Russia. It has a melancholic resonance, like longing for home, structured so that Reze's background creeps up on you. Nice catch.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> Reze herself is elusive, seductive, and ultimately lethal, but MAPPA redoubled its animation efforts to make her cuteness shine the brightest through Denji’s eyes. For her eponymous track, what word or mood were you going for to embody her as a character?</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> As I mentioned, that melody was already formed at a very early stage. But it developed into the final “Reze” song roughly during the middle to latter stage of music production. I wanted to create a sense of Reze's lethality, or rather... a melancholy feeling. So, I incorporated a lot of sounds like faint, raspy noises—almost like sounds before they become sounds—using instruments like the violin. Me, the orchestrator, and the violinist worked together, using the violin to layer in sounds where the bow barely touches the strings. We recorded many layers of these sounds, things that seemed like they might vanish away. I think that really became a defining element in shaping her.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1gGX5ajpPr8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="“Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc” –  &quot;Jane slept in the church&quot; ／劇場版『チェンソーマン レゼ篇』「ジェーンは教会で眠った」"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Track 12, “<a href="https://youtu.be/lggJlm4QeEE?si=UOK0JDoZQOEIn7jG&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jane Slept in the Church</u></a>,” is the only spoken word piece on the album. It's stark, unaccompanied, and deeply unsettling. It mirrors a moment from both the manga and anime where Reze sings in Russian while strangling an assassin, evoking a kind of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_9KNP9I6YA&amp;pp=ygUqbm8gY291bnRyeSBmb3Igb2xkIG1hbiBzdHJhbmd1bGF0aW9uIHNjZW5l&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>No Country for Old Men</u></em></a> with how quiet, intimate, and lethal the scene is. What led you to strip away all instrumentation and let the voice stand alone? Was it about amplifying the psychological tension, honoring the manga’s eerie stillness, or something else entirely? What did that sonic choice enunciate to you about Reze’s character or the emotional architecture of the scene as its composer?<strong>　&nbsp;</strong></p><figure><figcaption><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>KU: </strong>Abstractly speaking, that scene is where Reze comes into close-up. So, the camera and the microphone are right in front of her, incredibly close. You can even hear her own lip noise. If you're going to hear her singing with bated breath, I thought it would be better without any instruments. There's a man named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Chion?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Michel Chion</u></a>, who is both a film music composer and a leading authority on film music studies. In terms of what he calls “the possible forms of film music,” that scene features “music playing within the film itself.” You can't just add accompaniment to that, can you?</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>How does scoring anime differ from your solo or band projects? Do you find it to be a collaborative extension of your voice, or does it demand a different kind of authorship in instrumentation? 　<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>KU:</strong> Creating film scores is vastly different from solo or band work—it feels like a completely different genre, a completely different profession. I'm the type who spends five or even ten years on a single solo track... but with film scores, you have to create something in just a day or two. It's like the difference between a sprint and a marathon. Also, the goal of film scoring isn't to make great music; it's to make a great film. That aspect is completely different from the obsessive focus I have in my solo work. So, film scoring isn't about expanding my own musicality.　</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yz4GGVPRA68?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="agraph - greyscale (video edit)"></iframe></figure><p>My solo work involves years and years of meticulous research into various new areas, making it closer to research and development. It feels like taking the insights gained there—specifically things like synthesizer sounds, microphone techniques, compositional methods—things I researched and developed myself—and applying them to the soundtrack. It's like broadly applying the R&amp;D from my solo work to film scores.</p><p>On the other hand, I think it's a very positive spiral when someone who is both a film composer and an artist incorporates things they've tried in film music into their own work. I have that desire too, but I haven't done it yet.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/61DQLOKLNPU?start=112&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="DEVILMAN NIGHT kensuke ushio LIVE＠WOMB ダイジェスト"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Has your work in scoring anime, especially high-profile works like <em>A Silent Voice</em>, <em>Devilman Crybaby</em>, <em>Dan Da Dan</em>, and <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, shaped your career trajectory in ways you didn’t expect? Or do you see it as a core path to your personal music-making?</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> It’s not necessarily the core of my work. I just happened to be making music when someone asked, “Why don't you try making a soundtrack?” It sounded fun, so I did it. I don't think soundtrack production will ever become the core of my music. However, I couldn't write orchestral scores on my own. But as the leader of the production team, I can create large-scale pieces like “in the pool” at that scale. Since I work in electronic music, if I'd been working solo, I never would have learned how to create such large orchestral arrangements. There's that unexpected acquisition of skills.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>When the credits roll on <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em>, your music will linger with audiences as they sit and reflect on the film before leaving the theater. What do you hope audiences carry with them after hearing your score throughout the movie? Is there a feeling, rhythm, or silence you hope stays with them long after the film ends? 　</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> Whether I'm working solo or on film scores, I basically create music without lyrics. I want to make music that transcends words. So, to be specific, there's nothing I want you to take away within the realm of words. However, I can tell that you all are feeling something, because I'm receiving so much feedback right now, and I'm really happy about that.</p>
