We appreciate the time and effort you spent in preparing your application.</p><p>We've reviewed your application and are sorry to inform you that we'll not proceed with your application this time. This decision was as challenging as the toughest game level, as we had to consider many relevant candidates.</p><p>Although this quest didn't result in a win, we hope you'll consider applying for future roles that align with your experience, skills, and personality. We value your interest in our gaming universe and invite you to continue exploring our job openings.</p><p>Once again, thanks for showing an interest in joining our team. Keep gaming and good luck in your future quests!</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>You have got to be fucking kidding me. These responses are being sent to adults applying for jobs in a billion-dollar industry. If you work at this company, and you'll know if you do, do better. If you know someone who works here, tell them to do better. If you do something similar, or are thinking about it, do not.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-disability-pride-last-of-us-forza"><h3>Why Disability Journalism In Games Needs To Evolve Beyond Marketing</h3></a><p>"We’ve conditioned ourselves to believe that we’re all one big happy family"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/plushie-lawsuit-emotional-support-chicken-nuggets-what-do-you-meme"><h3>Plushie Maker Suing Over ‘Emotional Support Chicken Nuggets’</h3></a><p>It’s a pretty standard copyright and trademark infringement case, despite being about stuffed chicken nuggets.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/video-game-industry-layoffs-rejection-letter]]></content:encoded>
