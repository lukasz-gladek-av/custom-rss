            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill filed a lawsuit last week alleging that publisher Krafton intentionally obstructed and delayed the development of <em>Subnautica 2</em> in what they describe in the complaint, which was unsealed to the public and reviewed by Aftermath on Wednesday, as the company's "desperate efforts to avoid paying the earnout, and its flagrant contractual breaches in pursuit of that goal."</p><p>Unknown Worlds is responsible for <em>Subnautica</em>, the 2018 underwater survival game that, by all measures, was a hit. Krafton, the major South Korean publisher known for <em>PUBG Battlegrounds</em>, acquired Unknown Worlds in 2021 for $250 million, plus a bonus of $250 million that would be paid out by meeting certain milestones. Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill were fired in July before Krafton delayed the game into 2026, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thereby putting the bonus payout in jeopardy</a>. Bloomberg reported last week that Unknown Worlds leadership intended to share the money with the studio's roughly 100 employees, which would have earned staff "hundreds of thousands of dollars to seven figures" each, per Bloomberg's report. Krafton, <a href="https://krafton.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a statement published on its website</a>, said the fired executives "abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them."</p><p>Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill disputed that, and announced they were filing a lawsuit, the details of which are now public. In it, the executives lay out the timeline that claims Krafton was worried about <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s projected success and how much money the company would have to pay out. "As momentum for <em>Subnautica 2</em> was building, the reality of what this would mean for the earnout hit Krafton. When that happened, everything changed," lawyers wrote in the complaint.&nbsp;</p><p>Several Unknown Worlds' "publishing colleagues" from Krafton's El Segundo office met with Krafton in South Korea to "finalize the marketing and advertising strategy" in April, and when they returned to the United States, told Gill that "Krafton leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game," per the complaint.</p><p>"The El Segundo colleagues informed Gill that Krafton’s legal team was combing through the agreements looking for any opening to terminate the Founders if they proceeded with the planned [redacted] release," lawyers wrote. "The El Segundo colleagues told Gill it was clear that Krafton was aiming to avoid paying the earnout."</p><p>Lawyers write that Krafton “engaged in a months-long campaign to delay <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s release,” including that the company “pulled key marketing materials, refused to follow through with crucial partnerships, and reneged on long-standing commitments to handle important prelaunch tasks.” The 58-page lawsuit, filed in early July in the Delaware Chancery Court, goes into detail on what the fired executives call an “obstructist agenda” — Krafton allegedly stopped paying vendors, which impacted Krafton’s marketing support, like trailers and a PC Gamer magazine cover; pulled localization help, back-end services like “analytics and server infrastructure,” legal support for contract review, and policy review for the game’s terms of use. The executives claim, via one Krafton employee in the El Segundo, California, office, that Krafton employees were instructed to stop “<em>all</em> creative tasks related to <em>Subnautica 2</em>” and to stop communicating with Unknown Worlds.</p><p>In May, the executives allege, Krafton “advanced the new company line” that “<em>Subnautica 2</em> was not ready.” That included a milestone review, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/lXgAdej" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which has since leaked online</a>, in which Krafton described the game as lacking polish and “market impact.” It showed biomes being removed, fewer creatures, and cut content — signifying “the need to reassess the timeline and roadmap,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the leaked documents that Krafton has since confirmed as real</a>. The executives, in the lawsuit, characterize this review as Krafton’s “obstructionist tactics,” saying that the people who did the review were not experts in survival games nor releasing early access games. The executives pushed back the feedback, according to the lawsuit, and showed that playtest data from community members “unequivocally confirmed that the game was ready to go.” (Earlier in the lawsuit, lawyers call out Krafton’s previous early access game, <em>inZOI</em>, as launching with “less content and being less developed than <em>Subnautica 2</em>; allegedly, Krafton executives expected <em>Subnautica 2</em> would “easily double” <em>inZOI</em>’s 1.1 million sold copies “with proper publishing support.”)</p><p>Krafton began sending letters — “an intimidation campaign,” per the complaint — to the founders on June 10, “falsely accus[ing] the Founders of failing to fulfill their contractual responsibilities and violating their fiduciary duties.” On June 18, according to the document, a Krafton executive met with Gill to “attempt to get the Founders to accept a lower earnout.” The executives claim the offer “did not allow them to share the earnout with the full team, so the Founders declined.” Negotiation continued through late June before Krafton fired the three executives and removed them from the Unknown Worlds board of directors. Steve Papoutsis was named CEO of Unknown Worlds and Krafton announced the game would be delayed until 2026.</p><p>“Krafton flagrantly breached both the letter and the spirit of the promises at the very core of its agreement to purchase Unknown Worlds,” lawyers wrote. “It promised to leave creative and operational control in the hands of the Founders. Promise broken. It promised to consult with the Founders before taking any action that could harm the earnout. Promise broken. It promised not to take any action with the primary business purpose of frustrating the earnout. Promise broken. And it promised not to terminate the Founders without Cause. Promise broken.”</p><p>The lawsuit also details continues in detailing what it describes as Krafton’s attempt in “harming Unknown Worlds’ relationship with its fan community” by posting on the game and studio websites “a statement apologizing for Subnautica taking ‘far longer than any of us ever intended’ and making allegations about Cleveland and McGuire’s alleged roles.” It also includes the community response to the public dispute, including headlines, YouTube screenshots, social media posts, and Reddit threads commenting on — and worrying about — the executive firings and subsequent delay.</p><p>The executives say Krafton breached their purchase agreement contract and want the court to order the company to pay up the earnout fee, reinstate the founders’ jobs and board of directors seats, and pay other damages. The purchase agreement signed by both the fired executives and Krafton allegedly made it so the founders would “maintain operational control of the Group companies in all material respects, including (for both existing and new products) product roadmap, launch, planning, partnering, budgeting and employee matters,’ so long as at least one of the three of them was still employed.”Krafton declined to comment. On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg reported</a> that Krafton intends to “extend the schedule for a potential bonus payout” for Unknown Worlds. Forty or so Unknown Worlds employees will be “eligible to share a $25 million bonus” if revenue goals are met by the end of 2025, “with a possible short-term expansion,” per the report. Bloomberg sources said the schedule for that $25 million bonus has been extended a year, and that Krafton will “advance a portion of the studio’s projected 2026 profit-sharing bonus pool,” something separate from the $25 million bonus, to all employees in 2025.</p><p>You can read the lawsuit below:</p><p><em>This story has been updated.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms"><h3>A Salute To The 13%</h3></a><p>Let them live a little</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/horror-anime-crunchyroll-netflix-hikaru-takopi"><h3>Your Guide To Feel-Bad-Anime Summer</h3></a><p>The Summer Hikaru Died and Takopi’s Original Sin are a throwback to the disturbing, horrifying anime of yesteryear</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/high-wheel-bike-race-frederick"><h3>The Penny Farthing Is Alive And Well In 2025</h3></a><p>The National Clustered Spires High Wheel Race takes place every summer in Frederick, Maryland</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/unknown-worlds-lawsuit-subnautica-2]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-worry-about-me-being-a-nepo-baby-says-nepo-baby.1245501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year, Ubisoft <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a $1.25 billion bailout from Tencent</a>, resulting in the creation of a new subsidiary – partially owned by Tencent – that will take charge of Ubisoft’s three biggest series: <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. While details of how the operation will function remain sparse, we now know who’ll head it up: co-CEOs Christophe Derennes, former head of Ubisoft Montreal and managing director for North America who’s been with the company for over three decades, and Charlie Guillemot, whose main distinguishing feature is that he’s Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot’s son.&nbsp;</p><p>Is Guillemot the very definition of a nepo baby? I mean, yeah, sure, probably. Don’t worry about it, though!</p><p>"I’d like to address this question directly, if I may," Guillemot said in response to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a question from Variety about nepotism</a>. "I completely understand where it comes from, and I want to be clear about it. Yes, I’m Yves’ son. That’s not something I hide from. But my appointment isn’t only about family ties; it’s about what Ubisoft needs at this moment. ... What matters now isn’t my name, it’s the work ahead."</p><p>Guillemot also reassured Variety that he’s spent the past decade "building experience both inside and outside Ubisoft,” which is true. For example, he ran the Ubisoft studio behind <em>Tom Clancy’s Elite Squad</em>, which found itself in the crosshairs of controversy in 2020 after launching with an intro that was widely panned for <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-apologizes-for-tom-clancy-game-imagery-that-sug-1844892904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playing on right-wing conspiracies about Black Lives Matter</a>. He then struck out on his own to launch a Web3 studio called Unagi, which has predictably pivoted into AI but is also still clinging desperately to NFTs, before beaming back onto the Ubisoft fathership.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft has faced a great deal of criticism for its continued status as a pop ‘n’ pop (‘n’ pop ‘n’ pop) shop. The company was founded by five Guillemot brothers – Yves, Christian, Claude, Gérard, and Michel – in 1986, with four remaining in positions of power at the company to this day. However, recent times have not been kind to the Guillemot family’s reputation; allegations of widespread sexual abuse, harassment, and discrimination <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-and-insomniac-face-dozens-of-allegations-over-mistreatment-of-women" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit the company in 2020</a>, leading to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-france" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the conviction of three former Ubisoft executives</a> following a 2025 trial.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft’s business has also swirled a precarious drain in recent years, with sales of expected hits, like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, coming in “<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/star-wars-outlaws-coming-to-steam-in-november-sales-have-been-softer-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">softer than expected</a>” while longer-tail online games like <em>Skull And Bones</em> and <em>XDefiant</em> have floundered and failed. Despite this, the Guillemot family reportedly <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ubisoft-buyout-talks-are-reportedly-progressing-but-theres-one-small-hitch-the-guillemot-family-wants-to-stay-in-charge-but-tencent-isnt-so-sure-about-that/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fought to remain in charge</a> during pre-deal talks with Tencent, and now, here we are.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, best of luck to Charlie in his new role. After all, everyone deserves a little nepotism, as a treat.</p><p>“Ubisoft is at a pivotal moment,” he told Variety. “What’s expected of me is to help push the company forward by bringing energy, focus, and by relying on the incredible expertise that already exists across the teams. I see myself as someone here to contribute, support, and help create the right conditions are in place for everyone to do their best work.”</p><p>Sure! Cool! Whatever that means!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms"><h3>A Salute To The 13%</h3></a><p>Let them live a little</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/horror-anime-crunchyroll-netflix-hikaru-takopi"><h3>Your Guide To Feel-Bad-Anime Summer</h3></a><p>The Summer Hikaru Died and Takopi’s Original Sin are a throwback to the disturbing, horrifying anime of yesteryear</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/high-wheel-bike-race-frederick"><h3>The Penny Farthing Is Alive And Well In 2025</h3></a><p>The National Clustered Spires High Wheel Race takes place every summer in Frederick, Maryland</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-ceo-charlie-guillemot]]></content:encoded>
