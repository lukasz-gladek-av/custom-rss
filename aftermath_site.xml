            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-holiday-break-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s the end of the year as we know it, and we’re feeling fine – largely because we are all blessedly taking a soft break and have already begun to regenerate the many cells we obliterated in the course of running an independent video game website for just over 365 days. In the short term, this means there will be fewer blogs on the site as we rest and recuperate for the next couple weeks. But! We’ll still be running stories here and there.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, we’d like to thank all of you for the incredible support you’ve shown this past year. Aftermath – and the many fun, interesting, and occasionally indulgent pieces we’ve been able to write – wouldn’t exist without you. Independence is empowering but also terrifying; there’s no institutional safety net to catch us when we fall (and then unceremoniously lay us off about it). By subscribing, you’ve provided us with assurance that you, our readers, have our backs and value what we do. We plan to continue making it worth your while. We’ve got big plans for next year, and we hope you’re as excited as we are to see what’s to come.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, though, if you need some holiday reading – or if you’re just joining us, as many of you did during our anniversary sale last month – here are some of our greatest hits:</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/how-a-leftist-meme-account-accidentally-fooled-everyone-into-believing-a-famous-quote-came-from-final-fantasy-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How A Leftist Meme Account Accidentally Fooled Everyone Into Believing A Famous Quote Came From Final Fantasy</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/making-a-skating-game-set-in-palestine-has-become-an-act-of-resistance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Making A Skating Game Set In Palestine Has Become An Act Of Resistance</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/its-exhausting-trying-to-read-video-game-website-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It's Exhausting To Read Video Game Website Headlines</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/the-worlds-best-stereo-system-what-happened-ken-fritz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What Happened To “The World’s Best Stereo System?”</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/dry-january-sober-curious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You Could Just Keep Doing Dry January</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-an-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games Journalism: An FAQ</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-game-development-ign-kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why So Many Games Journalists End Up Going Into Game Development&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-vii-fandom-parasocial-heartbreak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Very Dumb Reason Why I Can’t Play Final Fantasy VII</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/nobody-needs-to-know-how-many-people-are-playing-a-singleplayer-video-game-nobody" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nobody Needs To Know How Many People Are Playing A Singleplayer Video Game.
