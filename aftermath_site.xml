"The future of Giant Bomb is now in the hands of our supporting community, who have always had our backs no matter what. We'll have a lot more to say about what this looks like soon, but for now, everyone can trust that all the support we receive goes directly to this team."</p><p>A statement issued by Fandom, meanwhile, says:</p><blockquote><p>Fandom has made the strategic decision to transition Giant Bomb back to its independent roots and the brand has been acquired by longtime staff and content creators, Jeff Bakalar and Jeff Grubb, who will now own and operate the site independently. Fans are at the core of everything we do at Fandom and we’re committed to not only serving them but also supporting the creators they love, and the sale of Giant Bomb represents a natural extension of that mission. We’re confident Giant Bomb is in good hands and its legacy will live on with Jeff and Jeff.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>There's an announcement post on their site <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/join" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/get-premium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can check out pricing here</a> (you can subscribe for $9.99 a month or $99 a year).</p><p>The financials involved "were not disclosed", and the statement also says "Giant Bomb’s programming, which was paused in order to work out the terms of this deal, will resume as quickly as possible".</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-ai-business-ed-zitron"><h3>We’re In The Era Of The Business Idiot</h3></a><p>"We’re watching what happens when the people who don’t really understand work control everything"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
