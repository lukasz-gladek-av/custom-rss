            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Friday, I went to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3ly54pyazjk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a rave</a> celebrating a series about fleet-footed anime girls based on real-life race horses. Today, the most-beloved of those IRL inspirations, a dismally untalented horse named Haru Urara, died at age 29, which is pretty old for a horse. An incredible number of people – far more than anyone ever would have expected even a scant few months ago – are in mourning.</p><p>The official Twitter account of <em>Umamusume</em>, the aforementioned <a href="https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anime horse girl sensation</a> that continues to sweep multiple nations, broke the news to fans earlier today.</p><p>“It is with heavy hearts that we share that Haru Urara passed away on September 9,” <a href="https://x.com/umamusume_eng/status/1965367711531434346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote the account</a>, which has become <a href="https://x.com/umamusume_eng/status/1953800765572632981?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something of a horse death tracker</a> in recent months. “The legendary racehorse's legacy serves as the inspiration for the character of the same name in <em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>. We share our condolences to all the staff involved in Haru Urara's care.”</p><p>Across social media, fans have come together to celebrate the not-so-mighty mare’s life.&nbsp;</p><p>“Rest in peace, you will forever live in our hearts, our shining hope,” reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UmaMusume/comments/1nce1jh/comment/nd8hotc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one comment on Reddit</a> that’s received thousands of upvotes.</p><p>"I came to [university] to do something I loved and started hating cuz of uni and the competition, and AI is taking the role I am going with," reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UmaMusume/comments/1nce1jh/comment/nd8jwp8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a>. "Haru Urara['s] story gave me a second wind, and I am going ballistic with my side projects and getting myself better. It's because Haru never gave up and enjoyed the run. Losing is never painful if you are enjoying your run. REST IN PEACE Haru Urara."</p><p>Many, many others have shared fan art of Haru Urara’s <em>Umamusume </em>character, including <a href="https://x.com/LuisArreol33565/status/1965370342681313323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an image of her being reunited</a> with other in-game characters whose IRL inspirations have passed.</p><p>Race horses are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/15/medina-spirit-scandal-horse-abuse-bob-baffert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treated about as well as the dirt they run on</a>, and this goes double for those who underperform. The story of Haru Urara’s career ranks among the saddest; before she retired in 2004, she lost every single one of her 113 races.&nbsp;</p><p>"Race horses are destroyed when they don't win," Haru Urara’s former trainer, Dai Muneishi, <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/world/horse-that-never-wins-has-become-the-toast-of-japan-2459872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told The Scotsman</a> in 2004 (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/millions-of-gamers-on-steam-and-beyond-gather-to-mourn-famously-untalented-horse-who-inspired-the-beloved-anime-girl-in-umamusume-haru-urara-may-she-get-all-the-grass-and-carrots-in-heaven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamesradar</a>). "But to my way of thinking, a horse is also a living being, and it's inexcusable to destroy it at the mere whim of humans."</p><p>Muneishi also described Haru Urara as “physically small” and fearful of other horses. As a result, training her to race was an ordeal.</p><p>The tide began to turn for Haru Urara in 2003, at the tail end of her time on the tracks, when Japanese media took notice of her unlikely record, which then stood at a mere 80 consecutive losses. That sudden surge in popularity saved her life; in 2003 her then-owner <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/travel/destinations/asia-travel/japan/horse-on-losing-trot-could-be-worlds-worst-lh9p86fnjbt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told The Times</a> that she’d been on a collision course with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knacker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the knacker’s yard</a> prior to that point.&nbsp;</p><p>At the peak of her fame in 2004, Haru Urara was dubbed “the shining star of losers everywhere” and lured 13,000 spectators out to the Kochi Racetrack in Kochi, Japan where, despite being ridden by Japan's top jockey, Yutaka Take, she lost her 106th race.</p><p>At the time, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3558275.stm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC wrote</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Japanese television ran footage of the race, focusing on the mare with her trademark pink "Hello Kitty" hood.</p><p>"All the fans seem to be going home happy," a reporter covering for Asahi TV said.</p><p>"They feel that it was OK for her to lose."</p><p>Correspondents say Haru Urara, the eternal loser who does not give up, has struck a chord with those Japanese who have lost most during the past decade of economic stagnation and job losses.</p><p>Her spectacular lack of success is also proving as profitable as it is inspirational. Kochi racecourse, nearly bankrupt, has seen its revenues shoot up.</p><p>Others are also cashing in with "Haru" tours, t-shirts, good luck charms said to contain a hair from her tail, books, and postage stamps. There is a pop song about her and a movie is in the works.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Haru Urara’s career <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%AB%E3%82%A6%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A9#CITEREF%E9%80%B1%E5%88%8A%E6%96%B0%E6%BD%AE2008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concluded</a> with a dispute between her trainer, owner, and others about whether she remained fit to race – along with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UmaMusume/comments/1mn9uuj/untold_stories_of_haru_urara_you_will_barely_find/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speculation</a> about involved parties attempting to squeeze another financial windfall out of her – after which she spent the next handful of years involved in her owner’s therapy and education efforts. There were also plans to breed her with other famous Japanese horses, but they never fully materialized. Eventually, in 2013, ownership of Haru Urara was transferred to Matha Farm in Japan’s Chiba prefecture, where she lived out the remainder of her days.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Umamusume</em>’s take on Haru Urara, a pink-haired anime girl with a legion of in-game fans despite her penchant for losing, exposed the ancient race horse to a new audience. Her story resonated with younger people in the West as well. Earlier this year, they <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/anime-horse-girls-are-causing-one-real-life-mare-dubbed-the-shining-star-of-losers-everywhere-to-receive-so-much-usd40-grass-she-broke-the-donation-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crashed a website</a> that let them donate $40 ryegrass gifts to her. In the end, <a href="https://namabokusobank.jp/article/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%AB%E3%82%A6%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the website</a>, fans donated a total grass amount of 3,410 kg, or 7,518 lbs. That is too much for one horse to eat, but I’m sure Haru Urara appreciated it on some level.</p><p>Haru Urara <a href="https://friday.kodansha.co.jp/article/438213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">died of colic</a>, a form of gas build up that is often deadly to horses, but was apparently healthy up to that point. I find it difficult not to feel a little weird about a situation in which an animal suffered to make money for a bunch of different people, only to be declared an inspiration for never giving up despite <em>her </em>apparent desire to be doing anything else – and then a lot of other people became parasocially attached to an anime girl, further obscuring, at least in some cases, the wants and needs of real animals trapped in a broken system. But it sounds like Haru Urara lived out her final years in peace, and that’s better than nothing.</p><p>"One of these beautiful tragedies," reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UmaMusume/comments/1nce1jh/comment/nd92he3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a comment</a> on the <em>Umamusume </em>subreddit. "We didn't expect it so soon, but our gal made it to 29 years old. Lived the last of them in absolute luxury and love."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/unikat-32-33-indie-games-publisher-marketing"><h3>Running A Video Games Publisher AND Marketing Agency Sounds Absolutely Exhausting</h3></a><p>'Seeing all of your different efforts, ones that are synced by the work of many people, all being unveiled at once is a cool feeling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-author-immortal-image-comics-interview"><h3>The Author Immortal Is A Metanarrative Isekai Comic That Explores The Messiness Of Separating The Art From The Artist</h3></a><p>Amid canceled creators, cultural reckonings, and A.I.’s rise, Frank Barbiere and Morgan Beem’s new Image Comics series invites readers to reclaim fantasy and confront who stories truly serve
