            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>All the way back in 2022, Microsoft made waves in the video game industry by striking a legally binding agreement with Communications Workers of America (CWA), the union that now represents thousands of workers within the company. “Microsoft will remain neutral when Activision Blizzard employees express interest in joining a union, providing a clear path to collective bargaining for almost 10,000 workers,” read <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2022/06/13/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a joint release</a> from CWA and Microsoft during a time when the latter was facing regulatory scrutiny over its then-proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard. At the time, it seemed like a match made in heaven, but two years later, workers find themselves stuck in bargaining hell.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, approaching the third anniversary of the neutrality agreement and the second anniversary of QA workers at Zenimax – the first video game studio union at Microsoft – beginning the process of bargaining for a contract, CWA says proceedings have stalled. It chalks this up to Microsoft’s failure to address concerns about remote work, an issue that has led to <a href="https://aftermath.site/activision-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-mandate-that-they-see-as-soft-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outcry from workers at other Microsoft-owned companies like Activision</a>, as well as Microsoft’s “unilateral decision to replace in-house quality assurance work with outsourced labor without notifying the union.”</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Microsoft for more details, but the company did not reply as of this publishing.</p><p>While early returns, like <a href="https://aftermath.site/as-video-game-industry-goes-all-in-on-ai-workers-race-to-secure-their-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an agreement to curb destructive uses of AI</a>, seemed promising, <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rounds</a> of mass layoffs soon followed in 2023 and 2024. The relationship between Microsoft and the nascent Zenimax QA union has since devolved.</p><p>“It’s become increasingly clear that although Microsoft tries to position itself as a good-faith employer, there’s another story being told behind the scenes at the bargaining table,” Zenimax Workers United member and senior QA tester Autumn Mitchell said in a statement received by Aftermath. “We are frustrated. Our union will continue fighting until we secure a first contract, and we’re prepared to do whatever it takes – even if that means withholding our labor.”&nbsp;</p><p>This follows demonstrations outside of Zenimax offices in Texas and Maryland last week, as well as <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a strike authorization</a> from the hundreds-strong Zenimax bargaining unit earlier this month, which 94 percent of members voted in favor of. At the time, workers spoke out against return-to-office policies and what they viewed as penny pinching from their corporate overlords.</p><p>“Underpayment and costly RTO initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment,” said Zenimax senior QA Tester Zachary Armstrong in <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a release</a> issued by CWA.</p><p>“Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time,” associate QA Tester Aubrey Litchfield added. “Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We’ve released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grace-sinners"><h3>Grace Did Nothing Wrong</h3></a><p>Some Sinners fans need to ease up on homegirl

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/duolingo-ai<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You’ll remember my <a href="https://aftermath.site/duolingo-gamification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rant against Duolingo</a>, which has now turned one of Aftermath’s Discord channels into a regular vent session as we share the language learning app’s latest follies. (My recent complaint: I pop in to do one lesson and it keeps foisting XP boosts on me, a naked attempt to keep me on the app that absolutely works, because I am a rube.) Well, I’m back with a new complaint, which is the harder pivot to AI Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/657594/duolingo-ai-first-replace-contract-workers?utm_content=buffer2a099&amp;utm_medium=socialpost&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced yesterday</a>. </p><p>In a message to staff also posted to the company’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7322560534824865792/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a>, von Ahn writes that “Duolingo will remain a company that cares deeply about its employees,” then says that the company will be replacing <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/duolingo-cuts-10-contractors-uses-173030211.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more</a> contractors with AI, writing, "We’ll gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle." This is part of the company’s decision to become “AI-first,” a nonsense buzzword that even von Ahn can’t pitch without admitting it sucks, writing (emphasis mine) “Being AI-first means we will need to rethink much of how we work… [W]e can’t wait until the technology is 100% perfect. We’d rather <strong>move with urgency and take occasional small hits on quality</strong> than move slowly and miss the moment.”</p><p>This strategy will also involve considering AI in hiring and performance reviews, whatever that means, and that “headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work.” While von Ahn writes that "This isn’t about replacing Duos with AI" (contractors are indeed not staff) he does write that "It’s about removing bottlenecks so we can do more with the outstanding Duos we already have," which reads to me like a way of fancying up the "do more with less" afflicting countless industries these days.</p><p>In his note, von Ahn seems to claim that these decisions are in service of Duolingo’s mission: </p><blockquote><p>To teach well, we need to create a massive amount of content, and doing that manually doesn’t scale. One of the best decisions we made recently was replacing a slow, manual content creation process with one powered by AI.&nbsp;Without AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners. We owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Rather than use the revenue from Duolingo’s <a href="https://investors.duolingo.com/static-files/99006c40-d8cf-41ca-b5b1-c5cb1fa5ba88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 10 million paid subscribers</a> to hire more experts to create–I cannot stress this enough–<em>learning content that requires subject matter expertise</em>, von Ahn seems to believe that quantity is the top goal, and that its users <em>deserve </em>a flood of what even he admits could be shit. This certainly squares with my own experience of Duolingo, which employs every cheap gamification trick in the book to simply keep me in the app and push me to pay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7322657005800759297/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a>, Duolingo’s chief engineering officer Natalie Glance shared a Slack message she wrote to the engineering team explaining how AI will fit into their work. This message features new directives such as “AI will be everywhere in our product” and “productivity expectations will rise.” Here’s my personal favorite: </p><blockquote><p>Start with AI for every task. No matter how small, try using an AI tool first. It won’t always be faster or better at first–but that’s how you build skill. Don’t give up if the first result is wrong.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Again, these people are <em>literally admitting</em> AI won’t work, but are still asking engineers now laboring under heightened productivity expectations to spend their even-more-precious time managing this sub-par tech. "That's how you build skill" puts the AI tools' failing back on the user, the "<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Have%20Fun%20Staying%20Poor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have fun staying poor</a>" of the AI world, and asks engineers to troubleshoot AI when they could instead be using their <em>real live human skill to do the jobs they were hired for</em>.</p><p>That Duolingo execs can write all this and still insist the company prioritizes humans, whether that’s workers or users, is a staggering level of AI brainrot. None of this helps people. Workers, if they still have jobs, will be asked to pivot to clumsy tools. Users will be fed content Duolingo itself admits could have mistakes; in the language I’m learning, Irish, this is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dean-tane.bsky.social/post/3lnwt46sgps2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already</a> a problem, with the computerized voices mangling the pronunciation to such an extent that I live in dread of the app giving me listening exercises because I often have no clue what it’s attempting to say. All of this means what AI always means: creating more–God help me–<em>content</em> with less people, assuming workers and users are so stupid that we’ll lap up whatever shit is shoved in our faces or crammed into our workflows because the people at the top can’t imagine we’re not as enthralled with the latest fad as they are.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m new enough to Duolingo that giving up my streak or uninstalling the app isn’t a big ask, though I’ll also admit that I’m loathe to give up on all the new vocabulary it’s teaching me. Luckily, I have options: my public library gives me free access to <a href="https://mangolanguages.com/libraries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mango Languages</a>, and I know other libraries have Rosetta Stone or other programs. I’ve recently been experimenting with user-made <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anki decks</a>; the program is much clunkier than Duolingo, but way more customizable and robust. For those of you learning less obscure languages than Irish, I’m sure there’s an even greater wealth of resources out there. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike"><h3>Almost Three Years After Neutrality Agreement, Negotiations Between Microsoft And Unionized Workers Aren’t Going Well</h3></a><p>"Although Microsoft tries to position itself as a good-faith employer, there’s another story being told behind the scenes at the bargaining table"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grace-sinners"><h3>Grace Did Nothing Wrong</h3></a><p>Some Sinners fans need to ease up on homegirl
