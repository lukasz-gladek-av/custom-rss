            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/following-%E2%80%98recent-events-%E2%80%99-mods-lock-helldivers-subreddit-while-helldivers-2-stays-open.1296987/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Due to what they call “recent events,” the moderators of the r/Helldivers subreddit have temporarily closed the community. Meanwhile, the moderators of r/Helldivers2 have decided to keep theirs open.</p><p>At around 11:30 eastern, the moderators of r/Helldivers, which has 1.2 million members, locked the community, meaning that moderator approval is required for all new posts and all new comments on posts. They pinned a message to the subreddit explaining the decision.</p><p>“Due to recent events and the high amount of posts about the topic, we will be locking the subreddit temporarily. We're aware of what happened, our modteam doesn't condone it,”<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nf6g7e/rhelldivers_is_locked_temporarily_requests_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the post reads.</a> “In any case, posts and discussions about it are against this sub's rules regarding real-world political discussions.”</p><p>Although they don’t specifically reference the killing of Charlie Kirk, that is the only recent event that would require condemnation from the moderation team of r/Helldivers. The alleged killer engraved one of his shell casings with the phrase “Hey fascist! Catch!” and then arrows pointing up, right, and three arrows pointing down. Those arrows are the inputs needed to<a href="https://aftermath.site/tyler-robinson-journalism-wsj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> call in the 500kg Eagle bomb in the game <em>Helldivers 2</em></a>.</p><p>There haven’t been any new posts in the r/Helldivers subreddit since 11:15 am ET. Aftermath has reached out to the moderators of r/Helldivers for comment, but they did not reply in time for publication.</p><p>By contrast, the comparatively smaller r/Helldivers2 community—boasting only 318,000 members—have not only kept the community open, but the mods have used <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/helldivers2/comments/1nf5sxh/damn_not_for_nothing_but_its_gonna_be_weird_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a community member’s post</a> about the potential weirdness of having a <em>Helldivers 2</em> tattoo as a “megathread” for discussion on the killing of Charlie Kirk. Megathreads are used by Reddit moderators to keep conversations contained to one post, rather than let their communities be overrun with dozens of posts on the topic. People are allowed to discuss the shooting of Charlie Kirk and its connection to <em>Helldivers</em> <em>2</em>, but in the designated megathread only.</p><p>“Locking it down isn't managed democracy. People can have THIS outlet. It's contained here.&nbsp; You have a place to go and discuss that fine. 5000 places with 2 comments, nope,” wrote one moderator. “Being able to have the conversation is important. It happened for a reason. Unprecedented times etc.”</p><p>Responding to another user asking if today was a weird day to be a r/Helldivers2 moderator, they said it wasn’t anything they couldn’t handle.</p><p>“Community is necessary because of events like this. If we as people spent more time learning about each other and overcoming our differences instead of bickering we might actually achieve equity and not just equality,” the moderator wrote. “As Helldivers it's our responsibility to keep those we love and are sworn to protect safe from outside evils. Sometimes those evils exist within our own society. This is just another dive in a long long history of dives.”</p><p>Aftermath also reached out to the moderators of r/Helldivers2 for comment, but they did not respond in time for publication.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-charlie-kirk-death-streamers"><h3>Why Republicans Needed Charlie Kirk</h3></a><p>"The purpose of Charlie Kirk [was] to conceal from the Republican base what their policies actually are"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lego-death-star-9000-pieces"><h3>Deahas thed Star</h3></a><p>Dorth Stor?

And, you’ll never believe this, either: video games are part of the conversation.</p><p>On Friday, authorities <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/suspect-charlie-kirk-shooting-tyler-robinson-rcna230504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested</a> 22-year-old Tyler Robinson of Utah in connection with Kirk’s shooting, following a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-director-kash-patel-faces-scrutiny-inaccurately-saying-kirk-killer-had-been-2025-09-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fumbling</a> manhunt. On Thursday, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/charlie-kirk-shot/card/pdymd1sXXMSlVRhpvR4b?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAh-xmrQ9tuoCZsoSv9XN-t0ch6BvHyjwDh6HoCzigPdhsf2nz2xaMmaSjC1lTo%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68c45f33&amp;gaa_sig=62XiXkfFvN6T2WFTD5mPpiNjjOW0DcsPGbZNVAmxrZAKcHzU1mbyiu_iQSueLAWEFrpwjnwMDpI5HEXGsKlodQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Wall Street Journal</a> reported that a bulletin for law enforcement claimed bullet casings found in a gun believed to belong to the shooter contained "transgender and anti-fascist ideology,” though later <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jackjenkins.me/post/3lymaxawilk25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated</a> that story to note that “sources urge caution.” It’s unclear what “transgender ideology” might refer to when “trangender ideology” is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jamilahking.bsky.social/post/3lynf33ad422l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not a thing</a>, but we do now know what messages the casing contained. In a briefing today, Utah governor Spencer Cox read aloud:</p><blockquote><p>Inscriptions on a fired casing read “notices bulges ‘O w O’ what’s this?” Inscriptions on the three unfired casings read “Hey fascist! Catch! Up arrow symbol, right arrow symbol, and three down arrow symbols.” A second unfired casing read “oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao ciao ciao.” And a third unfired casing read “if you read this you are gay lmao.”</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><div><figure><p><iframe title="LIVE: Man arrested in connection with Charlie Kirk shooting" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiS5wXfXiKs?start=278&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The first message, as noted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/777313/charlie-kirks-alleged-killer-scratched-bullets-with-a-helldivers-combo-and-a-furry-sex-meme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a>, is a reference to<a href="https://x.com/knowyourmeme/status/1966509774452773219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a joke about furry roleplay</a>; the last is a joke that pretty much speaks for itself; and the third is a well-known anti-fascist song that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/us/tyler-robinson-bella-ciao-bullet.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a> claims was popularized by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juIcenNQWLs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix series</a> “Money Heist” and&nbsp; <em>Far Cry 6,</em> while The Verge notes that it has appeared in <em>Hearts of Iron IV</em> and a <em>Helldivers 2</em> mod. That <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/helldivers-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers</em></a><em> </em>connection is salient because of the second casing, with the arrows: while three downward-slanting arrows is a long-standing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Arrows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-fascist symbol</a>, the up, right, and three downs combination is the code to drop <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s <a href="https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_500kg_Bomb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eagle 500kg bomb</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This would, of course, <a href="https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not be the first time</a> video games have come up in <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">connection</a> with real-world violence. It wouldn’t even be the first time this week; on Wednesday, RFK <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-mass-shootings-video-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that “there could be connections with video games, with social media” and gun violence. Often in these situations, authorities and the public look to what video games a shooter played; it’s less common for a shooter to actively reference a specific video game, as the 2019 Christchurch shooter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/world/asia/new-zealand-shooting-brenton-tarrant.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemingly facetiously</a> did with <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Spyro the Dragon</em> in a manifesto. <em>Helldivers 2</em> is a wildly popular game, though it’s more a deep cut for the mainstream than <em>Fortnite </em>is, and it’s made even less legible to those unfamiliar in light of its own <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-anti-fascist-answer-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complex</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24093674/helldivers-2-discord-meta-role-play-fandom-joel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politics</a>.</p><p>We’ll surely learn more about Robinson in the coming days, but what we have so far is an incoherent jumble of online references that don’t tell us much beyond the fact that he is a young person who knows about at least one video game and the internet; the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/who-tyler-robinson-charlie-kirk-suspect-814fd21f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a> reports he spent a lot of time online, though <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/charlie-kirk-shooting-suspect-identified-as-22-year-old-utah-man-tyler-robinson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a> notes that “Beyond [a] Discord account identified by [Governor] Cox, Robinson appears to have had virtually no online footprint that could be immediately identified in public or private databases.” The messages on the casings, taken together, largely read as weird, gruesomely-placed shitposts. Without knowing more about his motives, it’s hard to tell how seriously to take the seeming anti-fascist slant, or to draw any conclusions about why furries and <em>Helldivers 2</em> are part of it all. This obscuring of whatever sincerity might undergird Robinson’s actions is, too, a hallmark of online culture.</p><p>In the online circles I travel in, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ositanwanevu.com/post/3lynnrbq5fk27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/swin24.bsky.social/post/3lynlyhsir225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journalists</a> have pointed out how this moment highlights the need for reporters and desks dedicated to video games and online culture. It’s a call that hits particularly close to home for me, who, along with Nathan, staffed The Washington Post’s gaming desk until it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/washington-post-launcher-layoffs-giant-bomb-games-media-1850025471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down</a> in 2023. In the time before and since, we’ve seen multiple gaming outlets <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-has-been-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a>, or <a href="https://kotaku.com/fanbyte-website-layoffs-tencent-staff-g4tv-future-1849540893" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gutted</a>, with many that remain being forced to <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">churn out</a> high volume, SEO-friendly copy for numbers-focused <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">owners</a> instead of the journalism and cultural analysis that were once, at least for a brief moment, common. The remaining journalists best suited to meet this moment, to help readers flooded with divisive rhetoric and misinformation, are facing an uphill battle to do that work.&nbsp;</p><p>A healthy media ecosystem, one actually interested in helping readers, would see mainstream outlets staffed with writers knowledgeable in online culture. It would see plenty of specialized publications with the resources and owner willingness to do more than write to SEO. But that would also be an ecosystem that didn’t produce the Wall Street Journal’s absurd leap to “transgender ideology,” a phrase that is its own kind of right-wing meme, though one that’s spread far beyond the internet into the mouths of powerful people like the drafters of <a href="https://www.aclu.org/trump-on-lgbtq-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project 2025</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/trump-executive-order-ban-trans-women-sports-rcna190767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Trump</a>. The Right is eager to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/maga-already-blaming-trans-people-214925315.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKV-QVhkZ5JI9Flo3CMa3dH3QfH1Z0UjccAfZ9540o7Wys31Z5TBGkj8dEFljrWCAq5KIfc0n3653ybL18xMBnY8u5wSSZl0twsv2YbzIRgqYEDsDzkmtNEpSc9IiRIcm9NV-yVXbQHuJhoTtMZk6Z33VjqpB_BY7-27sZbkceOR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blame trans people</a> for the violence overwhelmingly performed by <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/sep/09/trans-people-mass-shootings-gun-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cis people</a> of their <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/02/23/mass-killings-extremism-adl-report-2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">own ranks</a>. It’s hard to read the WSJ’s speed to parrot such talking points as anything other than helping spread that message, though one would hope unintentionally. But just as unfamiliar writers can leap to blame video games or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/technology/video-games-extremism.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord</a>, they can leap to blame trans people too.&nbsp;</p><p>I can’t say if there are fewer trans reporters than games reporters out there (some, like me, are both), but there certainly aren’t a lot of either anymore, especially at the outlets with the most reach. <a href="https://www.404media.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Independent</a> <a href="https://www.assignedmedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outlets</a> and the <a href="https://www.wired.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remaining</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mainstream</a> ones do great work, but they can only do so much, especially when facing off against powerful figures and their fanbases. And both of these lacks highlight the gap between so many of our news outlets and the real world that our readers live in and need to know about, especially in complex situations like today's.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-charlie-kirk-death-streamers"><h3>Why Republicans Needed Charlie Kirk</h3></a><p>"The purpose of Charlie Kirk [was] to conceal from the Republican base what their policies actually are"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lego-death-star-9000-pieces"><h3>Deahas thed Star</h3></a><p>Dorth Stor?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Charlie Kirk made a lot of people mad, and then he <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-political-violence-new-york-times-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">died</a>. The first part almost certainly contributed to the second. But it’s unlikely that right-wing content creators and political commentators will be backing away from this ledge anytime soon. After all, the broader, ragebait-driven Republican apparatus relies on them. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we discuss the purpose Charlie Kirk served.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by two popular political streamers, <a href="https://x.com/Mike_from_PA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MikeFromPA</a> and <a href="https://x.com/DenimsTV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Denims</a>, to discuss how the far-right social media landscape created and ultimately destroyed Charlie Kirk. How do content creation ecosystems on the right and left differ, and why does the political right uplift – and fund – extreme voices like Kirk while the political left <a href="https://aftermath.site/cuomos-latest-strategy-to-resuscitate-his-flatlining-campaign-go-after-zohran-mamdani-for-associating-with-a-twitch-streamer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">distances itself from outspokenly leftist figures like Hasan Piker,</a> despite their success?&nbsp;</p><p>Why is mainstream media <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-political-violence-new-york-times-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying to convince us that we should feel bad</a> that someone who spent their life regularly advocating for violence against marginalized groups met a violent end? And how, generally, can we combat a right-wing online apparatus rooted in bad faith, that will condemn violence out of one side of its mouth and then cry for vengeance from the other? Finally, the most important (listener-submitted) question: Should the United States break up?</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can become influential enough to prevent Nathan from <a href="https://aftermath.site/bluesky-charlie-kirk-dead-rest-in-piss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting banned on Bluesky</a> again.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Denims: </strong>To be clear, there is a large majority of Republicans and people who vote red that are full-blown racists, and there’s no saving those people. If you’re voting for Trump, and you’re like “Yes, I want my white ethnostate,” we’re not saving you. You know what you want, and it’s not good for you either, but whatever. But I think that there are also – More Perfect Union, the work that they do, they show a lot of that stuff – people who voted for Trump that are like “Why is my life worse now? What did I do wrong?”&nbsp;</p><p>Or even look at after the CEO of United Healthcare was killed. Ben Shapiro tried, Steven Crowded tried, God-knows-who-else tried to be like “Left wing violence is out of control,” and their comments sections were just filled with right wingers going “No, healthcare is a joke in this country. I’m not for violence, but I’m not gonna cry for the CEO of a healthcare company.” And this is from right wingers, people who voted for Trump.</p><p>The idea that we can’t reach anyone is silly. If you can debate one of the people who has the biggest pull for a political influencer online, you can convince some of these people that the methods the Republicans are using are not gonna make their lives better.</p><p><strong>MikeFromPA: </strong>Something that I say a lot is that the purpose of Charlie Kirk [was] to conceal from the Republican base what their policies actually are – and to distract them with culture war slop. If you look at positions on single-payer healthcare, you’ll see, like, 30 percent support, 25 percent, 35 percent support among Republicans for it. And it’s like, wait, you support a minimum wage increase, you support Medicare For All, you support raising taxes on the rich. Why the fuck are you a Republican?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s an understanding that politics is not about people looking at a list of policies and then picking them and going “I took a test online, and it says I should support Bernie Sanders. I’m voting for him!” It is a vibe. It is a social, political, cultural milieu. It is your material interests, whether you have any class consciousness. Are you organized in a union? And even then, people who are unions will vote against their union recommendation because of, like, guns or something.&nbsp;</p><p>That is the main project of these right wing debaters and entertainers: to create an uncertainty and a cloud around the Republican party where you fill in the blanks about what you think the Republican party is. They have a few cultural touchstones that they will use, and they’re all, like, abortion, guns, and trans issues. It’s not based on your life or your material interests.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Anything that will improve your life, especially.</p><p><strong>MikeFromPA:</strong> Exactly. And maybe it’ll cut your taxes, because that sounds real to people. We all pay taxes, so if somebody says “I’m gonna cut your taxes,” that feels real to you. But “I’m gonna cut this program in the government,” you may not even know that’s actually something you rely on. That takes a certain extremely high level of political knowledge to get. That is kind of what Charlie Kirk functioned as: covering everything up with a fart cloud so nobody is paying attention to their wallet getting picked.
