            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday afternoon, conservative political activist Charlie Kirk was shot during a stop on his “American Comeback” tour at Utah Valley University. He <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/death-charlie-kirk-lays-bare-deep-us-political-divisions-2025-09-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">died shortly after</a>. In the 24 hours that followed, liberal news networks, publications, and politicians have tripped over themselves to eulogize Kirk, with the New York Times’ Ezra Klein <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/opinion/charlie-kirk-assassination-fear-politics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claiming</a> that Kirk was “practicing politics the right way,” while California podcaster-in-chief Gavin Newsom <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/governor.ca.gov/post/3lyjajnblcs25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> "the best way to honor Charlie's memory is to continue his work: engage with each other, across ideology, through spirited discourse.”&nbsp;</p><p>After MSNBC analyst Matthew Dowd noted, quite reasonably, that "hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions,” the network <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/msnbc-fires-matthew-dowd-charlie-kirk-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired him</a>. The New York Yankees, neither a publication nor a politician, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/yankees/2025/09/10/yankees-charlie-kirk-moment-of-silence/86085914007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">held a moment of silence</a> for Kirk.</p><p>These are just a handful of examples. Conspicuously, many such teary-eyed odes neglect to quote or substantially discuss the views of the man himself.

But Kirk knew how to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/09/charlie-kirk-shooting/684173/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cozy up to power</a> and work the algorithm – the only two skills you need to gain influence in a landscape where viewership, as opposed to expertise or a legitimate desire to better your community, is king. This is a system that makes monsters, encourages them to run rampant, and then scratches its head at the carnage they’ve caused. It is ill-equipped to grapple with the age-old adage “what goes around comes around,” because that would require accepting a measure of culpability.</p><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/charlie-kirk-video-graphic-online-social-media-6cfd4dfde356b960aeea69c01ea3ec34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many saw images of gruesome violence</a> in their algorithmically generated feeds. Some expressed outrage, acting as though this was an anomaly, and perhaps it was. Perhaps they have not spent the past almost-two years opening Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram or whatever else and being greeted by images of charred Palestinian children. Maybe the endless stream of unspeakable darkness has made them numb. Or maybe, like many pundits and elected officials, they are aware of the horrors visited upon Gaza, but to them, those are acceptable losses – bodies, but not real people. State violence is the background hum of this country, after all. It does not count as the “<a href="https://x.com/BernieSanders/status/1965867418863235410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">political violence</a>” so many politicians and pundits rushed to decry yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Kirk’s death, like much of his life, took place on a stage. Despite the artificiality of such a setting, that makes him <em>more </em>real to some Americans – and clearly to those eulogizing him. More real than the Democratic lawmaker and her husband who were <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/after-two-day-manhunt-suspect-charged-shooting-two-minnesota-lawmakers-and-their-spouses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killed just a few months ago</a>. More real than the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/people-killed-us-boat-strike-were-not-tren-de-aragua-venezuela-minister-says-2025-09-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">11 people killed last week by the US</a> government in what was almost certainly an illegal strike on a boat in the Caribbean. More real than <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/palestinian-death-toll-in-gaza-passes-64000-officials-say-after-ceasefire-talks-break-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tens</a> of thousands – or, more likely, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/8/gaza-toll-could-exceed-186000-lancet-study-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds</a> of thousands – of Palestinian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/aug/21/revealed-israeli-militarys-own-data-indicates-civilian-death-rate-of-83-in-gaza-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">civilians</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Kirk’s violent rhetoric helped shape this world, and yet, it has been deemed “civil” by those on both sides of the political divide. This is the mark of a sick society, one that is perfectly fine with an unconscionable body count as long as none of the disfigured, barely recognizable faces are ones we know from a screen. Some of the pundits fake-crying for Kirk probably found his views privately appalling. Again, networks made the deliberate <em>choice </em>to shy away from engaging with the substance of his debates. They were almost certainly aware, at least on some level, of the kinds of things he regularly said. But that didn’t matter. They had to put on a show. The show, after all, is what keeps the meat grinder that is America moving, and it must – at all costs – go on.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/signal-rolls-secure-after-i-detleted-my-signal-history"><h3>Signal Rolls Out Secure Backups Just After I Had To Nuke My Message History</h3></a><p>Signal is allowing users to opt-in to secure backups in their beta, one of their most requested features.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a month my phone was, from a technical perspective, “severely messed up.” I am a klutz on occasion, which is partially why I’ve gotten good at backing up my data, buying the most durable tools possible, and repairing the things that I own. But this time my phone was not only beyond the limits of my repair abilities, but also of everybody I brought the device to, and it contained the only thing I could not back up: my (iOS) Signal history. So, with a heavy heart, I had to let those chats go. So when Signal finally confirmed that they were rolling out “secure backups” in a limited capacity, I was ecstatic, and the timing made me want to throw a brick at a wall.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’ve never used Signal before, you should. It’s as secure a messaging app as you’re likely to get, works across most platforms, and is just generally well-encrypted and secure. It’s flexible and can work between your desktop and phone. But because it’s a piece of software that prioritizes security over retention, it has historically been complicated to back your conversations up.</p><p>This is by design: though your messages sync across devices, you cannot currently back them up to the cloud. iOS devices like the iPhone are especially annoying as you can only directly transfer it to another iOS device, usually over wifi. (Android phones can work similarly with the option <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059752-Backup-and-Restore-Messages#android_restore_steps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for local backups</a>, and people have <a href="https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built complex, open source tools</a> for this purpose.) I have had to transfer my Signal history over multiple iPhones in the past, and thankfully the old devices were screwed up in a way that was either repairable or did not compromise the integrity of the phone itself.&nbsp;</p><p>This time, however, I was not so lucky. Following a freak accident, my phone got messed up in the most specific and annoying way possible: damage to the logic board, most likely the NAND flash. The phone would boot up momentarily, work very poorly for about 30 seconds (and a few times up to 30 minutes), and then promptly reboot. The phone was simply unable to stay on long enough to back up my conversations.</p><p>For about 99% of what’s on my phone, it’s not catastrophic. I’m fairly regular at backing up my photos and messages, so while the cost of a new or refurbished phone is bad, it’s mostly not world ending. But I did not want to lose my Signal chat, particularly years of discussions with my one other friend who is just as obsessed with technology as I am, in the way that I am. Both of us are very good at taking notes, but occasionally it would be useful to search the transcript for something one of us linked to in an offhanded way.&nbsp;</p><p>So, in my desperation, I spent multiple weeks seeing if a guy could fix the issue. I brought it to a guy who said he fixed it, but didn't, then that guy had to send it to <em>another guy </em>in Sunset Park, who held on to it for a week, said he fixed it, only for it to not be fixed. What’s more, I had already planned a vacation to the Bay Area with my girlfriend and I could not get a new device in time, so I had to navigate the entire trip via the 30 seconds of time my phone could handle, on my girlfriend’s phone, and over café WiFi on an iPad Mini. I cannot stress how embarrassing it is to walk around holding an iPad Mini like a man-sized toddler, although I guess if you have to pull something like that, San Francisco is the place to do it.&nbsp;</p><p>By choosing to use Signal on iOS, I had authored the inevitable demise of my texts. Eventually I just got a replacement phone and wiped the old one, those messages wiped away like a sand mandala being dumped into the ocean. I had to live my life. Perhaps this was for the best.</p><p><strong>Finally, Secure Backups</strong></p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://signal.org/blog/introducing-secure-backups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a blog post Monday</a>, Signal announced that they were finally rolling out a beta on Android (with iOS to follow) that allows for secure backups in the cloud. Based on the writeup as well as what’s covered in the support <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/public-signal-backups-testing/69984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forum</a>, there’s a lot to like and a lot to prod at. The feature is opt-in by default, and covers up all your texts and up to 45 days of media. If you want to store all of your media, Signal offers a monthly paid service (their first, they are a non-profit) of $1.99 to cover the cost of 100GBs of media storage. Media itself is encrypted twice and padded to obscure the file size.&nbsp;</p><p>The backup is end-to-end encrypted and locked with a 64-character recovery key. Though another person at the other end of a conversation can back up your conversation without you enabling the feature, disappearing and deleted messages are removed from any archive the way they were intended to. It also introduces a backup format that is readable independently of all clients, which opens up the possibility of theoretically restoring your messages between iOS, Android, and Desktop clients.</p><p>As with most security features, the devil is in the details. But security has always been Signal’s highest priority, which is why something as basic and heavily requested as secure backups took so long to figure out. And if there’s a potential exploit, Signal’s user base will probably be the first to figure it out. Though I’m bummed out, this was always something I’d known could happen, and I know this feature would not have rolled out to iOS fast enough to save my conversations. I’m done grieving my Signal history and am tranquil in the knowledge that I can finally shoot my phone with a shotgun without worrying that my secure texts and conversations from close friends will be lost forever.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lego-death-star-9000-pieces"><h3>Deahas thed Star</h3></a><p>Dorth Stor?
