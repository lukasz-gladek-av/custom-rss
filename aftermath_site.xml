      <p>If you predicted ten years ago that Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson would grow his YouTube channel into an empire that spans snacks, toys, an anime meant to sell those toys, and now a theme park, I would very much like for you to come lottery ticket shopping with me. Despite the long odds, it’s all come true, with the latter materializing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia after a frenzied couple months of construction. It looks… <a href="https://kotaku.com/beast-land-mrbeast-theme-park-saudi-arabia-2000645495?ref=aftermath.site"><u>really bad</u></a>! But a lot of things about MrBeast look bad when put under a magnifying glass, like his many <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-chaos-1235217834/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>recent scandals and controversies</u></a> – as well as his whole <a href="https://aftermath.site/mrbeast-beast-games/"><u>persona</u></a> of being a Willy Wonka wannabe meets Jigsaw from <em>Saw</em>. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we discuss why none of those issues have managed to meaningfully chip his armor.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by two of the finest internet culture reporters to ever lace up their boots and wade into the muck, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kattenbarge.bsky.social?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kat Tenbarge</u></a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/asarch.bsky.social?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Steven Asarch</u></a>, to talk about why MrBeast’s new theme park, Beast Land, is so bad – and why quality was never the point in the first place. Spoiler alert: It’s a giant ad, as many so-called theme parks, activations, and experiences are these days. We live in an era of flimsy disposability where nothing – whether it’s a short-form video or a branded IRL pop-up – is built to last.</p><p>Then we discuss the latest platform to go all in on invasive age verification tech: <em>Roblox</em>, which will <a href="https://www.polygon.com/roblox-age-verification-id-check-user-issues-child-safety/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>require use of a facial age estimation system and ID checks</u></a> to access chat. On one hand, <em>Roblox </em>has had more than its fair share of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>child predation scandals</u></a> at this point, so it has every incentive to at least perform comprehensiveness here. On the other, <em>Roblox</em>’s real problems run much deeper, and a suite of data-hungry surveillance tools won’t solve them.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Kat shares a wild story about the time someone commissioned her, then an ASMRtist, to make a video in which she turned them into a puppet.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can build our own theme park in Australia (or maybe just the cozy little countryside office <a href="https://aftermath.site/aurumek-simon-hintermann-new-shirt-print-design-aftermath/"><u>featured in our latest piece of merch</u></a>, available now!)</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> It’s weird to think that YouTube, in a way, has this incestuous relationship with [MrBeast]. They want the views his content brings, so despite the personal controversy he might start, YouTube as a company are willing to relentlessly promote him and invest in him. The last person I can remember them having that kind of relationship with was Shane Dawson before his fall. The CEO of YouTube would go to his house and hang out with him, and that was not really a relationship YouTube had with a lot of people.</p><p>But I think with MrBeast, we’re almost in a post-controversy era, because previously in a different decade, you’d think major multinational corporations would be scared by the types of things MrBeast has been credibly accused of doing. But now they’re actually less scared of working with him even when now the general public consensus around him is that he’s kind of a bad guy.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Why do you think that is? What do you think made brands in general go from being very squeamish around these creators – being very brand safe in their approach – to being like “Now that people’s opinions have soured, this is actually safer for us”?</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> When we were talking about MrBeast’s controversies, it’s like, in a certain sense, now that he’s had them, they know that it doesn’t really matter anymore. Of course there are still worse things he could do; there are still things that could bring down the empire. But I think these companies and brands realized over the past five years in particular that the longevity of the influencer does not depend on how bad the controversy gets.</p><p>I imagine that the lesson from Logan Paul, for example, was [that cancellations don’t stick]. At a certain point after the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42644321?ref=aftermath.site"><u>suicide forest video</u></a>, it seemed like Logan would never make money again. But the reality is that he makes exponentially more money now than he ever did before or during that controversy. In a weird way, I feel like the brands almost push the creators more than the audience pushes the creators.</p><p><strong>Steven:</strong> Cancellation in general when it comes to this style of influencer is now a myth. I don’t think an influencer – outside of an extreme grooming or sexual assault scandal – can’t bounce back from any sort of controversy at this point. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/trisha-paytas-past-drama-mom-life-1234983378/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Trisha Paytas</u></a> is doing better than she’s ever done before. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffree-star-sexual-assault-allegations-violence-accused-predator-myspace-payments-2020-9?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jeffree Star</u></a> is still thriving.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper/"><u>Dr Disrespect</u></a> still exists.</p><p><strong>Steven: </strong>Guy Beahm is doing photoshoots and thriving with his weird audience. You can’t really be cancelled anymore, because all it takes is a weird niche audience that can fund your content for a really long time. You don’t need to go mainstream. Guy Beahm – I’m not calling him The Doc, I refuse – is never going to hit that same level he hit in the pre-2020 TwitchCon era. He’s now sort of cemented himself as an anti-cancel culture warrior, and the audience that’s fallen for it is willing to give him enough that he can survive. Influencers don’t need to be for everyone anymore. They can find their niche and thrive in a way that didn’t work just five years ago.</p><p>I think when it comes to MrBeast, his scandals only reached the level that they did because he couldn’t talk. He claims there was a law firm looking into his company. I believe that from talking to people inside. But in general, these influencers can’t be canceled. There’s no such thing. Brands are full of older folks who see a big name and think “Oh, I can throw my thing behind them.” I don’t think Jack Link’s Beef Jerky – which is now doing a MrBeast collab – really cared too much about the Ava [Kris Tyson] controversy from last year when they signed that seven-to-eight-figure deal to slap his name on a bunch of meat sticks.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Just to give people an idea of what we’re talking about here – especially as you have been kind of the chronicler of MrBeast’s many scandals – what are the most egregious things he’s done?</p><p><strong>Steven:</strong> I’ve been reporting on MrBeast since 2018, when I interviewed him about a real-life battle royale he decided to do. I would say up until 2024, MrBeast was uncancellable. Criticism was not even allowed of MrBeast because he did philanthropy; he helped people. He helped cure blindness singlehandedly, according to his video thumbnail.&nbsp;</p><p>But in the summer of 2024, it came out that Ava Kris Tyson – who was his second in command and his closest friend – had been talking inappropriately with minors on a Discord and had allegedly sexually assaulted their assistant while they were working. This led to a series of other controversies coming out. A YouTuber named DogPack made a whole bunch of videos. Other YouTubers came out claiming they were tortured trying to film a video.&nbsp;</p><p>All these controversies grew on top of each other to the point that when the first season of The Beast Games came out, I <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-chaos-1235217834/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>reported</u></a> that the crew members were treated very poorly. They were underfed, they were overworked. One crew member I spoke with was hit by a 200 lb piece of wood that fell on his neck, causing him to fall backward and hit his head with blood shooting out of his mouth. He is still recovering. His left side doesn’t work very well. When he was in the hospital, a MrBeast executive offered him $1,000 in Uber Eats and DoorDash gift cards as a way to make amends.</p><p>In general, all those controversies didn’t really mean much. MrBeast was sort of able to just continue posting content and wave it all away with a law firm investigation into the company that found, yeah, there was some bad stuff, but overall they did their best. You’ve gotta remember that MrBeast for a while was just a bunch of teenagers running around and doing wild stuff. Now it’s a major corporation that has just hired a bunch of executives from Shopify and NBC to try to change their image, and it’s clearly working. I would say if Ms Rachel is for the really young kids, MrBeast is for the young kids. Scandals are now unimportant when looking at MrBeast, because they didn’t really stick.</p>

      <p>On October 28th, 2025, Aftermath had a party, and you were all there.</p><p>Okay, not <em>all</em> of you were there—but on a Tuesday night in October, nearly a hundred Aftermath fans went to a venue in Queens to celebrate the site, hang out, and eat cake. It was the biggest party I’ve ever thrown and an incredible success. Hopefully, attendees have put their exclusive Aftermath stickers somewhere special.</p><p>Despite the fact that no one other than me and one very enthusiastic couple danced (shout out to y’all!),&nbsp; being at this party was one of the best nights of my life. I kept saying to my husband “I feel like it’s my birthday.” I could barely talk to people because so many people kept coming up to us to say how much they love our website and how much our work has touched their lives. The energy in the room was infectious; I felt like I was walking on a cloud.</p><p>The Aftermath Party was all the more special because of the people who helped us bring it together. Thanks to TV Eye, the venue in Ridgewood that housed us. Thank you also to Rudy’s Bakery for baking the lovely chocolate cake that we all enjoyed. Thank you to DJs Janus Rose, Alien D and Actuator—I truly wish that more people had danced, because these sets were incredible. And especially thank you to <a href="https://decristophoto.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Carmen DeCristo</u></a>, our photographer for the night.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>All photos by Carmen DeCristo</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure><div></div><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>All photos by Carmen DeCristo</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>And also, thank <em>you </em>for coming to the Aftermath Party.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>In my freshman year of college, a friend of mine convinced me to go to Saint Mark’s and impulse <a href="https://videogamesnewyork.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">buy an imported PSP</a> before it had launched in the States. This was generally bad financial advice, as it blew a gargantuan hole in what little disposable income I had at the time. But buying it felt fantastic, one of the first real things I had purchased as an adult who could vote, smoke, die in a war, but not yet legally drink. We then proceeded to go around the corner to a dingy and poorly lit Italian restaurant and played each other in the only game we had at the time, <em>Lumines: Puzzle Fusion</em>.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YmnMAzPx7jU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Lumines Soundtrack: SHININ'"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>SHININ'...my old friend.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t remember the meal, but I do remember the walls melting away and both of us being locked in silent combat for much of the duration of our time there. From that moment onward, the PSP became ”the machine that played <em>Lumines</em>.” <em>Lumines</em> came to represent that feeling of PlayStation  cool – the idea that video games were these things that young, fashionable adults in urban areas played, like the scene in <em>Hackers</em> where they go to the club and play a pre-vis version of <em>Wipeout</em> on a wall of CRTs. It was also a game that represented what rhythm games can and should be, a sublime melding of music and play, of performance and curation. Now, decades later, <em>Lumines Arise </em>returns when much of that feeling of gaming’s potential for being cool is largely absent. <em>Lumines Arise </em>is that feeling of 2000s cool unthawed, along with all it represented.</p><p>The original <em>Lumines </em>was the product of Tetsuya Mizuguchi, the man who introduced a generation of indoor internet kids to the concept of synesthesia with the game <em>Rez</em>. The player drops various configurations of 2x2 blocks in various configurations of two patterns, while a metronome line sweeps the stage. When the line sweeps through a solid color square, the square is eliminated. What differentiates <em>Lumines</em> from many other puzzle games is that it makes explicit the implicit rhythm and tonality of the format with different speeds and custom music. A stage in <em>Lumines </em>is bespoke, with everything synchronizing and pulses in perfect harmony.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3-TLvgz8mXA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Star Guitar by The Chemical Brothers | Lumines II"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>I kinda love that they just used the Michel Gondry video as the backdrop for this.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>It has been well over a decade since we have gotten a <em>Lumines</em> game that was not some flavor of remake. In the void of new releases, Q Entertainment and subsequently Enhance (the company Mizuguchi would go on to found in 2014) went on to riff on similar puzzle-rhythm fusion concepts, the most notable recent release being <em>Tetris Effect. Tetris Effect </em>was a <em>Lumines</em>-themed mutant, with its immersive music and textural themes infecting the most storied and beloved puzzle series in history. But <em>Tetris Effect</em> always had to be a <em>Tetris</em> game first and foremost, a quality that confined what it could do as a synesthetic experience, and on some level it felt like a dry run for the inevitability of <em>Lumines Arise</em>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>I can confirm that this looks sick in VR. Credit: Enhance</span></figcaption></figure><p>To play <em>Lumines Arise</em> actively is to give the whole of your being to sound and form. The textures of individual tile dyads shift between stages; on one stage they take the shape of jarringly vivid fruits and vegetables, on another they are droplets of water and jellyfish. The dropping, clearing and twisting of each block sync harmoniously with the song in the background, one stage in particular being flanked by giant raving chameleons.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Burst mechanic is new and gives you breathing room to create a single, giant block. Credit: Enhance</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sets of stages in <em>Lumines</em> blend in with one another like an album or a DJ set. Like<em> Tetris Effect </em>before it, it is one of the better showcases for VR as a format, as the immersion of being fully swaddled in a space and surrounded by whirling particles gels perfectly with the game’s thesis of synesthesia and connection. You are meant to be locked in, senses blending in seamlessly with one another. But while the boutique VR experience that I dusted off my Valve Index for was nice, <em>Arise</em> is also a fantastic fit for portable gaming. It now has a permanent home on my Steam Deck in much the same way my PSP always had <em>Lumines: Puzzle Fusion.</em></p><figure><figcaption><span>Transitions between stages are shifting and intricate. Credit: Enhance</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are times where the sheer noise of the default blocks can be a bit overwhelming. This is especially noticeable if you compare <em>Arise</em> to the original PSP classic, a game whose tiles were fairly clean and legible, steeped in the exact Y2K design sensibility you’d expect from a PSP puzzle game in 2004. That said, <em>Arise</em> also has a solid accessibility menu, allowing you to dial in the experience to fit different forms of color blindness and reduce the severity of particles. There are also spider and snake filters, which is a nice inclusion because I’m sure those levels in particular would be mildly terrifying to me if I had that phobia.</p><p>The music selection is apropos in <em>Arise</em>, a lot of bumping techno and a bunch of pop tracks crossing a variety of genres. The electronic music in these games is more strongly curated, and there’s at least one hip hop track in Event 7 that I just straight up don’t like. If I was more jaded I would say a few of the vocal tracks are corny, but I am old enough to also find them charming. They also contain a wisp of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/amazingthew.bsky.social/post/3m5ju6dzho22c?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">earnestness</a> that is fundamental to the game’s premise of connection and that is inseparable from the mentality that this game is culturally downstream of.</p><figure><figcaption><span> Later stages can get hectic. Credit: Enhance </span></figcaption></figure><p>It is that commitment to earnestness that I find so refreshing. I do not need to explain to you how cynical the world is. Art these days feels self-aware and too clever by half, unable to let its guard down to say something from the heart. <em>Lumines Arise</em> feels unstuck in time, like a memory of a dinner with an old friend when you were younger and more naive, when the future stretched out infinitely, before you were crushed by the weight of just getting by. It<em> </em>is a reminder that the beauty of the world is still limitless and luminous, that even something as abstract and frivolous as a puzzle game can stir in you emotions that are wordless and perhaps divine.</p>
