            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/agent-47-hitman-assassin-cost-hire<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hitman</em>'s Agent 47 is the world's premier assassin, a man able to blend in with his surroundings at will, to get within arm's reach of the most secure and often most <em>dangerous </em>people on the planet. For much of his career he's been a man on a mission, but I have recently been wondering how much it would cost to hire him for a single job.</p><p>Me being able to entertain this possibility is canon! At the end of <em>Hitman 3</em> he and Diana essentially go off grid, leaving Providence behind to continue their work together as <a href="https://aftermath.site/hitman-freelancer-the-best-kind-of-hitman-is-more-hitman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freelancers</a>.<a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Which I'm assuming doesn't pay as well as a staff job</a>, but if the gig economy has come for <em>us</em>, then it has come for Agent 47 as well.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like us</a>–and this is one of the only times I can make such a comparison, at least until I get balder–Agent 47 now has to worry about doing his own taxes, quoting for jobs and just generally living the small business hustle. His work pays (presumably) a lot more than ours does, so I’m sure he’ll be fine, but still, the leap from Providence employee to small business owner will be a challenge for him.</p><p>Which also means Agent 47's loss could be our gain. Prior to the events of <em>Hitman 3</em> he only worked in the shadows, the most lethal puppet on a string on the planet, a plaything of the powerful in their struggles against the...also powerful, but slightly more evil. If anyone else<em> </em>needed work done back then we'd have had to hire an assassin out of the phonebook, or Facebook Marketplace, or the dark web, or know a guy who knew a guy, all of which were just as likely to see us end up in prison as the target whacked.</p><p>These days though, Agent 47 is just out there for hire! He could, and presumably <em>would </em>(after repeated quicksaves and reloads, anyway) be able to do any job on the planet provided the pay was right.</p><p>Which leads me to wonder: <em>hypothetically speaking</em>, how much would a contract cost? Would Agent 47 charge per kill? Would he charge according to the complexity of the job? Would he scout out the target and present them with a series of quotes, escalating in cost owing to factors like difficulty and comedic value? Would the prospective clients get a certain number of "body in a storage closet" dumps for free, and exceeding that value would result in a surcharge per body?</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/19bp6yz/how_much_do_you_think_it_costs_to_hire_47/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve seen people ask this before</a>, pointing to contract values from previous games and coming up with ballpark figures. <em>Silent Assassin</em>, released in 2002, has Agent 47 saying his standard rate is $100,000, while 2006’s <em>Blood Money</em> paid between $100,000 and $600,000 per job. That’s a while ago though, and Providence probably took a substantial cut of that, so it doesn’t really help with what his rates would be in 2025, particularly given the inflationary and cost-of-living crisis we’re all currently living through.&nbsp;</p><p>And while<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/uruno4/how_expensive_is_a_hitman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> there are publicly available rates for actual hitmen</a>, I suspect that many of those are based on hitmen who were caught, and who also appear to be at the entry level of this particular market. The mafia hiring a guy to whack another guy outside a deli would not cost the same as a single career professional infiltrating an 18th century mansion, sneaking past 72 guards, hacking a security network and executing a renegade tech mogul.&nbsp;</p><p>So yeah, I have no idea how much it would cost to hire Agent 47! I just wonder sometimes, that's all.
