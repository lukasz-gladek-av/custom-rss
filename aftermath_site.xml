            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the past several years, indie developers have raised more than $1 million for Palestinian aid; in 2021, the Indie Bundle for Palestinian Aid raised nearly $900,000 for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and in 2024, the Palestinian Relief Bundle raised nearly $600,000 for Palestine Children's Relief Fund. More than a year has passed since Israel’s renewed assault on Palestinian people in which tens of thousands of people have been killed or injured—and game developers are urging the industry not to look away.</p><p>Experts with the International Association of Genocide Scholars recently declared in a report that Israel’s actions against Palestine constitute a genocide, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde3eyzdr63o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the BBC</a>, joining groups like <a href="https://msf.org.uk/issues/gaza-genocide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor’s Without Borders</a>, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amnesty International</a> and Israeli human rights organization <a href="https://www.btselem.org/publications/202507_our_genocide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">B’Tselem</a>. Israel has disputed the accusation for years, calling its actions a justified response <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/10/7/23907296/israel-war-hamas-attack-rocket-strike-response-2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to an Oct. 7 attack</a> in which militant group Hamas attacked and killed hundreds of civilians, some of which were attending a music festival, and injured thousands more. The current situation in Gaza is a continuation of an ongoing conflict in the region. In 2022, Human Rights Watch called Gaza an “<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/06/14/gaza-israels-open-air-prison-15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open air prison</a>.”</p><p>“It is imperative that everybody in the world does not look away from the ongoing genocide, destruction of livelihood, culture and humanity in Palestine,” organizer Jun Shen told Aftermath. “The games industry is built on communities of compassionate developers, artists, creators, writers, players who want to make a difference—and so we have the power to bring together our "kampung" (Malay word for "village") and harness our collective spirit to contribute to the welfare and freedom of the people of Palestine.”</p><p>Shen and a group of volunteers organized the <a href="https://itch.io/b/2979/play-for-peace-games-for-palestine-2025-charity-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Play for Peace - Games for Palestine 2025 Charity Bundle</a> to continue raising funds for Palestinian aid; the effort began around 10 months ago, Shen said, with outreach to different organizations, volunteers, Itch itself, and game developers. The group partnered with the UNRWA USA, who will accept the raised money and pass it along to the UNRWA, which funds the direct support of Palestinians. Shen said the group chose the UNRWA because the proceeds go directly to relief efforts in Palestine.</p><p>The UNRWA was founded in 1950, <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/who-we-are/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per its website</a>, and has provided “assistance and protection to Palestine refugees pending a just and lasting solution to their plight.” It also helps with emergency response and is almost entirely funded through fundraising via “voluntary contributions, and mostly from donor states.” It continued, <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/who-we-are/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via an FAQ page on its website</a>: “UNRWA is asking all donors to find ways to comprehensively address the Agency’s recurring shortfalls to ensure the uninterrupted delivery of critical services until there is a just and durable solution to the plight of Palestine refugees. Maintaining smooth and predictable operations, including the provision of emergency assistance, is of the utmost importance for the well-being, protection and human development of Palestine refugees, as well as for the stability of the region at large.”</p><p>Since the Play for Peace bundle launched on Sept. 2, it’s raised more than $33,000 for the charity. It’ll stay open until Sept. 23, with the goal of raising at least $200,000. The price is set for just $8, but people are able to donate more if they choose.</p><p>The bundle has been curated with 382 games from 248 creators—everything from “cozy narrative sims, to meditative adventures, to action games, visual novel tools, experimental sims, an RPG about being a cow, to tabletop experiences about everything from the occult, to journaling of self-discovery.”</p><p>Shen said it was important to him that the games represented in the bundle included “as many developers and contributors from all over the world,” including south east Asia, where he is from. “I created SEA Games for Good—a community-powered platform from which we can do good together—and as a way to encourage more participation from devs everywhere,” Shen said.<br>The Bundle includes <a href="https://togeproductions.itch.io/coffee-talk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toge Productions’ <em>Coffee Talk</em></a>, <a href="https://softnotweak.itch.io/spirit-swap-lofi-beats-to-match-3-to" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soft Not Weak’s <em>Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 To</em></a>, <a href="https://hthr.itch.io/extreme-meatpunks-forever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heather Flowers’ <em>Extreme Meatpunks Forever</em></a>, <a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/vvvvvv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terry Cavanagh’s <em>VVVVVV</em></a>, <a href="https://necrosoftgames.itch.io/hypergunsport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Necrosoft Games’ <em>Hyper Gunsport</em></a>, and <a href="https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/lucifer-within-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kitfox Games’ <em>Lucifer Within Us</em></a>, among many, many more. “All of it represents the creative expression of artists and developers who want to help raise money through their art for one of the most important causes of our time—freedom and the ending of genocide in Palestine,” <a href="https://itch.io/b/2979/play-for-peace-games-for-palestine-2025-charity-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the group said on its Itch page</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/oxo-rapid-brewer-coffee-espresso-soup-shots"><h3>The OXO Rapid Brewer Is Great For Coffee And Better For ‘Soup’</h3></a><p>The OXO Brew Rapid Brewer is a fantastic portable coffee brewer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“I do not need another coffee device” is what I told myself recently. I have already spent countless hours powerfully disassembling, powder coating, and modifying an off-the-shelf espresso machine, and it serves me perfectly. I have an Aeropress, a pour-over, and a beautiful, gothic <a href="https://us.alessi.com/products/pulcina-espresso-coffee-maker-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alessi Pulcina</a> moka pot. And yet when I saw what people were doing with the OXO Brew Rapid Brewer, I sighed, because someone had finally gone after Aeropress, and succeeded in making something new.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.oxo.com/rapid-brewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit: OXO</a></figcaption></figure><h2>A New Portable Coffee Contender</h2><p>The OXO Brew Rapid Brewer (I have seen people affectionately dub it “ORB” for short) is a compact coffee maker that claims to make hot or cold concentrated coffee in less than five minutes. To make a cup of coffee you disassemble the machine, place the included carafe under it, grind some fresh beans, pour the grounds into the lower basket, tamp it down with the self-stored tamper, then pour hot or cold water in the top chamber of the container. When you’ve reached the correct immersion time, you force water through the puck by pressing the built-in pump, which forces air out, sort of like a bike pump. Individual factors depend on how you’d like to brew. It’s a beautifully designed machine, and the constituent parts of the pump, carafe, and the tamper are all self-contained in a way that collapses down for easy storage.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="OXO Rapid Brewer Quick Start Guide" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkzNoG2hws8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The immediate thought you may have is “that seems like an Aeropress,” a beloved staple of the coffee world and campers in particular, and I would say “sort of.” The Aeropress typically uses paper filters, which the Rapid Brewer does not need if you use it as OXO suggests. The Rapid Brewer creates a chamber with a dense puck more akin to the kind you make when you make a shot of espresso, while the Aeropress has an immersion chamber, and when it’s done the coffee gets forced through a paper filter like an oversized syringe. Though they serve a similar market, and both would be handy for making coffee while camping, the Rapid Brewer works in a fundamentally different way.</p><figure><figcaption>The Rapid Brewer broken down. </figcaption></figure><p>The Rapid Brewer would be noteworthy enough on its own, but what truly makes it novel is how the coffee community has found ways to use it. It came to my attention originally thanks to coffee YouTuber Lance Henrick, who had originally seen that it had become the pet project of a channel on the Espresso Aficionados Discord (which I was conveniently already in) called the Soup Kitchen, dedicated to making what are dubbed “Soup” shots.&nbsp;</p><h2>From Turbo To Soup</h2><figure><figcaption>The Cafelat Robot, my favorite manual espresso maker.<span></span><a href="http://www.cafelat.com/robot.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit: Cafelat</a></figcaption></figure><p>Modern espresso styles have changed over the last few years, with much of this changing due to “turbo shots.” The turbo shot originated from a <a href="https://strivefortone.com/blogs/coffee/low-pressure-turbo-shots-and-the-perfect-espresso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research paper in 2020</a> and is a style of smooth espresso shot that uses lower pressure, coarser grinds, and a much shorter extraction time. Traditional espresso machines typically force water through a puck of finely ground coffee at about nine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(unit)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bars</a> of pressure, while the turbo shot initially only used six. The resulting shot is sweet, floral, and easy to drink. Getting a turbo shot out of a traditional espresso machine is not possible unless you are either using a machine that has flow profiles (like the <a href="https://decentespresso.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decent </a>or the hacked <a href="https://aftermath.site/gaggiuino-gaggia-classic-pro-mod-open-source-hack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gaggiuino </a>I built) or you are using a manual espresso machine like the Flair58 or the Cafelat Robot with a gauge to measure the pressure.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="This OXO Brewer Might Replace Espresso" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Odo0f9P2SgQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“Soup” is a further evolution of styles like turbo shots and other low pressure shots. Though terms like “soup,” “yeet,” and “piss”&nbsp; had been kicking around in the Espresso Aficionados Discord to describe these styles, “soup” was eventually chosen because it is more family friendly. It was originally popularized by user DC, although he stresses that he did not “invent” it per se. After much experimentation, the “Soup Kitchen” thread was established, with DC showing the style off on a Cafelat Robot – my favorite manual espresso machine because it looks like a little pastel robot guy that wants uppies. Soup calls for even lower pressure than turbos (never exceeding one bar) and a grind with twice the burr gap of a turbo shot. Lighter roasts are often employed. Circular paper filters are added to the bottom before the grounds, with an additional one added to the top for cleanliness and puck consistency (DC prefers Chemex filters cut to size for the bottom).The puck is preinfused super gently, often with the assistance of a tiny $7 dollar folding mirror. DC described his ideal soup to me as “Very forgiving to dial in, like a pourover while highlighting complex acidity in coffees, aromatic.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Getting in the Weeds with the Rapid Brewer: Three Niche Profiles" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fHwX4u_4t3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The resulting “shot” produces foam but no “crema” like a traditional espresso or turbo. It’s clear and drinkable like a pourover, an extraction level similar to espresso but with none of the oily body. Eventually, the members of the discord realized that OXO excelled at making soup shots, and a cult began to form around the device. According to DC, the Rapid Brewer&nbsp; “makes it really easy to do a soup shot because it prevents you from building too much pressure by accident while giving you tactical feedback about puck resistance.”&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Soup’s On</strong></h2><p>Since I was already set up for espresso, I was already set up for soup. I needed a lighter roast than what I was used to, so I went with Pink Bourbon from Variety Coffee. Soup calls for near boiling water, and conveniently I have a Zojirushi water boiler that I use for tea. You don’t strictly need a Japanese water boiler, but mine is one of the single most useful appliances in my house. It’s a big self-heating vacuum flask with variable temperatures and pour speeds that makes it so you constantly have hot water at precisely the right temperature at all times. Soup’s grind size takes a while to dial in, but a good rule of thumb is that water should be very nearly dripping through when you pour it in without applying additional pressure; for me, that’s roughly in the area between a fine moka grind and coarser espresso grind.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Espresso Without Pressure? The SOUP Method Changing Coffee Forever" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GeFEwNfLZg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Recipes vary depending on a number of factors, but generally for the stock orb I’ve seen people suggest 18-20 grams of coffee and roughly 82 ml of hot water. Soup requires additional filtration in the form of paper filters above and below the puck. Aeropress filters are slightly too large for this purpose but will work in a pinch, although I’ve heard custom-cutting Chemex filters to size is a meaningful improvement. You place a filter in the basket, place your freshly ground and dosed coffee over it (WDTing if you like), lock it into the brewer, place it over the carafe, pour the correct amount of hot water, and place the pump on it. Preinfusion is the most important part, and the first pump is done as slowly as possible to saturate the coffee puck. Brewing time is short, about 20 seconds in total. Once the puck is saturated and you can pump without resistance, go to town on it. Congratulations, you’ve made soup.</p><p>As an espresso drinker, soup is a bizarre drink. It’s about the volume of a lungo shot, with the clarity of a pourover. Though it does not have the oily, viscous consistency of espresso that I love, it has an extraction that’s closer to it than other forms of coffee. It's like mutant pourover. If you make it correctly, soup is strong and beautiful, exceedingly floral and seductively clear. I have heard people describe it as “juicy,” which is a bizarre descriptor for any coffee drink, but it’s an apt one. Soup is exceedingly drinkable and downright beguiling. I have seen multiple people claim that their espresso machines have laid dormant since they started pulling soup shots. I have not, but I see with the utmost clarity why.</p><p>The Rapid Brewer does not replace espresso machines, but it’s cheap (in the US), well built, and lets you try a bizarre style of drink that you could mainline for the rest of your life. You do not need the level of investment as an espresso machine to get it right: A simple digital scale, hand grinder, a kettle and some filters are enough to get you there. Though many devices can make soup, none are as cheap and convenient at the task as the Rapid Brewer. You know a product has “the juice” when you see people 3D printing custom accessories for it, and rabid coffee fans have already found ways to modify the Rapid Brewer to take <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1694474-oxo-rapid-brewer-58mm-basket-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different espresso basket sizes</a>. I have a good feeling that the Rapid Brewer is more than a simple fad. The ORB has escaped containment, it’s making soup, and the coffee world might never be the same.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/play-for-peace-bundle-palestine-aid-fundraiser"><h3>10 Months In The Making, Play For Peace Bundle Launches To Raise Money for Palestinian Aid</h3></a><p>‘It was important that our charity's proceeds directly went to Palestinian relief efforts’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/32-9-long-handheld-amd-pc-steamdeck"><h3>Long Handheld</h3></a><p>ᗡ□□□□□□□□□□□□D</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-king-is-watching-pc-steam-review-impressions"><h3>The King Is Watching: It’s A Very Good Video Game</h3></a><p>'There's no wrong way to play this!
