            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-expedition-33-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When you write about games for a living, you rarely just sit down and write about a whole damn game. Even reviews, which some people think <em>should</em> be that, are hopefully something more focused and nuanced. Impressions of a game tend to involve the writer choosing a hook, an angle, something to peg their thoughts on before expanding on them over the course of an article.</p><p>It's why, for example, my <em>Infinite Wealth</em> "review"<a href="https://aftermath.site/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-spoilers-kazuma-kiryu-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> ended up</a> as<a href="https://aftermath.site/infinite-wealth-ichiban-kasuga-friendship-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> two separate pieces</a>, or why<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I wrote about <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows'</em> ending specifically</a>; it's easier for everyone, me and you, if we just find one thing to talk about in detail. And normally, that's pretty easy to do! I wrote about <em>Shadows</em>' ending because it really stood out, and the <em>Yakuza </em>posts were based on themes and impressions that became clear over my time with the game, which I thought were a lot more interesting than talking about "graphics" and "difficulty".</p><p>This week, though, I am having <em>problems</em>. I have been playing <em>Clair Obscur</em> non-stop, it's that good, but every time I go to write about it I find myself struggling to find that hook. Not because there's nothing good or interesting to write about, but because <em>everything </em>in <em>Clair Obscur </em>is good and interesting.</p><figure></figure><p>That's OK, maybe I can pivot to writing about stuff I don't like and...hrm. I guess traversing the levels can suck sometimes, if I have to name <em>one </em>thing I am not completely enamoured by. They can get a bit sprawly and repetitive at times, and you can get lost if you're not careful; they maybe need a map or clearer marker system or something. It gets a bit tedious. But like, that's it? I can't pad a whole post out into me complaining about that.</p><p>Everything else I cast my eyes, hands and ears over is just the best. The music rules. I love the art design. The battles have <em>got me</em>, someone who doesn't normally dabble in this genre outside of <em>Persona </em>and the odd <em>Final Fantasy</em>. The writing is great, the voice acting is great, the interlocking magic and abilities systems are surprisingly elegant.</p><p>I could write about any one of these things, sure, but every time I've tried I look over at everything else and it feels like I'm about to adopt only one kitten from an entire litter, and those left behind are looking at me with the biggest, saddest eyes. Awwww, character art, I love you, but I can't write about you <em>and </em>Charlie Cox, there are only so many hours in a day!</p><p>Though...ah. Maybe this <em>is </em>the hook. That the game is hookless. And that in my failed attempts to avoid writing about a whole game maybe I have to, just this once, if only to emphasise how fucking good it is.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-analysis-details-rockstar"><h3>A Video Game Trailer Maker’s Take On The Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer</h3></a><p>"If this was a better trailer, then people would be that much more hyped.

But a trailer everybody’s watched and a well-crafted trailer are two different things.</p><p>Despite amassing a truly astounding number of views, <em>GTA VI</em>’s second trailer didn’t land for everyone. This is not to say that the game will be bad or that Rockstar somehow dropped the ball, but rather that making a trailer, like any other mode of storytelling, is an art unto itself – one that goes far beyond the simple act of layering music atop footage.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Derek Lieu, a professional game trailer editor whose work you’ve almost certainly encountered – trailers for <em>Half-Life Alyx</em>, <em>Among Us</em>, <em>Psychonauts 2</em>, <em>Riven</em>, <em>Spelunky 2</em>, <em>Firewatch</em>, <em>Dead Cells</em>, <em>Viewfinder</em>, and <em>Stray Gods</em>, to name a few – believes that <em>GTA VI</em>’s second trailer doesn’t do its subject justice. The game, he told Aftermath, looks incredibly impressive, but after watching the trailer numerous times, he doesn’t find himself knowing or feeling as much as he’d like.</p><p>"[The game] looks amazing. It looks great," Lieu told Aftermath. "A trailer is designed to do this thing well, which is to incite our emotions and show a bunch of stuff from this new thing that we haven't seen before. This trailer, or a bunch of B-roll with music over it, can kind of achieve the same thing. But that doesn't make it a good trailer. Just because people get hyped, doesn't mean it's a good trailer. If this was a better trailer, then people would be that much more hyped. They would feel, they would care."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Just because people get hyped, doesn't mean it's a good trailer.</p></blockquote></figure><p>One of the trailer’s biggest issues, according to Lieu, is a general lack of narrative. This might sound odd given how much of it is made up of cutscenes, but consider what we’ve learned by the end: There are two characters who we’re obviously supposed to root for, and we know they’re having a grand old crime-filled time in Vice City, but what are the stakes? Why is any of this happening?&nbsp;</p><p>"The only thing we know about these characters is: They do crime and they're a couple,” said Lieu. “We have no idea what their motivation is. Why are they doing crime? Are they being forced to do crime? What's the reason? By the time the first part with the landlord is over, that's, like, 30 seconds into the trailer – an immense amount of time.”</p><p>Lieu drew a comparison to a more effective variation on the theme from Rockstar’s own oeuvre:&nbsp;</p><p>“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJIxpjXKd1g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>GTA IV</em>'s third trailer</a>, where it's like ‘Niko, my cousin!’, you know [Niko] is a person who's come to the United States, you know they're an immigrant, you know their contact is in a really shitty apartment, but they have aspirations of more,” said Lieu. “You have all of that in one shot. That [moment] encompasses the whole story of <em>GTA IV</em>. There's probably something like that in <em>GTA VI</em> somewhere. At least let us know what [the characters] want, and that will make us care more and be interested in how they achieve that."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="GTA IV Official Trailer #3" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJIxpjXKd1g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Lieu described Rockstar’s trailer output over the years as “uneven.” This, he said, is par for the course with trailers that are produced in-house – as opposed to those created by dedicated editors or agencies like <a href="https://www.altarcreative.com/our-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Altar Creative</a>, which has worked with Ubisoft on many occasions. While Lieu doesn’t know for certain if <em>GTA VI</em>’s trailer was produced in-house, he thinks it bears the hallmarks of one that was.&nbsp;</p><p>"Some places, in-house, are amazing,” he said. “<em>Destiny 2</em>, most of them are amazing. Blizzard, <em>Overwatch</em>, their stuff is amazing. Nintendo is kind of uneven, but the good stuff is really good."</p><p>In-house trailers, he said, often lean on viewers’ preexisting knowledge or excitement; they stop short of going the extra mile.</p><p>"The first <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trailers, I think, are also made in-house. They're terrible. The really good ones – they're really tightly edited and the music's done well – are edited by a place called <a href="https://www.hammercreative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hammer Creative</a> in Los Angeles. Those [first trailers] are incredibly random because [Square Enix] knows it's <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>. Everyone will recognize these scenes. They'll do the work for us. But <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> has great music. Put some amazing music under it. Make me remember all this stuff. It's such a wasted opportunity. We could be [up] here, emotion-wise, and instead, whether people realize it or not, they could be so much more excited."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>You can give people room for speculation and reaction videos and stuff and have it be fun to watch.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Granted, <em>GTA VI</em> isn’t set to come out for another year, so perhaps Rockstar doesn’t have the necessary raw materials on hand to assemble a series of scenes that more explicitly lays out the game’s stakes. But Lieu finds that unlikely, given how video game trailers are typically made. He said that some triple-A studios will spend a month just capturing footage, meaning the process of editing together a trailer “can easily be multiple months.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm working on stuff that's for Summer Game Fest time,” he said. “A lot of these games are not super duper early, but there's still a lot of gray box stuff. So I make my draft of the trailer, and then we polish up the things that need to be done for that."</p><p>There’s also the matter of Rockstar’s infamous commitment to littering trailers with as many hints and easter eggs as possible, to inspire the kind of free marketing the aforementioned “details you missed” lists provide. But Lieu doesn’t believe those sorts of smaller flourishes need to come at the expense of a trailer’s storytelling.</p><p>"You can give people room for speculation and reaction videos and stuff and have it be fun to watch,” said Lieu. “If you look at the <em>Tears Of The Kingdom</em> trailers, it's <em>Legend Of Zelda</em>, so everyone's gonna speculate about every single frame. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHGShqcAHlQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The full trailer</a> is completely epic. ... There's ups and downs, there's big, pivotal moments. If you look at that trailer in terms of its emotional weight, the graph of that would be [a series of taller and taller spikes, building to a huge crescendo]. <em>GTA VI</em>'s is kinda [flat]."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Official Trailer #3" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uHGShqcAHlQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Music is another area where <em>GTA VI</em>’s trailer, in Lieu’s eyes, falters when compared to other major game trailers – or even Rockstar’s previous work. Again, the drama and narrative of the trailer take a backseat, in favor of a song that’s just sort of… there. The song itself, “Hot Together” by The Pointer Sisters, fits the trailer’s vibe, but it’s inelegantly deployed despite Rockstar almost certainly having the resources to give it a proper cinematic treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"So watch the trailer for [movie] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGqiHJTsRkQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Knives Out</em></a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJN4hN28kg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>It Takes Two</em>'s 'Better Together' trailer</a>. Those both use licensed music, but they trailer-ized the music, which Rockstar has the money to do. Not all licensed music can just be put into a sequence and made into a trailer. If you look at<em> Knives Out</em>, that one, especially, is really customized. If you listen to the music during different parts of that trailer, you could really feel like 'Oh, this is the beginning, this is the middle, and this is the end.' But for [<em>GTA VI</em>], the energy just feels flat."</p><p>As Lieu sees it, all of these issues compound to make the trailer feel disconnected – like a series of unrelated moments rather than a cohesive work. For example, the first chunk of the trailer lingers on a day in the life of Jason Duval, a comically jacked Florida man who makes up one half of the game’s core power couple. But it doesn’t initially read like it’s trying to convey several related events from his perspective.</p><p>"That whole opening minute, I didn't even realize that the first scene where the landlord is saying, 'Go get me my money' connected with a shot of [Jason] slapping the guy and opening the register, which is, like, two shots later,” said Lieu. “It's so quick, too. It doesn't feel like 'This is a day in my life. This happens and this happens.’"</p><figure><blockquote><p>Not all licensed music can just be put into a sequence and made into a trailer.</p></blockquote></figure><p>These are, as far as Lieu sees it, fixable issues. They just require a little more signposting.</p><p>"The part where it's showing the two of them doing crime versus them having beers, there's space in there for really simple contrasts. They could be like 'To new beginnings' cut to [gunfire sounds] 'Hands on the floor!' to ask 'Oh, is this actually a new beginning?' To have that dramatic irony there. There' so many things you could do in there, but it just feels very disconnected. It's kind of forcing us to do the work in a not-interesting way."</p><p>This is not to say that trailers have to hand you everything upfront; some of the best trailers lure you in with a plethora of unanswered questions. They give you the basic premise followed by flashes of scenes that function almost as puzzle pieces. Lieu pointed to A24 movie trailers as an example.</p><p>"A24 movie trailers are really good at this, where you have an idea, and they show a lot of the movie after that. If you watch the trailer for<em> Under The Silver Lake</em>, the premise is that [Andrew Garfield’s character’s] girlfriend disappears, and there's a whole lot of stuff after that setup. All of it seems interesting, but none of it actually helps me understand what happens plot-wise, but it's interesting. It does a good job of [conveying] this context of this problem that needs to be solved and then 'These are things that we go through in order to do that.' But we don’t know how it turns out. We don’t even know which parts of the movie [we’re seeing].”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Under the Silver Lake Official Trailer #1 (2018) Andrew Garfield Thriller Movie HD" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkAztth9PpY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Given that we’re talking about Rockstar, one of the most notoriously secretive studios in the business, we can only speculate about the exact intentions underlying this trailer. But we can speak to the end result and the circumstances surrounding it. Last week, Rockstar announced that it was <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-v-was-released-on-september-17-2013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delaying <em>GTA VI</em></a> from 2025 to May of 2026. To those who’ve been waiting for over a decade to finally go on their latest, greatest, balmiest crime vacation, this might suggest trouble in paradise. Rockstar, then, needed to assuage concerns and keep the hype train moving full speed ahead. </p><p>And so, while you might be tempted to view a <em>GTA VI</em> trailer as an easy layup – after all, this game is going to sell more units than there are grains of sand on its meticulously rendered beaches – it does serve an important purpose. Every trailer, even for games whose success seems like a foregone conclusion, does.</p><p>"As big as <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> is,” Lieu said, “it's still important to control the news and keep things top of mind. It's just at a different scale."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/marvel-rivals-healer-strike"><h3>Healers In Marvel Rivals Went On Strike</h3></a><p>Thank your support players once in a while, folks</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
