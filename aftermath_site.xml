      <p>Less than two years<a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs/"> <u>after first purchasing the site</u></a> (along with Rock Paper Shotgun, GamesIndustry.biz and VG247) from Reedpop, media company Ziff Davis (owners of IGN) have conducted a number of layoffs at games media site Eurogamer, affecting both editorial and video roles.</p><p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/games-media-set-for-more-layoffs-as-ign-owned-eurogamer-cuts-editorial-staff/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>As VGC report</u></a>, "the brand’s most experienced editors and its entire four-person video team" are among those impacted, while "behind-the-camera cuts" have also been made at another Ziff-owned property, the YouTube channel Outside Xbox. VGC also say this is "at least its second round of editorial layoffs" to hit Eurogamer since 2024.</p><figure><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/games-media-set-for-more-layoffs-as-ign-owned-eurogamer-cuts-editorial-staff/?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Games media set for more layoffs, as IGN-owned Eurogamer cuts editorial staff | VGC</p><p>Gamer Network brands including Outside Xbox are facing another wave of cuts…</p><p><span>Andy Robinson</span></p></div></a></figure><p>It's just the latest in a succession of<a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-giant-bomb-polygon-layoffs-valnet/"> <u>devastating blows to games media</u></a> over the last few years, as publishers struggle with both a collapsing ad market and their own bone-headed decisions, like Ziff buying a bunch of video games websites when <em>they already owned the biggest one in the world</em>.</p><p>Eurogamer's time under Ziff has been rocky; this is not the first round of layoffs the site has endured since 2024. Last year much of their masthead was overhauled when a number of editors and writers from VG247 were shuffled over to Eurogamer following<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-farewell-from-tom-phillips?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>the departure of veteran EiC Tom Phillips</u></a>.</p><p>The network also lost performance and technical experts Digital Foundry last year, when the team--who had been with Eurogamer since 2007--<a href="https://aftermath.site/digital-foundry-ign-ziff-davis-eurogamer-patreon/"><u>bought their way out from Ziff ownership and went independent</u></a>.</p>
