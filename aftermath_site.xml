    <article>
      <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702170/Strange_Jigsaws/?ref=aftermath.site"><em>Strange Jigsaws'</em></a><em> </em>description is simple: It's a game of strange jigsaws where you solve strange jigsaws. I started playing it recently after seeing <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hownottodraw.bsky.social/post/3m4gmqikclc2b?ref=aftermath.site">some posts</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m4qamjr7n22h?ref=aftermath.site">about it</a> on social media. Created by <em>20 Small Mazes</em> puzzle master FLEB, <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> has about 50 or so puzzles—not necessarily <em>all</em> jigsaw puzzles, but using jigsaw pieces. It opens right into the chaos: "Solve jigsaws. Find the golden pieces. Open the door."</p><figure></figure><p>Designer FLEB opens <em>Strange Jigsaw</em> with a chaotic mess of multiple jigsaw puzzles, signaling that this game is more than just a puzzle simulator. Pieces are everywhere, and it's prudent just to start moving pieces around to test out what they do. Among the first few puzzles, I'm to put pieces together to power a magnet and a computer, respectively, which opens up <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> puzzles even further. Then, trouble! A puzzle is on fire, and <em>Tetris</em>-shaped blocks of water are the only thing that can put them out. On the newly-powered computer, more puzzles: A clever captcha-inspired puzzle game, then a burger-building logic puzzle that reminded me of <a href="https://aftermath.site/is-this-seat-taken-impressions-indie-direct"><em>Is This Seat Taken?</em></a></p><figure></figure><p>There are jigsaws that are highly meta, using pathways controlled by <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>' menu systems. There are darling puzzles illustrated by the designer's seven-year-old daughter, puzzles with missing pieces that must be recolored using a paint fill tool, puzzles that need a screwdriver to solve. <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> is expertly designed, but what makes it truly fantastic is the earnest playfulness of it all: FLEB loves puzzles, and that's obvious. He writes in <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>' Steam description that this game is harder than his last, <em>20 Small Puzzles</em>, and that may be true—but the puzzles here don't feel cruelly hard. Some are hard, but designed in a way to make them feel doable and intentional. I might not understand a puzzle now, but the game reassures me that I will be able to, later.</p><p>There are so many moments in <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> that I want to talk to you about, but unfortunately for me, the person writing about this game, talking about them will sully the experience for you. <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> is just $5, so I urge you simply to try it out yourself. But if you need a taste of what designer FLEB is out, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2570630/20_Small_Mazes/?ref=aftermath.site"><em>20 Small Mazes </em>is free</a>.</p><p>Or, you can look to YouTube: The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FLEBpuzzles?ref=aftermath.site">designer FLEB has a YouTube channel</a> in which he talks about his games and others. It's just as delightful as his games. His recent videos include a retrospective on <em>20 Small Mazes</em> and a newly designed puzzle called <em>Touching Grass</em>, which is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmndrQW5AmA&amp;ref=aftermath.site">naturally built out of grass</a>. Over the past 10 years—with a seven year break somewhere in there—FLEB has made videos about all sorts of different puzzles. If this doesn't convince you that FLEB knows puzzles, I don't know what will.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-second-anniversary-special/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/that-time-a-student-asked-us-not-to-write-any-weird-or-horny-shit-until-4-30-pm-and-other-highlights-from-aftermath%E2%80%99s-first-two-years.1348813/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>We did it. Against all odds (our profound lack of business acumen), we made it to our second anniversary, which is today, <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-a-leftist-meme-account-accidentally-fooled-everyone-into-believing-a-famous-quote-came-from-final-fantasy-tactics">on the dot</a>. We’ll have more – MUCH more – for you next week, but for now, let’s all reminisce about the highs and lows of our first two years (out of a planned infinity).</p><p>On the latest Aftermath Hours, the whole gang – Gita, Chris, Riley, Luke, Isaiah, Nicole, and I – gathers to celebrate Aftermath’s two-year anniversary. We begin by announcing that we’re relaunching the site next week, but not with all the bullshit bells and whistles you’ve come to expect from this sort of thing. Instead, it’ll still be the simple, streamlined Aftermath you’ve come to know and love, but sleeker, more professional, and easier to use. We’re very excited for you all to try it out!</p><p>We then move on to a discussion of how far the site and the underlying business have come, as well as our proudest accomplishments and our hopes and dreams for the future. We want to hire more people and make space for fresh voices, and while that was a pipe dream when we first launched, we’re now tantalizingly on the cusp. Year three, ideally, is when it all happens. Thanks for sticking with us. We wouldn’t – and literally couldn’t – be here without you.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can expand the Aftermath empire until it includes 1,000 overlapping podcasts, at least 500 of them hosted by Riley, who absolutely loves podcasts.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nicole: </strong>We got an email, and Riley shared it with the group. It was about two different stories that I had written. A student wanted to write about a serious one that I had written about <a href="https://aftermath.site/candy-crush-saga-lawsuit-alleged-scam-tournament-king">a lawsuit concerning a <em>Candy Crush</em> scam</a>, and they were like “But my teacher says it has to be from a legitimate website, so can you guys not write about anything weird, like a breast milk river,” which was <a href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-sound-design-maxi-boch">the headline of a story</a> from an interview that I’d previously done. What other site would get that email?</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>“Don’t be weird or horny until this time and date.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>They specifically requested a time. They were like “OK, you can return to publishing those sorts of stories after this point in the day.” I think it was 4:30 PM or something? But until then, no weird shit or horny shit!</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Riley followed up to make sure it went OK.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>They were very kind about it, and it went well.</p><p><strong>Nicole: </strong>It went well. It was allowed.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> They were so lovely about it. I think at other sites, you’d get a mean, harassing email. But this was just so kind and lovely.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> It was so kind and sweet, and it was because they wanted to show the professor that we are a reputable outlet. They just weren’t sure how the professor would take things like breast milk rivers. I was like “You know what? Thank you for doing us this favor for one day. Now your professor will accept us as a source. It’s good for us, good for you.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>It must also be noted that that professor is definitely a coward. They see a breast milk river and think “Oh, they’re not serious?” No, we’re very serious. We just so happen to be serious about many things, including breast milk rivers. That’s fine.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> That was a serious article, too! It was real journalism. You deserve a Pulitzer Prize.</p>

      <p>I try not to be gross on this site, but if you are a man of about 30 or 40 years old you know that your body just gets weird as you age. If you have met a very old man you will see that the hair in their ear and nose area is often out of control. Generally speaking, products for grooming the nose and ear are badly made, annoyingly loud, and battery powered. The Golden Birdie by South Korean brand Royal is none of those things, which is why it is life changing to me.</p><p>Most nose and ear hair trimmers I have used have been battery powered and built like garbage. These things are usually anemic little wands that are way louder than they have any right to be and just take forever at the task of trimming your hairs. The noise is particularly an issue when it comes to your ears, because any motor noise placed directly there becomes borderline dangerous to your hearing. Your other option is plucking, and I can think of few parts of your body that are worse to pluck than your nose hair.</p><figure><figcaption>It comes with a tiny case for travel and a brush for cleaning.</figcaption></figure><p>For a long time I had assumed the solution was more technology, like a quieter motor, but it turns out the opposite was true. The Royal Golden Birdie is a spartan and analog grooming device. It can be used one handed and is meant to be placed between your thumb and index finger. The tip is two interlocking crown shaped prongs that close in on each other when pressure is exerted on both sides. The only noise it makes is a charming metallic rustling sound, like a lower registered version of a barber using shears. It comes apart easily for cleaning; you simply loosen a screw on it and pull the interior layer out to be cleaned with the included brush, which also fits in the case.</p><figure><figcaption>Royal also has a higher end model, but it requires two hands to use.</figcaption></figure><p>Royal makes several models, including a premium one where the brush is stored inside the device, but that one requires using two hands to operate the device itself. I went with the Golden Birdie, which is like five dollars more than the twelve dollar base unit, but I can’t tell what the difference is aside from the golden one claiming to be hypoallergenic. None of these devices cost more than 22 dollars, which is how much money falls out of me like Sonic The Hedgehog every time I leave my house these days.</p><figure><figcaption>Comes apart easily, simple to clean.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike my nasty little Panasonic trimmer, the Golden Birdie just works. With 12 blades, nose and ear hairs just vanish after a handful of delightful little clicks. The Birdie is a joy to use in terms of both its exceeding simplicity and its tactile fidget toy feedback. It gives an otherwise unpleasant grooming task a mild ASMR atmosphere. The Birdie currently has about 11k largely positive reviews on Amazon, so I guess I’m not the only one who really likes this thing.</p><p>I have not put the Golden Birdie through the ringer for more than a few times, and I will concede that it might get shitty over time, but it’s an exceedingly simple device made entirely out of metal with few points of failure (like, say, a motor or battery), and even if it does fail me in the future it costs between a good sandwich and a very good sandwich to replace. That’s the joy when you find a simple solution to an age old problem – there’s just way fewer parts to screw up.</p>

      <p>It’s easy to grow jaded as a gamer, and even easier to forget why you got interested in games to begin with. As trends in video games change, you may find yourself longing for an imagined yesteryear, where that spark was still fresh. As a member of the diehard cult that hopes that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/telltale-delays-the-wolf-among-us-2-till-at-least-next-year-because-if-its-half-baked-were-going-to-get-torn-to-shreds/?ref=aftermath.site"><em>The Wolf Among Us 2</em> will ever see the light of day</a>, <em>Dispatch </em>feels like a return to the experimental golden age of episodic choice-driven storytelling, where fun isn’t in photorealism but in the online water cooler buzz of what you chose and why.</p><figure><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/DomTheBombYT/status/1984327008487428270?ref=aftermath.site"></a></blockquote></figure><p>After bingeing the first four playable episodes of <a href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-demo"><em>Dispatch</em></a>, I found myself swept back (<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dispatch-narrative-superhero-game-episodic-telltale-games?ref=aftermath.site">alongside other like-minded, nostalgic players</a>) into the magic of<em> Life is Strange</em> and <em>The Walking Dead—</em>the very games that ignited my love for storytelling in my teens when an innocuous <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/life_is_strange/b/playstation4/archive/2015/01/29/life-is-strange-episode-one-chrysalis-review-game-informer.aspx?ref=aftermath.site">GameInformer magazine blurb</a> first sold me on the dream of games playing like episodic TV.

In <em>Dispatch</em>’s fandom, players feel less like rivals in a competitive arena and more like a community—eager to swap decisions, analyze tiny details, trade puzzle tips, and even talk about romance without feeling juvenile or ironic.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>This year <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/box-office-demon-slayer-infinity-castle-biggest-anime-opening-1236516498/?ref=aftermath.site"><em>Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle</em> </a>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/chainsaw-man-movie-reze-arc-box-office-weekend-premiere/?ref=aftermath.site"><em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em></a> played spoiler at the box office in their respective opening weekends (for the pocket-watching pundits among us), aweing moviegoers with the indescribable spark of magic animation. Anime has legs and is worth taking seriously as a new direction in cinema. Instead of addressing the 2D elephant of a lesson in the face, Hollywood said, “You know what the world really needs? More live-action anime films.”</p><p>According to an exclusive report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/chloe-zhao-manga-kodansha-studios-1236605962/?ref=aftermath.site">Deadline</a> (on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kodansha.us/post/3m4qpg6tpu32x?ref=aftermath.site">manga day</a>, no less), Chloé Zhao, two-time Oscar winner behind<em> Nomadland</em> and Marvel’s <em>Eternals</em>, and Nicholas Gonda are teaming up with manga publisher <a href="https://aftermath.site/heres-the-dumb-shit-you-have-to-put-up-with-to-read-manga-these-days">Kodansha</a> to head up a global studio called Kodansha Studios. Kodansha Studios, in turn, will exist for the express purpose of creating “premium, live action movies and television series” based on manga from Kodansha. To break this down in comic book movie terms, Kodansha is pulling a DC Studios by having Zhao and Gonda become their <a href="https://gizmodo.com/james-gunn-head-of-dc-movies-and-tv-warner-bros-1849701460?ref=aftermath.site">James Gunn and Peter Safran</a>, guiding a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/report-david-zaslav-pushed-back-on-ta-nahesi-coates-black-superman-movie-for-being-too-woke-2000628090?ref=aftermath.site">new era of live-action anime films</a> to a cinematic golden age. All the while, ensuring quality control, fostering healthy communication between international directors and manga creators, and developing solid scripts to bring their work to light. Hopefully, this will make the phrase “live-action anime film” less of a punchline than it has been over the past decade by utilizing Kodansha's manga catalog.</p><p>On paper, all of it sounds lovely, set against the haphazard wild west of <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-one-piece-yu-yu-hakusho-anime-live-action-netfl-1850050620?ref=aftermath.site">random-ass live-action Hollywood adaptations</a> that have seen the light of day and are looming menacingly over the horizon. But it's hard not to reflexively recoil when the Deadline piece namedrops “beloved manga” like Katsuhiro Otomo’s <em>Akira</em>,<em> </em>and go, “God dammit, they’re gonna try doing it again.”</p><figure><iframe width="160" height="90" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IqVoEpRIaKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>If there is any anime that could be considered Hollywood’s Moby Dick, it is <em>Akira</em>. Still, Kodansha Studios' mere existence essentially shows that, despite decades of false starts, studio reshuffles, and directorial ghosting—such as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/warner-bros-gives-up-on-akira-remake-but-hollywood-wont-2000621686?ref=aftermath.site">Warner Bros. shelving its version</a> in the early 2000s, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/jordan-peele-nope-akira-adaption-references-film-1850048374?ref=aftermath.site">Jordan Peele</a> politely declining, and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/taika-waititi-still-plans-on-directing-akira-eventuall-1839207999?ref=aftermath.site">Taika Waititi</a> eventually withdrawing after years of development hell—<em>Akira</em> remains Hollywood’s promised-yet-elusive cash cow. With Kodansha Studios declaring its raison d’être as “premium live-action projects” (whatever that means), the thought that <em>Akira </em>might be their flagship effort feels like creative ambition and more like comedic arrogance. Should <em>Akira </em>prove to be the hill Kodansha Studios chose to die on, with the promise of guaranteed success because it’s popular, it’s hard not to stifle a laugh at the thought of it still attempting to see the light of day.</p><figure><iframe width="160" height="90" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BXsar5rpgwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Tokyo Movie Shinsha’s 1988 <a href="https://gizmodo.com/akira-35-year-retrospective-impact-1850645834?ref=aftermath.site"><em>Akira</em></a> isn’t just a sci-fi anime film. It’s a miracle. A once-in-history convergence built on unheard-of budget, artistic labor, and technical muscle that animated over 160,000 cels and hand-painted matte backgrounds with the kind of obsessive artistry that <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2020/6/8/akira-anime-film-producer-corrects-30-year-fact-on-how-much-the-groundbreaking-film-cost-to-make?srsltid=AfmBOorrcZSOtdh698GQTcySSmgOi-xMhlmUSUnrM1vhjt7qmmXVFb0E&amp;ref=aftermath.site">no studio today could bankroll</a>. The film isn’t just looked back on as lightning in a bottle but as a global flag-planting moment that declared anime as a cutting-edge art form worth taking seriously. Threatening to recapture it in live action isn’t just misguided—it verges on being creatively bankrupt. Undeterred by taste, history, hubris, or the sheer impossibility of doing it justice.</p><p>To quote YouTuber Cosmonaut Marcus in his succinctly titled video, <a href="https://youtu.be/f9I-s2UwxZk?ref=aftermath.site">Why I Hate Live-Action Anime Adaptations</a>, “If you agree to adapt an anime into a live-action TV show or movie for Hollywood, then it means that you are already disrespecting the source material because in any great animated work, the beauty goes beyond the story or the characters, usually it's good because it's animated.”</p><p>While I’m <a href="https://aftermath.site/bet-kakegurui-netflix-live-action-anime">a bit of a sicko</a> who likes some live-action adaptations on their own merits, I agree with the latter half of Marcus’ take. Roughly 90 percent of why anime fans like the medium is the moving drawings. So reading this news in concert with Sony, through its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/sonys-potential-kadokawa-acquisition-could-tighten-its-grip-on-anime-and-manga-2000526376?ref=aftermath.site">fucked up homunculus merger with Kadokawa</a>, also plans to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/anime-movies/sony-is-stepping-up-its-plans-for-more-live-action-movie-adaptations-of-anime-and-manga-properties/?ref=aftermath.site">ramp up its live-action efforts</a>, despite their direct financial success from <em>Demon Slayer</em> and <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, has me both fucking exasperated and side-eyeing Kodansha Studios playing follow the leader.</p><figure></figure><p>It’s not like Kodansha hasn’t had successes with already-made anime adaptations of its works; they're special because they're animated beautifully, filling in the gaps in manga panel artistry for anime fans without losing their artistry. And Kodansha’s library has proven to yield some of the most memorable anime films, like <em>Weathering With</em> <em>You </em>and <em>A Silent Voice</em>—<em>anime</em> films being the operative word.</p><p>Playing devil's advocate, there are exceptions to the rule of live action adaptations not being an entire crapshoot, but mainly as a reflection in fans' eyes in retrospect as cult classic hits with the likes of Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt-led<em> </em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/all-you-need-is-kill-anime-movie-trailer-edge-of-tomorrow-warner-bros-2000575528?ref=aftermath.site"><em>Live Die Repeat</em></a> and The Wachowskis’ <em>Speed Racer</em> (pound for pound <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwh9ETdhrf4&amp;t=2980s&amp;ref=aftermath.site">the best live action anime film of all time</a>). There’s even been pretty decent live-action ventures in the past, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-loved-no-really-about-alita-battle-angel-1832758443?ref=aftermath.site"><em>Alita Battle Angel</em></a>, and that Netflix adaptation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLfE-WiHAWU&amp;pp=ygUdbGFzdCBzYW11cmFpIHN0YW5kaW5nIG5ldGZsaXjSBwkJAwoBhyohjO8%3D&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em>Last Samurai Standing</em></a> looks promising. But for every success, there’s also monumental failures from leveraging Kodansha’s catalogue for live-action works—your Scarlett Johansson-led <a href="https://www.wyomingnewspapers.org/?a=d&amp;d=WYWPN20170501-01.1.7&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=-------en-20-WYWPN-1--img-txIN%7CtxCO%7CtxTA-isaiah+colbert+ghost+in+the+shell-------0------&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em>Ghost in the Shell</em></a>.</p><p>Should Zhao and Gonda prove masterful international directors and original mangaka matchmakers, bringing underappreciated gems into the mainstream with “premium” live-action projects for works like all power to them. Works less likely to make folks reflexively throw their arms up like hearing “live action <a href="https://kotaku.com/my-hero-academia-netflix-live-action-anime-bnha-movie-1849883927?ref=aftermath.site"><em>My Hero Academia</em></a> or live action <a href="https://gizmodo.com/naruto-live-action-film-lionsgate-1851047617?ref=aftermath.site"><em>Naruto</em></a>,” not helping themselves by going for big-spectacle, fantasy-laden shonen hits with an even larger margin for error, for the disrespect Marcus mentioned earlier, to bring it to live action and look shit. If the first of their projects is <em>Akira</em>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gachiakuta-doesnt-just-redefine-shonen-anime-it-anoints-itself-as-the-next-big-thing-2000622249?ref=aftermath.site"><em>Gachiakuta</em></a><em>,</em> <em>Fire Punch</em>, or <em>Shangra La Frontier</em>, because they’re popular fantastical works, then all good will for Kodansha Studios is lost.</p><p>If Kodansha Studios instead invests in showcasing its creative skills through greenlighting live-action series and films based on more realistic sleeper hits in seinen and shojo genres, like <em>Princess Jellyfish</em>, <em>Blue Period</em>,<em> Hajime no Ippo</em>, or (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/vinland-saga-creator-makoto-yukimura-looks-back-on-writing-his-pacifist-viking-epic-2000664303?ref=aftermath.site">gulp</a>) <em>Vinland Saga,</em> then, and only then, can it flirt with its strength as a studio capable of delivering on its promises for all its so-called premium projects. Do that, and I can have faith in prospective Kodansha Studio live-action adaptations of series like <em>Knights of Sidonia</em>, <em>Land of the Lustrous</em>, <em>To Your Eternity</em>, <em>Tower Dungeon</em>, and be less gun-shy about them possibly tackling <em>Akira</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[I Owe My Workday To Criterion 24/7]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7.1348795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Most of the time when I’m working I need a little background noise. Sometimes that means music, sometimes podcasts, sometimes streamers. Most recently I’ve been working with the Criterion 24/7 channel on my second monitor, and I swear to god it’s fixing my mental health.</p><p>My husband and I are very aware of how much bullshit we let into our minds. We try not to binge television shows—after three episodes, we watch something else. For every fluffy blockbuster we watch, we make an appointment to watch something off the beaten path. We pop on an episode of <em>The Gilded Age</em> before embarking on an hours-long baseball game. It’s all about balance: If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p><p>But when I work, I often seek out the kind of slop I try to avoid in the rest of my life. For a long time my bread and butter for working was extremely long Let’s Plays, but I also keep podcasts in the rotation for a similar reason: I just like to hear the sound of human voices while I work on something. Streamers like NorthernLion and Hasan Piker have also worked their way into my routines, though there’s only so much I can take of grown men playing video games at this point in my life, as amusing as their anecdotes may be.</p><p>Reality television (my husband hates it, so I can only watch it in my office), podcasts and streamers genuinely do help me to get started with my work, because they help me feel like I’m not just typing alone in my office with my cat. The problem with all these sources of “content” is that they make me feel like my brain is melting after a while. So last week, on a whim, I tossed on the Criterion’s 24/7 channel, which plays movies from the Criterion Collection 24 hours a day, and I had the complete opposite effect.</p><p>I know that watching a dense, foreign language film like <em>Ceddo</em> while working on an essay or typing emails isn’t going to help me retain much of what I’ve seen. But that said, looking over to my second screen and seeing a frame that’s been arranged deliberately, with care, makes me simply feel more like an adult. I know I can’t really watch the movie with the focus it deserves, but at the very least it’s another really cool film to add to my list, and my growing collection of Blu Rays from Criterion.</p><p>Because of Criterion 24/7, which is available with a subscription to the Criterion’s streaming service, I’ve enjoyed the pleasures of Orson Welles’s<em> The Trial</em>, Pierre Creton’s experimental gay coming of age story <em>Un Prince</em>, as well as <em>In Celebration</em>, which features a very young Brian Cox. Sometimes I’m still in the mood for slop, but it’s a more balanced diet. Even if I’m not grasping every detail from these films, I still feel better off for having seen them—and am sometimes drawn into ten or fifteen minute stretches of beautifully framed shots. Since all of these movies are already in the Criterion streaming collection, I can always watch them again when I’m not working. But when I am working, they remind me that I am not sitting around bullshitting. Like these artists, I have the ability to make things with care, too.</p><p>My mom, who is a professor, used to watch Turner Classic Movies all day long while grading papers before she formed a mild addiction to home renovating shows on Bravo. Maybe I picked up this habit from her instead of inventing it wholecloth. Either way, watching images that are more than incidental, and aspire to more than just entertainment, is healing my neural pathways. It gives me no joy to admit this, but my mom had a point there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Today, as part of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125039888/ef20057994_defa14a.htm?ref=aftermath.site">an updated FAQ</a> aimed at workers (<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners?ref=aftermath.site">spotted by Game File</a>), EA said that its <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-ea-sale-is-bad-news-for-everyone">impending $55 billion sale</a> to a consortium that includes Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund will not come at the cost of creative control. If you take EA at its word, I have a bridge to sell you.</p><p>The FAQ includes a number of tersely worded sentiments intended to reassure.</p><p>"We will continue to be guided by our cultural values of creativity, pioneering, passion, determination, learning, and teamwork," it says to counter concerns around a change in culture. "EA will maintain creative control and our track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact."</p><p>Another eyebrow raiser: no layoffs following a major acquisition. From a company that already <a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-respawn-titanfall-layoffs-andrew-wilson-pay">laid off hundreds of employees</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs">across multiple rounds</a> earlier this year in the name of “<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-says-business-primed-for-accelerated-growth-following-layoffs?ref=aftermath.site">accelerated growth</a>.” Following a buyout that will <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-gaming-is-the-new-oil-how-the-ea-buyout-diverges-from-the-traditional-playbook-?ref=aftermath.site">saddle the company with $20 billion in debt</a>. Sure!</p><p>"There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction," reads the response to a question about layoffs. "Our focus is on driving innovation, and expanding our global reach, all of which require world class teams, who are excited to shape the future of entertainment."</p><p>The driving message underlying the FAQ is more of the same – literally, with EA saying that management, HQ, AI usage, and other staples will remain exactly as they are now.</p><p>That would be great if big companies had given us any reason to believe them in circumstances like this, ever. Bungie leadership told employees that Sony’s purchase of the studio <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/02/01/bungie-sony-buyout-destiny-2-developers/?ref=aftermath.site">wouldn’t result in layoffs or restructuring</a> back in 2022. Look at Bungie now: It’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio?ref=aftermath.site">a husk of itself</a>, dragging new <em>Destiny </em>expansions across the finish line while betting big on <em>Marathon</em>, a game whose lunch may have just been preemptively devoured by <em>Arc Raiders</em>.</p><p>Or consider everything Microsoft said in its attempts to avert the regulatory Eye Of Sauron while its purchase of Activision Blizzard was still pending. The deal will be <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/02/employee-organizing-engagement-labor-economy/?ref=aftermath.site">super worker-friendly</a>? <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july">Uhhh</a>. Game Pass prices <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-wins-against-ftc-injunction-against-activision-blizzard-buyout-is-denied/?ref=aftermath.site">won’t skyrocket</a>? <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/as-microsoft-lays-off-thousands-and-jacks-up-game-pass-prices-former-ftc-chair-says-i-told-you-so-the-activision-blizzard-buyout-is-harming-both-gamers-and-developers/?ref=aftermath.site">Hmmm</a>.</p><p>The latter comparison is especially apt when taken alongside the growing chorus of voices calling for greater regulatory scrutiny of the EA deal. In the immediate aftermath (dot site) of the sale’s announcement, US senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf?ref=aftermath.site">sent</a> <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Electronic-Arts-CEO-Andrew-Wilson.pdf?ref=aftermath.site">letters</a> to US Treasury Secretary and Committee Of Foreign Investment chair Scott Bessent and Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson warning of risks that include "surveillance of Americans, covert Saudi propaganda, and selective retaliation and censorship of persons disfavored by the Saudi government."</p><p>Workers at EA, in collaboration with <a href="https://aftermath.site/uvw-cwa-video-game-union-microsoft-trump-musk">CWA’s direct-join video game union</a>, have also voiced extreme suspicion of the deal, saying in a statement last month that they and theirs stand to be “jeopardized as a result of this deal” despite the fact that they were “not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed.”</p><p>“We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful,” the EA workers wrote.</p><p>Most recently, CWA president Claude Cummings Jr sent formal letters to the Federal Trade Commission and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States calling for a comprehensive review of the deal.</p><p>“This deal is not about innovation or growth for the U.S. economy – it’s about handing control to a small group of powerful investors and putting thousands of jobs and sensitive consumer data at risk,” said Cummings Jr in a statement of his own. “I’m calling on CFIUS Chair Scott Bessent and FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson to scrutinize this deal carefully and to ensure that this deal protects American workers, consumers, and the future of the video game industry.”</p><p>Of course, Trump’s FTC is different from Biden’s FTC, which, under now-former-commissioner Lina Khan, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-18/biden-antitrust-enforcers-set-new-record-for-merger-challenges?embedded-checkout=true&amp;ref=aftermath.site">blocked a record number of mergers</a> in an attempt to stem the tide of monopoly power in the US. On top of that, it is impossible to ignore the fact that another member of the consortium purchasing EA is Affinity Partners, an investment firm formed by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law. Trump has also done ample business in Saudi Arabia <a href="https://archive.is/6QLOj?ref=aftermath.site">since he won the 2024 presidential election</a>. Now, with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/saudi-crown-prince-bin-salman-will-visit-trump-november-18-white-house-official-2025-11-03/?ref=aftermath.site">set to visit the White House later this month</a> – seemingly to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/world/middleeast/mohammed-bin-salman-us-visit.html?ref=aftermath.site">discuss a nuclear deal and a defense pact</a> – the odds seemed stacked against those who’d rather not see the EA sale sail right on through.</p><p>Elsewhere in games, the International Olympic Committee recently backed out of a deal with the Saudi government to host and operate the Esports Olympic Games. According to <a href="https://esportsadvocate.net/2025/10/esports-breakup-why-the-ioc-backed-out-of-saudi-esports-deal/?ref=aftermath.site">a report from The Esports Advocate</a>, the two sides failed see eye-to-eye on the creation of an overseeing federation after the Saudi government concluded that existing options were insufficient. What the Saudi government proposed instead would've been under its control in perpetuity, an arrangement the IOC found untenable.</p><p>The report concludes with the following note:</p><p>"Further, the Saudi contingent pushed back on being forced to put women in leadership positions and adhering to rules on who (what nations) it could or could not allow to participate."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>As one of the nerdiest Paradox grand strategy series around--and that's saying something--you would think that giving someone nearly an entire month to review the latest <em>Europa Universalis</em> game would be more than enough time to get a handle on it. And yet!</p><p>Despite Paradox giving reviewers a remarkably generous lead-in--only a select few Japanese series like <em>Yakuza </em>or <em>Persona</em> have given as long in recent memory--as the <em>Europa Universalis V</em> embargo crept ever-closer last week I found myself staring at my disjointed notes and a blank page thinking "man, there is just no way I can review this".</p><p>Not because I can't review grand strategy games themselves--<a href="https://kotaku.com/victoria-3-review-paradox-pc-kotaku-impressions-verdict-1849669988?ref=aftermath.site">I love doing that!</a>--but because whether intentionally or not, Paradox's first-party efforts have over the last few years become increasingly malleable things, changing their core features and sometimes entire vibes every time an expansion, update or even patch rolls around.</p><p><em>Victoria 3</em>, for example, has had a rollercoaster ride of tweaks and balances since launch. And <em>Crusader Kings III</em>, which somehow released over five years ago now, has in that timeframe become almost something else entirely, landing as a prettier<em> Crusader Kings II </em>before turning into everything from a singleplayer RPG to, in its latest expansion, a game that spans as far as China and Japan.</p><p>Both of which are fine, maybe even great in <em>CK3's</em> case, but all that meddling makes the idea of some kind of review at <em>Europa Universalis V's</em> exact time of launch feel almost irrelevant. What the hell is the point of me giving a long list of thoughts about this game now, in October 2025, when by March 2027 it could be an entirely different experience? Especially when, unlike its more focused stablemates, <em>EU5 </em>is ambitious enough to let you play a single game that begins in the 1300s and ends just before the American Civil War, which means we are messing with a <em>lot </em>of variables here.</p><p>Even just during the time I've had a pre-release copy of <em>EU5</em>,<em> </em>the goalposts have moved a number of times, with seemingly harmless bugs (like an overpowered Papacy) repeatedly patched out because they were messing up people’s campaigns. And as much as there is already in the game, you can still see the outline of where there's going to be (over the course of years of expansions) so much more, whether it be fleshing out the storylines of minor nations to making more far-flung tribes and nations playable.</p><p>Also standing in my way of being able to give some kind of proper "review" of <em>EU5 </em>is the fact that, even with weeks to play it, I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface of its systems and possibilities. Some of the updates made to my pre-release copy broke older saves, so I've only had time to play as three nations (Holland, England and Scotland), and there's so much to this game that it might be months before I've fully come to grips with stuff like its economic management.</p><p>In many ways these games have become their own kind of MMO or Forever Shooter. Many outlets won't score games like that anymore, or will update their thoughts several times as they go. <a href="https://kotaku.com/crusader-kings-ii-the-kotaku-re-review-1783955128?ref=aftermath.site">Some of my favourite pieces of critical work over the past decade</a> haven't been reviews of Paradox games but re-reviews of them,<a href="https://kotaku.com/hearts-of-iron-iv-the-kotaku-re-review-1847022998?ref=aftermath.site"> checking in years after release to see how they've evolved and bedded in</a>. To me that feels like the best time to not just experience a Paradox game but to talk about one.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Go on, pick one</span></figcaption></figure><p>What I <em>can </em>say now, after spending over 100 hours with a game I nevertheless feel I can’t “review,” is that what's there is pretty good! I think. I'm primarily a <em>Crusader Kings</em> and <em>Hearts of Iron</em> guy. I'm not and have never really been an <em>EU </em>guy and that, combined with a weird bug on my last PC that never let me get past the title screen on <em>EU4</em>, means I haven't touched the series since at least 2019, so going into this new entry I couldn't remember <em>shit</em>. I had no idea what was new or just improved, and it took me days just to learn (or re-learn) how to play the game, even with some fairly substantial tutorials attached.</p><p>One thing I did instantly appreciate though was a substantial, <em>Football Manager</em>-like series of automation tools. Anywhere you see a gear icon--and that's on practically every menu screen in every aspect of the game--you can click it and the AI will take over that part of your nation's affairs for you. While maybe not necessary for series fiends, or anyone running one of the game's 117,000 tiny German principalities, I found it invaluable when playing as a larger nation (like England) because I simply couldn't be bothered tinkering with every little building and trade deal when I had more important things to do, like exploring distant lands, insulting the Papacy and beating up on France.</p><p>The amount of stuff I managed to outsource to the AI was impressive in that it liberated my attention span, and also let me see just how much of the game I still had to learn, which returns to my point above; even with weeks to play <em>EU5 </em>I'm still discovering fundamental things every time I make an errant mouse click or stumble on a hovering tooltip I hadn't noticed before. I didn't know I had to manually upgrade a town to a city until last week. I only found out you could build bridges from a fellow 3MA panellist in a Discord chat. There's simply too much game here for me to even discover, let alone pass comprehensive judgement on, at this stage of its life.</p><p>Even with the AI running vast parts of my empire, constant pop-up events still kept me busy, and there's a surprising variety of them, each tailored not just to the age but the people and place as well. Playing as Scotland, I got a number of very Scottish decisions to make, and helpfully the game even has an icon telling you which one is the historical choice if you want to go down that route. Fighting a war is pretty standard Paradox stuff, as is diplomacy, and while slightly cumbersome (in that you can't simply explore a whole ocean, you can only unlock small sections of it at a time) the game's exploration section also works pretty easily.</p><p>This superficial side of the game, a feast of just the icing, no cake, was a blast. With no personal interest in the fine details this game offers--the numbers run so deep you can burrow down and see each item being traded in every port, and the specific population breakdown of every town and region in your nation--I loved just focusing on the big picture, and really did feel like I was some kind of demigod managing every aspect of my people's lives for 500 years.</p><p>Playing as Scotland I got caught in a messy land war in Ireland. I speedran my break from a corrupt and decadent Catholic Church. I agreed to divide the new world (where I'd founded Scottish colonies everywhere from Greenland to Georgia) with the Pope. I survived the black death, explored the seas and was constantly having to mediate between the vested interests of my nobles, workers and priests. All without ever once dipping into the game's production and trading systems, which lurk beneath the surface of <em>Europa Universalis</em> like the bulk of an iceberg.</p><p>Oh, I also had a family to marry off, a complicated alliance with France to maintain, kids to educate, a cabinet to oversee, parliaments to organise and massage votes through, 500 years of scientific research to read over, uprisings to quell, roads to build, navies to maintain. Even on this icing-only diet, there's a LOT TO DO.</p><figure><figcaption><span>There are hundreds of Kingdoms and nations you can play as, so getting customised events like this one is very fun</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm not just listing all of that here for the quantity's sake; it all feels consequential. I could always see the reactions to my decisions: shifting prices affect people's welfare and happiness, leading to revolts or migrations or both, and spending money on education got me a more literate population and loads of visible benefits as a result. I have no idea how robust any of this is on a long-term basis--to reiterate once more, I did not come close to surveying this game in its entirety--but it certainly looked and felt real, empowering even.</p><p>With its lack of a fully-fledged character system and a (relatively) simple approach to fighting wars, it may lack the personal touch of <em>Crusader Kings </em>or the brutal satisfaction of <em>Hearts of Iron</em>, but <em>EU5 </em>is still Paradox at their best: giving the player a place and time in human history and letting them not just live through it, but dictate its terms.</p><p>I played this game a lot over the last month, and what I played, even with its limitations, I loved. I can see myself playing a lot more in the years to come, maybe even enough to fully understand how to play whole sections of it and be able to report back with a better idea of what this game eventually becomes, not what it is at launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Everybody <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review">loved</a> <em>Blue Prince</em>, and at this point it feels like everybody has finished (or, “<a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending">finished</a>”) <em>Blue Prince</em>, but I’m still here thinking “boy, I really should get back to <em>Blue Prince</em>” while knowing there’s a good chance I won’t. As much as I liked what I played, it just <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-beginner">didn’t get its hooks in my brain</a> the way it did with others, and it’s the kind of game that needs passion to see it through. But I have finally found my sicko mode, “can’t stop thinking about it and need to talk to everyone about it” puzzle game: <em>The Seance of Blake Manor</em>.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1395520/The_Sance_of_Blake_Manor/?ref=aftermath.site"><em>The Seance of Blake Manor</em></a> casts you as Declan Ward, a detective in 1890s Ireland who’s been called to a mysterious manor hotel to investigate the disappearance of a woman named Evelyn Deane. A diverse crew of guests has gathered at the manor to attend a seance, and it quickly becomes clear that they all have their reasons to wish Deane harm. You have the weekend to figure out what happened to Deane and who’s responsible before the seance occurs on Sunday night.</p><figure><iframe width="160" height="90" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QF8sknUZUW4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>The time limit can feel pressuring, but time only passes when you undertake certain clearly-marked actions, such as examining objects, questioning guests, and attending events like meals and lectures. An important first step in solving the mystery is filling your timetable with the weekend’s activities and guests’ schedules, so you’ll know who will or won’t be where every hour. The latter is particularly helpful; one fruitful avenue of investigation is to break into everyone’s rooms and go through their stuff, and you definitely don’t want to get caught. Ask me how I know.</p><figure><figcaption>Analyzing a character tells you more about them and gives you topics to discuss (Spooky Door)</figcaption></figure><p>Every guest and staff of the hotel has a backstory, motive, and relationships with other characters. And they’re not just cursory stuff for atmosphere; I almost immediately forgot about the game’s central mystery as I dug into secret love affairs, thwarted career ambitions, cryptic plots, mystical societies, class and race tensions, failed romances, and people struggling to square their faiths with a changing Ireland and with the popularity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritualism_(movement)?ref=aftermath.site">Spiritualism</a>, a 19th and early 20th century movement to communicate with the dead that threatened much of society’s <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/419656?ref=aftermath.site">status quo</a>. (Spiritualism is one of my top <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025072830/https://kotaku.com/the-real-fakery-of-the-ouija-board-1819805308">niche interests</a>, and I’m also currently learning the <a href="https://aftermath.site/irish-now-youre-talking">Irish language</a>; the fact that there’s a game about both is <em>very</em> exciting for me specifically.) To add to the plot stuff, the game is also full of things to learn about the history of the manor, Chrisitian gnosticism, and Irish folklore, politics, and history–a lot of this information is kept in the manor’s library, where you can research plot-essential stuff, but also browse the shelves for more detail on a topic. I’ve spent way more time doing this than I have actually trying to figure out what happened to Deane; I’m currently just before Saturday dinner and feel like I have no hope of solving her mystery <em>and</em> preventing whatever horrors it’s hinted will happen at Sunday night’s seance. With over 20 characters to learn about and whose problems to solve, I’m constantly panicking about the time limit, though players who’ve beaten the game tell me not to worry and that they ended things with time to spare.</p><figure><figcaption>The library (Spooky Door)</figcaption></figure><p>The game has a robust set of menus to help you keep track of all this and figure out what to do next. When you talk to characters, available topics are represented by icons to choose from, and while characters will only talk about certain topics so you don’t fritter away your time too badly, not all of them are essential for your investigations. Discovering more about the topics that <em>are</em> important places those topics on a mind map/ conspiracy board that shows how they’re connected and paints an overall picture of a character and their story. (I’d show you images, but they would be full of spoilers; you can see a glimpse of this in the trailer above.) When you’ve connected enough bits of information, you’re given a Mad Libs-style screen in which to create a hypothesis by filling in words from your conspiracy board, and then you can confront that particular character about it. I found these Mad Libs a little fiddly on occasion to express my hypothesis exactly how the game wanted me to, but it’s a fun mechanic with a lot of guardrails to make sure you know what’s going on. So far, some of my confrontations have wrapped up a character’s story, while others have introduced actions I need to take to fully resolve things, which means more investigating.</p><p>The game menus do their best to keep everything organized for you and to nudge you about where to go next, but I haven’t always found it to be quite enough, so I also keep a notebook beside me while I play. Occasionally I’ve been frustrated when I feel like I know enough to confront a character but haven’t discovered all the things to let the <em>game</em> know I know them, but those instances have been pretty rare. My main problem is that everything is so interesting that I’m constantly getting off track, suddenly remembering that time is ticking down and I’m no closer to putting my top priorities to bed.</p><figure><figcaption>Story cutscenes are told through dialogue and static images (Spooky Door)</figcaption></figure><p>For me, <em>The Seance of Blake Manor</em> echoes <em>Blue Prince</em>’s interlocking mysteries and sense of place without having to contend with its life-eating RNG and open-endedness (I’ve also seen some players compare the two game’s art styles.). There’s some <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> vibes too (a game I actually <em>did</em> <a href="https://aftermath.site/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-end">finish</a>!), and I’ve wrestled with wanting to start again to introduce the game to the <a href="https://aftermath.site/lorelei-laser-eyes-tips-steam-nintendo">friend</a> I played <em>Lorelei </em>with, and not wanting anything to come between me and seeing its end. But at the same time, I’m tempted to start again just so there’ll be more game to play, even though I have a full in-game day and evening left; like a good book, I both want to know what happens in the end and to never be done with it.</p><p>It sucks to be writing about <em>Blake Manor</em> on a Monday morning because now I want to be playing it but a whole work day stands in the way. There is just <em>so much</em> in this game, all of it given so much detail and attention that I’m thoroughly lost in it, while still providing enough guidance to keep me from getting totally washed away. It’s captured the obsession and passion of all those puzzle games I couldn’t get into this year, while still being a constrained experience I can actually tackle, with that time limit bringing a tension that feels essential to the game’s story and atmosphere. There’s a free demo on Steam if you want to get a feel for it first; you should do this not just because the game is good, but because then I’ll have more people playing alongside me to talk about it with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Due to what has become our specific remit, we – or at least I, Nathan – have spent the week with eyes on the <a href="https://aftermath.site/trump-halo-twitter/">“government uses gamer memes” situation</a> like a diligent newscopter. The latest development? The Department Of Homeland Security has started sprinkling <em>Lord Of The Rings</em> in with its misunderstanding of <em>Halo</em>. But though the cultural touchstones might be new (relative to, like, the 1950s and decidedly <em>not </em>relative to modern gaming culture), the tactics are not. Viciously calling back to an imagined better time is the oldest trick in the far-right book. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>This time around, we bathe in the afterglow of Aftermath’s first-ever in-person party before hinting at big changes to come (the good kind) as a result of the site’s upcoming second anniversary. <strong>Note: Due to a technical issue we learned about<em> right after</em> recording this episode, those changes will be coming the week after next – not next week, as we said during the episode. Apologies for the confusion.</strong></p><p>Then we discuss the United States government’s sudden gaming fixation, following <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-halo-dhs-ice-trump-flood/">a flood of <em>Halo </em>memes</a> from White House and Department Of Homeland Security accounts, as well as <a href="https://aftermath.site/us-government-halo-jd-vance-hasan-piker-dog/">JD Vance’s embarrassing reveal</a> that he not only keeps abreast of Twitch drama but is fluent in CollarGate, a widespread nontroversy about Hasan Piker turning out to be a secret dog torturer.</p><p>After that, we move on to Amazon’s devastating <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-layoffs-what-we-know-teams-roles-affected-job-cuts-2025-10?ref=aftermath.site">layoff of 14,000 people</a>, including many of those working on<em> New World</em>, a once-popular MMO that’s now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-isnt-closing-mmo-new-world-right-away-but-it-wont-guarantee-the-life-of-the-game-past-2026?ref=aftermath.site">being wound down</a>. As it turns out, like many others, Amazon tried to take on Steam, and also like many others, it <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/as-amazons-game-business-crumbles-the-public-is-surprised-to-discover-that-it-was-trying-to-compete-with-steam-all-this-time/?ref=aftermath.site">failed miserably</a>. Finally, in honor of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/ACNH_3.0_Update_and_Switch_2_Edition:_All_Details_and_Everything_New?ref=aftermath.site">surprise 3.0 update</a>, we share our <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizon</em> opinions (Nintendo was too inspired by cozy games, a genre it basically invented with… <em>Animal Crossing</em>.)</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can make a modern <em>Animal Crossing</em> where all the villagers verbally accost you again.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>All of these things do have a feeling of dragging and resuscitating a corpse. Who the fuck actively cares about <em>Halo </em>right now? The only reason they did that is because [Microsoft] <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one?ref=aftermath.site">announced that remaster</a> PlayStation is also getting – that whole conversation. I looked at that remaster and was like “If you guys want that, that’s fine.” But I can already play <em>Halo </em>multiple ways. The <em>Master Chief Collection</em> is kinda fine.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>It makes me think of the sort of shared masculinity of the <em>Halo </em>choir in the bathroom – that kind of thing. Those are the good old days that they’re trying to harken back to. It also ties into the sort of <a href="https://www.404media.co/80s-nostalgia-ai-slop-is-boomerfying-the-masses-for-a-past-that-never-existed/?ref=aftermath.site">[80s and] 90s AI slop</a> that you’ll see on nostalgia channels now, where it’s trying to imagine a past of being a white, teenage suburbanite. A world where <em>Halo </em>was non-toxic, uncomplicated fun never existed.<em> Halo</em>’s notoriousness for being a toxic game was evident from the moment that online lobbies started existing [for<em> Halo 2</em>].</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Xbox Live was the original place that got called out for being full of kids saying slurs.</p><p>It’s notable too that the other series these government agencies are now drawing on is <em>Lord Of The Rings</em>. Same time period – at least, if we’re talking about the movies. They’re trying to harken back to specific people’s childhood. But that’s always what these far-right, often-fascist movements do. Remember the good old days, whatever those might be. For a while the aesthetic touchstone was the 1950s or some imagined version of it. Now it’s an imagined version of the 2000s. You’ve gotta advance it forward to keep things relevant to your prospective audience.</p><p>But yeah, they’re just running the same playbook as always, only this time on the media of our youth as opposed to that of older people.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> It’s so funny that <em>Lord Of The Rings</em> is in this milieu, because most of my memory of <em>Lord Of The Rings </em>is reading gay fan fiction about it from that same time period. I was reading about the hobbits fucking each other.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>They do kinda [seem to be].</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>It seems like they have, or at least that they have a very intense friendship – one of those ones where they stopped talking after a certain point in time, and then one of them comes out as gay decades later.</p><p>But it shows the limits of their imagination. They can’t imagine that there’s a massive group of people that also like <em>Halo </em>and<em> Lord Of The Rings</em> and nerd stuff [but are queer and progressive].</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>This is the other thing I think it’s very important to note about fascism as a movement and ideology: It cannot create. It can only co-opt. That’s what it does: It finds something to latch onto and says that it either always [belonged to the far-right] or that an imagined version of it that never existed is the thing to which everyone should aspire. Again, they’re grabbing onto something that previously existed and people had strong feelings about at the time, and they’re trying to graft their own ideology onto it, regardless of what that thing was actually about or what other people read into it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I started playing <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> again, which means I have been in Mandalia Plains grinding for several hours now. Mandalia Plains is the earliest stage in the game, and one I know intimately, because you can unlock every job there if you hunker down. This is perhaps not the most enjoyable way to play, but it’s the only way I know how. I will turn <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> into a grueling grind fest every single time I play it and you can’t make me play the game any other way.</p><p>The reasons for this are twofold. The first reason is that <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> was historically unforgiving, even early on. This is a PS1 game, and one where you can soft lock yourself if you were not careful. This happened to me when I rented the first game at around age 13, and I’ve never forgotten or forgiven the game for it. My last playthrough was on a MiSTer (on a CRT next to my computer), but every time I’ve done this I’ve been very careful to make sure I had backup saves and save states. Many of your generic characters can permanently die, and so training them so they can tank a thermonuclear explosion is seductive.</p><figure><figcaption>Once you hit a certain level, humans will appear on Mandalia Plains and you can steal stuff from them. | Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure><p>The second reason is because it’s funny and the game doesn’t stop you. <em>Tactics</em> is a job-based RPG, but unlike many RPGs where grinding the starter zone yields diminishing returns, you really don’t have to go further than the Plains. Unlocking new jobs unlocks new skills, and the job Arithmetician (which I still call by its original name of “Calculator”) lets you nuke half the map. Successfully executing a skill gives you job points provided they land, so even a simple Squire skill like Focus is enough to level up your jobs. The Squire job can give you the JP Boost skill fairly early, which rapidly accelerates your job growth. This means you can drop your characters into Mandalia Plains, kill everything that moves except one wounded goblin or Chocobo, and then safely have your characters repeatedly power up like Goku for the duration it would take you to watch the entire Namek Saga of <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>. You can turn the remaining enemy into a frog and have a knight destroy their speed stat so it won’t distract your training. It is even a valid strategy early on to have your characters throw rocks at each other and have one character with the monk class use Chakra to heal and revive anyone. This is quite literally aura farming.</p><figure><figcaption>If they did not want me to do this in the first chapter, why would they give me a skill that makes it super easy? | Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve done this miserable slog every single time to the point where I find the entire process genuinely soothing. You can get very anal with this entire leveling system, maxing out your character by leveling them down and then re-leveling them again using a hyper specific trick in Zeklaus Desert, but to be blunt I have never cared that much, particularly when many of my characters can wipe half the board in one go.</p><figure><iframe width="160" height="90" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbNnIuuMaJQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> also has an entire Zodiac compatibility system for individual characters, which impacts their compatibility with each other and their efficacy against bosses, so ideally you want to do the charts of your characters before you even start. There is a structural humor in getting a bunch of teenage nerds in 1997 really into doing their character’s star charts. Ramza is canonically a Capricorn by the way, and you can’t fuck up if you go that route. There is also an entire system involving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmPwvSdOmEE&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Bravery and Faith</a> stats, the former of which <a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Shout_(Tactics)?ref=aftermath.site">Ramza can raise artificially by shouting</a> or other characters can raise by giving each other <a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Orator_(Tactics)?ref=aftermath.site">compliments or proselytizing</a> to each other, but there are complexities to what these stats do that are too complicated to get into here.</p><figure><iframe width="160" height="90" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UmPwvSdOmEE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Though <em>FFT</em> has a lot of obtuse PS1 era cruft on it, its newest remaster, <em>The Ivalice Chronicles, </em>gives the game a much-needed rehaul. Square Enix did a beautiful job here. They have given the player the option to play the game as it was originally presented, or in a new form with a script that strikes a balance between the blunt but charming <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197339-final-fantasy-tactics/faqs/14169?ref=aftermath.site">original PS1 translation</a> and the slightly purple PSP <a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics:_The_War_of_the_Lions_script?ref=aftermath.site"><em>War of The Lions </em>script</a>. The ability to look at the map grid from above somehow was not in the base game despite being a no brainer, and its inclusion almost feels like cheating if you’ve beaten this game before.</p><figure><figcaption>The script is the same as The War of the Lions script in many places, but has been edited and tweaked to account for voice acting and general flow. | Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure><p>These are hard compromises to make on a deeply beloved game, and they somehow pulled it off. The added voice acting brings a liveliness and dimension to a deeply political story that could at times be difficult to parse from moment to moment. I’m often a purist when it comes to remasters, but The <em>Ivalice Chronicles</em> does so many things right that it’s the version I would recommend to new players, praise I’d previously only given to Square Enix’s loving treatment of <em>Live-A-Live</em>.</p><figure><iframe width="160" height="90" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W3HDTnq1IZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>But even with the added quality of life and balance changes, I only know one way to play this game. This method completely fucks up the pace of the storytelling because it adds like five hours of lag time between the intro and the stage Dortor Slums. It also makes random encounters more wonky because foes scale to Ramza’s level (which is distinct from job levels) as a point of balance, but that’s moot when you can teleport behind anybody on the map and punch a hole the size of a trash can lid through their torso.</p><p>You emerge from the Plains and every member of your party has a degree in advanced math and can dual weird katanas. You’re ready to beat the piss out of any morally ambiguous enemy in your path. When you finally get back to the story missions and pound your foes into a smoking crater, you may ask yourself “Wait, what was happening in the story again?”</p><p>If this sounds entirely unpleasant, I assure you it is not. The reason I committed to doing this again despite beating this game in recent memory is because I have a Steam Deck now. Tactical RPGs have always agreed with me the most on handhelds. I lost an entire summer to <em>Golden Sun </em>and <em>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</em>, because it’s nice to have something to keep your hands busy while you watch TV or particularly corny movies. The Steam Deck and the Switch 2 are perfect for this purpose, and it is wise that they put the remaster on both platforms.</p><p>I’m in a happy place right now: in Mandalia Plains. I'm passively rewatching the entire filmography of John Carpenter with director’s commentary.  All my little characters are thinking super hard and screaming next to a confused frog that used to be a goblin until they can solve the math problems from <em>Good Will Hunting</em>. All of us, together, are thriving.</p>
