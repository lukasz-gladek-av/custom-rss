            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/california-wildfires-ces-generative-ai-nvidia-google<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is the dead of winter, and yet, somehow, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/08/us/california-wildfire-la-palisades" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wildfires</a> are currently ravaging southern California. Each year, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/08/california-fire-rare-climate-change-factors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unprecedented weather events</a> become significantly more precedented, and the culprit couldn’t be clearer: climate change. That, however, has not stopped tech companies from going gaga for the latest <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/12/g-s1-9545/ai-brings-soaring-emissions-for-google-and-microsoft-a-major-contributor-to-climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">environmentally</a>-<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/12/g-s1-9545/ai-brings-soaring-emissions-for-google-and-microsoft-a-major-contributor-to-climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">destructive</a> fad. Just one state over from California, they’ve spent the week putting on the <a href="https://x.com/DanaWollman/status/1876453533228454205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dumbest possible parade</a> in generative AI’s honor.&nbsp;</p><p>The Consumer Electronics Show is taking place in Las Vegas right now, and predictably, AI is (once again) this year’s big buzzword. A quick roundup of some of the brilliant inventions that have crowded the spotlight:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEKUSMqrbzQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The <em>PUBG </em>Ally</a>, a “co-playable character” that draws on Nvidia AI NPC tech to “communicate using game-specific lingo, provide real-time strategic recommendations, find and share loot, drive vehicles, and fight other human players using the game’s extensive arsenal of weapons.” So basically, it’s a soulless, subservient husk you can play the battle royale with if you don’t have any friends. And given <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-npcs-nvidia-unity-ubisoft-convai-inworld" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what we’ve seen from other AI NPCs</a>, I’m sure it will work exactly as intended and definitely not lose the plot the second you push it too far.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Inworld AI, Logitech, and Nvidia’s “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335356/virtual-ai-intelligent-streaming-assistant-inworld-streamlabs-nvidia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intelligent Streaming Assistant</a>,” an AI cohost for livestreamers that the companies say can understand what’s happening in games and “highlight a well-timed build, provide commentary during a dramatic Victory Royale, or shoutout audience members for sending tips.” In short, it can awkwardly insert itself into the vital alchemy that streamers and chat produce together, adding a third voice where streamers have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53RoOAZXPqs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already demonstrated</a> that they don’t really want one. Sounds bad in theory, looks rough <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=909h0VZeOMM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in practice</a> – and that’s when the companies in question <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338645/that-ai-powered-livestreaming-assistant-i-wrote-about-yesterday-id-be-skeptical-of-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have complete control over it</a>. The assistant can also perform behind-the-scenes functions like troubleshooting and setting up Streamlabs. Sure, OK, whatever.</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnozAHKTz9o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nvidia RTX Neural Faces</a>, which aim to “cross the uncanny valley” by using generative AI to make video game characters’ faces look a) way worse and b) not at all how artists intended them to.</span></li><li><span>New Nvidia graphics cards that could <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/afterclimate.com.au/post/3lf4rfhtxvc2z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">up your power bill</a> by hundreds of dollars per year.</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/project-digits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nvidia’s “Digits” AI computer</a>, presumably named for the portion of human anatomy AI still struggles to correctly generate.</span></li><li><span>Google’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338053/google-deepmind-world-modeling-ai-team-gaming-robot-training" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“world modeling” team</a>, which will continue the company’s quest to build <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/06/google-is-forming-a-new-team-to-build-ai-that-can-simulate-the-physical-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad-looking</a> video games <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/google-latest-ai-innovation-offers-a-putrid-vision-of-game-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incorrectly</a>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337478/samsung-ballie-robot-release-date-features-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ball robot</a>.</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/brisk-its-latest-ai-infused-smart-grill-only-costs-399-140035250.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grill</a>.</span></li></ul><p>I’ve obviously handpicked a bunch of egregious, tenuously-gaming-related examples here, but they’re still illustrative of a larger point: Tech’s biggest movers, shakers, and grill makers are all in on generative AI, heedless of how much sense it makes. Why? Because investor money and record-high valuations – and certainly <em>not </em>to enrich your experience of anything. Nobody, outside of the same few sickos who embrace <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/climate/nfts-have-a-climate-problem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every emissions-surging tech trend</a>, is asking for this. These are not use cases; they’re excuses.</p><p>On their own, each of these solutions looking for a problem does not represent anywhere near the totality of the issue. They are merely symptomatic. But during a week-old year in which the six biggest banks in the US have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rbreich.bsky.social/post/3lfb5xwlnzd2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quit the Net Zero Banking Alliance</a>, Israel has employed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/29/ai-israel-war-gaza-idf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a fallible “AI factory”</a> to select targets in Gaza, embarrassing AI guy Elon Musk has <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-doge-starmer-afd-trump-rcna185979" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made his mark on global politics</a>, somehow-more embarrassing AI guy Mark Zuckerberg has followed Musk’s footsteps in <a href="https://aftermath.site/zuckerberg-meta-policy-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kissing Trump’s ring</a>, and even their sad sycophants have found themselves <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/badideas.bsky.social/post/3lf7nala74s2y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helpless in the face of California wildfires</a>, it’s become impossible to ignore the interconnectedness of it all.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s so putridly on the nose. California and Nevada are next door neighbors. People in one state are microdosing the end of the world while people in the other ring it in. What are we even doing here? And what will it take to get us – by which I very much mean them – to stop?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/locator-demo-geoguessr"><h3>Yay But Also Oh No, A Map Game</h3></a><p>Locator calls itself a "Geoguessr-inspired" puzzle game</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/balatro-golden-needle-challenge-how-to-beat"><h3>Balatro’s Golden Needle Became A Prison</h3></a><p>Balatro's Golden Needle challenge, which requires both luck and skill, trapped me in a gameplay torment of my own creation.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
