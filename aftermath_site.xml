They represent s​even identity groups​: Asian, Black, 2SLGBTQIA+, Latinx/Hispanic, family of all kinds, women and gender minorities​, and interfaith.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Now, in February, that text has been removed, and replaced with:</p><blockquote><p>All employees are welcome to create or join Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which are voluntary employee-led groups mentored by executive sponsors.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Other sections, like employee training pages mentioning "Diversity and Inclusion”, have also been edited to delete certain wording, while whole pages, like those discussing executive salary bonuses tied to diversity accomplishments, "have been removed from the website entirely", according to <em>404</em>.</p><p>While these appear to have had little effect on the company's internal operations--staff speaking to <em>404 </em>say nothing has changed in terms of the ERGs or internal messaging about diversity--it's still a chilling sight to see a media company, one that employs an international workforce of diverse people, making such a clearly submissive gesture to an increasingly authoritarian government that, with a hatred of the media as one of its core tenets, will not give half a shit about gestures.</p><p><a href="https://www.404media.co/ziff-davis-dei-commitment-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can see detailed examples of the changes at <em>404</em></a>, where you should also subscribe so you can read more of their <em>excellent </em>work.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-sad-trombone"><h3>How’s That AI Future Looking?</h3></a><p>The Humane AI pin died on the way back to its home planet</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
