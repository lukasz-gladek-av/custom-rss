            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Front Mission 3</em>, an absolutely <em>classic </em>tactical RPG, is getting a remake. And it looks like complete dogshit.</p><p>Cullen Black over on <em>RPGSite</em> has a copy of the remake--the original was released on the PS1 in 1999--<a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/17799-you-need-to-see-front-mission-3-remakes-redone-network-graphics-photograph" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and has shared a bunch of images</a> showing the various ways Megapixel Studios SA, the remake's developers, have "decided to feed all of the game's original 2D art assets into some form of upscale algorithm to clean them up, sometimes dramatically altering the content of the original image".</p><p>He's not kidding! While some of the more harmless examples include regular remake/remaster suspects like upscaled character portraits looking weird, there are far more egregious alterations here, like this image of a wrecked wanzer (a mech in the <em>Front Mission</em> universe), which in the original on the left clearly had legs and guns, but in the remake on the right is now...a crashed Eschercopter:</p><figure><figcaption>Front Mission 3 / RPGSite</figcaption></figure><p>Or this briefing screen, which in the original (left) was clearly illustrating a wireframe schematic, but in the remake (right) is now a maze you see printed on the back of a family restaurant's menu:</p><figure><figcaption>Front Mission 3 / RPGSite</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering about the rest of the game, a trailer was posted earlier today showing extensive gameplay footage, and nearly every comment is complaining about how certain animations or sound effects have been cut (or replaced with worse versions).</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FRONT MISSION 3: Remake || 15-minutes Gameplay" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBb9-DJ8I-c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This sucks!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em> is, by most measures, an authentically promising-looking game. You get to build your own Jurassic Park, a dream we’ve all had at some point or another while succumbing to our own hubris. This time around, the series is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958130/Jurassic_World_Evolution_3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simulating 75 dinosaur species</a> across generations, with traits both beneficial and pernicious getting passed on to dino-youths. There are “distinct female, male, and juvenile variants” with “unique social needs” and “brand new behaviors.” All that painstaking effort, and yet developer Frontier was planning to take the easy way out with non-prehistoric park partners – until recently.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this month, prospective players noticed an AI disclosure on <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em>’s Steam page. "Scientists' avatars are created using generative AI," it read. This led to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2958130/discussions/0/599654768975026771/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of negative comments</a> across multiple Steam threads, the kind of storm some developers would opt to try to wait out. As of this week, however, Frontier is singing a different tune: “Thanks for your feedback on this topic,” reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2958130/discussions/0/599654768975026771/?ctp=16#c599656262950498876" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post on the game’s Steam forum</a>. “We have opted to remove the use of generative AI for scientist portraits within <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em>.”</p><p>Confusingly, some have suggested that <em>Jurassic World Evolution 2</em> also used AI for scientist portraits, though the game’s Steam page includes no such disclosure. Then again, the game came out in 2021, before Valve began requiring developers to take this specific tack where AI is concerned. Aftermath reached out to Frontier for more information but did not receive a response as of this publishing.&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, this is a more or less optimal outcome compared to, for example, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ark-aquatica-ai-trailer-snail-games-studio-wildcard-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple companies on another dinosaur-themed game playing hot potato with accountability</a> for hacky use of AI that serves no one, least of all the people pouring their blood, sweat, and tears into the rest of the video game.</p><p>"Good,” one Steam user replied to the devs’ post about removing generative AI from the game, “I'm sure you can afford an artist to create them for you. It's not like <em>Jurassic Park</em> is a small IP."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-sexual-exploitation-of-children-lawsuit-safety"><h3>Roblox Accused Of Allowing Sexual Exploitation In Four Separate Lawsuits</h3></a><p>All four — and more reportedly incoming, lawyers say — are filed by the same law firm</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/jurassic-world-evolution-3-ai-removed]]></content:encoded>
