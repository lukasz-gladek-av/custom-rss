            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-suikoden-book-boss-fight<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Few series continue to influence entire industries three decades down the line – fewer still if we’re talking about relatively obscure Japanese role-playing games. <em>Suikoden</em>, however, fits that bill. The recently-remastered JRPGs in which you’re able to recruit 108 characters to your cause are about far more than collecting ‘em all. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, Aidan Moher, freelance writer and author of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aidanis.fun/post/3ljpuq32vqc2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming book <em>Suikoden 1 &amp; 2</em></a>, takes us to class.</p><p>We begin by discussing the many reasons why Moher felt these games in particular were worthy of an entire book, including their pre-9/11 historical context and the specific team-based nature of their development. Then we discuss news from the eye of the pre-GDC storm: Next week, thousands of game developers will convene in San Francisco to network and exchange knowledge, but <a href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-2025-travel-visa-san-francisco-donald-trump-mahmoud-khalil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a growing number of non-US-based devs are dropping out</a> due to Trump’s hostile policies and erratic governance.&nbsp;</p><p>After that we talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/playstation-ai-aloy-horizon-talk-character" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony</a> and <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/13/new-copilot-for-gaming-save-time-help-get-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a> both introducing new unwanted AI features in the same week. Whose is worse? We’ll let you decide. Lastly, we design the one product that should include generative AI: a fucked-up private jet for rich people that definitely works just fine.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can eventually hire exactly 108 writers, reporters, and heck, maybe even some kind of battle chef to work at Aftermath.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Aidan:</strong> [The book talks about] how these things were important in the mid-90s as we were entering into a period of geo-political turmoil. We were only a few years away from 9/11 and everything that entailed. And so looking at the series contextually, we were able to have that conversation with the context of being adults who understand all of that better than we did when we first played it.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>As somebody who hasn’t really played these games, I know them as the series where you can collect 108 potential party members. How does that tie into what you’ve been talking about so far: these themes of war and how it impacts people?</p><p><strong>Aidan:</strong> I think there’s two interesting angles on that: The first is that <em>Suikoden </em>bucked the trend of so many RPGs that look at exceptional people doing exceptional things. You’ll go in, and it’ll be princesses or brilliant scientists or knights who get turned into frogs; I’m describing <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. I think <em>Suikoden </em>is so remarkable because it does something the original <em>Star Wars</em> movies did really well, which is showing normal people doing exceptional things.</p><p>With a huge cast of 108 recruitable characters, not all of them have a big impact on the story. Not all of them are usable in combat. But they all fill a role in this community that you build. And so you have people who are rising up. They’re sort of powerless. There’s one woman you recruit sorta late into the game, and she’s in a poor town. She just washes clothes. She’s a washer woman. But she joins your party because she recognizes she can bring something to the community that does not exist. So she’s there with former generals of the enemy, powerful magic users – everybody across that gamut.&nbsp;</p><p>That is what war is, that is what conflict is in societies: Everybody has a role to play, everybody can bring something to that. You couldn’t do that with just a cast of nine people. You’d have to give them each a defined role in the game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think what the Final Fantasies of the world do is, they get you really invested in your main character. You have this sunk cost fallacy of “Well, if my main character’s in there, he’s the important one. He’s where I put all my gear, all my stuff, all my things.” It gets in the way of storytelling, I find. In <em>Live A Live</em>, you get a completely different perspective because they don’t give you enough time to have that sense of possession over your character. <em>Saga Frontier</em> is like a bunch of little eight-hour RPGs that all intersect with each other. Oh, <em>Chrono Cross</em>! That has 49 characters in it. It’s not the same [as <em>Suikoden</em>], but you get a lot of perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there’s something powerful about this thing that really limits a lot of RPG storytelling, which is “You’re the special boy.” It makes the investment in a character hurt more, like with Aerith [from <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>], but it also means you can’t have characters really die or live. <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, in the second act, whether or not you get those characters [after the world ends] is one of the reasons why it’s one of my favorites. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> – all these things. There’s a malleability to RPGs that you don’t usually see. <em>Suikoden </em>is weird, and I like a weird game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aidan: </strong>It is a weird game, and it allows you to have that sort of agency within that experience, because it’s weird. It allows you to explore war in the way that you want to or what makes sense to you. That’s how you construct your party. A lot of people nowadays get caught up in the idea that there’s 108 characters, and you’ve gotta get all of them, and the only correct way to play the game is to collect every character.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The Pokemon mentality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aidan:</strong> Exactly. And you get a special ending if you collect all 108 characters; there’s incentive for it. But [creator] Yoshitaka Murayama’s intent was always for people to go through the game and miss characters. So Nathan, you, Chris, and me would all end up with a different assortment of community – a different community we built up around ourselves. That was always the intent. Conflict and community is what you build up around yourself.</p><p>Secondarily to that, and kind of getting back to what Chris was talking about with scope, Jason [Schreier] likes to liken <em>Suikoden </em>to <em>Game of Thrones</em>, the <em>Game of Thrones</em> of JRPGs. But <em>Suikoden</em> actually predates the first <em>Game of Thrones</em> book, which I think is really remarkable. And I think it speaks to a lot of what was going on not just in video games, but epic fantasy at the time – that we were seeing this big explosion of scope where bringing in many, many viewpoints and looking at conflict through many eyes became important to fantasy. </p><p>In the ‘80s we saw a lot of sword and sorcery-style adventure fantasy. Raymond Feist, Terry Brooks. And then in the ‘90s we started to get the <em>Wheel of Times</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> that tried to do the same thing <em>Suikoden </em>was doing, which was [to] show that this is complex. There are many, many different sides and motivations. Sometimes they’re at odds. Sometimes they cross over. Sometimes they cross over for a little bit, and then they get pulled apart. I think that holds up really well in these games – even now, even though they’re 30 years old.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotick-kotaku-gizmodo"><h3>Report: Bobby Kotick Files Defamation Suit Against Gizmodo And Kotaku</h3></a><p>The suit is over details in a pair of articles about Kotick's rumored interest in buying TikTok</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/duolingo-gamification"><h3>Why Did No One Tell Me Duolingo Is Like This</h3></a><p>I thought it was just, you know, a learning app</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/gdc-2025-travel-visa-san-francisco-donald-trump-mahmoud-khalil<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As far as statements of intent go, it’s hard to make a more definitive one than what the Trump administration has done to Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/columbia-university-protester-mahmoud-khalil-immigration-arrest-5ae6eeb3ac95f190a505abebc4ee0944" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snatching a legal US resident</a> away from his family, stripping him of his rights, and detaining him with intent to deport, all for the non-crime of exercising his First Amendment rights by helping lead protests against Israel’s genocide of Palestinians. This follows previous weeks in which the Trump administration passed down <a href="https://aftermath.site/kennedy-center-nea-trans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous anti-trans edicts</a>, made moves to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-quest-conquer-canada-confusing-everyone-rcna195657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annex Canada</a>, imposed tariffs that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/14/investing/stocks-trump-wall-street-tariffs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threaten to crash the US economy</a>, and began an ongoing project to <a href="https://aftermath.site/elon-musk-treasury-protest-diablo-path-of-exile-cheating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dismantle the federal government</a>. You can understand, then, why some game developers would be hesitant to enter the United States, even if it means missing out on career-defining opportunities.</p><p>The annual Game Developers Conference takes place next week in San Francisco, and while the event has received <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/27/23679081/gdc-2023-price-affordability-game-developers-conference" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ample criticism for prohibitively high prices</a> and other accessibility issues over the years, it remains an important event for developers from all over the world to gather, network, and share knowledge. But as of the past few weeks, some developers are canceling their plans to attend.</p><p>"I had flight tickets, hotel, and pass all lined up and decided to cancel last week due to the possibility of being turned around at the border for being trans – which according to a recent <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5189226-texas-bill-transgender-rights-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memo</a> can be considered fraud," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/loa-gunnars.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lóa Gunnars</a>, an independent game designer and educator based out of Reykjavík, Iceland told Aftermath. "I’ve been planning [to attend GDC] for about four months, and [it] would have been my 10th year there. ... GDC is incredibly valuable to me. I studied game design [at] NYU, and GDC is my main way of staying connected to the North American game industry, a place where I meet old friends and make new connections."</p><figure><blockquote><p>In the Republican US, they could grab me and make me go away, and nobody would be able to do shit even if they tried.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In other cases, more specific headlines generated by the Trump administration’s smash-and-grab tactics have developers un-packing their bags. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ramiismail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rami Ismail</a>, an indie developer, speaker, and consultant formerly of Vlambeer, told Aftermath that immigration agents' abduction of pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil solidified his decision to keep his distance from a conference he's been critical of in the past.</p><p>"I can barely get into the US under the Democrats," Ismail said. "The Republicans are straight up disappearing people, mate. I'm Egyptian. I know what disappearing is: Little van shows up, gone you are. In the Republican US, they could grab me and make me go away, and nobody would be able to do shit even if they tried. I think if anyone with Western privilege would be worried about going to Egypt, they should now be equally worried about going to the US. These things are random, unfair, and without recourse."</p><p>Others, like <em>Subnautica Below Zero</em>, <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, and <em>Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry</em> writer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jillmurray.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jill Murray</a>, who is based in Montreal, are maintaining a healthy distance from the increasingly bad ol’ US of A out of senses of both solidarity and self-preservation.</p><p>"[The breaking point] was seeing how afraid trans and BIPOC friends were of crossing the border. I take it seriously and don’t really want to go where they can’t go," Murray told Aftermath. "My biggest personal factor is that I’ve been self employed for a very long time, and that can make me face more questioning. With a trade war on, it doesn’t feel like the risk is warranted – even if I’m facing mounting pressures to network, given the overall situation of the industry."&nbsp;</p><p>Vivid Foundry founder Tanya Kan and game trailer maker Gary J Kings, two developers who are residents of Canada, kicked off a discussion of the difficult choice many international developers face in regard to GDC <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/garyjkings.bsky.social/post/3lk6w64e4os2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Bluesky</a>. Both cancelled their plans this week after hearing the story of Becky Burke, a British tourist who’s been <a href="https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article301877574.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detained in an ICE facility for two weeks</a> due to visa issues, unable to voluntarily return home. Burke’s father has called the situation <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2025/03/11/british-tourist-detained-us-canada/82267160007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“a nightmare.”</a></p><p>"[Burke's] case highlights the system's cruelty by detaining her in inhumane conditions,” Kan told Aftermath. “From there we looked at other factors and came to the conclusion that the political climate was devolving too rapidly for us to not feel anxious whilst needing to be in our top form at GDC."</p><figure><blockquote><p>It doesn’t feel like the risk is warranted – even if I’m facing mounting pressures to network, given the overall situation of the industry.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Trump’s escalating trade war with Canada – the goal of which sure seems to be annexation of a sovereign nation – has many Canadians bunkering down on their side of the border.</p><p>"The straw that broke the camel's back was the President's constant and repeated economic and military threats to Canada, including tariffs and especially annexation," BancyCo co-founder <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjaminrivers.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Benjamin Rivers</a> told Aftermath. "Since a vast swath of Canadian businesses have decided to remove American products and pivot to non-American services, and citizens are increasingly opting out of travelling to the US, we thought it was only prudent to do the same. So instead of attending events like GDC or PAX, we've opted to spend our marketing budget on events in Canada, Europe, and Asia."</p><p>Rivers by no means relishes having to steer clear of a country where many friends reside, but in times of political upheaval, safe is far preferable to sorry.</p><p>"We know that American friends and colleagues don't support what the government is doing, and we'll dearly miss meeting them at events like GDC,” he said. “But it seems insane to travel to a country that has all but declared you its enemy, and in which random innocent travelers are already being detained, so we've opted to not cross that border for the foreseeable future."</p><p>Conditions, unfortunately, do not look to be improving, even in supposed liberal strongholds like California, which finds itself under the shaky stewardship of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/14/gavin-newsom-steve-bannon-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right-wing-guest-hosting</a> podcaster-in-chief Gavin Newsom. What, if anything, can GDC and other, similar events do? Most developers believe the obvious answer is the best, fraught with logistical concerns though it might be: move.</p><p>"It might help a bit if the GDC talks were live [streamed] so at least it’s possible to follow along online conversations. But even when they did for covid it just [wasn't] the same; active participation during talks and the mingling between events are the important bits," said Gunnars. "A more central Europe conference [might be GDC's best bet]? I’m not sure why GDC Europe never held the same appeal."</p><figure><blockquote><p>I don’t think the industry in the US has had to grapple with the possibility of becoming less central before, but I think it’s a real possibility now.</p></blockquote></figure><p>“It would be nice to see the industry decide to convene elsewhere on a rotating basis,” said Murray. “I hope there’s an opportunity here for other conferences to grow, and for international organizers to reach out to each other and combine resources and ideas to capture some of that magnetic mass attraction GDC has always had. I don’t think the industry in the US has had to grapple with the possibility of becoming less central before, but I think it’s a real possibility now.”&nbsp;</p><p>Despite how quickly things are accelerating, the fact is that the current climate in the US didn’t come out of nowhere. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chhopsky.tv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christina Pollock</a>, a developer who's worked on series like <em>Call of Duty</em> and has, at various points, resided in Brisbane, San Francisco, and Vancouver, told Aftermath that she’s faced visa issues when it comes to entering the US since 2020. She’s not alone.&nbsp;</p><p>"Every year we hear the same story from developers from all around the world that two things hold them back from GDC: the cost of visiting SF and difficulty with US visas,” Pollock said. “Plenty of other North American industry conventions successfully rotate through cities and venues. SIGGRAPH, NANOG et al have had successful events in Canada. … If GDC is willing to break away from its home venue and look towards Toronto or Vancouver, I think they'll find that organizing events internationally isn't nearly as difficult as people might think. The game industry is already a global community; our premiere conference should reflect that."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotick-kotaku-gizmodo"><h3>Report: Bobby Kotick Files Defamation Suit Against Gizmodo And Kotaku</h3></a><p>The suit is over details in a pair of articles about Kotick's rumored interest in buying TikTok</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-suikoden-book-boss-fight"><h3>The Suikoden Series Is As Relevant As Ever</h3></a><p>"It does something the original Star Wars movies did really well, which is showing normal people doing exceptional things"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/duolingo-gamification"><h3>Why Did No One Tell Me Duolingo Is Like This</h3></a><p>I thought it was just, you know, a learning app</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
