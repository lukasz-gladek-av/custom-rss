            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I try not to be gross on this site, but if you are a man of about 30 or 40 years old you know that your body just gets weird as you age. If you have met a very old man you will see that the hair in their ear and nose area is often out of control. Generally speaking, products for grooming the nose and ear are badly made, annoyingly loud, and battery powered. The Golden Birdie by South Korean brand Royal is none of those things, which is why it is life changing to me.</p><p>Most nose and ear hair trimmers I have used have been battery powered and built like garbage. These things are usually anemic little wands that are way louder than they have any right to be and just take forever at the task of trimming your hairs. The noise is particularly an issue when it comes to your ears, because any motor noise placed directly there becomes borderline dangerous to your hearing. Your other option is plucking, and I can think of few parts of your body that are worse to pluck than your nose hair.</p><figure><figcaption>It comes with a tiny case for travel and a brush for cleaning. </figcaption></figure><p>For a long time I had assumed the solution was more technology, like a quieter motor, but it turns out the opposite was true. The Royal Golden Birdie is a spartan and analog grooming device. It can be used one handed and is meant to be placed between your thumb and index finger. The tip is two interlocking crown shaped prongs that close in on each other when pressure is exerted on both sides. The only noise it makes is a charming metallic rustling sound, like a lower registered version of a barber using shears. It comes apart easily for cleaning; you simply loosen a screw on it and pull the interior layer out to be cleaned with the included brush, which also fits in the case.</p><figure><figcaption>Royal also has a higher end model, but it requires two hands to use.</figcaption></figure><p>Royal makes several models, including a premium one where the brush is stored inside the device, but that one requires using two hands to operate the device itself. I went with the Golden Birdie, which is like five dollars more than the twelve dollar base unit, but I can’t tell what the difference is aside from the golden one claiming to be hypoallergenic. None of these devices cost more than 22 dollars, which is how much money falls out of me like Sonic The Hedgehog every time I leave my house these days.</p><figure><figcaption>Comes apart easily, simple to clean.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike my nasty little Panasonic trimmer, the Golden Birdie just works. With 12 blades, nose and ear hairs just vanish after a handful of delightful little clicks. The Birdie is a joy to use in terms of both its exceeding simplicity and its tactile fidget toy feedback. It gives an otherwise unpleasant grooming task a mild ASMR atmosphere. The Birdie currently has about 11k largely positive reviews on Amazon, so I guess I’m not the only one who really likes this thing.</p><p>I have not put the Golden Birdie through the ringer for more than a few times, and I will concede that it might get shitty over time, but it’s an exceedingly simple device made entirely out of metal with few points of failure (like, say, a motor or battery), and even if it does fail me in the future it costs between a good sandwich and a very good sandwich to replace. That’s the joy when you find a simple solution to an age old problem – there’s just way fewer parts to screw up.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-telltale-games-adhoc-studio"><h3>Dispatch Brings Back The Halcyon  Era Of Online Water Cooler Talk</h3></a><p>Adhoc Studio’s superhero choose-your-own-adventure feels like a fun hole-in-the-wall, word-of-mouth-recommended spot that the gaming communities haven’t had in a minute</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor-election"><h3>Mamdani Won, And Also Cuomo Lost</h3></a><p>Mamdani can't solve all our problems, but at least he solved the problem of having to talk about Andrew Cuomo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7"><h3>I Owe My Workday To Criterion 24/7</h3></a><p>If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump"><h3>EA Says It Will Retain Creative Control Following Saudi Sale, But, Like, Come On</h3></a><p>Big companies have shown time and time again that they'll say whatever is necessary to get mergers approved</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/manual-ear-and-nosehair-trimmer]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s easy to grow jaded as a gamer, and even easier to forget why you got interested in games to begin with. As trends in video games change, you may find yourself longing for an imagined yesteryear, where that spark was still fresh. As a member of the diehard cult that hopes that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/telltale-delays-the-wolf-among-us-2-till-at-least-next-year-because-if-its-half-baked-were-going-to-get-torn-to-shreds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Wolf Among Us 2</em> will ever see the light of day</a>, <em>Dispatch </em>feels like a return to the experimental golden age of episodic choice-driven storytelling, where fun isn’t in photorealism but in the online water cooler buzz of what you chose and why.</p><p>After bingeing the first four playable episodes of <a href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dispatch</em></a>, I found myself swept back (<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dispatch-narrative-superhero-game-episodic-telltale-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alongside other like-minded, nostalgic players</a>) into the magic of<em> Life is Strange</em> and <em>The Walking Dead—</em>the very games that ignited my love for storytelling in my teens when an innocuous <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/life_is_strange/b/playstation4/archive/2015/01/29/life-is-strange-episode-one-chrysalis-review-game-informer.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameInformer magazine blurb</a> first sold me on the dream of games playing like episodic TV. It follows Robert Robertson (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/aaron-paul-dispatch-video-game-interview-2000672017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played by Aaron Paul</a>), a semi-retired superhero turned mission coordinator, assigning heroes to crises based on their skills and (difficult) personalities, both with the promise of leveling up over time. Your squad of “heroes” is the Z-team in every sense. It’s a <a href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chaotic mix of washed-up villains no one expects to redeem</a>, each carrying enough emotional baggage to test the most seasoned therapist (caped or otherwise) a headache.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dispatch | Episodes 5 &amp; 6 Preview" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zidpOy-Zta4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While <em>Dispatch</em>’s branching choices aren’t quite as splintered as the most procrastinated windshield spider cracks, it has already revived the lost art of player-driven internet chatter—debating everyone’s choices, overlooked details, and speculating on how the story might unfold in the remaining four episodes.&nbsp;</p><p>Being on the ground floor of something gaming-related that’s tied to players’ choices, discussing them, and trying to figure out how they’ll play out as the entire story unfolds in semi-weekly releases allows for community-driven conversations without the frustration of an episodic narrative that’s incomplete. This way, we see the whole work as evolving, rather than judging it based on unfinished pieces, which often leads to tired debates about graphics instead of emotional storytelling and character banter that really tug at your heartstrings or make you laugh.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">She’s insecure without her powers without her necklace but Robert? Who’s almost a parallel to her? He likes both the hero she is and the human being that she is. So she’s going to click with that aspect. <a href="https://t.co/LrlYbCdLSj">pic.twitter.com/LrlYbCdLSj</a></p>— PridefulSin ❕ (@ReignOfPride) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReignOfPride/status/1984009936561676356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><div><p>I’ve only had <em>Dispatch</em> for a weekend, and it’s already the kind of refreshing gaming community experience I’ve missed forages.&nbsp; It feels so fucking good to feel like I’m a part of a community again, the kind I remembered from playing <em>Wolf Among Us</em> and <em>Life Is Strange.</em> I’m ecstatic that <em>Dispatch </em>isn’t just filling the void for <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> fans but also reminding me why I love talking about games with other passionate fans in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>In an era where most online gaming conversations revolve around layoffs, imitation crab-ass gamergate faux outrage, or canceled games, it’s nice to see <em>Dispatch</em> become a bright spot online that highlights the good parts of gaming fandom. In <em>Dispatch</em>’s fandom, players feel less like rivals in a competitive arena and more like a community—eager to swap decisions, analyze tiny details, trade puzzle tips, and even talk about romance without feeling juvenile or ironic.</p></div></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/manual-ear-and-nosehair-trimmer"><h3>Nothing But Respect For This Manual Ear And Nose Hair Trimmer</h3></a><p>The Golden Birdie by South Korean brand Royal is a simple piece of metal that is leagues better than its flimsy, electric counterparts.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor-election"><h3>Mamdani Won, And Also Cuomo Lost</h3></a><p>Mamdani can't solve all our problems, but at least he solved the problem of having to talk about Andrew Cuomo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7"><h3>I Owe My Workday To Criterion 24/7</h3></a><p>If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump"><h3>EA Says It Will Retain Creative Control Following Saudi Sale, But, Like, Come On</h3></a><p>Big companies have shown time and time again that they'll say whatever is necessary to get mergers approved</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/dispatch-telltale-games-adhoc-studio]]></content:encoded>
