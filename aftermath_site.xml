            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>While absolutely another instance of gruesome bloodletting for the video game industry, 2025 at least <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/games-industry-layoff-figures-were-down-slightly-in-2025-but-it-was-still-horrendous-year-in-review?ref=aftermath.site"><u>had fewer layoffs than the prior year</u></a>. 2026, on the other hand, is off to a terrible start.</p><p>Today three major companies announced layoffs in some capacity, beginning with Meta, which shut down Sanzaru, Armature, and Twisted Pixel – all VR studios. The first worked on <em>Asgard's Wrath 2</em>, an award-winning game, while the latter is fresh off releasing <em>Deadpool VR</em> in November. The studios are victims of Mark Zuckerberg’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3m775t5ndvc2r?ref=aftermath.site"><u>predictably disastrous overinvestment</u></a> in VR and the metaverse, with roughly 10% to 15% of Reality Labs' 15,000 employees also set to be laid off, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to The New York Times</u></a>.</p><p>“We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/meta-game-quest-vr-facebook-deadpool-sanzaru-twisted-pixel-layoffs-2000659376?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kotaku</u></a>. “This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year.”</p><p>Ubisoft also <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/its-january-13-and-ubisoft-just-announced-its-second-round-of-layoffs-for-2026-at-massive-entertainment-and-ubisoft-stockholm/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>announced more layoffs</u></a> today – its <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-halifax-closed-weeks-after-unionizing-cwa-canada/"><u>second round</u></a> in as many weeks, a time period that constitutes the entire year. Following a “voluntary transition program” at <em>Division</em>, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, and <em>Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora</em> studio Massive Entertainment, the company decided to finish the job with an old-fashioned slash-and-burn treatment, eliminating approximately 55 roles at the Malmö, Sweden-based Massive, as well as Ubisoft Stockholm.&nbsp;</p><p>"This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time,” a company rep <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted?ref=aftermath.site"><u>told IGN</u></a>, noting that <em>The Division</em> will be the studios’ primary focus going forward. “These proposed changes are forward-looking and structural, they are not related to individual performance, recent deliveries, or the quality of the work produced by the teams.”</p><p>Lastly, former Xbox hype man Larry “Major Nelson” Hyrb, an industry veteran, announced that he’s been laid off from Unity after joining the <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-layoffs-1800-people-jobs-25-percent-january-2024-1851150254?ref=aftermath.site"><u>cut-happy</u></a> <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-unity-continues-layoffs-with-abrupt-communications-and-5am-emails?ref=aftermath.site"><u>company</u></a> in 2024.</p><p>"Like many in the gaming space recently, I've been laid off from Unity," he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:c4hu4bppjn6wilmucfikwite/post/3mccuyabbv22d?ref=aftermath.site"><u>said on Bluesky</u></a>. "I am proud of the goals my team and I accomplished in just 18 months, and I am grateful for the creators and teams I had the chance to support. Now, I am excited to explore the next chapter."</p><p>It is unclear if Hyrb's dismissal is part of a larger wave of layoffs at Unity.</p><p>This marks a rough beginning to the year for game workers, especially following yesterday’s news that Rockstar workers who alleged they were fired unjustly amid a unionization push <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/fired-rockstar-employees-denied-pay-by-uk-judge?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2ODI0NzI2MywiZXhwIjoxNzY4ODUyMDYzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUOFJPOVVLSVVQU1owMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.27VI473B4UvIhmPh6eOoW2Crg7Pem9jtOtoGNX34Bco&amp;leadSource=uverify+wall&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>won’t have their pay restored</u></a> during mandatory legal proceedings. However, small silver lining: IWGB, the union representing the workers in the upcoming tribunal, still believes that it will win out in the end.</p><p>“Despite being refused interim relief today, we've come out of last week's hearing more confident than ever that a full and substantive tribunal will find Rockstar's calculated attempt to crush a union to be not only unjust but unlawful,” IWGB president Alex Marshall said in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gameworkers.co.uk/post/3mccnz6vhuk2b?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a statement published today</u></a>. “Over the course of the two-day hearing, Rockstar consistently failed to back up claims made in the press or to refute that they acted unfairly, maliciously, and in breach of their own procedures. … This hearing could have alleviated the hardships faced by those in financial precarity or forced to leave the country as a result of Rockstar's actions but we remain undeterred in our efforts to hold them to account.”</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-recruitment-job-applications-ai-layoffs/"><div><p>Trying To Get A Job In Video Games Right Now Is Like Crawling Through Hell - Aftermath</p><p>The application process has become a dehumanising, demoralising grind</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>
