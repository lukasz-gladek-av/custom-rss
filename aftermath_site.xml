      <p><a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-relaunch-announcement/"><u>To celebrate the launch of our new website</u></a>, we're currently running a sale on Reader-tier memberships for new subscribers:<a href="https://aftermath.site/11-06-2025-01-12-00-2ndbirthdayoffer"> <u>sign up and you'll get a whole month of Aftermath, a blog about video games and so much more, for just $1</u></a>.</p><p>A single American dollar! I'm not even going to bother doing the usual comparisons with stuff like a cup of coffee, because it's <em>a buck</em>. That buck will let you kick the tyres on what it's like being a subscriber to a reader-supported, worker-owned website. You'll get access to every blog (no more registration or paywalls), as well as the ability to join the community by commenting under posts. You can also catch up on all the stories we've written over our first two years,<a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/bestof/"> <u>from exhaustive features to opinion pieces to freelance posts to news and so much more</u></a>.</p><p>After the first month your subscription will renew at the normal rate for the Reader tier, which is $7. If you like it, stick around! And if you like it a <em>lot</em>,<a href="https://aftermath.site/#/portal/signup"> <u>you can even upgrade to our Member tier</u></a>, which in addition to everything you've already got also includes an invitation to our community Discord,<a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>merch discounts</u></a> and a private, full-text RSS feed.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/11-06-2025-01-12-00-2ndbirthdayoffer"><u>Click here to redeem the offer</u></a>, and if you do, thank you so much for your support. This site and everything we do simply isn't possible without the help of readers like you!</p><div data-layout="immersive">
