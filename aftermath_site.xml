            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samadams.bsky.social/post/3lwbtrctwwk2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grim month</a> for the field of criticism: the New York Times <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxtani.bsky.social/post/3lvle3phwms2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reassigned veteran critics</a>, WaPo’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alanzilberman.bsky.social/post/3lvcmz6zvf22c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took a buyout</a>, Vanity Fair elected to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/vanity-fair-cut-back-coverage-hollywood-focus-mark-guiducci-1236487458/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eliminate reviews</a>, and Associated Press <a href="https://bookriot.com/associated-press-to-end-weekly-book-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did the same</a> with its book reviews. It’s beginning to look like curtains for criticism—at least of the traditional sort—but do not conflate the mercurial winds of economic change with a lack of need. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>This time around we’re joined by our former Kotaku colleague <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dreamcastaway.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harper Jay</a> for a discussion of criticism’s role in a world that seems determined to reject it—or at least cast it out of mainstream publications, as well as many video game publications. What does it mean for institutions to cede this ground to fandoms and social media? What do we lose when we cease to respect the expertise that goes into well-considered critical work—or even eliminate the idea of “critic” as a legitimate role or job altogether?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about the news of the week: Unionized workers at Arkane, a Microsoft-owned studio, released a statement <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-azure-arkane-israel-palestine-genocide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decrying the company’s complicity in Israel’s genocide</a> of Palestinians—a subject that hits close to home for Harper, who until very recently worked at Double Fine, another Microsoft studio. Finally, Gita explains why Eevee is the best Pokémon design (it’s a prism through which to view the infinite possibilities of childhood, obviously).&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can hire so many in-house critics that we’ll have to build a whole other house just for them.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> We’ve been talking a lot about fandom and the way people discuss things online – and the flattening of a whole bunch of different ideas that could be considered attempts at criticism, but mostly turn into arguments or policing people for not demonstrating sufficient ideological purity or whatever. And then we have publications ceding that ground and effectively saying that the traditional notion of a critic is something they’re no longer interested in. As a result, you could potentially say that the idea of being a career critic is going away, or becoming something you can only do on YouTube or whatever. What are your feelings on that dynamic shift?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Harper: </strong>It’s wrong. It’s wrong in the sense that anybody can call themselves a critic in the same way that anybody can say that they’re a journalist. The answer is: No you fucking aren’t. That’s a mean thing to say, and it’s not a question of their intentions; it’s a question of their ability. Which is not a popular sentiment to share, but the reason that newspapers have people who are critics is because it is a talent you develop just like anything else. It’s just like with people who say “I’m a journalist” and then just put “BREAKING” in front of all their tweets, that’s not the same thing as being a reporter. There are processes, there’s a body of knowledge that you have, there’s a tradition that you are connected to, there are standards that you hold yourself to.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s cool, and it’s often very good, that someone can jump on YouTube and make two hours of something that is incredibly personal and moving, and it’s right there; in some ways, there’s no barrier to entry. Anyone can do it. But also, the reason that you have positions at outlets or newspapers – and the reason why getting rid of them is bad – is because you’re ceding that process to people who do not have experience or training or standards.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> When I was working at Vice, I shifted pretty hard into criticism in a form I really enjoy—I wrote <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/when-joss-whedon-was-our-master/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Joss Whedon thing</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/aaron-sorkins-liberal-fantasy-runs-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Aaron Sorkin thing</a>—and I literally could not have written those things without [editor] Tim Marchman.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Harper: </strong>I miss him.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I was texting him the other day, and it made me miss him a lot—him and his weird tinned fish obsession.</p><p>He gave me a lot of tools and provided me with things to read. He told me ways to approach these questions that I was trying to answer that I couldn’t have found on my own. Even just the process of getting on the phone with him and being like “I’m thinking X, Y, Z,” and he was like “Have you tried A, B, C,” those things helped me get my wheels turning in ways that I could not have done without him.&nbsp;</p><p>Criticism for me is often a collaborative process, even if I’m just getting up and going to my husband in the other room and saying, “I can’t figure out how to do this transition from one paragraph to the other. Can you help me understand what I’m trying to say here?” I know I could not be someone who gets on YouTube and talks for three hours about a movie. I need an editor. I need someone to help put guardrails on my arguments so I don’t fly off into random tangents.</p><p>There are people on YouTube who I think do a great job at criticism. I just watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZQv1_oosZg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seven-hour video about <em>Midsommar </em>and all the symbolism in it</a>, and the person who made the video, Novum, went so far as to reach out to actors on the film and production designers —so a really, really robust attempt to actually look at the work and think about meaning and how these symbols come together and create new meanings.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s possible [to do in the YouTube ecosystem]. But you can see and tell that this person comes from a tradition of talking and thinking about art in that way. And that kind of video is surrounded by other videos that are just like “<em>Midsommar</em> Ending Explained.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>You could even say those types of videos are the majority now. That’s the main form of discourse around these types of media, whether we’re talking games, TV, film, or whatever else, and then as an outlier you have people digging into something and trying to talk specifically about themes and the ideas a work is trying to explore – which I think is often the point when an artist creates something. But people are getting hung up on “Oh, there’s a plot hole here.”</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Or literally even dumber, [a lot of videos] are just about what happened. “What was the sequence of events I just watched?” You can use your own brain to figure that out!</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s the plot section of a Wikipedia page.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>You can see the lack of facility here. And of course now a lot of those “Blah blah blah ending explained” videos are AI slop. AI voiceover and ChatGPT script put together with algorithmic editing of random clips from the film. That is worrying to me, because it’s not just about lack of media literacy—although I know that’s a popular conversation topic these days. It’s about a lack of curiosity. Not wanting to do the thinking yourself, but wanting something else to do the thinking for you—it is the thing that really concerns me about widespread use of ChatGPT.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/alien-earth-noah-hawley-fx-hulu-ridley-scott"><h3>Alien: Earth Has The Juice</h3></a><p>I was skeptical, but Noah Hawley has not let me down yet.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/cyberpunk-urban-design"><h3>What Cyberpunk 2077 Can Teach Real-World Cities</h3></a><p>Night City's urban design highlights the problems, and solutions, real cities deal with around walkability, housing, and mixed-use areas</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/iwalkfree-review-broken-foot"><h3>I Broke My Foot But The iWalkFree Gave Me Mobility Back</h3></a><p>Breaking your foot sucks, but the iWalkFree 3.0 gets you half way to walking again with some minor caveats.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nty-wapo-vanity-fair-critics]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Alien: Earth Has The Juice]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/alien-earth-noah-hawley-fx-hulu-ridley-scott</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alien-earth-has-the-juice.1271571/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>By the time the credits rolled on the first episode of the new FX series <em>Alien: Earth</em>, I was shocked by how much I enjoyed it. Other than the first two films, <em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em>, the legacy of the groundbreaking science fiction series has been divisive, to say the least. When I saw that Noah Hawley, who has also developed television adaptations of <em>Fargo</em> and created the X-Men series <em>Legion</em>, was credited for both directing and writing the series, I knew that we’re all in good hands.</p><p>I gave up on there being another good <em>Alien</em> movie a long time ago. As a general rule, I’m not a fan of extending something into a franchise when a story feels complete. <em>Alien</em> was its own complete story—one that gestured at a wider world, but a story with a beginning, middle and end. It’s extraordinarily lucky that <em>Aliens</em> is also an amazing movie, though an action movie rather than a compact science fiction thriller. But after these two successes, there’s been a series of duds and half starts, and some outright abominations (<em>Alien vs. Predator</em>).</p><p>As much as I personally enjoy a movie like <em>Alien: Covenant</em>, it is an objective truth that even the return of director Ridley Scott could not bring back the magic of that first <em>Alien</em> movie. As much as I like <em>Alien: Romulus</em>, it too relies on nostalgia for the past rather than creating new places for the story to go. This is not the case with <em>Alien: Earth</em>, which has two episodes streaming on Hulu right now. I think a large part of that is Noah Hawley.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Alien: Earth | Official Trailer | FX" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbsiKjVAV28?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The first show written by Hawley that I watched was <em>Legion</em>, which is an adaptation of <em>X-Men</em>, sort of. It follows David Haller, a mutant in a mental hospital who later learns that the things he thought were mental illness were actually his mutant powers manifesting. Though the show becomes more uneven the longer it goes on, it’s always ambitious and visually adventurous. Instead of putting a hand to his temple and squinting, Haller’s psychic powers are portrayed as dance offs, Bollywood musical sequences, and at one point, a duet between him and his nemesis of the song “Behind Blue Eyes.”&nbsp;</p><p><em>Legion</em> manages to capture aspects of the X-Men and mutant culture that exist in comics that never makes it into the movies: mutants are discriminated against, and therefore a lot of them end up in the dregs of society. What would it feel like to have potentially world altering power, but also be in the throes of a drug addiction? Similarly, Hawley’s <em>Fargo</em> show is more than just a series of crime stories. It tries to grasp at the tone, and especially the humor, of the Coen Brothers’ film without retreading plot points too closely.</p><p>This is the great strength of <em>Alien: Earth</em>. It isn’t just another game of cat and mouse with the infamous xenomorph—though there is still plenty of suspense centered around where the xenomorph currently is, and where it’s going to go next. Like the original film, it’s also about how megacorporations like the fictional Weyland Yutani treat its workers as expendable in their quest to learn the secrets of immortality from the nigh indestructible xenomorph. In a way, the xenomorph itself becomes a literalization of the extractive nature of capitalism: it takes from people and hollows them out from the inside, all in the service of replicating itself. All of the entries in the <em>Alien</em> franchise that I enjoy makes that tension a part of their narratives.</p><figure><figcaption>Image Source: <a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/alien-earth/galleries/first-look" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FX</a></figcaption></figure><p>Much of the first episode of <em>Alien: Earth</em> is about a new megacorp, Prodigy, which is experimenting in transferring consciousness from children with terminal illnesses into adult synthetic bodies.These synthetics have child minds, but they are in adult bodies, leading to some fun acting choices with these adult actors trying to portray that mentally these characters are all about eleven or twelve. Due to the secrecy surrounding this new technology, Prodigy does not allow these synthetics to return to their families ever again. The first child transferred into an adult synthetic body, Wendy, is allowed to see her brother, but only from a distance, watching him through viewscreens but never allowed to contact him.</p><p>In the first episode, a space craft crashes into a skyscraper, and Wendy watches her brother jump into action as a first responder. Wendy talks her handler into allowing her and her fellow synthetics to assist in rescuing people, and doing a bit of corporate espionage on the side. Of course–of course!—there is a xenomorph on that very ship. And boy howdy does it love tearing people apart.</p><p>More than just the fascinating mysteries that Hawley sets up in its first two episodes—the circumstances of how the xenomorph broke free from containment on a space ship, leading to it crashing into a populated city, are so far unrevealed—<em>Alien: Earth</em> is gorgeous to look at. The camera swings and careens down narrow hallways, picking up speed as if it's on a rollercoaster. There is detail packed into every frame, things moving behind people’s heads as they examine the crash, something scuttling in the background as they turn each corner. Most impressive to me are the show's use of soft fades to transition from shot to shot, overlaying images on top of each other into a collage. It all feels thoughtful and considered, a show you cannot watch while looking at your phone.</p><p>For a long time I never wanted an entry in the <em>Alien</em> series where the xenomorph comes to Earth. Hell, I thought most of the entries where the xenomorph is in space were cheap cash grabs relying on nostalgia—a xenomorph on Earth felt creatively bankrupt, as if the series were scraping at the bottom of the barrel to win back fans. After watching two episodes of <em>Alien: Earth</em> I stand corrected. There is something interesting in the idea of a corporation unleashing something this deadly on humanity, only to watch their plans all go up in flames.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nty-wapo-vanity-fair-critics"><h3>Despite What NYT, WaPo, And Vanity Fair Seem To Think, We Still Need Critics</h3></a><p>"You’re ceding that process to people who do not have experience or training or standards"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/cyberpunk-urban-design"><h3>What Cyberpunk 2077 Can Teach Real-World Cities</h3></a><p>Night City's urban design highlights the problems, and solutions, real cities deal with around walkability, housing, and mixed-use areas</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/iwalkfree-review-broken-foot"><h3>I Broke My Foot But The iWalkFree Gave Me Mobility Back</h3></a><p>Breaking your foot sucks, but the iWalkFree 3.0 gets you half way to walking again with some minor caveats.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/alien-earth-noah-hawley-fx-hulu-ridley-scott]]></content:encoded>
