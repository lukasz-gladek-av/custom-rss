      <p>You may not have noticed, but we’re pretty fed up with the cash-ravenous marketing scheme otherwise known as generative AI around these parts. We – like so many others – are sick of being exploited and tired of the computer getting more expensive. On the latest <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours/" rel="noreferrer">Aftermath Hours</a>, we rant about that for <em>even more</em> than an hour.&nbsp;</p><p>This time around, we find ourselves tangled in a rat king of interrelated AI stories: leftists apparently hate technology because they’re rejecting AI (and <a href="https://aftermath.site/anthropic-claude-ai-leftist-technology/"><u>the mass exploitation that comes with it</u></a>), the computer – a theoretically magical device hijacked by tech industry perverts – has <a href="https://aftermath.site/ram-prices-hdd-prices-ai-bubble-computer-expensive/"><u>become massively more expensive</u></a> as a result of AI, and a former indie games luminary has <a href="https://x.com/jasonrohrer/status/2022738409119461680?ref=aftermath.site"><u>dived into the deep end of AI psychosis</u></a> and given agents free rein to blow nearly $10,000 on the stock market.&nbsp;</p><p>Keeping in mind that AI is nothing but stringing together sentences by predicting words at mass scale, we maintain a theme by moving along to <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-game-awards-2025-polymarket-kalshi-gambling/"><u>prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi</u></a>, which also had a big week with the former <a href="https://www.avclub.com/substack-polymarket-expanded-partnership?ref=aftermath.site"><u>announcing Substack integration</u></a>. How is “data” that arises from what is functionally just gambling useful to writers, news organizations, or anyone? <a href="https://aftermath.site/journalism-prediction-markets/"><u>Beats us</u></a>! But here we are. Finally, we answer an all-timer of a mailbag question: “How many owls would you have to see in a day before you thought something weird was going on?”&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can create our own prediction market where CNN pays the five of us to each flip a coin, and then gives us one million dollars.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Every part of the computer [is being affected by AI], and it’s just a bar full of guys that are doing this – that are ruining the computer. I love the computer. I love the computer so much. I love the computer with all my heart. I love technology. Somebody described me as a technologist the other day, and I had never thought of calling myself that, but it is true: I love technology.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing that makes me saddest about this is that we are constantly made to hate the thing that many of us love, which is the computer. Because it either does evil things – which, fair, it’s technology; technology is often morally neutral to evil sometimes – but also because now we can’t even have it. The end of the personal computer, they want this now all in the cloud. They want you to rent their server space. It’s the enclosure of the commons.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>This also all raises the larger philosophical question that’s kind of answered by the powers that be that are propagating AI, which is: Who wants to surrender control to the cloud or AI agents or whatever? That’s not a thing that humans typically do well or that we enjoy. But then the question becomes: <em>Who </em>wants you to surrender control and why? AI is part of a larger push, under fascism, to make us more willing to just go along with whatever. It’s like “Oh, there’s always gonna be a degree of unpredictability or variability in AI agents handling stuff for us; look at how convenient it is.”&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, people in charge basically say “There’s always gonna be a degree of friction or strain under Dear Leader, but that’s fine; it’s the price of whatever good thing we’re collectively getting.” All of these are interrelated ideas that complement each other and, again, lead to the erosion of freedom and control in your own life – and being OK with that, at least philosophically.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>But even within that framework, it doesn’t make sense. I think that gives them too much credit, because even phones aren’t going to be affordable. How are you gonna talk to their chatbots? The thing you need to talk to the chatbot needs RAM. They are now hoarding the RAM.&nbsp;</p><p>This sucks for everybody, but it also sucks for me personally. It makes me mad, because none of them want to talk about the fact that the computer’s fucking expensive now. … It’s all just five guys being annoying, like “Isn’t this great? Isn’t this fucking great?” No! Leave me alone, you fucking freak. I don’t care! But I have to care because that’s my job. I have to care because it’s something I love. I have to care because the computer means more to me than it ever will to these fucking people – any of them! They do not love the computer. They do not have love of the computer in their heart. They love the shape of the computer, they love selling the computer. They don’t fucking like being on the computer. They don’t like getting a computer to do things. They don’t like enjoying struggling with the computer and then having it pay off.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a thing I feel in my heart. It makes me so fucking mad, and I hate these people so much for insisting that I should be fucking excited for this. Because they have ruined a thing I like; they have made a thing I love hard to get, and I cannot stand that. None of them want to talk about that. None of them want to face that because they are either too stupid, too sold on this, or they’re looking at their Vanguard portfolio. And honestly I cannot stand that. Go away. Leave me alone. I want everything you do to crash.&nbsp; </p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/anthropic-claude-ai-leftist-technology/"><div><p>The Left Doesn’t Hate Technology, We Hate Being Exploited</p><p>Techno-cynics are all just wounded techno-optimists.</p><p><span>Gita Jackson</span></p></div></a></figure><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/ram-prices-hdd-prices-ai-bubble-computer-expensive/"><div><p>I’m Tired Of These Useless Jackasses Making The Computer Expensive</p><p>RAM, flash memory, and HDDs are unaffordable because of a bunch of greedy idiots that do not love the computer.</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Chris Person</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>After <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-game-pass-unsustainable/"><u>a disastrous series of events</u></a> dating back to the launch of the Xbox One and <a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi/"><u>repeated</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-phil-spencer/"><u>entreaties</u></a> from us to lay off a few high-paid executives instead of thousands of workers, somebody has finally taken the hint: Phil Spencer. The Xbox boss is retiring from his job at Microsoft, a wannabe AI company whose various chunks are precariously held together by increasingly enshittified vestigial tentacles, and being replaced by… the current president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product. It’s unlikely that things will get better from here on out, but it’s not like we’re sad to see Spencer go.&nbsp;</p><p>“Last fall, I shared with Satya [Nadella] that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life,” Spencer wrote in a memo to staff <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive?ref=aftermath.site"><u>published today by IGN</u></a>. “From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead. … I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together over the last 25 years, and I have complete confidence in all of you and in the opportunities ahead. I’ll be cheering you on in this next chapter as Xbox’s proudest fan and player.”&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of staying on and assuming Spencer’s role, as many assumed she eventually would, Xbox president Sarah Bond is resigning, which sure is conspicuous! Asha Sharma, who spent years at Instacart and Meta before taking up the aforementioned AI job at Microsoft, promises her appointment somehow won’t lead to more AI slop from a company that seems <a href="https://aftermath.site/please-seek-help-immediately/"><u>determined to foist AI</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-muse-ai-phil-spencer-dipshit/"><u>on every sector imaginable</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us,” Sharma wrote in her own memo to staff, adding that Microsoft plans to “recommit” to Xbox fans and players, but also that Xbox, conceptually, is still kinda, you know, whatever. “Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.”&nbsp;</p><p>In his wake Spencer leaves a smouldering swathe of games industry destruction which is not solely his burden to bear – Microsoft employs other execs as well, after all, and also has a board and bloodsucking shareholders to satisfy – but for which he should have suffered significantly more consequences than he did. During Spencer’s tenure, Xbox made a series of ruinously bad bets on everything from <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/xbox-series-x?ref=aftermath.site"><u>console naming schemes</u></a> to <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-price-increase/"><u>Game Pass uprooting the traditional model of how games are purchased</u></a> and becoming a bonafide Netflix competitor. </p><p>In service of this, the tech behemoth unhinged its rotten maw and swallowed up dozens of video game studios, including all of Activision Blizzard, which cost Microsoft an eye-wateringly gargantuan $68.7 billion. Many studios have <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane/"><u>since been closed</u></a> or fallen victim to <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report/"><u>one</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people/"><u>of</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july/"><u>multiple</u></a> rounds of mass layoffs that ultimately impacted thousands of workers.&nbsp;Resulting <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-veterans/" rel="noreferrer">brain drain</a> has been immense, and thanks to the actions of Spencer and others at the highest echelons of power at Microsoft and other major companies, the video game industry <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-recruitment-job-applications-ai-layoffs/" rel="noreferrer">may never fully recover</a>. <a href="https://aftermath.site/blizzard-qa-workers-newly-ratified-union-contract-locks-in-pay-increases-better-benefits/" rel="noreferrer">Unions</a>, a silver lining of the current Xbox regime, are <a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-union-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cwa-layoffs/" rel="noreferrer">doing their best</a>, but have frequently <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-unions-microsoft-layoffs-mmo-elder-scrolls/" rel="noreferrer">found themselves in damage control</a> mode so far.</p><p>It might be hard to remember now, but once upon a time, not all that long ago, press and fans ate up Spencer’s smirking “just another average gamer” act, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/ozclw1/can_we_chat_about_how_how_much_phil_spencer/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>lauding him</u></a> for putting hundreds of hours into Xbox releases large and small. If nothing else, he was determined to portray himself as a man of the people, proudly announcing that he’d spent the equivalent of <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-game-pass-1851095933?ref=aftermath.site"><u>23 work weeks playing games</u></a> in 2023 alone before <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/12/phil-spencer-shares-his-xbox-year-in-review-and-hes-been-very-busy-in-2024?ref=aftermath.site"><u>dropping to a paltry 17</u></a> in 2024. At least now he’ll have more time for his true passion, which is obviously not keeping people gainfully employed.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-muse-ai-phil-spencer-dipshit/"><div><p>Phil Spencer That’s Not How Games Preservation Works, That’s Not How Any Of This Works - Aftermath</p><p>‘We’ve talked about game preservation’, says man who has no idea how it works</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>
