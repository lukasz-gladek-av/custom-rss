            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-respawn-titanfall-layoffs-andrew-wilson-pay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a very normal day</a>. Nothing is amiss. But just for fun, let’s have a gander at the most recent available information on how much EA execs, like CEO Andrew Wilson, are making.&nbsp;</p><p>Now admittedly, these numbers come from <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000712515/f0be0a59-dd50-4247-b36e-0513336b6c1f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA’s 2024 proxy statement</a>, the 2025 version of which is just around the corner, so they might be a little out of date. Still, I think they’re useful a) as a point of comparison to workers in less vaunted positions and b) because they’re from a time period during which EA <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/ea-layoffs-company-to-cut-5percent-of-workforce-or-about-670-employees.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut five percent of its global workforce</a> – the sort of ripcord a major video game publisher would obviously <em>never </em>pull again, but to liven up an otherwise dull day, why don’t we consider how such a thing does or does not impact executive compensation.</p><p>During fiscal 2024, Wilson took home over $25.6 million via a mixture of a $1.3 million base salary, $20.4 million in stock awards, $3.44 million from a non-equity incentive plan, and around $500,000 in personal security benefits. In the same proxy statement, EA said that the annual total compensation of its median employee was $148,704. If you crunch the numbers <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Game Developer did</a>, you’ll find that Wilson made 172 times more than the median EA worker.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re wondering how Wilson fared in years where EA didn’t lay off five percent of its workforce, well, those were some real belt-tightening times for the company’s head honcho, who pulled in only $20.6 million in fiscal 2023 and $19.8 million in fiscal 2022, down from $39 million the year prior, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-executives-blocked-from-received-exorbitant-awards-1844694638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an “exorbitant” level of executive pay</a> that shareholders ultimately <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-ceo-pay-apex-legends-fifa-battlefield-layoffs-compen-1849078379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voted to rein in</a>.</p><p>Here’s what other EA executives made during fiscal 2024:</p><figure></figure><p>Now, as a thought experiment, let’s say that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTk1MzQ2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2NTU4MjY4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVkhVQjFUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Ok9U1G-8KnrQWSRme5JF1VqfCPIxgENs3iq9d32PeRc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">300-400 workers had just gotten laid</a> off as a result of poor sales of games like <em>EA Sports FC 25</em>,<em> </em>as well as longstanding mismanagement of beloved series like <a href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-layoffs-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dragon Age</em></a> and, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-cancels-single-player-titanfall-apex-legends-game-221552559.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repeatedly</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ea-reportedly-cancels-another-titanfall-game-lays-off-several-hundred-employees-205008255.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Titanfall</em></a>. Wouldn’t you think one or even a few of these people could stand to take a pay cut in order to prevent such an outcome? Wilson alone, as we’ve learned, is equivalent to 172 employees if we’re measuring in pure dollars, and I’m sure he’s got plenty in the bank.</p><p>Fortunately, this is all hypothetical, and there’s no need to feel any wholly justified, blood vessel-bursting rage about any of it. We are, after all, in the midst of yet another normal spring day. Nothing to see here.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike"><h3>Almost Three Years After Neutrality Agreement, Negotiations Between Microsoft And Unionized Workers Aren’t Going Well</h3></a><p>"Although Microsoft tries to position itself as a good-faith employer, there’s another story being told behind the scenes at the bargaining table"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/flcl-reanimated"><h3>I’m Obsessed With FLCL Reanimated</h3></a><p>300+ artists got together to swing the bat and give FLCL the tribute it deserves

Which, fine, Nintendo can be glacial when it comes to changing this stuff, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement (or just new ideas!).</p><figure></figure><p>A very pretty example of exactly what I'm talking about is <a href="https://arkotype.co/project/sw1tchos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Clarke's attempt at creating an entirely new Nintendo OS</a>. A video games-centric designer by trade--<a href="https://aftermath.site/gamelogo-is-the-last-good-twitter-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we've covered Dan's stuff before!</a>--this goes well beyond just mocking up a main dashboard, going into the tiniest detail on everything from fonts to icons to the battery display.</p><figure><figcaption>It's great how Virtual Console games are given their own little historical showcases</figcaption></figure><p>What I love about it is that it manages to nail both ends of the brief. Yes, it's clean and crisp in the way all modern interfaces must be for a serious company selling expensive hardware, but it also doesn't forget that Nintendo is a company built on fun, and so still has room for stuff like a cute little pop-up when you put the cartridge in, and a re-imagining of achievements as "stickers". </p><figure></figure><p>If you're a fiend for this stuff as much as I am, <a href="https://arkotype.co/project/sw1tchos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please go check out the full concept over on Dan's site</a>; design sickos should know it includes everything from the colour palette to the percentages/dimensions for the layout of the home screen.</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike"><h3>Almost Three Years After Neutrality Agreement, Negotiations Between Microsoft And Unionized Workers Aren’t Going Well</h3></a><p>"Although Microsoft tries to position itself as a good-faith employer, there’s another story being told behind the scenes at the bargaining table"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/flcl-reanimated"><h3>I’m Obsessed With FLCL Reanimated</h3></a><p>300+ artists got together to swing the bat and give FLCL the tribute it deserves

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>All the way back in 2022, Microsoft made waves in the video game industry by striking a legally binding agreement with Communications Workers of America (CWA), the union that now represents thousands of workers within the company. “Microsoft will remain neutral when Activision Blizzard employees express interest in joining a union, providing a clear path to collective bargaining for almost 10,000 workers,” read <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2022/06/13/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a joint release</a> from CWA and Microsoft during a time when the latter was facing regulatory scrutiny over its then-proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard. At the time, it seemed like a match made in heaven, but two years later, workers find themselves stuck in bargaining hell.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, approaching the third anniversary of the neutrality agreement and the second anniversary of QA workers at Zenimax – the first video game studio union at Microsoft – beginning the process of bargaining for a contract, CWA says proceedings have stalled. It chalks this up to Microsoft’s failure to address concerns about remote work, an issue that has led to <a href="https://aftermath.site/activision-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-mandate-that-they-see-as-soft-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outcry from workers at other Microsoft-owned companies like Activision</a>, as well as Microsoft’s “unilateral decision to replace in-house quality assurance work with outsourced labor without notifying the union.”</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Microsoft for more details, but the company did not reply as of this publishing.</p><p>While early returns, like <a href="https://aftermath.site/as-video-game-industry-goes-all-in-on-ai-workers-race-to-secure-their-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an agreement to curb destructive uses of AI</a>, seemed promising, <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rounds</a> of mass layoffs soon followed in 2023 and 2024. The relationship between Microsoft and the nascent Zenimax QA union has since devolved.</p><p>“It’s become increasingly clear that although Microsoft tries to position itself as a good-faith employer, there’s another story being told behind the scenes at the bargaining table,” Zenimax Workers United member and senior QA tester Autumn Mitchell said in a statement received by Aftermath. “We are frustrated. Our union will continue fighting until we secure a first contract, and we’re prepared to do whatever it takes – even if that means withholding our labor.”&nbsp;</p><p>This follows demonstrations outside of Zenimax offices in Texas and Maryland last week, as well as <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a strike authorization</a> from the hundreds-strong Zenimax bargaining unit earlier this month, which 94 percent of members voted in favor of. At the time, workers spoke out against return-to-office policies and what they viewed as penny pinching from their corporate overlords.</p><p>“Underpayment and costly RTO initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment,” said Zenimax senior QA Tester Zachary Armstrong in <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a release</a> issued by CWA.</p><p>“Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time,” associate QA Tester Aubrey Litchfield added. “Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We’ve released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?”</p><p>Speaking with Aftermath, Mitchell explained how Microsoft's increased reliance on outsourced labor further imperils those contractors.</p><p>"We've got a lot of coworkers right now who have been contracted out for years at this point who are deeply integrated into our teams who need full-time jobs they can really rely on – jobs with sick leave, benefits, decent wages, etc," she said. "Being told there isn't any room for that while simultaneously employing outsourced QA on our projects is a significant threat to those serious needs, and from our eyes, quite hypocritical. We're not saying outsourced work can't exist. There's a place in this industry for QA that can help facilitate a surge in work. We believe, based on up-close experience on these projects, that there's enough room for both."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/flcl-reanimated"><h3>I’m Obsessed With FLCL Reanimated</h3></a><p>300+ artists got together to swing the bat and give FLCL the tribute it deserves
