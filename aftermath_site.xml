      <p>Bluepoint Games, an American studio specialising in remakes like the<em> God Of War Collection</em>, the <em>Ico &amp; Shadow Of The Colossus</em> bundle, <em>Uncharted Collection</em> and <em>Demon's Souls</em>,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>has been shut down by Sony after five years of ownership, during which time the company did not release a single remake</u></a>, with Bloomberg reporting that "roughly 70 employees will lose their jobs" as a result.</p><p>Having worked closely with PlayStation for over a <em>decade </em>(the <em>God of War Collection</em> was released in 2009), Sony decided to buy Bluepoint in 2021 and bring them in-house, after which they were promptly...set to work as a support studio on <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>, before then being assigned a live-service <em>God of War</em> game, before <em>that </em>project was cancelled in January 2025.</p><figure></figure><p>And today they're done. The studio, first founded in 2006, will be shut down next month. In an internal email sent to PlayStation staff (shared on<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloomberg-playstation-is-shutting-down-bluepoint-games-demons-souls-shadow-of-the-colossus-remakes.1440826/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>resetera</u></a>), Sony Interactive Entertainment Studio Business Group CEO Hermen Hulst says:</p><blockquote>...we're operating in an increasingly challenging industry environment. Rising development costs, slowed industry growth, changing player behavior, and broader economic headwinds are making it harder to build games sustainably.<p>To navigate this reality, we need to continue adapting and evolving. We've taken a close look at our business to ensure we're delivering today while still well-positioned for the future. As a result, we will be closing Bluepoint Games in March.</p><p>This decision was not made lightly. Bluepoint is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community. I want to thank everyone at Bluepoint for their creativity, craftsmanship, and commitment to quality. Where possible, we will work to find opportunities for some impacted employees within our global network of studios.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi/"><u>I have seen some gross acts of mismanagement in my time covering this industry</u></a>--it feels like the last three to four years have been nothing but--yet this one somehow feels like the worst. Bluepoint was a studio with a very clear speciality and a very successful track record: they took old PlayStation hits, gave them an update and sold them to new generations of fans.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi/"><div><p>Executives Should Be Facing The Music, Not Laying Off Workers - Aftermath</p><p>Bosses need to be held accountable for their failures</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><p>For PlayStation themselves to buy Bluepoint, not use them for the one thing they would have bought them for and now close them down is just the most colossal waste. It's industry vandalism, at scale. Former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who had live-service game brainworms (see below), deserves some of the scorn here, but the current regime--who have made the decision to close Bluepoint instead of finding something, <em>anything </em>from PlayStation's vast back catalogue for them to work on instead--are equally to blame.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:lb5dnroqbk4ikw4zmgdd77dd/app.bsky.feed.post/3mfaeubpavk2g" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreihch3tsrer7mjtdjifeafldxutaiktgmffrnx5mee6h3vgjotb2am"><p lang="en">Not pulling this outta my ass either, here's something from Sony's 2022 investor/press thing, where they promised 12 Live Services by 2025. Aside from Helldivers, none of that is paying off, and that was under Jim Ryan who left before shit predictably hit the fan.
