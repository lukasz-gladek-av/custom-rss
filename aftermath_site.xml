            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-kingdom-come-deliverance-gamergate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Whether you consider it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/awards/520012/first-2025-goty-contender-kingdom-come-deliverance-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a GOTY contender</a> or not, we’ve certainly got our first big game of the year in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, an open-world RPG that goes for it despite the inevitable jank that comes with such immense scale. This week, many were surprised to learn that the game’s director, Warhorse Studios founder Daniel Vávra, was a big supporter of the first Gamergate movement. This felt like <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-owes-its-popularity-to-realism-and-conserv-1823420208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common knowledge</a> back when the original <em>Kingdom Come</em> (kingdom) came out, but years later, that crucial context has faded into a footnote. What happened? On the latest Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>We’re joined by special guest Rowan Zeoli of <a href="https://www.rascal.news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rascal</a>, an independent, reader-supported, worker-owned outlet for journalism about tabletop roleplaying games not unlike Aftermath. The site is celebrating one year of life on the increasingly tumultuous planet Earth with <a href="https://www.rascal.news/rascal-celebrates-its-first-birthday-with-a-pledge-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a subscription drive</a>, so we ask Rowan how things are going (pretty well!) and then dig into a harrowingly powerful piece she recently wrote about <a href="https://aftermath.site/fight-for-america-j6-rascal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roleplaying the January 6 insurrection</a> in a Brooklyn warehouse. What can we learn from living out these moments in a controlled, game-like environment? And why don’t wargames recreate modern history more often?</p><p>Then we discuss <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> and its director’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3lhcer4oo322q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support of the original Gamergate movement</a>, which everybody seems to have forgotten about. Why, though? And what does it mean for a sequel that&nbsp; seems at least somewhat interested in exploring more diverse stories – despite the objections of an audience that’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-developer-is-fed-up-of-being-dragged-into-the-culture-war-it-seems-like-someone-is-always-trying-to-brand-us-somehow-and-we-are-just-trying-to-make-a-cool-videogame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partially turned on it</a> for that very reason? Finally, at listeners’ request, Nathan gives everyone a special pre-release preview of a passage from <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-stream-big-book-nathan-grayson-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his book</a> (<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preorder now</a>!), and he’s not nervous about it at all.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can grow this humble website into a vast kingdom that will deliver you from the horrors of the modern internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The new <em>Kingdom Come</em> kind of goes back on that idea of [an almost entirely white cast] and says “Actually we are gonna have characters of other backgrounds and from other places, and we’re going to engage in these ways that – at least based on the reviews I’ve read – sound kind of interesting and nuanced.”</p><p><strong>Rowan: </strong>They turned woke!</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>So it feels like the director of this studio is one thing, and some of the people working for the studio are another thing, and you’ve got people at the studio being like “Man, we <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-developer-is-fed-up-of-being-dragged-into-the-culture-war-it-seems-like-someone-is-always-trying-to-brand-us-somehow-and-we-are-just-trying-to-make-a-cool-videogame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t want anything to do with all this culture war shit</a>. We just want people to like our game and play it on its own terms.” And this is the funniest part: Back in the day, the Gamergater types were like “Yeah, this game is doing whites only! We love that shit!” And now that the series has added other people of different backgrounds into the series, they’ve turned on it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rowan:</strong> The leopards would never eat my face, though!</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I know, right? So then you have some of the other developers disavowing the culture war and asking why people are doing this to them. Well, because you’re working with a guy who set a lot of this stuff in motion [and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3lhceupzapc2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kept behaving that way</a> in the intervening period]. How can you be surprised?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>It’s been confusing to me. People are writing about it and talking about it in a way that makes me feel a little bit crazy, where I’m like “Doesn’t everybody remember what happened before?” And because I’m broken inside, I want to leave space for the idea that times have changed and maybe the guy has changed. Nathan tells me the guy has not changed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, if you look at his posts, it doesn’t seem like he’s changed substantially.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> But it seems like the game itself [is fine]. I remember that was the controversy with the game the first time, too: There are things in the game that are probably good and interesting. It’s not a wholesale write off.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Definitely not. That’s the dilemma that I think a lot of people who are more left-leaning are facing. You have this context around how the game was made and who made it, and then the game itself is not the horrible polemic you’d expect it to be. It’s more nuanced than that. And of course, as with any video game of this scale, it was made by hundreds of people – many of whom probably do not share that director’s opinions. But they also did choose to work at that studio.</p><p><strong>Rowan: </strong>Do you guys have this issue in video games? In tabletop games, there’s a real lack of institutional memory. Like even maybe the people writing about this game just have no idea.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Yeah, everybody keeps getting laid off, which certainly doesn’t help.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Times have also changed. When the first <em>Kingdom Come</em> came out [in 2018], a lot of the conversation around games was still happening on websites and blogs and stuff. YouTube was definitely a presence, but it was a little more nascent. Now that dynamic has totally flipped. Now most of the conversation is happening on YouTube and Twitch and Discord, and video game websites are becoming more and more dinosaur-like by the day.</p><p>So I think part of it is probably the age of the audience and the demographics of who was present for that first conversation [about the original <em>Kingdom Come</em>], and the other part is just where it’s all happening – how much more diffuse it is. That means, especially with websites closing down and people getting laid off, that there’s really no institutional memory whatsoever. So even people who’d want to know about this and who’d care about this are not finding out, at least until the very last second.</p><p><strong>Rowan:</strong> I feel like tabletop journalism is about 15 years behind video game journalism, because I’m like “Ah yes, I know exactly what you’re talking about. It’s gonna take us a decade to figure out.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, exactly. And even then, so much of it is cyclical. So many of the conversations happen again and again and again, and nobody fully figures it out.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/trump-tariff-china-ugreen-max5c-noise-canceling-headphones"><h3>These Headphones Were A Great Deal When I Bought Them</h3></a><p>The Ugreen Max5c were an absolute steal when I got them for about $35 dollars, but I have no clue how long that'll be true.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esa-iicon-e3"><h3>Vowels Are Back As ESA Announces New Conference</h3></a><p>The Interactive Innovation Conference will focus on where games connect to other industries</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/trump-tariff-china-ugreen-max5c-noise-canceling-headphones<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are certain areas where Chinese companies currently dominate: amplifiers, affordable earbuds and in-ear monitors. So when I saw a <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/ugreen-max5c-25-nc-headphone-review.58627/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forum post</a> and multiple YouTubers recommended a sub $50 bluetooth headset, I posted about it online. A few people bought them and told me “man, these are pretty good,” so I bought them to mess around. The wisdom was right; they’re well-built, sound solid, and were a great deal when I bought them–before Trump announced his massive China tariffs.</p><p>I should stress for anyone reading this later that this is being written in the early parts of Donald Trump’s second term. We do not know the full impact of how his continued trade war with China is going to work practically, although one element of it<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605483/shein-temu-amazon-trump-tariffs-de-minimis-exemption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> was the removal of the de minimis rule for goods under $800</a> that helped the import of inexpensive Chinese goods to flourish. Previously, inexpensive goods were exempt from existing tariffs and close inspection, and the removal of this rule means that not only are consumers hit with the new tariffs, but existing ones as well.</p><p>The framing of these tariffs has overwhelmingly been to state that this is a direct attack on vendors of cheap goods like Temu and SHEIN, as well as imports <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/drugs-fentanyl-shipping/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of fentanyl</a>.The last point is a little reactionary, and I am skeptical that the changes being proposed will do much to lessen the flow of fentanyl. And while I agree SHEIN sucks a lot, so does most clothing now, the framing undersells the significance of Chinese goods, including goods that are well made.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607282/trump-china-tariffs-dhl-shipment-import-duty-fees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fees on importing Chinese goods</a> are probably going to go up. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607080/qwertykeys-halts-us-shipments-tariff-china" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Some companies halted shipments in moments of uncertainty</a>; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607475/china-tariffs-shipping-fees-charges-delays-ups-usps-fedex-dhl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delays and new charges are happening</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606489/usps-reverses-china-hong-kong-parcel-decision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USPS briefly halted then backtracked on accepting packages from China</a>. Even if you agree with the idea of stopping the de minimis rule or buying less frivolous stuff, <a href="https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Final-de-minimis-report-Oxford-Economics-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">none of this seems particularly well-implemented</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>The pads are fairly comfortable but I tend to sweat through anything that isn't velour. These headphones are no exception.</figcaption></figure><p>This brings us to the Ugreen Max5c headphones, which I got for about $35. You may know <a href="https://www.ugreen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ugreen</a> because they make competitive and solidly built USB-C charging cables, power chargers and power banks. They've also been expanding into other fields like Network Attached Storage (for laymen: a big box you shove hard drives into to store stuff and run a Plex server), although I have not tested them against offerings like QNAP, Synology or Terramaster.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ugreen Max5c is not listed publicly on Ugreen’s English-facing site and is currently unavailable on Amazon, but it is available on their Aliexpress store. This is not uncommon with Chinese companies, and if you dig around the official Aliexpress store you’ll find a lot of items they don’t promote as much here, like wireless earbuds and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604094/ugreen-finder-slim-thin-wallet-card-tracker-rechargeable-apple-find-my-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple AirTag clones</a>. Ugreen also has models other than the Max5c, like the Max5 Hybrid and Studio Max 2, although I have not read any reviews of either of those.</p><p>The first thing you notice when you hold the Ugreen Max5c is that it’s shockingly well built for the money. Like a lot of Ugreen’s products, trim and finish are what I would expect from a much more expensive product, although the buttons themselves are a little clicky when they’re on your head. The cups are on the smaller side but fit comfortably on my head. The headset has both a partial lateral swivel and a hinge that allows you to fold them and put them in your bag. I dislike pleather or leather earcups personally, as I run pretty hot as a general rule. While these are no exception, I found them fairly comfortable as far as these things go. I would love the ability to swap the cups out for something aftermarket, because pads always disintegrate, but anything involving noise canceling requires a good seal, which can make that a tricky proposition.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>It's hard to have a problem with these headphones, but I don't like relying on an app as a general rule, and wished Ugreen had more specific EQing options.</figcaption></figure><p>The stock equalization for the Max5c is distractingly bassy, which is not uncommon when designing headphones for a mass market. Switching the tuning requires you to download a <a href="https://www.ugreen.com/pages/ugreen-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companion app</a> from Ugreen and switch to one of the many presets. I found that “Jazz” and “Classic” tended to tame the bass into something far more transparent and clear. The app is slightly fiddly and annoying to use, and the ability to do any of this without adding clutter to my phone would have been preferential. The ability to have a parametric or graphic EQ would also have been a nice touch, but as it stands you need to use an external app to do that, which I don’t because I am a basic iPhone user. Apps like <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Equalizer APO</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pittvandewitt.wavelet&amp;hl=en_US&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wavelet</a> for Android are a good way to address this. The good people at Audio Science Review, where I first heard about these headphones, actually <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/ugreen-max5c-25-nc-headphone-review.58627/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have a good preset that should work with those apps</a>.</p><p>My ability to assess just how good these headphones are is limited by several factors. The first is that I was not able to test the headphone with the advertised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAC_(codec)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LDAC codec</a> because this is one noteworthy area where Apple refuses to treat people like adults. Though it is possible to use LDAC on a Windows PC with annoying workarounds, the ability to turn the LDAC feature on in the headset requires you to enable it in the <em>Android version </em>of the app. It’s understandable that Ugreen does not want to implement a codec you can’t use with an iPhone on the iPhone app, but this and the lack of tuning made it difficult for me to give a full assessment on mobile. The other issue is that I don’t have a measurement rig like a B&amp;K 5128 – a big fake head that not only measures how headphones sound but how they behave on the head. Maybe one day if Aftermath gets serious money I’ll be able to get one of those, but for now I’m going on the measurements of others and how they sound to my own ears.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The buttons are fine, the mic is nothing to write home about although I don't expect much for $35 dollars. Wired connections can only be done via USB-C. </figcaption></figure><p>But to be honest, I’m not sure how rigorous I need to be given that these things sound pretty fantastic for about $35. For that money, what do you expect? It’s impressive that a pair of headphones has noise canceling at all at this price and even more impressive that it performs decently there. The app features four distinct levels of noise canceling, one of which is an awareness mode that worked ok, although I’ve definitely heard better. These are not perfect headphones, but they might be close to perfect $35 headphones.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="UGREEN HiTune Max5C Active Noise Cancellation Headphone Review" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/48c69Pkor7Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A pretty comprehensive video of the Max5C from AndyAudioVault.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Max5c features an under-explained game mode, but I assume this helps with latency. The mic quality is a little distant but performs OK for the money. I still dream that someday a company will start making mic quality a bullet point and implement something like the freakishly good array mic from the Valve Index. The battery life is advertised at 75 hours with ANC off and 45 hours with it on, and while I haven’t run it through a full charge yet, it seems to last a long time.</p><p>Though it has its quirks, the Ugreen Max5C is an incredible value for the money, or at least it was when I bought it. After I got the notification that it had entered the country and passed customs, USPS <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606489/usps-reverses-china-hong-kong-parcel-decision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enacted and then rescinded a freeze on packages coming from China</a>, one of many moves recently that seems to have been shot off with little thought of the cascading effects on consumers and businesses in America. That same day I got multiple panicked emails from tea suppliers I’d ordered from in the past, pleading patience as everyone figures out how any of this shit is supposed to work. I can only imagine being someone whose livelihood depends on imports and feeling your stomach drop as the underpinning of your life changed and reverted back in about a day.</p><p>This specific moment is volatile, senseless and ambiguous; every function of our life can change hour-to-hour as the world slouches towards an increasingly unstable future. It makes recommending any action uncertain, even something as frivolous and silly as buying surprisingly nice budget headphones. This review might not be relevant for very long, but if tomorrow looks anything like today and next week looks anything like tomorrow, then I suppose it’s worth noting that these headphones sound solid and were an absolute steal when I got them.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> While this article was being edited,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y7edy35pvo" target="_blank">Trump further delayed implementation of the de minimis rule</a>, which underscores the point about how nobody knows what’s going on.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esa-iicon-e3"><h3>Vowels Are Back As ESA Announces New Conference</h3></a><p>The Interactive Innovation Conference will focus on where games connect to other industries</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
