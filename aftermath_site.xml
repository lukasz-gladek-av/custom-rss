      <p><a href="https://aftermath.site/game-of-the-year-2025-aftermath-luke-plunkett/" rel="noreferrer">My 2025 obsession with city-builders</a> is running straight through into 2026 with <em>Whiskerwood</em>, which recently came out in Early Access and which, even unfinished, is legitimately one of the best and most interesting examples of the genre.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/game-of-the-year-2025-aftermath-luke-plunkett/"><div><p>Luke’s Favourite Video Games Of 2025</p><p>A year where indie city-builders carried the load following some big AAA disappointments</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><p>Set in the 1700s (though, not <em>our </em>1700s), you play as the leader of some little mice (<em>Redwall</em> fans, ahoy) who have been sent by their cat overlords to settle a distant (and importantly, unoccupied) land. Upon landing and picking out your settlement spot you begin a survival city-builder that appears to be quite conventional: you need to harvest timber and stone so you can build houses and farms, which you’ll need to support a growing population, while also keeping everyone fed and warm so they don't die during the depths of winter.&nbsp;</p><p>Were that all there was to this game, just a city-builder starring cute little mice, it would still be great. There's a staggering amount of tech and buildings to unlock, and a ton of resources to work with. What begins with picking berries and chopping down logs gets very quickly into pipe systems and mass transportation, and while early on you’re only building houses and docks, later you’ll need multiple buildings specialising in the inputs required for everything from tailored winter clothing to scissors.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4VVSaG9WnE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Whiskerwood - Launch Trailer | Cats &amp; Mice City-Builder Game"></iframe></figure><p><em>Whiskerwood</em> does a fantastic job of tracking the myriad of resources required to support this burgeoning commercial network. Click on a building and you’re instantly shown everything you need to know, like where the workers are right now on the map, what they’re doing, what the status of its current production is and what, if anything, is holding that up. Need to find a specific building, or a count of how much tea everyone has drunk today? It’s all 1-2 clicks away. I know this sounds like something all city-builders do and should do, but they don’t! Failing to tell the player all the information they need is where so many of them fall down!</p><p>The production chains, while appearing daunting at first glance, are also pretty fun to get going. <em>Whiskerwood</em> is packed with workshops that will turn something raw into something processed, then turn that processed thing into something else. Sometimes it’ll need more raw ingredients, sometimes it’ll need fresh water (requiring a piped water network) and often combinations of all of those. It’s very clear how to get these all up and running and to keep track of how they’re going, so from humble beginnings you can get some cool stuff going late-game, to the point it feels like <em>Factorio</em> in parts as you strive for the most economical way possible to move your resources from building to building (the developers’ last game went very hard on production).&nbsp;</p><p>It’s clear the team have put a <em>lot </em>of thought into what makes these games sing beyond the basics. You know everything you need to know at all times, thanks to the on-screen indicators and menus. The Interface is wonderful, and designed in a way that keeps you busy constantly; there’s always something broken or short on supply, which requires you to personally attend to it and generally make very precise orders, but rather than being an annoyance or something you wish could be automated, here it’s just an invitation to get creative. Mistakes in <em>Whiskerwood</em> are <em>fun</em>, a rarity in city-builders, but especially in survival ones.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>The emphasis on logistics is also astounding in how thorough and robust it is, even at this Early Access stage. <em>Whiskerwood</em> runs on a day/night cycle, limiting the amount of work every mouse can do each day, so it's imperative to make sure your workers’ commutes are as short as possible, while also optimising the delivery of goods through first direct paths, then later on conveyer belts, elevators and even railways. Commutes even factor into a mouse’s happiness, so <em>Whiskerwood</em> is in effect asking you to build several 15-minute settlements across the map, then endlessly refine them in a way that’s so taxing, and rewarding, that it could have just been its own video game.</p><p>But that’s not all there is to it. Remarkably, <em>Whiskerwood</em> also has <a href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game/" rel="noreferrer">a whole <em>Sid Meier’s</em> <em>Colonization</em> thing going on as well</a>, set in a politically tumultuous time, and laced with secessionist possibilities. Just like in <em>Colonization</em> your overlords are assholes, and just like in <em>Colonization</em> they’re also necessary because they’re supplying you, so you pay your taxes (colonial ships arrive at your towns periodically and demand huge portions of your goods), you buy fancy gear from home and you will like it. And just like in <em>Colonization</em>, a big part of your workforce planning is defined by the skills and experience your colonists have when they land, making some much better suited to certain jobs than others.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game/"><div><p>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game - Aftermath</p><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><p>The bigger your colony gets, and the more self-sufficient it becomes, the more you can start to question that power balance, and maybe do something about it. Annoy the motherland enough and they’ll snap, cutting you off from vital supplies and sending warships to your harbour which bombard you, causing huge amounts of destruction which you need to repair.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also…well actually that’s about it for the rebellion stuff, which is very much in an either unfinished or not-even-there-yet stage. You can see where the game’s going to try to go with it, but it’s clearly prioritising city-building at this stage of development over its political play.</p><p>I know I spent a lot of time in 2025 talking about city-building and resource management, so I'm sorry to begin 2026 doing exactly the same thing. But hey, it's not my fault the folks making cool games in this genre are getting so smart and making such interesting stuff. And <em>Whiskerwood</em> is one of the smartest I’ve played in a <em>long </em>time. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Climber Is An Incredibly Beautiful, Devastating Manga About Hubris]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/the-climber-shin-ichi-sakamoto-seinen-sports-manga-climbing/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>The first time I encountered the word “egoist” was while watching the shonen sports anime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lock?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Blue Lock</u></em></a>. By all accounts, it was a solid first foray into how an (ego) death game-lite soccer tournament comprised of nothing but strikers would have hotheads butting heads. However, everything <em>Blue Lock</em> had to offer me might as well have been baby food by the time I finished the underappreciated seinen gem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Climber_(manga)?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Climber</u></em></a>—a brutal, transcendent tale about when grit and enlightenment arrive a hair too late to save men already ruined by their own compulsions.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than being a glorified glossary of the sport like its breezier contemporaries, <em>The Climber</em>, written by novelist Jirō Nitta and adapted into a manga by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin-ichi_Sakamoto?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Shin-ichi Sakamoto</u></a>, is essentially about a group of climbers and the folly and pyrrhic victories of their impulses—namely, those of protagonist Mori Buntarō. When we first meet Mori, who’s loosely based on the <a href="https://onehundredmountains.blogspot.com/2010/10/life-and-death-on-matterhorn-of-japan.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>real-life legend Katō Buntarō</u></a>, he’s an edgy transfer student already halfway checked out of humanity. After a run-in with a classmate who impressively scaled the school roof just to poke fun at Mori for being an antisocial prick, Mori repeats the climb, to the horror of everyone at the school, without a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belaying?ref=aftermath.site"><u>belaying rope</u></a>. The instant he pulls off a ballsy double dyno jump to the school roof, Mori’s life shifts into a new paradigm as he chases an insatiable high for climbing, a sport the manga frames as his supposed salvation.</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>(Viz Media)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>At the onset, Mori’s got everything your typical shonen protagonist would have: a built-in rival in his former bully turned climbing senpai, a mentor in his homeroom teacher and climbing coach, and a cute girl cheering him on from the sidelines. All signs point toward a clean, redemptive path to being a normal guy. But climbing doesn’t save him; it drags him deeper into himself. Mori doesn’t want to tether himself to a partner—he wants to be a solo climber, and if he could help it, he wants to be a solo climber without the lifeline of a belay rope. What follows are chapters, cleverly stylized as “climbs,” that amplify everything fundamentally broken in Mori long before they ever offer a way out—which he frequently refuses—as the manga tracks his psychological descent with grisly patience, from dropping out of high school to the isolating, obsessive adulthood that cements his effigy as the “immortal climber.”</p><p>Part of what makes <em>The Climber</em> so arresting is its insistence that the logic of “the ground” does not apply to the logic of the mountain. Down here, cutting a belay rope is unthinkable. Up there, if it comes down to severing that line or dying alongside your partner, you cut the rope. The manga never sensationalizes this binary choice of extremes; it simply presents the reader with the reality of a world where survival demands choices that would make no sense to anyone not already resigned to the possibility of dying for having made the climb in the first place.</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>(Images: Viz Manga)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>To keep readers grounded without slowing the pace, each volume includes a glossary of climbing terms—clean, unobtrusive, and genuinely helpful—as well as interviews with real climbers explaining why they do what they do. But as the series reminds you, just because you can cut your ear off doesn’t make you Vincent Van Gogh. <em>The Climber</em> interrogates the “Why do you X?” refrain that runs through other art/athletics‑driven stories like <a href="https://aftermath.site/look-back-gkids-tatsuki-fujimoto/"><em><u>Look Back</u></em></a> or <a href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-review/"><em><u>100 Meters</u></em></a>, only here the characters are often too far gone for a redemption that isn’t self‑destructive. Real egoists, the manga argues, are R.U.N.s: revolting, ugly, nauseating, and shameless—and <em>The Climber</em> is packed with them.&nbsp;</p><p>No arc better epitomizes the ambitions and the hubris of an egoist than <em>The Climber</em> putting its characters through the wringer in their attempt to conquer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K2?ref=aftermath.site"><u>K2</u></a>, one of the five tallest mountains on Earth, and also the deadliest. Given the mountain has killed one person for every four who reached the summit since the year 2021, totalling to around 96 deaths for every <a href="https://www.climbing.com/places/k2-worlds-second-highest-mountain/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>estimated 800 climbers who summited by the year 2023</u></a>, the odds of <em>The Climber</em>’s egoists being successful are dog water considering its climbing team would climb the bodies of their partners if it meant being the first to conquer its eastern face.&nbsp;</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>(Images: Viz Media)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><em>The Climber</em> is also one of those manga where the artistry illustrates its point far more effectively than dialogue ever could. For 170 chapters, <em>The Climber</em>’s pages capture the true devastation of an avalanche, not as the usual cloud of powder sliding politely down a mountain, but as a catastrophic force of nature rendered through panels of skyscrapers and semi‑trucks plummeting downhill at blistering, irrational speeds. It’s a visual language designed to make you feel, in your bones, how dangerous climbing really is. And Sakamoto’s artistry drives that point home, shifting effortlessly between the magical realism of trippy, ethereal, dreamlike climbing sequences and the raw, uninhibited anguish his characters endure as they bivouac on the mountain and as they curl up in a husk below it, should they be fortunate enough to descend a climb by their own power without their frozen carcasses being helicoptered from a rocky metaphor for their own hubris.</p><figure><figcaption><span>(Image: Viz Media)</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>The Climber</em>’s answer to “Why do you X?” is a deceptively simple one. Mori doesn’t climb because he loves it, nor does he do it to be the best. He does it because it’s natural to go where you feel compelled to go. And, as in life, the path that demands the most courage is, more often than not, the one you’re supposed to take. Whether that place is the zenith of a man‑killing mountain, or its nadir, where the people who love you white-knuckle it out through deafeningly silent weeks for your safe return. Along his trek, Mori metamorphosizes from an irredeemable little shit into someone worth rooting for one brutal climb at a time.&nbsp;</p><p>By the time I tore through <em>The Climber</em>, taking many a “woosa” break, I felt I’d read a masterpiece on par with <a href="https://gizmodo.com/vinland-saga-creator-makoto-yukimura-looks-back-on-writing-his-pacifist-viking-epic-2000664303?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Vinland Saga</u></em></a>. It gave me a new appreciation for climbing—and scared me straight out of ever wanting to solo climb a mountain, much less face life’s less voluntary obstacles alone.</p>
