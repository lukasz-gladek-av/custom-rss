            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/open-thread-how-was-your-break<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to 2025, which is starting in earnest with good things–<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games Done Quick</a>!--and less good things–<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/06/nx-s1-5217818/january-6-electoral-count-reform-act" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the US certifying election results</a>, ushering in whatever the next four years of our lives are going to be. Let’s drag our heels a little longer by reflecting on the glory of the timeless sprawl of winter break.</p><p>My break was pretty OK– I went to visit my parents in Florida for the first time since they moved there many years ago. For <a href="https://www.aclufl.org/en/know-your-rights/know-your-rights-floridas-public-restroom-changing-facility-ban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obvious reasons</a> I wasn’t that psyched to go, but the trip was mostly good. They live in a weird golfing complex, which makes my dad happy and gave me the opportunity to spy on golfers and remember how much I don’t like golf. My sister took me and my youngest niece and nephew to the Everglades, where we saw so many terrifying alligators and also some cool birds. My parents have a giant TV that is positively cursed with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sor5qTTsOOQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion smoothing</a>; I smugly said “Oh, I can fix this for you,” only for them to not be able to find the remote that would allow me to do so. I have failed in my duty as an ostensibly tech-savvy kid.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I also spent some time with my sister’s family in South Carolina, where she lives on a farm full of horses, who let me pet them, and also goats, who for some inexplicable reason I want to pick up and cradle like babies but who mostly ran away to mockingly have goat fun where I couldn’t get to them.</p><p>Because I was away, I didn’t get to play as many games as I meant to, though I did start a new run in my favorite game, <a href="https://aftermath.site/long-dark-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Long Dark</em></a>, instead of doing the more professionally responsible thing of playing more <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a>. But I did read a lot of books on my travels: a book about <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/671288/dont-call-it-a-cult-by-sarah--berman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NXIVM</a>, an academic book about <a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479881062/heavens-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heaven’s Gate</a>, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/670541/the-rich-people-have-gone-away-by-regina-porter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Rich People Have Gone Away</em></a> (wasn’t as into it as I was hoping to be from reviews), and half of <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/665335/come-and-get-it-a-gma-book-club-pick-by-kiley-reid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Come and Get It</em></a>, which I’m digging.</p><p>And now we’re all back to work and ready (or not) for whatever a new year will bring. What did you get up to? How’s your 2025 feeling so far? &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
