            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As <a href="https://aftermath.site/trump-halo-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riley has already reported</a>, earlier today several wings of the US federal government spent their time tying some of the current administration's most racist and heinous policies--like masked goons snatching innocent people off the street--to the <em>Halo</em> franchise.</p><p>There's no ambiguity here, no wink or nod to hide behind. They literally came out and directly tied immigrants to America to The Flood, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_(Halo)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'parasitic alien lifeform</a>' that you spend the <em>Halo </em>games blasting to hell and back because there are countless millions of them and they're trying to invade and corrupt the universe. They're using <em>Halo </em>imagery to recruit armed, masked goons.</p><p>In any sane and normal world, even one we lived in mere months ago, this would have prompted an immediate comment from the large, wealthy company that owns <em>Halo</em>. At least, a cursory "Master Chief fights for peace, and we have no association with this" line would have been expected, like we see<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/20/nx-s1-5580328/kenny-loggins-donald-trump-ai-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> most days of the week when a musician has to distance themselves from a song used by a Trump video</a>. Even taking into account the fact Microsoft knows <em>some </em>of its customer base are racist fascists, they also surely know that most <em>Halo </em>fans are <em>not</em> racist fascists, and would be horrified to see Master Chief associated with any of this.</p><p>But we no longer live in a sane world. And so in the hours that have passed since the images were first posted on official US government social media accounts, there hasn't been a peep. The only thing we've heard from Microsoft is “Microsoft does not have anything to share on this matter”:</p><p>Microsoft's refusal to actually say something here is more damning than any mealy-mouthed comment they <em>could </em>have made. They have been presented with what must be one of the most nightmarish scenarios anyone working in comms or PR can imagine--someone linking your video game series to <em>government-sanctioned tyranny</em>--and with most of the day to say something have instead simply declined to comment.</p><p>Sure, there's the fact we're talking about t<em>he US government here</em>, that's a factor! But maybe it also has something to do with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella being one of Silicon Valley's most overt ass-kissers,<a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/05/trump-tech-dinner-full-attendee-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> who earlier this year attended the President's fealty banquet</a> and, as Fortune writes, "thanked Trump for putting policies in place for the U.S. to lead in AI, praised Trump’s approach of supporting rather than fighting technology companies, calling it crucial for maintaining America’s technological leadership globally."</p><p>Maybe it's because Microsoft, under Nadella's watch, is helping bulldoze an entire section of the historic White House,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/trump-white-house-ballroom-donors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> an act the company donated money towards</a>.</p><p>Maybe it's just that loads of senior people at Microsoft are<a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> totally fine being active participants in the genocide of the Palestinian people</a>, something that absolutely aligns their corporate aims with those of the current administration. And finally, maybe it's<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-phil-spencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> just because the people running Xbox itself are simply not very good at their jobs</a>.</p><p>Whatever the reason, it's not like it matters. Like so many other cowardly and complicit tech CEOs of this age, and the companies they lead, Microsoft’s actions (or in this case, inaction) has done nothing today but<a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-price-increase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> remind us of something we already know: we should be spending our time and money elsewhere</a>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/trump-halo-twitter"><h3>The Trump Halo Memes Aren’t Supposed To Make Sense</h3></a><p>It's me, the sucker trying to figure them out anyway</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon"><h3>What The Hell Is Microsoft Doing?</h3></a><p>"They added a new Clippy.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-chainsaw-man-fan-calculated-how-long-you%E2%80%99d-survive-sex-with-angel-devil-before-suffering-from-twink-death.1336309/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With <a href="https://gizmodo.com/chainsaw-man-the-movie-reze-arc-review-anime-mappa-2000675933#comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Chainsaw Man — The Movie: Reze Arc</em></a> sitting at the number one spot in the U.S., <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/10/24/chainsaw-man-reze-arc-beats-demon-slayers-rotten-tomatoes-score/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drawing rave reviews</a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-chainsaw-man-movie-carves-up-a-box-office-win-2000677288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IMAX box office buzz</a>, anime’s bold leap into the mainstream has never felt more confident or surprising. For legacy outlets and casual moviegoers alike, the challenge with <em>Chainsaw Man </em>isn’t so much reviewing the film and anime’s signature mix of graphic violence and grief as figuring out how to interpret its overt horniness. And I’ve been loving every second seeing it on my timeline.&nbsp;</p><p>One Rotten Tomatoes critic quote from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/movies/chainsaw-man-the-movie-reze-arc-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times writer Nicholas Rapold’s review</a>—“It’s hard not to feel limited by the character’s somewhat stunted psychology”—while taken out of context from its otherwise glowing review (<a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/31/16107948/rotten-tomatoes-score-get-their-ratings-top-critics-certified-fresh-aggregate-mean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as it often happens</a>), reads like a shrug from someone who simply doesn’t understand the complexities of Denji’s process of turning his inverted hierarchical pyramid upright in his long, slow coming-of-age story to separate physicality and sex from emotional love.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, Rapold’s passing sentiment is a common refrain many fans grapple with when they first start the series. As YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHeJT0aNWJE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MoistCr1tikal</a> pointed out, the question of whether <em>Chainsaw Man</em> is an anime about a horny teenager or a horny anime about a teenager is an age-old debate that’s answered simply: yes to both. But the depravity of <em>Chainsaw Man</em> goes far deeper than Rotten Tomatoes’ cherry-picked pull quote from Rapold or the confines of <em>Reze Arc</em>’s stark nudity. Beneath Denji’s slow journey toward emotional literacy, which reviewers (including myself) have tried to capture in their reviews, lies a fandom that’s long since abandoned restraint.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="米津玄師  Kenshi Yonezu - IRIS OUT" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LmZD-TU96q4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>At their most peevish, they <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@weebeffect/video/7556176140306599175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bark at Makima’s appearance in theaters</a>. At their most exasperating, they “<a href="https://x.com/ver_zeke/status/1889422669067723170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wish that were me</a>,” like <a href="https://youtu.be/PV5063fjZ6I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Park characters </a>and boil down the adult women<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChainsawMan/comments/i7j4bs/psa_denji_is_not_a_simp_denji_is_a_victim_of/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> manipulating the 16-year-old protagonist with sex</a> to “simping.” Truly, the stunted psychology of <em>Chainsaw Man</em> fans might rival that of the hero. But I want to highlight how shipping—the great equalizer of depravity in any fandom—turns one glorious act of depravity into the primo example of how deep into the delinquent abyss <em>Chainsaw Man</em> fans can truly go in a vastly more positive light than the usual fair for the fandom scaring the hoes (read: normies).&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite examples of unhinged feats from the <em>Chainsaw Man</em> fandom are one unsung fan’s attempt to do the math (literally) and determine how long the average anime fan can raw dog the series’ resident cherub, Angel Devil, before dying.</p><p><strong>Light series spoilers for that.</strong></p><p>In a previous blog post in which I rightly stated that <a href="https://aftermath.site/chainsaw-man-reze-arc-tatsuki-fujimoto-the-bible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Chainsaw Man</em> is better than the Bible</a>, I explained that a Devil’s strength depends on humanity’s fear of the concept they embody. Falling Devils, Bomb Devils, and STD Devils are all real entities that exist in Chainsaw Man. One odd man out in the Devil pantheon is Angel Devil, a devil who looks more like a lil guy than a freakish homunculus. Angel Devil’s whole deal is that your lifespan is shortened the longer you make physical contact with him. Angel Devil works alongside Denji, specifically his roommate Aki Hayakawa, to hunt devils. Despite their limited screentime, fans strongly ship the straight-laced Aki and the innocent Angel Devil. They have their own ship name, <a href="https://shipping.fandom.com/wiki/AkiAngel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AkiAngel</a>. Plus, the whole cannot touch aspect of their partnership fits well with monster-fucker fantasies. Sony’s marketing team has been <a href="https://x.com/Chainsaw_EN/status/1980696214485233744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaning into that</a>, hyping up their relationship despite their limited screentime, much to the delight of AkiAngel fans.&nbsp;</p><p>Toward the climax of the film, Aki and Angel Devil are on the brink of getting caught up in the chaos of Denji and Shark Devil’s battle with Bomb Devil and Typhoon Devil. Instead of letting Angel Devil go, Aki pulls him close, clutching his hand as the chaos level of a disaster film like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000386/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolland Emmerich</a> tears through Japan. It’s a cute shipper moment in both the manga and the anime. But one fan was laser-focused on their brief contact, which lasted over 3 seconds, cutting 2 months from the 2 years Aki has left to live, and reverse-engineering how long the average anime fan could spend recreating the creature with two backs with Angel Devil before dying.&nbsp;</p><p>In the post, the fan, whose origin point in a sea of reposts on <a href="https://x.com/cavalierposting/status/1970834156113613225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Animemes/comments/zu57mx/chainsaw_man_sanest_chainsaw_man_fan_sir/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> about it is lost to time, hypothesized from chapter 50 of <em>Chainsaw Man</em> that the three seconds Aki touched Angel Devil, that a year of a person’s total lifespan would be depleted from physically touching Angel Devil for 18 seconds. Taking this knowledge from Tatsuki Fujimoto to its logical exaggeration, answering the question on every fan’s mind three years ago, crunched the numbers, concocting an equation for how long you could bump uglies with Angel Devil before meeting God.&nbsp;</p><p>They arrived at their equation by taking the average male life expectancy is 72.75 worldwide (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now 75.8 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—go men!</a>), subtracting from the average age of anime fans of 18 to 25, they estimated that the average viewer has around 47.75 to 54.75 years to spare to touch Angel Devil.&nbsp;</p><p>For clarity, the Angel Devil Porking Life Equation is: the average male lifespan minus your current age, multiplied by 18 seconds, then divided by 60 to get the exact minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>Using my age this year as an example, along with the updated male life expectancy, that equation looks like this:</p><p>75.8 - 29 = 46.8 years to spare</p><p>46.8 years to spare x 18 seconds =&nbsp; 828 seconds</p><p>828 seconds ÷ 60 = 13.8 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>So by my calculations, I’d get roughly 14 minutes with Angel Devil to, as the nameless fan so eloquently put it, “pound that angel bussy straight” before my lifespan taps out. While that’s not a lot to boast about, it’s undoubtedly more than Aki can say, given he’s got less than two years left post-<em>Reze Arc</em>. Could you wear protection and forgo the whole life-draining phenomenon entirely? Sure. But where’s the doomed romance in that? Sometimes you raw dog a life-sapping twink not for survival, but for the love of the game.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Chainsaw Man</em> fans, at the height of their passion, are dedicated enough in their depravity to do the math on how long characters can have sex. This is a crucial fact for anyone to know as anime movies continue to take over the box office: your fellow audience members are likely deranged.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-halo-dhs-ice-trump-flood"><h3>Not Commenting Is Commenting</h3></a><p>'Microsoft does not have anything to share on this matter'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/trump-halo-twitter"><h3>The Trump Halo Memes Aren’t Supposed To Make Sense</h3></a><p>It's me, the sucker trying to figure them out anyway</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon"><h3>What The Hell Is Microsoft Doing?</h3></a><p>"They added a new Clippy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s a theory that started on Bluesky a month ago from composer Patrick Cosmos that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/veryimportant.lawyer/post/3lybxlwzjuc2h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everyone in the US government is 12 now</a>. Cosmos goes on to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/veryimportant.lawyer/post/3lybyflzgzs2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">show</a> how all the dumb shit we’re currently living through, and which boggles the minds of regular people, makes total sense if you imagine it was conjured up by the brain of a pre-teen. I had a little laugh at this theory but didn’t think about it too seriously until this weekend, when several government social media accounts got really into <em>Halo</em>.</p><p>How did we get here? On Friday, it was announced that a remake of the original <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>, called <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em>, is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-launches-on-ps5-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to the PlayStation</a> in 2026. It’s the first time the iconic Xbox series will appear on its top competitor’s platform, as Xbox moves away from the whole “<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-marketing-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being an Xbox</a>” thing into <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whatever the heck it’s trying to be now</a>. This is, on the one hand, a big deal given Halo’s place in Xbox’s identity. On the other hand, it feels like a natural evolution as console exclusivity becomes <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-playstation-ps5-exclusivity-indiana-jones-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less and less of a thing</a>.</p><p>On Saturday, retailer GameStop <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982213786221109263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted a statement</a> declaring the “official cessation of the console wars,” which it writes started with <em>Combat Evolved</em>, but that now “console loyalists are instructed to cease hostilities, disband militias, and enjoy this new era of gaming.” There’s not much to this, though you could say the language is a little cringe given <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/live-updates/israel-gaza-live-updates-search-continues-bodies-missing/?id=126889888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current events</a>; GameStop sells games, this is a joke about selling games, whatever.</p><p>But for some reason the <em>literal US government</em> has taken an interest in this thoroughly mid-tier joke. It started with the official White House account retweeting GameStop’s post with an <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">image of Trump done up in Spartan armor </a>with the GameStop slogan “Power to the players.” Why? Looking at a <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/here-s-who-s-running-trump-s-digital-offensive-de4e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">list of the chuds</a> behind the government’s social media accounts, at least one of them is probably a gamer and saw GameStop’s tweet and, I guess given Trump’s efforts to portray himself as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-venezuela-strikes-regime-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peace president</a>, thought a games retailer declaring a joke truce in a joke war would fit with that image.&nbsp;</p><p>GameStop then retweeted the White House image with an <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982654845166428607/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">image of its own</a>, showing Trump in a Spartan helmet in front of JD Vance stylized as Cortana. Except for some reason it’s <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/jd-vance-babyface-edits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">babyface Vance</a>, a meme meant to be insulting to the vice president. Is GameStop knocking Vance? Does it just want to squeeze another meme into its meme to demonstrate that, I don’t know, memes are happening?&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the official <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1982587953676247375" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">White House rapid response account</a> retweeted GameStop’s ceasefire joke with the declaration that “President Trump presides over the end of the 20-year Console Wars,” including an emoji of a dove (for peace, you see). GameStop retweeted this with <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982619455797821810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>another</em> Trump/Halo meme</a>. And then today the Department of Homeland Security–which loves to use <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-administration-dhs-white-house-deportations-meme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pop culture references</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-creative-social-media-posts-artists-brands-happy/story?id=124541747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other people’s music</a> in its memes, including <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8ex9n8gxdwo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokemon</a>–got in on the action with a graphic of a Halo warthog vehicle with the phrase “Destroy the Flood” and an exhortation to join ICE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft declined to comment.&nbsp;</p><p>What is going on here? Out of all of this, the DHS post is the only one that makes “sense:” it’s desperate and racist (Nathan described it in our Slack as “Great Replacement Theory but make it Flood”) in the way of all DHS’ posts, just the same old loser shit. But it’s all the rest of the posts that are bugging me, none of which are out of character for the people currently steering the American ship into every available iceberg, but feeling to me as uniquely nonsensical.&nbsp;</p><p>Is Trump earnest about taking credit for “ending the console wars?” Is the Rapid Response account for real that this is some kind of Trump accomplishment? I have to doubt it. So did they just see something they imagine gamers find good and think, <em>you know what else we want gamers to think is good–Trump!</em> (this despite having previously <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-suggests-video-games-blame-mass-shootings-n1039411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blamed video games</a> for mass violence) and so throw something up, assuming people reading their accounts are so stupid that if you put two ostensibly “good” things together their audience will just connect the two? This theory has weight in that we know how stupid everyone involved is, and how stupid they think everyone else is.&nbsp;</p><p>As I ranted about this to my Aftermath colleagues this morning, raising my <a href="https://aftermath.site/civil-war-middle-age" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">middle-aged man</a> blood pressure as I frantically mined for meaning in posts that will remain in the historical record long after all of us are dead, Gita reminded me of the “everyone is 12” theory. They compared these posts to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/oct/23/six-seven-meme-invades-uk-classrooms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“six seven” meme</a>, also popular with 12-year-olds: incoherent nonsense that exists solely to remind the audience that an in-group exists and you’re not in it. It’s like the “<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/white-house-wild-response-to-huffpost-question_n_68f26217e4b0ee732e24eb66" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your mom</a>” replies to reporters’ questions, juvenile and combative for no other reason than that the people giving them are allowed to be juvenile and combative now.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s all the dumbest possible exercise of power: You can post whatever you want! You can say “your mom!” at work! You can <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/the-east-wing-of-the-white-house-has-been-demolished-heres-a-look-at-its-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tear down a chunk of your house</a>! I don’t think it matters to the White House whether Trump is sincerely taking credit for <em>Halo </em>on PlayStation or not, or if there’s any kind of strategy to win over gamers with the claim. It’s just that he can say whatever he wants, and he’s far beyond the requirement of that stuff making any sense. He knows his audience will salivate over his mention of <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-stupid-do-they-think-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things they recognize</a>, even if those things are meaningless. And it’s funny to rile up people like me who don’t get it, to hint at some secret knowledge or private joke even when there’s literally nothing underneath it.&nbsp;</p><p>Many adults know the particularly embarrassing terror that grips you when you walk by a group of teens on the street and prepare to get roasted. Our whole government feels like that now, except without the ability to take a different route home, and with the roasts not being insults about our outfits but the destruction of our families, communities, social safety nets, and more.
