            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crunchyroll-says-anime%E2%80%99s-chatgpt-subtitling-came-from-third-party-vendor-goes-against-its-policies.1235613/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week sees the debut of Crunchyroll’s summer season of anime, and one of the streamer’s new lineup of shows has become the focal point of online discussion not for the content of its story, but for its subtitles, which appear to include a line explicitly mentioning ChatGPT.</p><p>On Tuesday, Bluesky user pixeldoesthings uploaded a screenshot of Cyangames’ and studio Gokumi’s VR video game-centric action anime, <em>Necronomicon and the Cosmic Horror Show</em>. In their screenshot, the lower third of the anime’s German subtitles read, “ChatGPT said:Wenn ich die Welt von hier an weiter genießen kann.” According to <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-07-01/crunchyroll-german-necronomico-and-the-cosmic-horror-show-subtitles-listed-chatgpt/.226206" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Anime News Network</em></a>, the dialogue line appears at the end of the premiere episode of the anime around its 19:12 timestamp.&nbsp;</p><p>“Beyond disappointed to find <em>Necronomico and the Cosmic Horror Show</em>'s subs on Crunchyroll are blatantly and openly ChatGPT,” pixeldoesthings wrote in the post. “This is not acceptable. How can we be expected to pay for a service that clearly doesn't care about the quality of its products?”</p><p>As <em>ANN </em>notes, as of July 2, the German subtitle line no longer includes “ChatGPT” in its subtitling; however, for many, the damage was already done. Pixeldoesit’s post has since been cross-posted from BlueSky to Twitter, leading to an outcry from anime fans wondering if the streamer was caught blatantly using ChatGPT, rather than hiring human subtitlers.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking with Aftermath, a Crunchyroll spokesperson provided an official statement this morning saying, “We were made aware that AI-generated subtitles were employed by a third-party vendor, which is in violation of our agreement. We are investigating the matter and are working to rectify the error.”</p><p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/26/24081180/crunchyroll-president-purini-anime-funimation-shutdown-sony-merger-decoder-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Verge</em></a> in February 2024, Crunchyroll President Rahul Purini mentioned that the company was experimenting with machine-learning technology to "improve and optimize [their] processes" for delivering subtitles in more languages worldwide at a faster rate compared to the original Japanese release date of seasonal anime. The following March, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24092569/crunchyroll-ai-subtitles-funimation-account-updates-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Polygon </em></a>asked whether Purini’s stance on AI had changed in the wake of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/funimations-app-will-officially-sunset-in-april" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchyroll’s merger with then-competitor Funimation</a>—a merger that led to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crunchyroll-president-responds-to-concerns-over-lost-digital-copies-due-to-funimation-merger" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan outcry over losing digital anime content they once owned on Funimation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Purini reiterated to <em>Polygon </em>that the anime company wasn’t using AI in its subtitling, despite subscriber worries over his February 2024 statement, which had hinted at the possibility that the streamer <em>would </em>implement machine-generated subtitles.</p><p>“AI is new, we are curious to see what it can do, what it cannot do, to understand it better,” Purini told <em>Polygon</em>. “Quality is of paramount importance for us, and if we find out the technology is not to the level that it can create the best subtitles we want for our fans, then we will wait until the technology gets there. And if it never gets there, then it never gets there.”</p><p>When <em>Polygon </em>asked how and when Crunchyroll might implement AI-generated subtitling and closed captioning into the company’s localization workflow, Purini declined to comment on a timeline.&nbsp;</p><p>“We still don’t know if we can get them done,” Purini said. “It’s really, really early testing so far.”&nbsp;</p><p>The widespread outrage within the anime community over obvious ChatGPT-produced subtitles for a lesser-known show highlights a long-standing concern. Many worry that, like the <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-01-23/shogakukan-releases-novelous-light-novel-manga-app-using-ai-assisted-translation-in-u.s-canada/.220391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manga</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://aftermath.site/disney-universal-midjourney-ai-lawsuit-case-copyright" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">film</a>, <a href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/ai-in-movies-tv-op-ed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TV</a>, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-ai-darth-vader-star-wars-epic-games-sag-aftra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game industries</a>, anime may also be showing signs of increasingly relying on AI for faster production and higher output.</p><p>Anime fans’ collective outrage over <em>Necronomico and the Cosmic Horror Show</em>’s ChatGPT-generated subtitles shows they recognize the vital role of human translators and localizers. After all, it's these human beings’ expert skills and training that have contributed to Crunchyroll’s lofty position as the leading platform for anime fans, not AI. And it should stay that way.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-veterans"><h3>Microsoft Layoffs Signal Video Game Industry Brain Drain</h3></a><p>Multiple industry veterans have left Xbox in the wake of layoffs</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-phil-spencer"><h3>Has Xbox Considered Laying One Person Off Instead Of Thousands</h3></a><p>None of the people being laid off were responsible for the decisions that have led to these layoffs</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-activision-blizzard-xbox-warcraft-rumble"><h3>Microsoft Layoffs Hit Blizzard, Warcraft Rumble Put On Life Support</h3></a><p>No new content for Warcraft Rumble as Blizzard departments like marketing and customer service are also impacted</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-sale-keleops-go"><h3>G/O Media Finally Sells Kotaku</h3></a><p>Kotaku has been purchased by the owners of sister site Gizmodo</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/chatgpt-crunchyroll-ai-subtitles-necronomicon]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The consequences of the <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox layoffs</a> are still trickling out, with news of canceled games and closed studios only the vaguest outline of the full effects. Among those caught in Microsoft’s latest bad decision are people with a combined over 60 years at the company, and even more years in games.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s just a handful that are known so far. Zenimax Online Studios president and <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em> director Matt Firor <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-elder-scrolls-online-director-matt-firor-who-helped-launch-zenimax-online-studios-in-2007-is-leaving-the-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced he was leaving the company</a> after “more than 18 years.” Firor has been at Zenimax Online since its <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zenimax-media-announces-establishment-of-online-gaming-division-zenimax-online-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founding in 2007</a>, long before it fell into Microsoft’s clutches in 2021. Before Zenimax, he was one of the founders of Mythic Entertainment and has <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/83290/matt-firor/credits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game credits</a> going back to the 90s.</p><p>Turn 10 design director Jon Knoles announced on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346304368750510084/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a> that he’d been caught in the layoffs, after 15 years at Xbox working on Forza games. Knoles has been in game development since <a href="https://x.com/jonk1969" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1989</a>, and told <a href="https://www.jedinews.com/interviews/articles/shadows-at-25-jon-knoles-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jedi News</a> that “I landed my first game development job at Taito Software Inc., working on [1991’s] <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em> for the 8-bit Nintendo system.” Knoles went on to work on <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/1140/jon-knoles/credits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>so many</em></a> Star Wars games, spending <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonknoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 15 years</a> at LucasArts, among other studios.</p><p>At Rare, which saw its in-development game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Everwild</em></a> canceled yesterday, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VGC</a> reports that Gregg Mayles is leaving the studio after 35 years. Mayles was working on <em>Everwild</em>, but his career at Rare started with <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/51913/gregg-mayles/credits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games</a> like <em>Donkey Kong Country, Battletoads, </em>and <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>. He served as creative director on <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, where a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2kU27giiEs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">song in the game’s soundtrack</a> is named after him. VGC also reports that executive producer Louise O’Connor will be leaving the studio; O’Connor, who was also working on <em>Everwild</em>, has been with Rare <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/louridge/details/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since 1999</a>.</p><p>The experience and talent Microsoft has just discarded is staggering, and these are only some of the people we know about so far. When Phil Spencer writes in his <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoff justification</a> that “we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted,” the people he’s speaking of weren’t just foundational to Microsoft, but to some of gaming’s earliest characters, studios, and systems. But in order for Xbox to “protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business,” those people now have to be pushed out from the industry they helped create.&nbsp;</p><p>From a hard-hearted business perspective, it makes sense to lose experienced people; they cost a lot of money! They cost a lot of money because they have a lot of experience, experience that doesn’t just contribute to the projects they’re on, but to their less experienced colleagues. This helps those colleagues, in turn, become the kind of experienced game developers Microsoft is willing to be rid of to make the line go up. Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/02/tech/microsoft-layoffs-9000-employees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broader cuts</a> have focused on axing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-layoffs-d1f2de54ebad6f099deac8fbd3375835" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managers</a> in a claim toward “<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-xbox-begins-latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-with-cuts-at-king-and-zenimax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">efficiency</a>,” but how efficient is it to brain drain your company?</p><p>These days, early-career and experienced game developers alike can’t keep their jobs, and up-and-coming developers can’t enter the industry if there’s no jobs available. Game development isn’t alone in this; we’re seeing similar things happen in <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-shield-mini-room-television" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TV</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-media-journalism-layoffs-gamurs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journalism</a>, among other fields. What happens to these industries when basically no one can work in them? How does Microsoft, or any company, plan to make the games it claims its layoffs are in service of when <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-industry-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no one is left to make them</a>? Where do laid-off people go, and what happens when newcomers are competing for a handful of jobs against people with <em>decades</em> of experience? This whole thing sucks.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chatgpt-crunchyroll-ai-subtitles-necronomicon"><h3>Crunchyroll Says Anime’s ChatGPT Subtitling Came From Third-Party Vendor, Goes Against Its Policies</h3></a><p>Cyangames’ VR video game anime Necronomicon and the Cosmic Horror Show subtitles had “ChatGPT” smack-dap in its German subtitling
