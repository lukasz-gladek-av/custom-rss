            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/elon-musk-treasury-protest-diablo-path-of-exile-cheating<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today hundreds convened outside the United States Department of the Treasury in Washington DC to oppose Elon Musk’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teenager-powered takeover of the federal government</a>, a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/josephcox.bsky.social/post/3lhequawfvk2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brazenly illegal</a> smash and grab meant to irreparably damage what remains of the country’s infrastructure and turn its carcass over to private sector looters. But the overwhelming din of extra-legal noise didn’t stop one protester from focusing on the real matter at hand.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/climatebrad.hillheat.com/post/3lhf4iz2gc22f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">captured</a> by Brad Johnson of <a href="https://hillheat.news/subscribe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Hill Heat newsletter</a>, a brave soul called attention to a truth that threatens to get buried by the impending fall of our nation: Elon Musk cheats at video games. Specifically <em>Diablo </em>– in which many suspect him of spending real money to enlist the services of a “booster” to grind his character gear, levels, and rank for him – but also <em>Path of Exile</em>, where he was caught even more red-handed, prompting <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/29/elon-musk-video-games-diablo-path-exile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an eventual confession last month</a>.</p><p>This is fitting, considering that Musk has only one real ability, and it is not "intelligence" – <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3lhcfk62z7k2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whatever that means</a> – or even engineering, which he claims to be a generational talent at despite <a href="https://observationalepidemiology.blogspot.com/2018/06/elon-musk-is-terrible-engineer-and-why.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidence to</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/14/23458247/elon-musk-fires-engineer-correcting-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the contrary</a>. Instead, the man excels solely at finding loopholes in systems meant to maintain some semblance of order and ruthlessly exploiting them for his own gain. What he did in games and business before he is now doing to the government, because he's spent a lifetime achieving certainty that nobody will stop him.</p><p>He's remarkably bad at everything else, though. Next somebody needs to take to the streets with a sign that lambasts his <a href="https://aftermath.site/does-elon-musks-gaming-rig-suck-or-not" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dire gaming setup</a>. Either that or just carry around one of those weird vampire candles he was using to light his room for a minute. If that doesn’t at least irk him, he truly has no shame.</p><p>In the meantime, if you’re the person who made this sign, feel free to get in touch. You’re doing important work.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-howl-soulslike-dark-souls-deckbuilder"><h3>Death Howl Nails The Dark Souls Vibes</h3></a><p>More than just bonfires and difficult combat, Death Howl's world is ominous and evocative.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tell-me-about-your-favorite-niche-simulator"><h3>Tell Me About Your Favorite Niche Simulator</h3></a><p>There is still some joy in this world, probably</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
