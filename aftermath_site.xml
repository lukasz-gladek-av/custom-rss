            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/summer-games-fest-website-geoff-keighley-polygon-palestine<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Summer Geoff Fest is less than a month away, and you know what that means: It is once again time to turn our attention to <a href="http://summergamesfest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summergamesfest.com</a>, a URL of a common typo – the event is for some reason called Summer <em>Game </em>Fest, not Summer Games Fest – with a mysterious owner and <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-games-fest-website-geoff-keighley-taco" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a half-decade-long history of activism and cheese puffs</a>. This year, it’s looking a little different than last year.</p><p>As of this publishing, the URL redirects to <a href="https://haunts.neocities.org/polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Neocities page</a> that pays respects to Polygon and implores visitors to support both independent media – including Aftermath dot site – and laid-off Polygon writers, linking to their profiles as well as <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-polygon-workers-and-the-vox-media-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Vox Media Union’s GoFundMe</a> for them.</p><p>“I don't work in the games industry and don't even really play video games (aside from neopets),” the Polygon support page’s creator, a comic illustrator named Kaylee Rowena, wrote in a disclaimer on the page. “I've just enjoyed the work of folks at Polygon for many years &amp; want to give them some support and solidarity where I can. Workers of the world unite.”</p><p>But what has the mysterious owner of the summergamesfest.com URL, who did <em>not </em>make the Polygon support page, been up to for the past year? That’s where things get a little weirder. When we last checked in on summergamesfest.com during June of 2024, it redirected to <a href="https://donate.unrwa.org/int/en/gaza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a donation page</a> from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Based on a scant few Wayback Machine snapshots, it appears to have stayed this way for the whole summer.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, in September 2024, for at least a couple days, the summergamesfest.com URL began redirecting to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/insiderthre.at/post/3l3tsgqcxbf2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Bluesky post</a> from Epic Games senior trust and safety investigations manager Bruce Knapik that reads “Bet you thought I was joking.” There is no further context for this comment; it follows a seemingly <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/insiderthre.at/post/3l3mbbfq4il26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unrelated post about pro wrestling</a> and precedes <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/insiderthre.at/post/3l4cta4xw7d22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a> about Bluesky informing Knapik that he was the platform’s 850,339th user. They are all days apart.&nbsp;</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Knapik to ask the obvious question: Are you the person who owns the URL?</p><p>“[If I remember correctly] I linked to that post as an accompaniment to a bullet point of ‘webmaster of summergamesfest.com’ on an introduce-yourself-to-the-team presentation at work,” Knapik told Aftermath. “But yeah, that’s me.”&nbsp;</p><p>Knapik explained that he snapped up the URL in 2020, around an hour after Keighley went live with the name of his now-ubiquitous E3 replacement.&nbsp;</p><p>"At that time, I was on a spree of registering goofy domains,” Knapik said, “and it just happened I was prescient enough to think '[the name of the event] should maybe be games.'"&nbsp;</p><p>(He’s right! It should be “games!” I’ve spoken to high-profile industry figures who still accidentally call it Summer Games Fest! Because there is more than one game!)</p><p>Occasional pre-orchestrated bits such as a short-lived <a href="https://x.com/giantbomb/status/1668787755114012672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaboration with Giant Bomb</a> last year aside, Knapik has mostly just enjoyed causing random online passersby to stumble into oddball humor and, at the other end of the spectrum, legitimately important causes.</p><p>"Overall, it’s just been a sounding board for silliness or things I think it would be nice if people stumbled onto/knew about,” he said. “It’s nice to have that kind of… megaphone? When you feel strongly about, and have a high degree of confidence in, your convictions.”</p><p>Despite the joy summergamesfest.com has brought Knapik, he would sell it to Geoff Keighley if approached with a “reasonable” offer.</p><p>"I think I’ve managed to keep the jokes in good fun – and avoid any actual brand confusion – so I don’t think he’d feel a heavy desire to go out of his way to make [an offer],” said Knapik. “No one’s ever attempted to actually contact me about it, to my knowledge.”</p><p>But if the right wealthy and/or evil benefactor came along, he would at least consider it.</p><p>"I’d probably never sell it to anyone but Geoff,” said Knapik, “but who knows what I’d say if a dipshit loser offered me $44 billion to let him kill it and use its corpse for fascist ventriloquism."&nbsp;</p><p>Many assumed that the original images on the summergamesfest.com page, variations on a plate of cheese puffs and a Dorito-orange taco shell with what <em>appeared </em>to be a hotdog in it, were a veiled reference to Keighley’s pre-Game Awards <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dorito-pope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Dorito Pope” legacy</a>. But that is, in fact, not the case.</p><p>"The original images were part of a triptych I made for an extremely narrow joke, where I pre-empted the weekly 'Friday Food Facts!' local food news email that Epic’s office manager would send and sent one with an identical subject line just to [another Epic employee],” Knapik said.</p><p>Also, it’s not a hot dog.</p><p>"The taco shell contains a Beddar With Cheddar sausage," Knapik said. "I expect a retraction of last year’s – to be frank (ugh), libelous – assertion it was a 'hot dog.'"</p><p>We regret the error.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/thunderbolts-marvel-avengers-cube-escape-room"><h3>Thunderbolts* Could Have Been Marvel’s Cube</h3></a><p>It could have been an escape room movie starring Florence Pugh, but we got New Avengers instead
