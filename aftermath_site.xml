            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paul Thomas Anderson’s nearly three hour long Pynchon-adjacent revolutionary drama <em>One Battle After Another</em> is a hit. We here at Aftermath give it our stamp of approval and recommend you see it in the most elaborately large format you can. Isaiah and Chris sat down to chat about what they liked.</p><p>(This article contains some spoilers for <em>One Battle After Another</em>)</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>So, as someone who just watched their first Paul Thomas Anderson film a couple weeks prior in <em>There Will Be Blood</em>, I didn't walk into<em> One Battle After Another </em>with any grand expectations like the rest of the general public. All I knew is it starred Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor, and Benicio del Toro. Assuming you've got more familiarity with PTA, how'd the film measure up for you? Spoilers for me: I rated it a rare five stars on Letterboxd.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="One Battle After Another - Official Trailer 2 - Warner Bros. UK &amp; Ireland" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rNLrWQ4HtY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Chris</strong>: Oh wow, I'm happy for you. You got a ton of great PTA films to watch. I went to film school and so it was kind of impossible to avoid the man's work. <em>Phantom Thread </em>is one of my favorite movies, and he's unimpeachably good with the exception of <em>Licorice Pizza, </em>which exactly half of my friends hated vehemently. He was "working some stuff out" with that one.&nbsp;</p><p>For people who have not seen the movie, <em>One Battle After Another</em> is an incredibly loose adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's <em>Vineland</em>. Anderson had previously adapted <em>Inherent Vice, </em>which I love, but a lot of people slid off of it. I think he made the right call here because it diverges a lot from the novel.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Ah, didn't know it was based on a book! I wonder if that'll explain some ick feelings I've been seeing from folks. But yeah, the movie---in the barest of terms, follows DiCaprio as a former revolutionary and single father. After roughly 16 years, a military dude played by Sean Penn is back on the hunt for him, putting DiCaprio and his daughter in the crosshairs of a messy (to put it lightly) family drama with a city-wide ICE raid taking place in the background. I basically walked out of the film with the burning thought to add it and <a href="https://aftermath.site/eddington-ari-aster-covid-movie-pedro-pascal-joaquin-phoenix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Eddington</em></a><em> </em>to a time capsule watchlist about how our current administration sucks.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: I agree, although I like it way more than <em>Eddington </em>for reasons that would take too long to get into.</p><p>In the movie, Bob&nbsp; (DiCaprio) is a former member of the French 75, which is pretty notably rooted in radical Black politics. His lover, Perfidia Beverly Hills (Teyana Taylor) sexually humiliates Steven J. Lockjaw (Penn) who becomes obsessed with Perfidia, and this sexual obsession becomes much of the motivating factor in tracking down Bob and his daughter Charlene.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: The movie from there is an extended game of cat and mouse as Bob looks for his daughter while Lockjaw tries to kill Bob and track her down. In the midst of all that, Lockjaw is terrorizing this small town and Del Toro's Sensei Sergio helps organize folks to circumvent ICE.</p><p>He's the coolest guy ever.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Chris</strong>: He's so sick, man. He's so cool he momentarily sells drunk driving as being cool.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: I've never seen a film so successfully advertise Modelo. Like every scene Sergio is on sight offering Bob a four pack of beer to help calm down their very stressful situation.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: I believe in the original he's a fucked up DEA agent, but in this he's like a guy who's a karate instructor but secretly the most competent guy he knows. It's really hard to watch this movie and not force analogues from P.T. Anderson's life. <em>Phantom Thread </em>is a wife guy movie, and both that movie and this feel indebted to his marriage to Maya Rudolph, who herself mostly grew up not knowing her mother, Minnie Riperton.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. I only knew him as the guy folks confuse for Milla Jovovich's husband.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: Also a wife guy director, but in a totally different way.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: I liked the film a lot. It had that kind of riding the line of being funny and stressful in equal measure with some sick-ass camera work. Which, I guess, should go without saying. Folks were clowning on the IMAX poster just being of a road instead of the cliche floating head poster. After seeing the film, they're 100 percent justified in doing so. I've never been more stressed at a camera pointed at a road in my life.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: I saw it in VistaVision, which is a very weird format from the 50s that they revived for <em>The Brutalist</em> where you flip the 35mm negative sideways to get more resolution. The film broke halfway through the screening and I saw a lot of people report similar things, but it looks FANTASTIC.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p>It is fascinating how current the movie feels. The setting that Anderson uses is a little wonky and surreal on purpose, a little unmoored in time. It envisions a world with a more radical politics than ours (closer to groups in the 70s), but the depiction of fascist ICE agents is just what I see every single day when I look at my phone. It feels like this was pitched last week.</p><p>Sean Penn puts in a deranged performance, I was in awe.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Wrestling circles are basically in agreement that Penn could play Vince McMahon in a biopic should Hollywood want one. The teeth sucking grossed me, out but that weird waddle of his is vintage Mr. McMahon.</p><p>On that note, there’s one plot point related to him I have a point of contention with if we're good to lightly dive into <strong>some spoilers</strong>.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: He does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLBUd3r1y3I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Vince walk</a>! And also yes.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: The major thrust of the film is that Bob and Perfidia are very sexually active. Like, will fuck in the middle of setting off a bomb sexual. But all of that plays out after an encounter where Perfidia humiliates Lockjaw basically making him get an erection at gunpoint while rescuing folks in an ICE encampment. This domino effects into him being obsessed with her and coercing her into sex lest Lockjaw ruin their whole operation. Hence the family drama element of Perfidia not really liking her daughter Willa, walking out on Bob, and eventually ratting on the French 75.</p><p>The rest of the movie's whole chase is basically <em>Maury</em> with the parentage of Willa being in the balance.</p><p>While I found all that drama pretty engrossing, some folks felt that part of the film was off the mark.&nbsp; Basically,<em> One Battle After Another </em>doesn't leave any Black women looking good by the end of it. It's not something I actively thought about while watching it, but I did find the movie routinely being like "kinfolk will sell you out when push comes to shove" to be something worth picking apart. Not necessarily something the movie interrogates, but an interesting aspect of the film nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p>I was wondering, since this is based on a book, if that was an element PTA directly adapted or if this is a case of PTA not being as tapped in to things that give Black folks the ick.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: Yeah, I do agree that there's something really hard to watch about Perfidia's character, and I've seen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/29/jezebels-race-kink-and-cardi-b-in-one-bat[%E2%80%A6]ther-black-women-are-still-stereotypes-paul-thomas-anderson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people echo that statement</a>. I think you're meant to sort of stew in what she did and why she did it, like her identity is meant to be a thing that Willa has to grapple with, but it comes off weird.</p><p>There's a part where Junglepussy (played by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglepussy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rapper of the same name)</a> says "this is some <em>Set It Off </em>shit" in the middle of a robbery, and it's hard not to see him borrowing heavily from that movie.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Set It Off (1996) Trailer | Jada Pinkett Smith | Queen Latifah" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkPAxsN9wQA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>A big theme of this movie is how the fascist state forces people to turn on each other, to inform, to name names. It happens again and again in the movie, but the movement persists. It's a movie that feels indebted to movies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Cercle_Rouge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Red Circle</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_Is_Over_(1966_film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The War Is Over</em></a>, about the intricacies of resistance, but the difference is it's largely meant to be a hopeful message. And I think a running theme is that even if you were complicit with the way the world is, how do you make things right?</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Yeah, the film to me didn't necessarily embellish in fetishizing Black women more than play up how people who do so are fucking weird. Kinda in the way that it would make Black people laugh watching all the shit go down with Lockjaw being both cartoony and realistically racist. I think the film also dresses that with its weird underground coven of white racists in the Christmas Adventurers Club. Still, I can see why folks aren't so hot on Black women getting the short end of the stick in tandem with revolutionaries seeming incompetent.</p><p>Basically everyone not involved with Sensei comes off as a group of washed revolutionaries or folks who are more likely to rat each other out when the going got tough. There's probably more to that, but I found that to be more interesting than something to necessarily find fault in being represented in the film. I don't necessarily need <em>One Battle After Another</em> to neatly package my politics. If it did, I'd feel more pandered to than anything. So I found even that messiness to be a quality to the film in a way.</p><p>Shit happens, people make decisions, and sometimes those are more about self preservation than true allyship. As a nonbinary person, Charlene's nonbinary friend ultimately selling her out was something I leaned forward in my chair from then threw my hands up at. I think filmmakers are at their best when they make those kinds of interesting choices that provoke conversation instead of feeling like a laminated, mass-produced, people-pleasing, cathartic affair.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Yeah, and there's this implicit element there of their nonbinary friend being the highest risk.</p><p>Related to Lockjaw's weird pathology, I had to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mass_Psychology_of_Fascism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Mass Psychology of Fascism</em></a> when I <a href="https://aftermath.site/psycho-patrol-r-early-access-impressions-review-cruelty-squad-consumer-softproducts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviewed <em>Psycho Patrol R</em> </a>and the one part where Wilhelm Reich (who was a crank) was really cooking is his idea that fascism is the sum of irrational thoughts, and that racism stems from fascism and sexual dysfunction, and that's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3llfuiymlzk2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">basically just describing Sean Penn's whole character</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I like how nobody in The Christmas Adventurers Club knows how to talk normally; they all have these weird ways of phrasing shit. Fascism is that cartoonishly evil, these people really do exist and they are currently in charge of the government. And to your point about ambiguity, I think the part that haunts me the most is the tracker Avanti played by Eric Schweig, who gives this incredible, understated performance.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p>Also, this movie is fucking FUNNY.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Yeah, I was worried when the online chatter from legacy pubs likened DiCaprio's performance to <em>The Big Lebowski </em>but that's entirely fitting. Him basically being the inverse, less a fish out of water thrown into a whole ordeal and more a guy trying his best, was a good bit. I tend to have a better time with movies that don't take themselves too painfully seriously, so <em>One Battle After Another</em> injecting some humor to break up the crushing tension of the film is great. Didn't think PTA would have a good eye for directing that, but seeing as how one of the funniest bits in <em>There Will Be Blood</em> was the whole milkshake scene, it shouldn't surprise me that he had a comedic eye too. High key, not enough folks talk about the actually funniest scene, where Paul Dano talks about God failing to alert him to the recent panic of our economy.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> He does not get enough credit for being funny, I think so often of Phiip Seymour Hoffman in <em>The Master</em> saying "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Roy_KV1WK8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you already know the answers to your questions then why ask PIG FUCK</a>?"&nbsp;</p><p>I also love that DiCaprio is like a revolutionary from another era: He sucks at doing the reading, he does not know how modern society works, but he never stops trying or caring. The scene with his daughter's nonbinary friend could have easily gone off the rails, but it's saved by him being like ‘look, I'm just trying to be POLITE.’</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Exactly! I'm not one of those folks saying it's his best performance to date or anything, but it's nice to see that this wasn't a film he seemed to be sleepwalking through doing his usual crashouts at things happening around him. Film had heart and it did so without really centering him as a blanket savior but with Willa reckoning with her place in this fucked-up world.</p><p>Also, fun fact, I discovered that her actor, <a href="https://x.com/ColumbiaChi/status/1970172755510251534?t=m6zWisMryBRmfUh5Gv8oDg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chase Infiniti</a>, actually graduated a year after me at Columbia College Chicago. Very wild stuff I'll be sure to use as bragging rights in every cinephile circle I'll frequent in the near future. Makes me wonder if I crossed her in the halls or nearly missed each other during Zoom classes for the few film courses I took there. She was great.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris</strong>: What could have been...</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: She strikes me as a fellow Devil Dawgs frequenter. Her name being a mix of inspiration from <em>Toy Story</em>'s "To infinity and beyond” and Nicole Kidman’s Chase Meridian in <em>Batman Forever</em> is <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/chase-infiniti-interview-one-battle-after-another-1236366095/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most gen-z thing anyone will ever hear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: Goddddd. Yeah, you're right.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Hopefully it'll be her star-making performance in the years to come.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: Yeah she is the breakout here, and like the heart of the movie.&nbsp;</p><p>In a movie of messy characters she is one of the few with her head on straight. She does not need her dad to save her or her mom to come out of hiding and that's the point. Despite the limitations of what her parents could give her, Bob's heroism is fundamentally in instilling a moral compass in her even when she has to raise herself. In her heart she wants to be the version of her mom that she was raised on. And that's the thing about kids– you hope that they live up in a better world, to be what you wanted to be, and not make the mistakes that you made.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: And at the end of the day, that's really the <em>One Battle After Another</em>, isn't it? Overcoming generational trauma. That and trying to live in a world that abhors your very existence.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/airpods-pro-3-review-heartrate-v-shaped-sound"><h3>The AirPods Pro 3 Are Everything I Wanted, And They’re Crucially Flawed</h3></a><p>The AirPods Pro 3 are a generational leap in technology, kneecapped by Apple’s showy tuning and hubris.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/one-battle-after-another-review-aftercha]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-sound-design-maxi-boch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-does-it-sound-like-to-slide-down-a-breast-milk-river-ask-baby-steps-sound-designer-maxi-boch.1315201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rhythm is important in <em>Baby Steps</em>. If you’re to get Nate—the playable man-child in Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and Bennett Foddy’s latest game—anywhere, you’re going to need to find your rhythm. Fiddling with a controller’s triggers, walking up, around, and through <em>Baby Step</em>’s many obstacles is not easy. But it <em>is</em> possible, and made all the more satisfying by the game’s dynamic sound design that creates music from both nature and the way in which Nate interacts with the world.</p><p>Maxi Boch, <em>Baby Step</em>’s sound designer, developer, and designer, told Aftermath it was an “intense undertaking” for her and her team (DJ and producer Ashe Kilbourne and game designer and composer Jack Schesigner).&nbsp;</p><p>“The music of <em>Baby Steps</em> is also walking this uncanny divide—it is made entirely of sounds of nature and the player’s interaction with the world, but is sequenced and rhythmic in a truly human way,” she said.</p><p>The wind blowing, a phone ringing, and a seagull’s incessant squawking becomes music set to Nate’s muddy footsteps and belabored grunting. In an interview with Aftermath, Boch spoke about her approach to sound design for a game that’s outside the bounds of reality—like creating sounds for Nate falling down a breast milk river.&nbsp;</p><p><em>[Ed. note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.]</em></p><figure></figure><p><strong>Aftermath: What role does sound design play in creating the world of </strong><strong><em>Baby Step</em></strong><strong>s?</strong></p><p><strong>Maxi Boch: </strong>The world of <em>Baby Steps</em> is split between intense commitments to reality &amp; fidelity and joyful embrace of the unique unrealities of video games. Sound in games is essential to creating a unique and pleasurable game feel, and I see my job as trying to make everything the player does as juicy and detailed and pleasurable from a low level interaction standpoint, even if that means going for hyper reality, so that the player can find joy in just touching stuff and&nbsp; exploring the world.&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, we try to bring a robust materiality to every interaction so that the ground you are walking on, tripping on, or falling over/sliding down. When you swim in <em>Baby Steps</em>, we model the displacement of water and play differential sounds depending on whether your feet break the surface of the water, whether you are displacing water (what we call a “slosh”) or pressing against it (a “splash”). There are 31 unique surface sounds in babysteps, and with each step, we are usually blending between two different surface sounds to arrive at a super-unique sounding step. If your foot scuffs a rock, then slides past some dirt and onto a moss-covered rock, we play a scuff that is tailored to the length of your contact with that rock, then layer in a custom slide sound that fades between dirt and and moss and rock, culminating in that unique step sound blending moss and rock in a way that the player has likely never heard before and will never hear again. The result is that the player doesn’t hear footstep sound effects, instead they start to believe the terrain is real, which makes the extremely tough and purposely difficult challenges feel somehow more fair.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>So with every slide down a breast milk river there is a bit of the “ahhh” sound that I make after swallowing something refreshing, and with every step a bit of me gulping, lending a truly surreal sonic experience.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure><p>The world of <em>Baby Steps</em> is a magical place where you can survive a fall from any height. But when you fall, we don’t want the kind of visceral, bone-breaking sounds that one might expect from an enormous tumble. Instead, we play up the slapstick nature of the fall with clattering sound effects that are detailed and complex to the point of silliness, bringing a jovial quality to the inevitable failures you’ll encounter in <em>Baby Steps</em>. Likewise with Nate’s yelling—we have a forthcoming feature where when Nate starts yelling he won’t ever stop, like his lungs just have infinite capacity for wailing and whining.&nbsp;</p><p>But when you slide down a river of breast milk, what the hell do we do given that commitment to reality? That’s where we roll up our sleeves and try to come up with bizarre sound combinations that would never exist in the real world. So with every slide down a breast milk river there is a bit of the “ahhh” sound that I make after swallowing something refreshing, and with every step a bit of me gulping, lending a truly surreal sonic experience.&nbsp;</p><p>None of that would be possible without a super performant low level audio system, because, as a physics game, we also have to be hitch free. So Jack’s work making our audio system super tight and performant, and coming in at a late hour and porting all of the work over to a new frame work, was truly indispensable in achieving this design.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>How did you build and implement the dynamic sound system in </strong><strong><em>Baby Steps</em></strong><strong>, something that adjusts to what’s happening in game?</strong></p><p>Likewise with nature sounds: the music of <em>Baby Steps</em> is also walking this uncanny divide—it is made entirely of sounds of nature and the player’s interaction with the world, but is sequenced and rhythmic in a truly human way.&nbsp;</p><p>Building a system like this is an intense undertaking. We have found that the nature sounds, given that they exist in a space outside of any particular tonal or tempered music (has no scale or key or anything like that), have the unique quality of being able to be broadly interpreted by players according to their play experience and mood.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>This allows us to sidestep the emotionally prescriptive feel that scoring can sometimes have, like when the “it’s time to cry” music comes on.</p></blockquote></figure><p><em>Baby Steps </em>has no particular rules or boundaries enforced, so it’s difficult for us to know when a particular moment is going to be high pressure or emotional for the player—they could’ve decided to climb an almost unclimbable rock and we don’t really have a good way of knowing as much. But players report the birds and animals in the game as either encouraging, or taunting, or celebrating them, depending on their context. This is beautiful to me, and allows us to sidestep the emotionally prescriptive feel that scoring can sometimes have, like when the “it’s time to cry” music comes on.</p><p><strong>What's your approach to actually recording the different sounds that make up the sound design?</strong></p><p>We are a tiny team and don’t have the resources to do a lot of our own recording with regard to surfaces, wildlife, etc. I have sourced an enormous amount of recordings from a wide variety of pro and independent sources, and worked with Ashe to process them all and get them sounding cohesive. Additionally, we run an enormous amount of analysis to each sound, so that we can understand what tempo is a natural fit for that individual sound, and how that sound compares to the others within the same cue (collection of sounds that come from the same animal, plant, etc.) That way, we can build layouts for our Ableton Live patches where similar sounds are mapped to similar locations on our midi controllers. </p><p>This lets us build cool call and response repetition style patterns without actually repeating the same sound over and over again, lending that sense of both reality and impossibility to the memorable animal and bird “hooks” that appear throughout the game and in our trailers. With few exceptions, every animal sound sequenced into songs in the game has been performed by me on an Ableton Push controller, so that it is not robotically gridded and has that looser feel that helps sell the illusion &amp; adds to the groovy musicality.</p><figure><blockquote><p> We transition between intense percussive mixes when you are falling to insect-driven percussion when you’re ambling about</p></blockquote></figure><p>We can also make real-time swaps to other similar sounds if we know the player has heard a particular sound a lot. Our intention is to make the player first question whether there is a music system at all, as if they’re just maybe imaging it, but then they start to realize there is truly a chorus of natural sounds accompanying their gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>We also love intense percussive sound effects, and originally the music design was full of those, but over time we saw the songs messing with the player’s ability to hear their own footsteps. That led us to creating insect mixes of all of the tracks—Ashe headed up that conversion—and now we transition between intense percussive mixes when you are falling to insect-driven percussion when you’re ambling about, which leaves the low end and low mids free for players to be able to hear themselves walk.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>What have you learned from your previous works that you brought with you to the sound design of </strong><strong><em>Baby Steps</em></strong><strong>?</strong></p><p>Tons! But mostly a sense of how to do it well, and what I’m interested in as a sound designer. My work at Harmonix definitely gave us the production acumen and sense of the value of tools to be able to build something this big and ambitious. <em>Baby Steps</em> does take some things from the learnings of<em> Ape Out</em>, like the value of simplifying complex player inputs to 0-1 ranges to control musical intensity—but is largely oppositional to that sound design’s procedurality, viscerality and violence. <em>Baby Steps</em> has songs with predictable, intentional structure, and we’ll be releasing them in the form of a soundtrack with a list of actual songs.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also some traditional musical compositions in the game, but I won’t spoil those for you! I’ll just say that it was wonderful to be able to share the work I have been doing in regard to voice training with the world.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/one-battle-after-another-review-aftercha"><h3>One Battle After Another Is An Instant Classic That Plays Fast And Loose With Its Politics&nbsp;</h3></a><p>One Battle After Another is an instant popcorn classic that explores the murky, ugly side of revolution and the sexual hangups of fascism.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/airpods-pro-3-review-heartrate-v-shaped-sound"><h3>The AirPods Pro 3 Are Everything I Wanted, And They’re Crucially Flawed</h3></a><p>The AirPods Pro 3 are a generational leap in technology, kneecapped by Apple’s showy tuning and hubris.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-sound-design-maxi-boch]]></content:encoded>
