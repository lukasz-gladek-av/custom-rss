            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-caroline-kwan-california-firefighters-twitch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As wildfires rage across southern California, displacing thousands and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/california-fires-winds-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killing 24</a> as of this publishing, the state draws on the labor of <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/5081791-incarcerated-firefighters-join-california-wildfire-battle-efforts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 1,000 incarcerated firefighters</a> to help quell the blaze. Over the weekend, Twitch streamers Hasan Piker and Caroline Kwan <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2350601305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed a crew of those firefighters</a> in person, who revealed, among other things, that they are <a href="https://x.com/HasanabiProd/status/1878270180616200647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hideously underpaid</a> and that simple pleasures like video games help make their lives more bearable. This led to <a href="https://x.com/DmachineXClut/status/1878289541825695920" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a call for video game donations</a> from well-meaning Piker fans and collaborators. In the days following, they have “inundated” that specific fire camp, <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/washington-ridge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Washington Ridge #44</a>, with video games. But there are still other ways you can help out.</p><p>Speaking with Aftermath, a representative of Washington Ridge #44 noted that the streamers’ conversation with incarcerated firefighters had a big impact. The camp is now swimming in games for its PlayStation 4.</p><p>"We've been inundated with calls on that, and we've got all we need here,” the representative told Aftermath. “Donations are always welcome, but be careful as to what type of things are donated to a camp. I mean, ping-pong paddles and pool sticks and stuff like that are fine, but then you get into video games and stuff, and then you get inundated. We don't have the capability or the need for all that stuff."&nbsp;</p><p>But Washington Ridge #44 is just one camp, and <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/camps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there are 36 in total</a> under the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s umbrella – all of which have contributed at least one strike team to the wildfire-fighting effort, according to the Washington Ridge #44 rep. Aftermath called several to get details on their specific needs.</p><p><a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/alder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alder #20</a> has an Xbox (version unspecified), and a rep added that “We only have so many TVs,” so the camp is “pretty set” on games for now. But, he continued, it’s “one break away from not having one.” He noted, for example, that $7,000 in gym equipment succumbed to the ravages of wear and tear after just a month, so there’s no guarantee that game consoles will remain functional indefinitely. All this in mind, if you’ve got a spare Xbox, feel free to <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/alder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">send it</a>.</p><p>Those incarcerated at <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/deadwood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadwood #23</a>, like their counterparts at Washington Ridge #44, have access to a PS4, and they’re “always looking for games,” according to a representative of the facility. The only restriction is that games have to be playable offline. Otherwise, games of any age rating are fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/growlersburg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Growlersburg #33</a> is also “good” on games, while <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/norco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Norco #0</a> and <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/cuesta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cuesta #24</a> use a different system than all the other camps, going through the CDCR instead of fielding donations directly. The big takeaway? If you’d like to send your spare games – or anything else – to incarcerated firefighters, call ahead. Each facility has different needs, and you want to be sure your donations are reaching their intended recipients.</p><p>There’s also the option to donate money to incarcerated firefighters either via <a href="https://x.com/PplsCityCouncil/status/1878270113637351864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">organizations like the Anti-Recidivism Coalition</a> or to specific individuals by way of JPAY <a href="https://x.com/kelswizzIe/status/1878517378855915860" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if you can find their information online</a>. These people are saving lives for pocket change, and yet they face a future in which they might be <a href="https://www.knkx.org/2024-07-05/incarcerated-people-who-helped-fight-wildfires-struggle-to-build-a-career-post-prison" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied a proper, adequately-compensated job</a> doing the exact same thing after they’ve served their time. They’ve more than earned whatever you can give.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/california-wildfires-ces-generative-ai-nvidia-google"><h3>What Are We Even Doing Here?</h3></a><p>Wildfires rage in California while, one state over, tech giants brag about adding AI to everything</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
