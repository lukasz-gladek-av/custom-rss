      <p>On this week's Aftermath Hours, Chris, Riley, and Gita raise our heads above the water of Aftermath’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-relaunch-announcement/" rel="noreferrer">relaunched website</a> to talk, excitingly, about things that aren’t relaunching a website. To start, Chris and Gita talk about the movie <em>Bugonia</em>, a remake of 2003’s <em>Save the Green Planet</em>. We talk about how it’s different from the original, for better and worse, and what it says about class, society, and whether or not humanity is a failed experiment.</p><p>Then we talk about <em>Breaking Bad</em> creator Vince Gilligan’s new Apple TV show <a href="https://aftermath.site/pluribus-is-an-apocalypse-story-for-people-who-go-to-therapy/" rel="noreferrer"><em>Pluribus</em></a><em>.</em> We’re a bit divided on it, with some of us liking the tough exterior of its main character and others not quite sold yet. We discuss where we hope the show goes–no “Carol learns to love,” please!--and, if the point of art is to communicate with others, whether or not art can exist in the show’s world.</p><p>Last, Chris pitches us all on how great <em>Lumines Arise </em>is before we move on to the mailbag, where we appreciate the newly-announced <a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-machine-steam-frame-steam-controller-good-choices/" rel="noreferrer">Steam Machine</a>, discuss what games it should launch with, and talk about where we find a respite from staring at the news all day. </p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.
