            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Front Mission 3</em>, an absolutely <em>classic </em>tactical RPG, is getting a remake. And it looks like complete dogshit.</p><p>Cullen Black over on <em>RPGSite</em> has a copy of the remake--the original was released on the PS1 in 1999--<a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/17799-you-need-to-see-front-mission-3-remakes-redone-network-graphics-photograph" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and has shared a bunch of images</a> showing the various ways Megapixel Studios SA, the remake's developers, have "decided to feed all of the game's original 2D art assets into some form of upscale algorithm to clean them up, sometimes dramatically altering the content of the original image".</p><p>He's not kidding! While some of the more harmless examples include regular remake/remaster suspects like upscaled character portraits looking weird, there are far more egregious alterations here, like this image of a wrecked wanzer (a mech in the <em>Front Mission</em> universe), which in the original on the left clearly had legs and guns, but in the remake on the right is now...a crashed Eschercopter:</p><figure><figcaption>Front Mission 3 / RPGSite</figcaption></figure><p>Or this briefing screen, which in the original (left) was clearly illustrating a wireframe schematic, but in the remake (right) is now a maze you see printed on the back of a family restaurant's menu:</p><figure><figcaption>Front Mission 3 / RPGSite</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering about the rest of the game, a trailer was posted earlier today showing extensive gameplay footage, and nearly every comment is complaining about how certain animations or sound effects have been cut (or replaced with worse versions).</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FRONT MISSION 3: Remake || 15-minutes Gameplay" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBb9-DJ8I-c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This sucks! I know it's not as convenient as playing it on the Switch, but if you want to play this game as it was originally intended,<a href="https://www.retrogames.cc/psx-games/front-mission-3.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> you should just play the original</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-sexual-exploitation-of-children-lawsuit-safety"><h3>Roblox Accused Of Allowing Sexual Exploitation In Four Separate Lawsuits</h3></a><p>All four — and more reportedly incoming, lawyers say — are filed by the same law firm</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/front-mission-3-ai-remake-art]]></content:encoded>
