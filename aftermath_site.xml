      <p>Toys? Sweaters? Those are gifts of Christmas Past. You should take a look around at the state of the world, at tariffs and shipping costs for material goods, and consider giving a gift that can be enjoyed by anyone on the planet, wherever they are and however they use the internet.</p><p>I'm of course talking about an Aftermath gift subscription, which can be purchased <a href="https://aftermath.site/gift-subscription/" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and will grant the lucky recipient a whole year of access at our 'Member' tier, which lets them read every blog, score an invite to our community Discord, unlocks merch discounts and even includes a link to their own full-text RSS feed of the site.</p><p>As an added bonus, the money spent on the subscription will also go toward supporting Aftermath's full-time staff, contributors and freelancers, allowing us to continue the access-free, no-bullshit work you've come to expect from a worker-owned, reader-supported website. </p><p><strong>Note 1</strong>: To have the subscription delivered on a specific day, make sure to select the desired 'Start Date' on the purchase form. You as the giver will be charged immediately upon purchase, but the recipient won't be notified (and their sub won't start) until the selected date. If the date is left as today's date, they'll be emailed (and their sub will begin) immediately. </p><p><strong>Note 2</strong>: Gift subs can't be purchased for readers with existing paid subscriptions because...our system already recognises them as paid subscribers. They can be <em>purchased </em>by anyone though, whether they're an existing subscriber or not.</p><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I don't want to be the Game Announcement Police here, ACAB, but over the last month there have been two big, new video games revealed that were notable not for what they showed off, but for what they didn't.</p><p>First up was <em>Total War: Medieval III</em>, which was announced via a live-action trailer (below) and<a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/welcome-to-total-war-medieval-iii?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>blog post</u></a>:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFKhUJTnC-E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Total War: MEDIEVAL III - Announce Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>Amazing news! There hasn't been a proper historical <em>Total War </em>release since <em>Three Kingdoms</em> (<a href="https://aftermath.site/total-war-pharaoh-dynasties-impressions-release/"><u>I'm not counting <em>Pharaoh's</em> mea culpa</u></a>), and <em>Medieval </em>is a long-time fan favourite, so this should have got people excited. Only problem is that there wasn't any gameplay shown. There weren't any screenshots. There wasn't even much art for the game, aside from<a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/our-vision-for-total-war-medieval-iii?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>a single piece shown at the top of a follow-up blog</u></a>.</p><p>Only days later, Creative Assembly announced a <em>second</em> upcoming <em>Total War </em>game coming out much sooner, this time set in the<em> Warhammer 40K </em>universe, and its debut trailer was <em>packed </em>with gameplay footage, right down to giving us a look at the menus and interface.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QeCItSg-wmI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Total War: Warhammer 40,000 – Announce Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>I'm not drawing a very long bow here to speculate that the <em>Medieval </em>announcement was made a few days prior in an attempt to head off any uproar over the <em>40K</em> announcement. For those unfamiliar with the franchise, there's a kind of uneasy divide among some in the community, with <em>Total War's</em> longest-serving fans (going back to 1999's <em>Shogun</em>) preferring the series' historical focus over the wilder, more fictional stuff that has featured in the <em>Warhammer </em>(and now <em>40K</em>) entries. They look at how much money and effort has been poured into the Creative Assembly collab, then look at the relative neglect shown to the historical games (from ending<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/creative-assembly-faces-backlash-over-decision-to-end-support-for-total-war-three-kingdoms?ref=aftermath.site"> <u><em>Three Kingdoms</em> support early</u></a> to whatever the hell happened with <em>Pharaoh</em>), and get pretty mad.</p><p>While getting <em>Medieval III</em> out in front like that probably made diplomatic sense to publishers Sega and developers Creative Assembly, I dunno, I think I'd rather a game be announced on its own merits and with something genuine to show off and talk about, rather than shoot a clip and write a blog just so you make some of your own fans less angry. <em>Medieval III</em> is clearly <em>years </em>away (they didn't even hint at a broad window for it to come out), and you went and announced a whole other game a few days later– you didn't have to <em>Elder Scolls VI</em>-ify your next big game!</p><figure><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>The Elder Scrolls 6 Announcement Is Now as Old as Skyrim Was When The Elder Scrolls 6 Was Announced - IGN</p><p>The Elder Scrolls 6 announcement is now as old as predecessor Skyrim was when The Elder Scrolls 6 was announced, and developer Bethesda hasn’t shared another snippet since.</p><p><span>ryan_dinsdale</span></p></div></a></figure><p>The second game I wanted to talk about is even funnier. Earlier today Netflix<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/fifa-mens-world-cup-2026-game-on-netflix?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>announced</u></a><u> </u>that Delphi, a company you've likely never heard of (they're relatively new, and their only public credit is as support on IO's upcoming <em>007 </em>game) will be both developing and publishing a new FIFA game. You might remember that<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/may/10/electronic-arts-ditches-fifa-ea-sports-fc?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>back in 2022 EA Sports (developers of the long-running series) and FIFA (the world governing body for football) split</u></a>, and ever since EA's series has been called <em>EA Sports FC,</em> or <em>EAFC</em> for short.</p><p>Netflix's announcement contains zero images or video of the game. And there's probably a good reason for that: the press release says stuff like "All you need is Netflix and your phone", and "We want to bring football back to its roots with something everyone can play with just the touch of a button", suggesting that whatever Delphi is cooking up, it'll be a lot closer to a casual mobile experience than the blockbuster simulation football fans have long come to expect from series like <em>FIFA </em>(now <em>EAFC</em>) and <em>Pro Evo</em> (now called <em>eFootball</em>).</p><p>That obfuscation has paid off handsomely, though, with a ton of mainstream coverage of the announcement hitting today with headlines like:</p><figure><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93w7dp42z2o?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Fifa video game to return after four years in Netflix exclusive</p><p>The game will be made by Delphi Interactive and released in time for the 2026 World Cup.</p><p><span>BBC News</span></p></div></a></figure><p>There's a <em>small </em>mention of what I've just said above at the bottom of that BBC article, but as a mainstream article intended for a mainstream audience, I guarantee Delphi and FIFA will be thrilled at the number of water cooler and group chat conversations this week that will revolve around the talking point "Boys, did you hear FIFA is coming back?"</p><p>I should point out that this isn't the first FIFA game to "return" since the body split with EA; there's already a game called <em>FIFA Rivals</em>,<a href="https://fifa.rivals.game/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>which is basically an antique NFT scam with a playerbase best summed up by the fact the game's official site has a Telegram account</u></a>.</p>
