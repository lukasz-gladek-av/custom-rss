            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-science-saru-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dan Da Dan</em></a>, Science Saru’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/more-anime-fans-should-heed-the-advice-dan-da-dans-creator-got-from-his-editor-2000510509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lovey-dovey</a> madcap <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dan-da-dan-is-a-lovey-dovey-madcap-sci-fi-anime-drama-about-finding-your-balls-2000540322" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sci-fi-meets-yokai anime</a> is back, and I couldn’t be happier. We’ve got new <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dandadan-season-2s-new-opening-puts-you-right-in-the-stylish-action-2000623859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening and ending theme songs</a> to obsess over, a quietly released <a href="https://t.co/mIndqg9998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bare-bones beat ‘em up mobile game</a> to poke at, and the return of the weekly ritual of delegating Mondays and Thursdays as<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Dandadan/comments/1glqu2p/best_day_of_the_week_again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> DanDaDan Day</a>, with new manga chapters and anime episodes dropping like clockwork. But what’s got me the most jazzed about the second season isn’t just watching my adopted anime children <em>Scooby-Doo</em> their way out of an <em>X-Files</em> jam; it's poring over its animator’s rough draft key animations on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>While it isn’t rare for animators for shows like <a href="https://aftermath.site/gquuuuuux-finale-gundam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em></a> to <a href="https://x.com/gojooni/status/1937541488973643806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post illustrations on social media</a> following the release of a new episode to drum up excitement (and marketing) for their anime and <a href="https://x.com/HideMatsubara/status/1937543228494102568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bid farewell to their co-workers</a>, the folks at Science Saru have made it a tradition to have its animators post snippets of the production materials they worked on in new episodes.&nbsp;</p><p>These key animation production materials—whose rough versions are called <a href="https://sakuga.fandom.com/wiki/Genga" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genga </a>and cleaned-up versions are called <a href="https://sakuga.fandom.com/wiki/Nigen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nigen</a>—are essentially a behind-the-scenes look at how the anime sausage is made. It’s similar to looking at the version history Google Doc of a stellar review with all the <a href="https://x.com/SHUTOENOMOTO/status/1857189960685949072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strikethroughs, moved graphs, and editor comments</a>. Only with ningen do you get to see what the chiseled granite of animation looked like in its final stages before <a href="https://gizmodo.com/netflix-animation-anime-interview-power-house-sam-deats-adam-deats-david-how-2000517324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">color shading and compositing</a> come into play making the fluid animation (<a href="https://sakuga.fandom.com/wiki/Sakuga_Wiki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sakuga</a>) of anime episode what it looks like upon release.</p><p>What’s interesting about Science Saru animators posting various keyframes—whether they’re simple running cycles, head turns, <a href="https://x.com/dancing_stew/status/1940847223060983966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">character acting</a>, or action scenes—is that many of them last no longer than four to eight seconds. Still, each keyframe plays a crucial role in making every part of <em>Dan Da Dan</em>’s animation shine—whether it's in its opening theme or within the episodes. Essentially, looking at Science Saru’s team's piecemeal work on new episodes is like watching a street artist sign their name on a giant mural. Plus, by checking out their keyframes in isolation, I get to geek out over small animation details I might not notice in the chaos of the final episodes, like when Momo (my favorite character) makes a goofy face in the middle of a fight.&nbsp;</p><p>While I’ve meticulously set my Twitter algorithm to show me posts from Science Saru animators whenever a new episode drops, folks who also love behind-the-scenes animation details can visit websites like <a href="https://sakugabooru.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sakugabooru.</a> This site not only functions as a database for a wide range of anime shows, tagging various techniques and styles, but also links back to the animator’s Twitter accounts if people want to follow a creator’s work. I find this especially helpful in avoiding the trend where anime fans credit streaming platforms like Netflix and Crunchyroll for the animation quality, rather than recognizing the studios and animators who put in the effort to give those shows their shine and just desserts.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hideaki-anno-is-animes-ultimate-wife-guy"><h3>Hideaki Anno Is Anime’s Ultimate Wife Guy</h3></a><p>Moyoco and Hideaki Anno might dethrone Sailor Moon and Hunter X Hunter’s creators as anime’s it couple.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-sakuga-science-saru]]></content:encoded>
