            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/rockstar-launcher-pc-red-dead-redemption<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm currently (supposed to be) on vacation and today, having recently<a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-douglas-slocombe-cinematography-cutscenes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> finished up playing the excellent <em>Indiana Jones</em></a>, I decided to revisit a classic and play the original <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> on PC. I shouldn't have bothered.</p><p>After installing the game just after breakfast and settling in with a nice cup of coffee, I hit PLAY in Steam and was soon greeted by the sight of<a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-ea-paradox-launcher-pc-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> one of my great enemies in life</a>: Rockstar's third-party launcher. Which courteously tried to automatically log me in, then decided it could <em>not</em>, because it was trying to use a very old email.</p><p>That email was my old Kotaku work email,<a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/youre-solid-gold-ill-see-you-in-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a job I left in July 2023</a>, so you can see that I don't play Rockstar games on PC too often. Even though I no longer had access to that email, and the launcher couldn't log me in automatically, I tried signing in manually anyway because I figured I could remember the password, but no dice: the launcher sent a verification email, which I would never be able to read.</p><p>So I tried logging in using my <em>other </em>Rockstar account, one I'd made more recently for my PlayStation 5 and which was tied to a personal email I <em>did </em>have access to, but again was met with an error message. Turns out I couldn't use a different account on PC because Rockstar had linked the old/dead account to Steam, only one account was allowed to do this, and I didn't have access to that account.</p><p>That's OK, I figured, I'll just change which Rockstar account is linked to my Steam account. Nope! You can't do that manually; you need to contact Rockstar support for that--complete with screenshots and a written statement you acknowledge that switching accounts will mean you lose all access to the old one--and let them do it.</p><p>So I supplied all the information they asked for, waited a few hours then, at 4pm--remember, I'd wanted to play this game at <em>breakfast time</em>--I got a response. That response repeated the instructions I had already followed, asked for a screenshot and Steam ID I had already supplied, then told me I'd never be able to play <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> using that account again.</p><p>I was trying to play <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>.</p><p>A singeplayer campaign.</p><p>One I'd already acquired through Steam, and was trying to launch through Steam.</p><p>It's now 8pm at time of posting, and I've given up. But not before becoming even more convinced that anyone who has ever worked on the design or implementation of a third-party launcher on PC should be thrown into the deepest, coldest part of the ocean.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
