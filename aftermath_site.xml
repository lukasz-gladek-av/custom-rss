            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702170/Strange_Jigsaws/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Strange Jigsaws'</em></a><em> </em>description is simple: It's a game of strange jigsaws where you solve strange jigsaws. I started playing it recently after seeing <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hownottodraw.bsky.social/post/3m4gmqikclc2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some posts</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m4qamjr7n22h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about it</a> on social media. Created by <em>20 Small Mazes</em> puzzle master FLEB, <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> has about 50 or so puzzles—not necessarily <em>all</em> jigsaw puzzles, but using jigsaw pieces. It opens right into the chaos: "Solve jigsaws. Find the golden pieces. Open the door."&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>Designer FLEB opens <em>Strange Jigsaw</em> with a chaotic mess of multiple jigsaw puzzles, signaling that this game is more than just a puzzle simulator. Pieces are everywhere, and it's prudent just to start moving pieces around to test out what they do. Among the first few puzzles, I'm to put pieces together to power a magnet and a computer, respectively, which opens up <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> puzzles even further. Then, trouble! A puzzle is on fire, and <em>Tetris</em>-shaped blocks of water are the only thing that can put them out. On the newly-powered computer, more puzzles: A clever captcha-inspired puzzle game, then a burger-building logic puzzle that reminded me of <a href="https://aftermath.site/is-this-seat-taken-impressions-indie-direct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Is This Seat Taken?</em></a><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><figure></figure><p>There are jigsaws that are highly meta, using pathways controlled by <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>' menu systems. There are darling puzzles illustrated by the designer's seven-year-old daughter, puzzles with missing pieces that must be recolored using a paint fill tool, puzzles that need a screwdriver to solve. <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> is expertly designed, but what makes it truly fantastic is the earnest playfulness of it all: FLEB loves puzzles, and that's obvious. He writes in <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>' Steam description that this game is harder than his last, <em>20 Small Puzzles</em>, and that may be true—but the puzzles here don't feel cruelly hard. Some are hard, but designed in a way to make them feel doable and intentional. I might not understand a puzzle now, but the game reassures me that I will be able to, later.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>There are so many moments in <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> that I want to talk to you about, but unfortunately for me, the person writing about this game, talking about them will sully the experience for you. <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> is just $5, so I urge you simply to try it out yourself. But if you need a taste of what designer FLEB is out, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2570630/20_Small_Mazes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>20 Small Mazes </em>is free</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Or, you can look to YouTube: The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FLEBpuzzles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designer FLEB has a YouTube channel</a> in which he talks about his games and others. It's just as delightful as his games. His recent videos include a retrospective on <em>20 Small Mazes</em> and a newly designed puzzle called <em>Touching Grass</em>, which is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmndrQW5AmA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naturally built out of grass</a>. Over the past 10 years—with a seven year break somewhere in there—FLEB has made videos about all sorts of different puzzles. If this doesn't convince you that FLEB knows puzzles, I don't know what will.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-telltale-games-adhoc-studio"><h3>Dispatch Brings Back The Halcyon  Era Of Online Water Cooler Talk</h3></a><p>Adhoc Studio’s superhero choose-your-own-adventure feels like a fun hole-in-the-wall, word-of-mouth-recommended spot that the gaming communities haven’t had in a minute</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor-election"><h3>Mamdani Won, And Also Cuomo Lost</h3></a><p>Mamdani can't solve all our problems, but at least he solved the problem of having to talk about Andrew Cuomo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kodansha-studios-akira-anime-live-ation-chloe-zhao-nicolas-gonda"><h3>Somehow, The Threat Of A Live-Action Akira Refuses To Die</h3></a><p>If there is any anime that could be considered Hollywood’s Moby Dick, it is Akira</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/solve-these-strange-jigsaws-steam-puzzle-games]]></content:encoded>
