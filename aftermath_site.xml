            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fortnite-levels<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new season of <em>Fortnite</em> launched over the weekend, following a <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1862950664281919658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very popular</a> concert event that I managed to miss every time it ran. The season brings <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fight-as-a-ronin-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-6-season-1-hunters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new</a> landmarks, changes to movement, some creatures running around the world–and, it seems, removes the ability to see your squadmates’ levels, which is totally screwing me up.</p><p>I usually play <em>Fortnite </em>in squads with strangers, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-royale-the-kotaku-review-1833890299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">these days</a> I keep my voice chat off. This means the start of every new round is taken up by trying to parse if I’ve landed with a good squad–players who know what they’re doing and stick together–or a bad squad–players who just want to screw around, or who run off and get themselves killed in remote parts of the map where I will nevertheless rush to try to <a href="https://kotaku.com/please-stop-quitting-before-i-can-revive-you-1841606763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revive</a> them out of an overdeveloped sense of duty. One way I figure out the potential social dynamics is by seeing what level everyone is, indicated by a number next to their names in the top left of my screen. Higher levels don’t necessarily mean a better squad, of course, but at the very least I use them as a decision-making factor when my squad can’t agree on where to land–I’ll follow the player with the highest level, figuring they probably know where they’re going.</p><p>But when I booted up the new season last night, player levels no longer appeared. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h4fp8f/did_they_remove_displaying_levels_in_a_match/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Other</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h4eb1j/account_levels_not_showing_in_pubs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h46qy4/theres_no_more_level_up_in_the_top_left_which/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h53wh2/why_cant_i_see_anyones_levels_or_platform_icon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noticed</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h53wh2/why_cant_i_see_anyones_levels_or_platform_icon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h4r0iq/levels_not_displaying_when_in_game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too</a>, and largely aren’t happy with it. Overall, I think it’s probably a good change: I would often find myself in matches where higher-level squadmates would <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h4r0iq/comment/m08av4s/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bail</a> if they were too high above the rest of the squad, which felt bad and made my squads lopsided.&nbsp;</p><p>I know that a player’s level doesn’t <em>really</em> mean anything about them as a squadmate. And there are other <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fortnite/fortnite-xp-gets-a-boost-after-battle-royale-players-complained-that-leveling-up-was-too-slow-in-chapter-6-but-it-still-isnt-enough-to-make-up-for-the-nerf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XP</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/483112/fortnite-battle-pass-price-increase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle pass</a> changes players are riled up about that are probably more consequential. But the lack of player levels has upset the delicate, mostly imaginary social balance of my games. I miss the (imaginary) comfort of sticking to my highest-level squadmate, feeling shepherded through the mysteries and dangers of a new season. I miss the (again, imaginary) sense of responsibility I felt to low-level squadmates, whom I would feel duty-bound to defend. Now my squad is just a bunch of names, a level playing field of strangers. How do I sort us into a pecking order? Who do I prioritize? How do I tell myself a complex tale of heroes and newcomers banding together against the odds? Where do I find my narrative fulfillment?</p><p>&nbsp;Like I said, this is probably mostly a good thing. And, as someone who doesn’t play <em>Fortnite</em> as frequently as I used to, I have to admit I sort of appreciate there being less information on the screen, which over the seasons has become so cluttered with indicators and symbols that I mostly tune them out. Now I need to learn about my squadmates through their actions, rather than largely meaningless numbers next to their names. There’s probably a lesson in here somewhere. &nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
