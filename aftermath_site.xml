            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/go-media-kotaku-twitter-x-hack-memecoin-crypto<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This afternoon, the Twitter account for the hollowed-out remains of a once-popular video game website began counting down to an announcement. "The best gaming token is coming... stay tuned for updates!" read a post from Kotaku’s Twitter. Some presumed that the site’s owner, G/O Media, had launched a new misbegotten scheme to staunch bleeding from the publisher’s countless self-inflicted wounds. But no, turns out the account had been&nbsp;hacked – as a result of one of the many aforementioned self-inflicted wounds.</p><p>G/O Media revoked writers’ access to sites' social media accounts years ago, following then-Kotaku sister site Gizmodo’s promotion of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/everyone-should-be-able-to-use-the-public-restroom-whe-1845504927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article</a> that happened to criticize G/O's handling of a situation involving a disabled employee (Disclosure: Everybody at Aftermath has worked for Kotaku in the past, and Luke, Riley, and I were still at the site when this occurred).&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Kotaku / Twitter</figcaption></figure><p>Despite this apparent desire to preserve the sanctity of sites’ accounts, G/O was careless enough for Kotaku's to get hacked in service of the most embarrassing promotion possible: <a href="https://x.com/CabalTrackerBot/status/1886533482026783025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a memecoin</a> with the name $KOTA, which is either short for Kotaku or an acronym meaning “King Of The America,” depending on who you ask. The tweets remained up for over two hours before they were finally deleted. Admittedly, Twitter is a shitshow these days – a lawless land except when it comes to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/molly.wiki/post/3lhbropf4g22t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things that are actually legal</a> – but this situation was nonetheless largely if not entirely avoidable.</p><p>If you need a refresher, this is the same G/O Media that in early 2024 saddled Kotaku, a news site, with <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a guides-focused editorial edict</a> that caused its then-EIC to resign in protest. A pivot to guides has evidently done little to improve Kotaku’s flagging fortunes, with G/O <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-layoffs-go-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing one writer and laying off two more</a> in November, leaving what used to be one of the most influential video game websites in existence with just six full-time staff.&nbsp;</p><p>We must conclude that there is simply no rake too obvious for these clumsy buffoons to avoid stepping on. It is inevitable that these pioneers of the ancient art of the self-own will find new ways to innovate in the coming months, and that is one of the only truly exciting prospects that remains in this dreary, imploding world of ours – or at least it would be, if it didn’t splash back on writers who actually know what they’re doing.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tell-me-about-your-favorite-niche-simulator"><h3>Tell Me About Your Favorite Niche Simulator</h3></a><p>There is still some joy in this world, probably</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics"><h3>James Gunn Can’t Stop Making Suicide Squads</h3></a><p>Groups of freaky little guys are the stuff of comic book history, and maybe the future of comic book movies.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mika-and-the-witch%E2%80%99s-mountain-has-me-i%E2%80%99m-sorry-under-its-spell.1099218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/mika-witchs-mountain-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was idly thumbing through my Bluesky feed last week when I saw someone mention a game they described as "<em>Kiki's Delivery Service</em> meets <em>Wind Waker</em>". I don't know if I've ever rushed to install a game faster.</p><p>Turns out the game, <em>Mika And The Witch's Mountain</em>, is <em>fantastic</em>. You play as a young witch seemingly going to a school situated at the top of a mountain, but nope, about two minutes into proceedings you're cast down to the town below, broom snapped in two. You're stuck there working as a courier until you're able to afford a fancy enough broom to get you back to the top.</p><p>The whole game is built around being a courier, flying your magic broom around delivering stuff for people, and so for the whole game you're doing little else but running errands. </p><p>Imagine some of the worst parts of <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>--take this thing here, only do it carefully, but also do it <em>quickly</em>--and that's <em>Mika</em>. But it's OK! Because here those delivery-based challenges are neither tedious nor stressful; the timers are generous, the damage limits manageable, and the packages are just an excuse to get you flying around a beautiful tropical island meeting everyone who lives there and learning all about their stories.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Mika and the Witch's Mountain - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FYeMFMlwLJI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It's the meeting that's ultimately what's important. Everyone here has a story to tell, and they're all lovely little stories: some about spoiled kids with a struggling dad, others about the perils of licking the boots of a shit-heeled capitalist. What's more, helping everyone out all the time gives <em>Mika </em>such a wonderful <em>energy </em>to it; all you're ever doing is helping people, and that just makes you feel better every time you play it.</p><p>I've said it before but I'll say it again:<a href="https://aftermath.site/caravan-sandwitch-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I love a small sandbox more than almost anything else in video games</a>. The island in <em>Mika </em>isn't very big, so it won't be long before you meet everyone and visit every location at least once. But that's great; it really helps the communal feel of the game that you grow to know every square inch of the place and everyone living on it.</p><p>Finally, I want to point out how charming the whole thing is. It has some wonderful animated cutscenes (including a lengthy, must-see outro), some crisp, airy visuals that are, yes, very <em>Wind Waker</em>, and a soundtrack that's the perfect accompaniment to an afternoon spent catching some sea breeze on a witch's broom.</p><p><em>Mika And The Witch's Mountain</em> is out now on PC, Switch, PlayStation and Xbox.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tell-me-about-your-favorite-niche-simulator"><h3>Tell Me About Your Favorite Niche Simulator</h3></a><p>There is still some joy in this world, probably</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics"><h3>James Gunn Can’t Stop Making Suicide Squads</h3></a><p>Groups of freaky little guys are the stuff of comic book history, and maybe the future of comic book movies.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
