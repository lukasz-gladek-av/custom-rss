            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Everquest</em> maker Daybreak Games is suing the creators of a popular <em>Everquest</em> emulator called <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em>, accusing the company of copyright infringement and other DMCA violations. The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.casd.819107/gov.uscourts.casd.819107.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original complaint</a> was filed in June in a California court and was first <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/06/24/daybreak-is-chasing-everquest-emulator-operators-from-the-heroes-journey-in-court/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by gaming outlet Massively OP</a>. In <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889955351/Prelim-injunction-motion-via-Aftermath" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new documents filed this week</a>, Daybreak Games’ lawyers suggest that the existence of <em>The Heroes’ Journey </em>threatens “the very existence of <em>EverQuest</em> itself.”</p><p><em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> is one of dozens of <em>EverQuest</em> servers in operation, the majority of which are made possible due to an open-source project <a href="https://www.eqemulator.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">called <em>EverQuest Emulator</em></a>. It’s the most popular <em>EverQuest</em> server, according to EQ Emulator, <a href="https://eqemulator.org/index.php?pageid=serverlist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with more than 2,000 active users at the time of writing</a>. Some of these fan-run <em>EverQuest</em> servers run with permission from Daybreak Games, such as <a href="https://www.everquest.com/news/project-1999-daybreak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Project 1999</em></a>, which made an agreement with Daybreak Games in 2015. After the lawsuit was filed, one <em>EverQuest</em> emulator called <em>Project Quarm</em> shut down preemptively; it’s now come back online <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProjectQuarm/comments/1m0816j/project_quarm_has_entered_into_an_agreement_with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with permission from Daybreak Games, so long as it’s not-for-profit</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The key piece for <em>Project 1999 </em>and <em>Project Quarm</em>, for Daybreak Games, appears to be that they’re not-for-profit — meaning they don’t make money, whereas <em>The Heroes’ Journey </em>does, on top of it competing with the original <em>EverQuest</em> game. The other issue, which lawyers explain in the original complaint from June, is that <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> reportedly requires players to run the <em>EverQuest</em> client and mods it to access the unauthorized server. Daybreak Games says the mods “constitute unauthorized derivative works of Daybreak’s copyrighted software and circumvent technological measures implemented by Daybreak to control access to its copyrighted works.”</p><figure><figcaption>from Daybreak Games' lawsuit</figcaption></figure><p><em>EverQuest</em> was originally released in 1999 as a massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Its experience hinges on a lot of people playing it at once; the social element is a core function of the game. <em>EverQuest</em> is free-to-play, though it also has a premium membership plan that gives players different perks. Daybreak Games had previously been denied a temporary restraining order that would have taken <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> offline through the next phase of the lawsuit, and <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.casd.819107/gov.uscourts.casd.819107.29.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later agreed to an order</a> that instead prevented <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> from getting major updates and forced revenue into an escrow account while the lawsuit is ongoing. In Daybreak Games’ latest filing, a motion for preliminary injunction, the company seeks to have <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> taken down because it claims that its existence is a threat to <em>EverQuest</em> due to a reduction in Daybreak Games' <em>EverQuest</em> playerbase; damages for monetary harm aren’t enough, lawyers wrote.</p><p>“At the same time that EverQuest has experienced unprecedented decline, THJ has grown exponentially due to the direct theft of EverQuest users,” lawyers wrote.</p><p>It’s not clear how many players <em>EverQuest</em> currently has, and portions of the documents that discuss it are redacted. (In 2020, <em>EverQuest</em> had 82,000 monthly active players and 66,000 playing members, <a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EG7-Investor-Presentation-Dec-2020-Acquires-Daybreak-Games.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per an earnings report</a>. Aftermath has not been able to locate player numbers in the years that followed.) The newly filed documents imply that the existence of <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> has led to a decrease in <em>EverQuest</em> players; “Since THJ’s launch in late 2024, [redacted],” lawyers wrote. “A decline in user base not only causes a decline in revenue to Daybreak but also damages the entire gaming experience which depends, by definition, on the simultaneous play by thousands of users. This drop in users has irreversible ripple effects across the entire gaming experience, creating a downward spiral that will be impossible to reverse. Each day of delay allows Defendants to continue diverting players and revenue from Daybreak’s legitimate EverQuest service.”</p><p>They continued, “As a result of the damage that Defendants have already caused and are continuing to cause, [redacted.] This is the exact type of irreparable harm that preliminary injunctions are designed to prevent.”</p><p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889955350/Daybreak-vs-THJ-via-Aftermath-filing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a separate filing</a>, Daybreak Games attorney Nicholas Janda spends two pages discussing how much players love <em>The Heroes’ Journey, </em>using comments from YouTube, Reddit, and other social media. “Hands down the best thing that has ever happened to the game,” read one YouTube comment Janda cited. “Never going back to original EQ again.” Another person wrote, as cited by Janda: “The day I started THJ I stopped my EQ subs.”&nbsp;</p><p>Daybreak Games claims <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> has more than 30,000 users. That’s a huge increase since its launch in late 2024; Janda said Daybreak Games received an anonymous email in December 2024 that stated <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> had 2,000 users and was making $20,000 per month. Lawyers are drawing a line that they say shows “a clear correlation&nbsp; between THJ’s growth and the decline in official <em>EverQuest</em> server populations.” Daybreak Games is asking the court to force <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> offline, take its GitHub repositories down, and cease operation of its website while the lawsuit is ongoing.</p><p>“Player departure creates an accelerating effect where each departing [<em>EverQuest</em>] player makes the remaining experience less attractive, encouraging additional departures,” lawyers wrote. “As guild membership declines, group activities become harder to organize, and the social ecosystem that originally attracted players deteriorates. This acceleration means that early intervention is critical — once the exodus reaches a certain threshold, it becomes extremely difficult to reverse.”</p><p>Neither Daybreak Games nor the makers of <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> have responded to Aftermath’s request for comment. But <em>The Heroes’</em> <em>Journey</em>’s Discord server displays the following statement:</p><blockquote><p><em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> is currently subject to pending litigation brought by Daybreak Game Company LLC regarding intellectual property and other related matters. While that case proceeds, a Stipulated Order found <a href="https://heroesjourneyemu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/daybreak-stip-order.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> has been agreed to by the Parties in that litigation and is subject to enforcement by the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.</p><p>We know this has been stressful for many of you, but please know that you are not alone. We are doing everything in our power to see this through to a positive outcome for our community and all involved parties.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p><em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> <a href="https://heroesjourneyemu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a> contains a similar statement.</p><p>In a follow-up statement published on Discord on July 14, the makers confirmed they are taking donations that will go toward legal defense. Ozuri,&nbsp;an advisor for&nbsp;<em>The Heroes’ Journey&nbsp;</em>who worked on&nbsp;<em>EverQuest&nbsp;</em>until 2004, told Aftermath that the community support for&nbsp;<em>The Heroes’ Journey</em>&nbsp;has been overwhelming — unlike anything they've seen in more than 25 years in the video game industry.</p><p>“I’m a 47 year old jaded gamer, and I’ve been on the internet a long time, but I’ve ugly cried more than once reading the stories of the impact <em>THJ</em> has had on people and what it has meant for them and their lives,” Ozuri said. “We are grateful and oh so humbled by our community that seems deeply emotionally invested in [<em>The Heroes’ Journey</em>.]”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-valnet-off-the-grid-gunzilla-rip-this-sucks"><h3>🙃 [Update]</h3></a><p>Cool, cool, cool</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/everquest-the-heroes-journey-lawsuit-update]]></content:encoded>
