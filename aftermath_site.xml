            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re so back. A newish year and <a href="https://aftermath.site/baseball-week-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the triumphant return of Inside Baseball Week</a> can only mean one thing: a refreshed list of subscriber goals. Let’s get to it.</p><p>If you’re visiting Aftermath for the first time, welcome! Aftermath is a worker-owned, reader-supported site about games, the internet, and everything that comes after. We hope you stick around. If you’ve been around for a minute, you’re probably <em>well </em>aware that we’re <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an entirely reader-funded operation</a>. Still, we must continually bang that drum because subscriptions really and truly do keep us alive. The upside of all this is that we’re not beholden to any execs, investors, or other companies. As a result, we can publish whatever we see fit.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past year alone, our loyal reader base has allowed us to write about <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-industry-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game devs being forced to leave the industry as a result of rampant layoffs</a>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the quiet, often undignified labor of freelance games journalists</a>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/anime-classics-mecha-robot-recommendations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how they don’t make anime like they used to</a>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the many different ways generative AI is being unsuccessfully shoehorned into everything</a>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-profitable-layoffs-interview-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch CEO Dan Clancy’s effort to get everybody to like him (and how it ultimately failed)</a>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the conspiracy theory that gave rise to gaming’s modern far-right grifter-verse</a>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the plight of leftist influencers following Trump’s election victory</a>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/star-reporter-talent-pr-washington-post" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how the myth of the star reporter is reshaping journalism</a>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox’s rot economy</a>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/website-musk-twitter-facebook-internet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why everybody should make their own website to stop the internet from sucking</a>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-racism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why it’s futile to fight racism with logic</a>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/does-elon-musks-gaming-rig-suck-or-not" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon Musk’s embarrassing gaming setup</a>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/oh-no-i-bought-a-candy-cab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taiwanese arcade cabinet renovation projects</a>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/gaggiuino-gaggia-classic-pro-mod-open-source-hack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hacked espresso machines</a>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/industrial-cleaning-kimwipes-tergazyme-fast-orange-thymol-lens-pen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cleaning products</a>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-to-make-movie-theater-popcorn-flavacol-secret-ingredient" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popcorn toppings</a>; and <a href="https://aftermath.site/sanrio-film-extravagant-quest-hello-kitty-unico" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sanrio’s truly bonkers quest to become the next Disney</a>. We’ve also <a href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goku-how-many" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">counted Gokus</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/speedrunning-dog-interview-peanut-butter-agdq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed a dog</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/dog-speedrun-sgdq-peanut-butter-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(twice)</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, we <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-2024-finances-subscription-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kicked off our first subscriber drive</a>, pairing longer-term goals with subscriber totals we estimated would allow us to realize our wildest (and more realistic) dreams. We want readers to understand where their money is going, and so far, it’s proven to be a winning formula. As of this writing, we’re at 4,350 paying subscribers, up from 2,850 this time last year. The additional funds have allowed us to <a href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-vii-remake-rebirth-terrorism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">run freelance pieces</a>, <a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell merch</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-rami-ismail-arabic-palestine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch a new podcast</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/author/isaiah-colbert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bring on a regular contributor</a>, plan an in-person party (still to come; we’re aiming for when the weather improves), and give ourselves raises that don’t quite equate to a full-time salary, but we’re getting there.&nbsp;</p><p>Now it’s time for another, even more ambitious list of goals. As we said last year, these are ballpark figures; a year of being in business has shown us that some things are harder to map to straight subscriber numbers than others. We’ve also moved or removed a couple un-reached goals from last year’s list, which we realized with the benefit of time would prove either more costly or intensive than initially expected.</p><p><strong>4,350 - Where we're at now</strong></p><p>4,500 - More frequent pieces from even cooler freelancers.</p><p>4,800 - We can pay somebody to write a regular column for the site.</p><p>5,000 - We can all do this full-time and not be poor!</p><p>5,200 - We can bring on people to help us with more specialized tasks (a dedicated businessperson, someone to focus on our social media accounts and promotion, etc).</p><p>5,500 - More merch drops!</p><p>5,800 - We can bring on another regular contributor to keep Isaiah company.</p><p>6,000 - A second party, and we can cover Luke’s travel costs (unless he decides he never wants to set foot in America again, which would be totally understandable).</p><p>6,300 - We can travel to and cover events more regularly.&nbsp;</p><p>6,500 -&nbsp; We can hire another full-time staff member!</p><p>100,000 - We will purchase what little remains of G/O Media and fire somebody whose name rhymes with Spim Janfeller (out of a cannon)</p><p>150,000 - We will purchase what little remains of G/O Media and fire somebody whose name rhymes with Spim Janfeller (out of a gold-embossed cannon).</p><p>As with last year, we plan to regularly update this page – and let everybody know when we do so – to ensure that readers can follow along at home. If you’d like to kick off that process by subscribing or going up a subscription tier (which will grant you access to our comment section and Discord), <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can do so here</a>. Or if you’d like to supercharge this whole operation, we also have <a href="https://aftermath.site/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a tips jar</a> where you can donate whatever you want (RICH PEOPLE PLEASE NOTICE THIS).</p><p>Thank you! With your help, we can reduce 2025 to a smoking crater in the ground and, once again, save the world with the power of blogs.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baseball-week-2025"><h3>Welcome Back To Inside Baseball Week</h3></a><p>It's the return of our most popular theme week, bringing you niche stories about game development, games journalism, and running this site</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
