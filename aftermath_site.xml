I've been alive for most of that time (and blogging on the internet for nearly half of it!), and one thing that's always struck me is that while loads of Australian games have been huge international successes, there's been surprisingly little international recognition that they were <em>Australian</em>.</p><p>That's probably down to many of the games themselves--few of the big successes have been distinctly Australian in their setting or design the way, say, <em>The Witcher 3</em> is distinctly Polish--but it's still struck me as a weird oversight!

Including:</p><p>And, just yesterday:</p><p>But it's also a handy reminder that the AAA video game industry's web of contractors reaches all corners of the globe, with everything from <em>Black Ops 6</em> to <em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</em> being worked on by Australian teams.</p><p>If you'd like to scroll through the list yourself and check out some very good indie video games--<a href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-trailer-ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something I'd recommend on a weekend like this</a>--<a href="https://www.sifter.com.au/post/2024-the-definitive-list-of-australian-made-video-games-playstation-xbox-switch-pc-steam-vr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can find it here</a>, along with links to most of their Steam pages as well.</p><p>(<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-bluey-video-game-sucks-for-australians-and-everyone-else" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you're wondering where the <em>Bluey </em>game is, well firstly it wasn't made by an Australian studio, secondly it came out in 2023, and thirdly it sucked</a>).&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-2024-future-class-game-changer-geoff-keighley"><h3>With The Future Class On Hold, The Game Awards’ Attempts At Doing Good Produce Mixed Results</h3></a><p>Geoff Keighley wants to be perceived as an agent of change for the better, but he's propped up by the status quo</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-good-or-not<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are certain choices I tolerate in games because they are appropriate, types of friction that in a different context would not be acceptable. <em>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</em> is full of those moments, tiny quirks that work for the game because, well, Indiana Jones <em>would </em>do that sort of thing. On this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.&nbsp;</p><p>Riley and I discuss the sometimes <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-reviews-opinions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divisive reaction to the new <em>Indiana Jones</em></a> game, franchises in general, <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hitting fascists in the head</a>, and how in a sense gaming has been trying to make Indiana Jones happen for several decades.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we talk about what the alleged <a href="https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Healthcare shooter’s gaming history means</a> (if anything), <a href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-gamesindustrybiz-humble-buyouts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ziff Davis</a>’ soft layoffs, and much more. We also answer reader questions, like Christmas gifts you’d never buy for yourself, and how to get into tinkering.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Spotify</a>,<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.
