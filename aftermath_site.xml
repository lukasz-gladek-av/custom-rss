            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/felt-that-boxing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tonight's Summer Game Fest presentation included a trailer for a game called <em>Felt That: Boxing</em>, which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3763840/Felt_That_Boxing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">describes</a> itself as "a heartfelt and hilarious boxing game where the charm of handcrafted puppets meets the punch of arcade fighting." It's by a developer called Sans Strings Studio, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sans-strings-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">say</a> they do "digital puppeteering." All that is very cool, and is also literally my worst nightmare.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Felt That: Boxing Official Trailer | Real-Time Puppet Boxing Game" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eSZCdxMQjxs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Here's an embarrassing confession-slash-<a href="https://aftermath.site/i-hate-double-jump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unpopular</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opinion</a> in the grand Riley tradition: I fucking hate Muppets. I hate things that <em>look</em> like Muppets. As a kid, adults were always turning <em>Sesame Street</em> or <em>The Muppet Show</em> on in front of me, and I was consistently horrified, a reaction that was made even worse by the fact that everyone <em>else </em>loved them. Do any of you remember <em>The Muppet Show</em> version of "The Windmills Of Your Mind?" That shit gave me nightmares for <em>years</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Muppet Songs: Screaming Thing - The Windmills of Your Mind" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zt3vzOMzQYU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Muppets and Muppet-inspired puppets are often weird, unpredictable, and unhinged. That's where the humor is supposed to come from, I guess. But as a kid, I just found it hugely upsetting. There's no way to know what these things are and what they want from you. "Windmills Of Your Mind" captures that to the extreme: here is a <em>thing</em> that seems calm and normal on the outside, but on the inside is completely fucked up. When it inevitably cracks, it rushes at the camera--at <em>you</em>, the viewer; at <em>me</em>. What's it gonna do now? Probably hide under my childhood bed and scream out in the middle of the night and eat my face.</p><p>And now here's a game about puppets beating the shit out of you? A <em>series</em> of puppets beating the shit out of you? What the hell, man? Why would you do that to me?</p><p>The problem with this phobia is that I respect the art of puppetry a whole lot. I know a bunch of activist puppeteers and I think what they do is really cool. That clip of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y1Y5Ps3H8w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the guy dragging a puppeteer across the floor</a>? Rad. <em>Avenue Q</em>? I can sing the whole soundtrack. This Canadian <a href="https://variety.com/2000/legit/reviews/street-of-blood-1117775528/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vampire marionette show</a> I saw in some tiny Off-Off-Broadway theatre in 2000? Amazing! I trembled my way through all of them. (And did, in a story too long to recount here, say as politely as I could manage to a puppeteer in <em>Avenue Q</em>, "Please get away from me right now.") I know that I am missing out on a wealth of cool shit because I just cannot deal with puppets without needing to make sure none are hiding under my chair.</p><p>No offense, Sans Strings: It's not your fault your interests lie in cursed facsimiles of living things that are an affront to god. I bet you're working really hard and doing something really cool, and I wish you all the luck in the world in a brightly-lit locked room someplace far away from me.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-yasumi-matsuno"><h3>Tell â€˜Em</h3></a><p>'The will to resist is in your hands'</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
