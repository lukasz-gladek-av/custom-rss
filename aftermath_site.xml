On this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.&nbsp;</p><p>Riley and I discuss the sometimes <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-reviews-opinions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divisive reaction to the new <em>Indiana Jones</em></a> game, franchises in general, <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hitting fascists in the head</a>, and how in a sense gaming has been trying to make Indiana Jones happen for several decades.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we talk about what the alleged <a href="https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Healthcare shooter’s gaming history means</a> (if anything), <a href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-gamesindustrybiz-humble-buyouts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ziff Davis</a>’ soft layoffs, and much more. We also answer reader questions, like Christmas gifts you’d never buy for yourself, and how to get into tinkering.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Spotify</a>,<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.
