            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-says-it-will-retain-creative-control-following-saudi-sale-but-like-come-on.1342798/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, as part of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125039888/ef20057994_defa14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an updated FAQ</a> aimed at workers (<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by Game File</a>), EA said that its <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-ea-sale-is-bad-news-for-everyone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impending $55 billion sale</a> to a consortium that includes Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund will not come at the cost of creative control. If you take EA at its word, I have a bridge to sell you.&nbsp;</p><p>The FAQ includes a number of tersely worded sentiments intended to reassure.&nbsp;</p><p>"We will continue to be guided by our cultural values of creativity, pioneering, passion, determination, learning, and teamwork," it says to counter concerns around a change in culture. "EA will maintain creative control and our track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another eyebrow raiser: no layoffs following a major acquisition. From a company that already <a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-respawn-titanfall-layoffs-andrew-wilson-pay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off hundreds of employees</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">across multiple rounds</a> earlier this year in the name of “<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-says-business-primed-for-accelerated-growth-following-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accelerated growth</a>.” Following a buyout that will <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-gaming-is-the-new-oil-how-the-ea-buyout-diverges-from-the-traditional-playbook-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saddle the company with $20 billion in debt</a>. Sure!</p><p>"There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction," reads the response to a question about layoffs. "Our focus is on driving innovation, and expanding our global reach, all of which require world class teams, who are excited to shape the future of entertainment."</p><p>The driving message underlying the FAQ is more of the same – literally, with EA saying that management, HQ, AI usage, and other staples will remain exactly as they are now.&nbsp;</p><p>That would be great if big companies had given us any reason to believe them in circumstances like this, ever. Bungie leadership told employees that Sony’s purchase of the studio <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/02/01/bungie-sony-buyout-destiny-2-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wouldn’t result in layoffs or restructuring</a> back in 2022. Look at Bungie now: It’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a husk of itself</a>, dragging new <em>Destiny </em>expansions across the finish line while betting big on <em>Marathon</em>, a game whose lunch may have just been preemptively devoured by <em>Arc Raiders</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Or consider everything Microsoft said in its attempts to avert the regulatory Eye Of Sauron while its purchase of Activision Blizzard was still pending. The deal will be <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/02/employee-organizing-engagement-labor-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">super worker-friendly</a>? <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uhhh</a>. Game Pass prices <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-wins-against-ftc-injunction-against-activision-blizzard-buyout-is-denied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t skyrocket</a>? <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/as-microsoft-lays-off-thousands-and-jacks-up-game-pass-prices-former-ftc-chair-says-i-told-you-so-the-activision-blizzard-buyout-is-harming-both-gamers-and-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hmmm</a>.</p><p>The latter comparison is especially apt when taken alongside the growing chorus of voices calling for greater regulatory scrutiny of the EA deal. In the immediate aftermath (dot site) of the sale’s announcement, US senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent</a> <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Electronic-Arts-CEO-Andrew-Wilson.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letters</a> to US Treasury Secretary and Committee Of Foreign Investment chair Scott Bessent and Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson warning of risks that include "surveillance of Americans, covert Saudi propaganda, and selective retaliation and censorship of persons disfavored by the Saudi government."&nbsp;</p><p>Workers at EA, in collaboration with <a href="https://aftermath.site/uvw-cwa-video-game-union-microsoft-trump-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CWA’s direct-join video game union</a>, have also voiced extreme suspicion of the deal, saying in a statement last month that they and theirs stand to be “jeopardized as a result of this deal” despite the fact that they were “not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed.”</p><p>“We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful,” the EA workers wrote.</p><p>Most recently, CWA president Claude Cummings Jr sent formal letters to the Federal Trade Commission and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States calling for a comprehensive review of the deal.</p><p>“This deal is not about innovation or growth for the U.S. economy – it’s about handing control to a small group of powerful investors and putting thousands of jobs and sensitive consumer data at risk,” said Cummings Jr in a statement of his own. “I’m calling on CFIUS Chair Scott Bessent and FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson to scrutinize this deal carefully and to ensure that this deal protects American workers, consumers, and the future of the video game industry.”</p><p>Of course, Trump’s FTC is different from Biden’s FTC, which, under now-former-commissioner Lina Khan, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-18/biden-antitrust-enforcers-set-new-record-for-merger-challenges?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blocked a record number of mergers</a> in an attempt to stem the tide of monopoly power in the US. On top of that, it is impossible to ignore the fact that another member of the consortium purchasing EA is Affinity Partners, an investment firm formed by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law. Trump has also done ample business in Saudi Arabia <a href="https://archive.is/6QLOj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since he won the 2024 presidential election</a>. Now, with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/saudi-crown-prince-bin-salman-will-visit-trump-november-18-white-house-official-2025-11-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set to visit the White House later this month</a> – seemingly to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/world/middleeast/mohammed-bin-salman-us-visit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discuss a nuclear deal and a defense pact</a> – the odds seemed stacked against those who’d rather not see the EA sale sail right on through.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere in games, the International Olympic Committee recently backed out of a deal with the Saudi government to host and operate the Esports Olympic Games. According to <a href="https://esportsadvocate.net/2025/10/esports-breakup-why-the-ioc-backed-out-of-saudi-esports-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report from The Esports Advocate</a>, the two sides failed see eye-to-eye on the creation of an overseeing federation after the Saudi government concluded that existing options were insufficient. What the Saudi government proposed instead would've been under its control in perpetuity, an arrangement the IOC found untenable. </p><p>The report concludes with the following note:</p><p>"Further, the Saudi contingent pushed back on being forced to put women in leadership positions and adhering to rules on who (what nations) it could or could not allow to participate."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5"><h3>How Am I Supposed To Review Europa Universalis V</h3></a><p>There is simply too much video game here, and it's always in motion</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-halo-white-house-trump-vance"><h3>And Also, Who Even Cares About Halo And Lord Of The Rings These Days</h3></a><p>"All of these things do have a feeling of dragging and resuscitating a corpse"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-tactics-grind-jp-mandalia-plains"><h3>I Will Grind In Final Fantasy Tactics Every Single Time And You Cannot Stop Me</h3></a><p>Final Fantasy Tactics without grinding Mandalia Plains is like a day without sunshine.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/us-government-halo-jd-vance-hasan-piker-dog"><h3>We Have Never Been More 12 Years Old</h3></a><p>In the same week government agencies coopted Halo, now we've also got JD Vance weighing on in CollarGate</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-am-i-supposed-to-review-europa-universalis-v.1342711/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As one of the nerdiest Paradox grand strategy series around--and that's saying something--you would think that giving someone nearly an entire month to review the latest <em>Europa Universalis</em> game would be more than enough time to get a handle on it. And yet!</p><p>Despite Paradox giving reviewers a remarkably generous lead-in--only a select few Japanese series like <em>Yakuza </em>or <em>Persona</em> have given as long in recent memory--as the <em>Europa Universalis V</em> embargo crept ever-closer last week I found myself staring at my disjointed notes and a blank page thinking "man, there is just no way I can review this".</p><p>Not because I can't review grand strategy games themselves--<a href="https://kotaku.com/victoria-3-review-paradox-pc-kotaku-impressions-verdict-1849669988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I love doing that!</a>--but because whether intentionally or not, Paradox's first-party efforts have over the last few years become increasingly malleable things, changing their core features and sometimes entire vibes every time an expansion, update or even patch rolls around.</p><p><em>Victoria 3</em>, for example, has had a rollercoaster ride of tweaks and balances since launch. And <em>Crusader Kings III</em>, which somehow released over five years ago now, has in that timeframe become almost something else entirely, landing as a prettier<em> Crusader Kings II </em>before turning into everything from a singleplayer RPG to, in its latest expansion, a game that spans as far as China and Japan.</p><p>Both of which are fine, maybe even great in <em>CK3's</em> case, but all that meddling makes the idea of some kind of review at <em>Europa Universalis V's</em> exact time of launch feel almost irrelevant. What the hell is the point of me giving a long list of thoughts about this game now, in October 2025, when by March 2027 it could be an entirely different experience? Especially when, unlike its more focused stablemates, <em>EU5 </em>is ambitious enough to let you play a single game that begins in the 1300s and ends just before the American Civil War, which means we are messing with a <em>lot </em>of variables here.</p><p>Even just during the time I've had a pre-release copy of <em>EU5</em>,<em> </em>the goalposts have moved a number of times, with seemingly harmless bugs (like an overpowered Papacy) repeatedly patched out because they were messing up people’s campaigns. And as much as there is already in the game, you can still see the outline of where there's going to be (over the course of years of expansions) so much more, whether it be fleshing out the storylines of minor nations to making more far-flung tribes and nations playable.</p><p>Also standing in my way of being able to give some kind of proper "review" of <em>EU5 </em>is the fact that, even with weeks to play it, I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface of its systems and possibilities. Some of the updates made to my pre-release copy broke older saves, so I've only had time to play as three nations (Holland, England and Scotland), and there's so much to this game that it might be months before I've fully come to grips with stuff like its economic management.</p><p>In many ways these games have become their own kind of MMO or Forever Shooter. Many outlets won't score games like that anymore, or will update their thoughts several times as they go. <a href="https://kotaku.com/crusader-kings-ii-the-kotaku-re-review-1783955128" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Some of my favourite pieces of critical work over the past decade</a> haven't been reviews of Paradox games but re-reviews of them,<a href="https://kotaku.com/hearts-of-iron-iv-the-kotaku-re-review-1847022998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> checking in years after release to see how they've evolved and bedded in</a>. To me that feels like the best time to not just experience a Paradox game but to talk about one.</p><figure><figcaption>Go on, pick one</figcaption></figure><p>What I <em>can </em>say now, after spending over 100 hours with a game I nevertheless feel I can’t “review,” is that what's there is pretty good! I think. I'm primarily a <em>Crusader Kings</em> and <em>Hearts of Iron</em> guy. I'm not and have never really been an <em>EU </em>guy and that, combined with a weird bug on my last PC that never let me get past the title screen on <em>EU4</em>, means I haven't touched the series since at least 2019, so going into this new entry I couldn't remember <em>shit</em>. I had no idea what was new or just improved, and it took me days just to learn (or re-learn) how to play the game, even with some fairly substantial tutorials attached.</p><p>One thing I did instantly appreciate though was a substantial, <em>Football Manager</em>-like series of automation tools. Anywhere you see a gear icon--and that's on practically every menu screen in every aspect of the game--you can click it and the AI will take over that part of your nation's affairs for you. While maybe not necessary for series fiends, or anyone running one of the game's 117,000 tiny German principalities, I found it invaluable when playing as a larger nation (like England) because I simply couldn't be bothered tinkering with every little building and trade deal when I had more important things to do, like exploring distant lands, insulting the Papacy and beating up on France.</p><p>The amount of stuff I managed to outsource to the AI was impressive in that it liberated my attention span, and also let me see just how much of the game I still had to learn, which returns to my point above; even with weeks to play <em>EU5 </em>I'm still discovering fundamental things every time I make an errant mouse click or stumble on a hovering tooltip I hadn't noticed before. I didn't know I had to manually upgrade a town to a city until last week. I only found out you could build bridges from a fellow 3MA panellist in a Discord chat. There's simply too much game here for me to even discover, let alone pass comprehensive judgement on, at this stage of its life.</p><p>Even with the AI running vast parts of my empire, constant pop-up events still kept me busy, and there's a surprising variety of them, each tailored not just to the age but the people and place as well. Playing as Scotland, I got a number of very Scottish decisions to make, and helpfully the game even has an icon telling you which one is the historical choice if you want to go down that route. Fighting a war is pretty standard Paradox stuff, as is diplomacy, and while slightly cumbersome (in that you can't simply explore a whole ocean, you can only unlock small sections of it at a time) the game's exploration section also works pretty easily.</p><p>This superficial side of the game, a feast of just the icing, no cake, was a blast. With no personal interest in the fine details this game offers--the numbers run so deep you can burrow down and see each item being traded in every port, and the specific population breakdown of every town and region in your nation--I loved just focusing on the big picture, and really did feel like I was some kind of demigod managing every aspect of my people's lives for 500 years.</p><p>Playing as Scotland I got caught in a messy land war in Ireland. I speedran my break from a corrupt and decadent Catholic Church. I agreed to divide the new world (where I'd founded Scottish colonies everywhere from Greenland to Georgia) with the Pope. I survived the black death, explored the seas and was constantly having to mediate between the vested interests of my nobles, workers and priests. All without ever once dipping into the game's production and trading systems, which lurk beneath the surface of <em>Europa Universalis</em> like the bulk of an iceberg.</p><p>Oh, I also had a family to marry off, a complicated alliance with France to maintain, kids to educate, a cabinet to oversee, parliaments to organise and massage votes through, 500 years of scientific research to read over, uprisings to quell, roads to build, navies to maintain. Even on this icing-only diet, there's a LOT TO DO.</p><figure><figcaption>There are hundreds of Kingdoms and nations you can play as, so getting customised events like this one is very fun</figcaption></figure><p>I'm not just listing all of that here for the quantity's sake; it all feels consequential. I could always see the reactions to my decisions: shifting prices affect people's welfare and happiness, leading to revolts or migrations or both, and spending money on education got me a more literate population and loads of visible benefits as a result. I have no idea how robust any of this is on a long-term basis--to reiterate once more, I did not come close to surveying this game in its entirety--but it certainly looked and felt real, empowering even.</p><p>With its lack of a fully-fledged character system and a (relatively) simple approach to fighting wars, it may lack the personal touch of <em>Crusader Kings </em>or the brutal satisfaction of <em>Hearts of Iron</em>, but <em>EU5 </em>is still Paradox at their best: giving the player a place and time in human history and letting them not just live through it, but dictate its terms.</p><p>I played this game a lot over the last month, and what I played, even with its limitations, I loved. I can see myself playing a lot more in the years to come, maybe even enough to fully understand how to play whole sections of it and be able to report back with a better idea of what this game eventually becomes, not what it is at launch.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump"><h3>EA Says It Will Retain Creative Control Following Saudi Sale, But, Like, Come On</h3></a><p>Big companies have shown time and time again that they'll say whatever is necessary to get mergers approved</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-halo-white-house-trump-vance"><h3>And Also, Who Even Cares About Halo And Lord Of The Rings These Days</h3></a><p>"All of these things do have a feeling of dragging and resuscitating a corpse"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-tactics-grind-jp-mandalia-plains"><h3>I Will Grind In Final Fantasy Tactics Every Single Time And You Cannot Stop Me</h3></a><p>Final Fantasy Tactics without grinding Mandalia Plains is like a day without sunshine.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/us-government-halo-jd-vance-hasan-piker-dog"><h3>We Have Never Been More 12 Years Old</h3></a><p>In the same week government agencies coopted Halo, now we've also got JD Vance weighing on in CollarGate</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5]]></content:encoded>
