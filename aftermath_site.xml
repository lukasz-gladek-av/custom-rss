            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman James Comer is summoning the CEOS of Discord, Steam, Twitch and Reddit to Washington. A full committee hearing is scheduled for Oct. 8, at which Comer and the committee will ask Discord CEO Humam Sakhnini, Valve president and cofounder Gabe Newell, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy, and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman “explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes,” <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/chairman-comer-invites-ceos-of-discord-steam-twitch-and-reddit-to-testify-on-radicalization-of-online-forum-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per a press release published on Wednesday</a>.</p><p>The hearing “will examine the radicalization of online forum users, including instances of open incitement to commit politically motivated acts,” per the release, in the wake of what Comer described as “the politically motivated assassination of Charlie Kirk.” Alongside the news release, the committee published the four separate letters it sent to each of the company’s leaders. At the hearing, each person will be able to give a five-minute opening statement before answering questions from committee members.</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to the four companies for confirmation of their CEOs’ attendance.&nbsp;</p><p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in the shooting death of Charlie Kirk, allegedly <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2zkxy2xmno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confessed to the crimes on Discord</a> in a private chat with friends. In another chat, he joked about being the killer’s doppelganger. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/tyler-robinson-set-face-formal-charges-shooting-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBI director Kash Patel said Tuesday</a> that the bureau is investigating members of the Discord servers; <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/charlie-kirk-suspect-discord-messages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord said</a> it found "no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord.”&nbsp;</p><p>But Discord and other gaming platforms have been thrust into the spotlight as authorities and lawmakers attempt to decipher an extremely online culture they largely don’t understand. Robinson reportedly etched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/777313/charlie-kirks-alleged-killer-scratched-bullets-with-a-helldivers-combo-and-a-furry-sex-meme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memes and references to video game culture </a>into the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/us/politics/kirk-shooting-suspect-motive-messages.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bullets </a>he prepared for the shooting: “Hey Fascist! Catch!” followed by a series of arrows that appears to reference a stratagem code in <em>Helldivers 2</em>; “Notices bulges OwO what’s this?,” a copypasta parodying furry culture; “Bella ciao,” the title of an anti-fasict Italian folk song popularized by video games and a Netflix series; and “If you Read This, You Are GAY Lmao.” The messages inscribed on these bullets are shitposts and extremely online in-jokes, something Robinson even admitted to in a text message exchange quoted in <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26098820/robinson-indictment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">court documents</a> published this week: “The fuckin messages are mostly a big meme, if I see ‘notices bulge uwu’ on fox new I might have a stroke.”</p><p><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-tyler-robinson-discord-reddit-memes-2000625746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Utah governor Spencer Cox described Robinson</a> as a person who was involved in “deep, dark internet, the Reddit culture, and these other dark places of the internet where this person was going deep.” He also said “clearly there was a lot of gaming going on.” Friends described Robinson as “very, very big into gaming,” like lots of people are.</p><p>Gaming and gaming-related platforms like Steam, Discord, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-profitable-layoffs-interview-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch</a> are used by millions of people daily, largely by <a href="https://aftermath.site/infinity-nikki-bubble-season-1-5-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people commiserating about their favorite games’ latest bad update</a>, organizing gaming sessions, and sharing sometimes incomprehensible memes. That’s not to say that these platforms don’t have a problem with radicalization; <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/far-right-took-over-steam-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report published in 2021</a> found that Steam, Discord, and Twitch hosted extremist activity that ranged from “racially abusive livestreams to open support for neo-Nazi terrorists.” In 2022, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/senator-asks-gabe-newell-why-steam-hosts-so-much-neo-nazi-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Hampshire senator Maggie Hassan wrote an open letter</a> to Newell asking about its moderation of extremist content.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, a mass shooting in a Buffalo grocery store was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/15/business/twitch-livestream-buffalo-massacre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broadcast</a> live on Twitch. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49998284" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A German synagogue attack was livestreamed</a> on the platform in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, seven lawmakers <a href="https://kotaku.com/congress-extremism-harassment-ea-playstation-xbox-riot-1849901765" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attempted to grill game makers</a> on their role in extremism and harassment in online spaces in a letter addressed to executives of Activision Blizzard, Roblox, Take-Two Interactive, Epic Games, Electronic Arts, Microsoft, Innersloth, and others. Very little came of the letter; <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-gaming-171a384a-6013-4a04-a3d7-ef4d7c69513e.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S. Congresswoman Lori Trahan told Axios in 2023</a> that she was “disappointed that the majority of companies [that responded] failed to address some of our most urgent questions, including providing us with their policies around extremism, as well as transparency reporting around the topic.”&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/samuel-deats-anime-animation-horses-kiss-scene"><h3>What’s Harder To Draw: Horses Or Kisses?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Florida attorney general James Uthmeier has filed two lawsuits targeting companies that make, distribute, and process payments for porn video games. <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-james-uthmeier-files-complaints-against-pornography-websites-violating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uthmeier announced</a> on Monday that he’d filed lawsuits against both Lusty Heroes, which hosts a porn game of the same name, and its payment processor Segpay in one complaint and PornHub owner Aylo, which runs porn game platform Nutaku, in another.</p><p>Uthmeier claims in a news release that the companies are “openly violating Florida’s age verification law” that requires websites to ask users to verify their age using “a commercially reasonable method.”</p><p>These complaints <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/08/05/florida-porn-crackdown-age-checks-ignored-by-top-sites-ag-says/85522404007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">follow Uthmmeier’s first lawsuit against a porn website</a> that he says violates Florida’s age verification laws, which went into effect on Jan. 1.</p><p>“We passed strong legislation to keep kids from being exposed to harmful and toxic material, and instead of following it, these platforms ignored it,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “We are taking them to court to make sure they cannot continue bypassing Florida’s common sense safeguards.”</p><p>Aylo, which owns PornHub and Nutaku, said Nutaku (and a second website listed in the complaint, SpiceVids) comply with Florida’s laws, <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/09/15/florida-targets-porn-video-game-websites-under-child-safety-law/86167331007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to a statement provided to the Tallahassee Democrat</a>. Aftermath has reached out to Aylo, Nutaku, <em>Lusty Heroes</em> distributor Gethins Limited, and payment processing company Segpay for comment. Aylo told the Tallahassee Democrat that Nutaku’s games with explicit content “represent less than the statutory threshold,” meaning that it’s in compliance because the law doesn’t apply. The threshold in Florida is that the law applies to websites in which more than a third of its content is “harmful to minors,” <a href="https://www.freespeechcoalition.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Free Speech Coalition</a>.</p><p>Nutaku obviously has a lot of porn games, but as the Free Speech Coalition wrote, the laws are vague enough that it can be unclear what meets the threshold. “Whether ‘content’ is defined as bytes, images, web pages, video files, or something else entirely is likely to have to be decided by a court if/when a lawsuit is filed against a non-compliant site,” it wrote on its FAQ page about age verification laws.</p><p>"We intend to vigorously defend against these allegations in court," Aylo told the Tallahassee Democrat. "These platforms are committed to ongoing compliance with applicable state laws. We look forward to presenting the facts through the appropriate legal process."</p><p>Uthmeier is looking for fines of up to $50,000 per violation in each case.</p><p>Nutaku is one of the more popular porn game platforms; as of 2020, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nutaku-50-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it announced it amassed more than 50 million users</a>. It uses a special currency when selling its games. Instead of buying directly, a customer purchases gold coins that are then used to buy games. To use a processor like PayPal or Apple Pay, <a href="https://www.nutaku.net/gold-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gold must be purchased <em>off</em> Nutaku, through a third-party site</a>. Nutaku hosts all sorts of free and paid games across genres. <em>Lusty Heroes</em>, on the other hand, is a singular browser game that is free to play. Segpay, which describes itself as “one of the most reputable adult payment processors,” is listed on the <em>Lusty Heroes</em> website as the “authorized sales agent for access to <a href="http://lustyheroes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lustyheroes.com</a>.” That is, presumably, why Uthmeier listed it in the <em>Lusty Heroes</em> complaint, though the exact connection beyond that is unclear; he says it “facilitates” the distribution of the game. Segpay is listed as a Florida business.</p><p>“SegPay has yet to be served with any formal complaint and maintains a policy of not commenting on pending or threatened litigation,” Corey D. Silverstein, who represents Segpay, told Aftermath.</p><p>More than 20 states now have laws requiring age verification for sites deemed to be harmful to minors, which has caused some websites, <a href="https://www.aylo.com/assets/files/age_verification_fact_sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like other porn websites</a> and social media platform BlueSky, <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/25/bluesky-blocks-access-mississippi-free-speech-privacy-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to block access in several states</a>. Credit card companies and payment processors have also played a major role in the censorship of adult content and games online, too, perhaps to head off litigation like the lawsuit now against Segpay. In July, <a href="https://aftermath.site/itch-io-nsfw-adult-content-remove-payment-processors-collective-shout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">independent video game platform Itch deindexed</a> most of its adult content and wholesale removed others after “scrutiny from [its] payment processors regarding the nature of some content.” Valve similarly had recently removed a bunch of games from its platform, too, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-introduces-new-rule-prohibiting-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-that-might-make-visa-or-mastercard-unhappy-financial-deplatforming-in-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">again citing regulations from payment processors, credit card companies, and banks</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/samuel-deats-anime-animation-horses-kiss-scene"><h3>What’s Harder To Draw: Horses Or Kisses?
