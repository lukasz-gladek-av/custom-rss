            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-ai-business-ed-zitron<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“What a time to be alive,” I regularly say, exclusively ruefully, about drawing breath in the year 2025. I’m sure you do, too. The planet is on fire. The internet has devolved into an AI-generated slop puddle. Everything costs too much, and also it’s all busted. A mass of inconveniences have congealed to form a crisis, but if there’s one silver lining, at least we know where to point the finger: management types who spent the past several decades ushering in this tedious, wasteful world. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we talk about why they need to go.</p><p>This time around we engage in a savvy act of brand synergy by bringing on <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/reality-check/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extremely vocal AI critic</a> and friend of the show Ed Zitron to celebrate the release of <a href="https://aftermath.site/buy-destroy-ai-shirt-aftermath-kim-hu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath’s new “Destroy AI” shirt</a>, which we made in conjunction with <a href="https://kim-hu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim Hu</a>, an incredible (human) artist, and are very proud of. We eventually get around to talking about the extra-shimmery AI bubble, but first: <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em>. Ed started watching it recently, and three-fifths of Aftermath have been obsessed with it for years, so obviously we’ve got to ramble like a runaway train about the good (cool powers, clever fights, fun characters), the bad (a season that you can cut the entire middle out of), and the ugly (baby poop jokes) of the incredibly idiosyncratic anime.</p><p>Then we discuss the societal rot AI continues to inspire, with <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kids cheating their way through school</a>, normies <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/notalawyer.bsky.social/post/3loltnrk6zs25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having no idea what hallucinations are</a>, and vulnerable people being <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-spiritual-delusions-destroying-human-relationships-1235330175/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talked into believing they’re god</a>. Still, Ed doesn’t think this thing – or at least, the companies undergirding it – can last. The people in charge have no idea what human beings actually want or need, and that will come back to bite them eventually.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we discuss <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-analysis-details-rockstar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a>, which is a departure for the series in that it seems like a romance between two legitimately likable main characters. But can it sustain such an intimate dynamic in a game where you’ll inevitably end up murdering 9,000 dudes? I guess we’ll see!&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can turn “Destroy AI” into an entire designer fashion label.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ed:</strong> We’re in the era of the business idiot. The business idiot controls everything. The business idiot is so excited about AI. Why? Well, AI’s transformational power. What is that power? I need to take a phone call! I will be right back, but when I’m back I will tell you about the power.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://x.com/levie/status/1919573650547622130" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a tweet</a> from [Box CEO] Aaron Levie: “AI lowers the barrier to getting started on anything, which means people start doing far more. But to do great work still has a long tail of execution, judgment, creativity, and knowledge about the specific domain, which means AI replaces far fewer jobs than we think.”</p><p>What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck does that mean?</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>That just slid off of my brain.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I started thinking about what I’m gonna have for dinner.</p><p><strong>Ed: </strong>This is exactly it, though. There are people out there that that’s what they want to read. It doesn’t mean anything, but it makes them feel good about… management? They think that management is “I’ve read enough LinkedIn stuff, and I’ve been to enough conferences that I am now manager mode, and my people under me are doing good, and if not, I’ll get them fired. And then they’ll bring me new people that can be fired if I do anything wrong.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> “This is definitely not a sign that I’m doing something badly every time and that sometimes the people are just good enough that they overcome all the unnecessary obstacles I place in their path.”</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I have a very good friend who’s in a management position, and I think what differentiates her, specifically, from a bad manager is that she understands that her job is helping individual real human beings do their best possible job at work. And she spends a lot of time, on an individual basis, working with these people so that they can feel empowered to do their jobs and feel enriched by their work.</p><p>I’ve also worked with managers of the kind you described that clearly see me as an anonymous human resource, and I do daydream about throwing a giant steamroller at them.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> That’s what all the going to the gym is for: to help you lift the steamroller. Eventually you’ll be like “Alright, I’m strong enough. Today’s the day.”</p><p><strong>Ed:</strong> But anyway, Clubhouse, fucking pointless, but everyone agreed on it. Metaverse, same deal. Crypto, same deal. AI, same deal, except AI has more of a product. The same theme through all of this is that the people making the calls and telling us what the transformative future will be are not participating in it. None of these people! None of them!&nbsp;</p><p>Now, AI allows them to, to an extent; these middle managers love it because they can make it look like they did a job. It can make them look productive, which usually they’d have to do by being in an office. Usually they’d have be like [faces of consternation] and it’s 7:05 PM when they could have left at 6 PM.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Staring at <em>Minesweeper </em>on their computer screen like “This is the hardest decision I’m gonna make all year! Argh, it blew up.”</p><p><strong>Ed:</strong> Looking at a Word doc and you can’t quite see the words, but if you look closer, it just says, “Notes. Work today?”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s that <em>Spongebob </em>bit where he’s writing for hours and then it’s like “THE–”</p><p><strong>Ed: </strong>The thing is, what’s happening right now was inevitable. It was inevitable that we would eventually get a situation where real people who do stuff would get overwhelmed by people who don’t. And it goes beyond the fact that they want to automate labor. It’s beyond that because they don’t understand what labor they want to automate. They don’t understand what it is they’re trying to do. They’re like “You just write fucking content, right? I can just have AI do this. Suck my asshole.”&nbsp;</p><p>And it’s like, why do you think people read words? “For information, right?” Sure, OK. How do you think words provide that? Is it that they’re written with a purpose? “Yes, but AI can do that.” Can it? Is there purpose behind anything AI does, other than a prompt? No. Why do people like my writing? It’s because I am writing it. It’s because it is my voice, and I’m explaining things so that they understand a message that I have in my head. Same with you.&nbsp;</p><p>I think we’re watching what happens when the people who don’t really understand work control everything. There is no reason to really do this AI stuff. No one’s making the money. It’s popular, I guess, but in the way where if everyone agrees to do something, something is popular.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>The macarena was popular. A lot of things get popular.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ed: </strong>And even then, you didn’t have CEOs being like “Let’s all do the macarena once a day to improve corporate happiness.” But I think if Sam Altman told them to, they’d consider it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-analysis-details-rockstar"><h3>A Video Game Trailer Maker’s Take On The Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer</h3></a><p>"If this was a better trailer, then people would be that much more hyped.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-infinity-nikki-community-isn%E2%80%99t-boycotting-they%E2%80%99re-girlcotting.1185702/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/infinity-nikki-bubble-season-1-5-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been more than a week since <em>Infinity Nikki</em> developer Infold Games released its 1.5 update, which introduced multiplayer, added new outfits and customization options, and put the game on Steam. Called the “Bubble Season,” the 1.5 update <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1khdxdu/ethics_boycotts_gacha_and_infinity_nikki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t go over as planned</a>: <em>Infinity Nikki</em> players were immediately incensed by a bevy of bugs and general game instability, and made even more angry by several baffling changes to both the story and its monetization structure.</p><p>The <em>Infinity Nikki</em> community isn’t boycotting; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NSTzhJR1DI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they’re <em>girlcotting</em></a>. It’s a term that’s been partially used in jest, partially to get around what some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0unckb-w2Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players say is Infold Games censoring the word</a> “boycott” on its official forums and community spaces. Players globally are vowing to stay off the game until Infold Games addresses their concerns, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueVoabK9Fro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including at least one <em>Infinity Nikki</em></a> creator who is part of the game’s partner program.</p><p>What does it mean to girlcott? Of course, it means not logging into <em>Infinity Nikki</em>. And if you do, crucially, not spending money. Players are also attempting to warn other off of the game; the Chinese <em>Infinity Nikki </em>community – as well as others – has been flooding Steam with negative reviews of the game:.“Do not play this game if you do not want to be exploited,” one user, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198929196594/recommended/3164330/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who claims to be part of the Chinese boycott</a>, wrote on Steam. “Our voice should be heard.”&nbsp;</p><p>There are some people, too, who are attempting to get the message in-game, using in-game messaging to send jestful subliminal messaging: “aGaIn in staRLight, Crystal and gOld shine TogeTher,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1kgbekj/subtle_enough_to_not_get_banned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one player wrote</a>.</p><p><em>Infinity Nikki</em>, the latest in a long running series that's been mobile-only for decades, released in December 2024. The game came to Steam in late April, alongside the unpopular “Bubble Season” update. The game launched on Steam to mixed reviews; the complaints are also impacting <em>Infinity Nikki</em>’s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infoldgames.infinitynikkien&amp;hl=en_US&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review score on the Google Play Store</a>. (Reviews remain high, at 4 stars, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/infinity-nikki/id6502622570?see-all=reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the Apple iOS Store</a>; a lot of the problems are tied to the Steam release and attached 1.5 update, but impact all versions of the game.)</p><p>The <em>Infinity Nikki</em> development team quickly issued a response to players’ concerns at the end of April, with <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1917238176168677669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a spokesperson writing on X</a>, “We understand that every stylist’s love and trust in <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is something we must cherish and uphold with the utmost dedication.” The company said it’s working to fix the patch’s performance issues, which have caused game-breaking bugs for some players.</p><p>The message also attempted to explain some of the development team’s more unpopular decisions. You see, <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is a gacha game, but instead of pulling characters to play as, you’re rolling for pieces of outfits. You have to spend currency to roll for these pieces, and while you <em>can</em> earn currency in-game, it’s not often enough, which means players end up spending real money to get more pulls. Most outfits range from nine to ten pieces of clothing, but the new update added two 11-piece outfits. To put it simply, it now costs more to collect the full outfit from the gacha system, especially given that players often look to collect outfits multiple times, to “evolve” the outfit. To make matters worse, Infold Games’ new customization system, which lets players dye outfits, requires <em>another</em>, newly-added currency.</p><p>The team didn’t address the use of a new currency, but did say they wanted to “provide stylists with greater freedom in outfit design.” In response, the <em>Infinity Nikki</em> team also gave players some free currency, but there’s been problems there, too: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1kgze93/all_of_us_after_they_started_penalizingbugged_our/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Players say Infold had a bug in this distribution</a>, which awarded players too much free currency. Instead of letting players keep that – it was Infold’s mistake, after all – they deducted the currency, some of which players had already spent, putting them in the negative.&nbsp;</p><p>But the community is looking for more from the studio; it wants an acknowledgement of the “dumpster fire” of a situation, as one <em>Infinity Nikki</em> player told Aftermath, but also wants some of the biggest problems reversed. The original statement simply isn’t enough for <em>Infinity Nikki</em> players; they don’t see it as true accountability for the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Infold Games has not responded to a request for comment.</p><p>Despite being a gacha game, <em>Infinity Nikki</em> and its team has earned a lot of goodwill from its player base up until now — something that is, indeed, somewhat ironic, given the game's genre. <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is a gacha game; a gacha game is not inherently bad, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1khdxdu/ethics_boycotts_gacha_and_infinity_nikki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but as Reddit user girlrevolution wrote</a>, the monetization system can be viewed as inherently predatory. <em>Infinity Nikki</em> has been considered by its players less predatory because the game <em>can</em> be played without spending a cent. The new update pushed the gacha system much too far for a lot of players — something made more egregious by the numerous bugs and strange gameplay changes.</p><p>Several players told Aftermath that they felt Infold listens to the community, even if the community didn’t always agree with Infold’s decisions. The earlier Nikki games, <em>Love Nikki</em> and <em>Shining Nikki</em>, earned the developer a reputation for beautiful clothing and complex, sometimes wacky storytelling. “I’ve been around for a while,” Daisy, who’s been playing <em>Nikki</em> games for nearly a decade, told Aftermath. “I’ve put up with a lot of Infold’s crap when it came to the prices in their games.”</p><p>Another <em>Infinity Nikki</em> player, who asked to have her name withheld, told Aftermath that the new update pushed the monetization structure over the edge. She said <em>Infinity Nikki</em>’s gacha systems wouldn’t be <em>that</em> bad compared to other gacha games, if <em>Infinity Nikki</em> only had one “monetization scheme.” Instead, everything seems to cost <em>something</em>, so the added currency for dying outfits felt particularly bad. “[It’s] particularly egregious because it’s painfully obvious that dyes were originally supposed to be tied to resources you could collect in game,” she said. “Someone craved short term profit so much that they decided to just dump that in the trash.”</p><p>Daisy said it would take up to $300 to $400 to earn all the color options of a single 5-star outfit in <em>Infinity Nikki</em>. Regarding the new 11-piece outfits, Daisy believes the new items are simply a money grab. “The dresses on these banners are floor length, so the stockings added were unnecessary, and one of the dresses was shown, in earlier cutscenes, to not have stockings,” she said. “To me, they artificially inflated the suits so players would spend more money.”</p><p>Beyond the problematic monetization strategy, players Aftermath spoke with said they’re also pissed off at a major change to the start of the game. The original story set up Nikki’s transportation into Miraland as an accident that happened as she searched for a dress for a ball; the dress she found tucked away in the attic ended up sending her into the new world. But Infold Games removed the game’s original start with the update; the new intro drops players into <em>Infinity Nikki</em> with little context and a new, unexplained character who is supposed to be a guide as Nikki is dropped into intergalactic limbo.&nbsp;</p><p>Some players think this is a total retconning of the story they’ve come to consider <em>Infinity Nikki</em>’s lore. And it’s wildly confusing.&nbsp; Daisy said, “It’s honestly really, really confusing, and I have almost ten years of <em>Nikki</em> story in the recesses of my mind.”</p><p>Another <em>Infinity Nikki</em> player, Dia, put it this way: “It just feels like Infold has destroyed whatever was enjoyable about the game, story and characters; broke every promise to deliver enjoyable experience in the future; forced to release a very broken patch that is almost unplayable to a lot of people; and all of that was done just to focus on asking more money for time-limited gacha.”</p><p>The big problem for a lot of players isn't simply that they don't want to spend money on <em>Infinity Nikki</em>. The community at large isn't upset that <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is a gacha game; they're upset that the trust they've given Infold Games thus far has been broken.</p><p>"I put money in this game because I liked the product and felt that I could support them from an ethical standpoint, but that is no longer the case," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1khdxdu/ethics_boycotts_gacha_and_infinity_nikki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">girlrevolution wrote</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-ai-business-ed-zitron"><h3>We’re In The Era Of The Business Idiot</h3></a><p>"We’re watching what happens when the people who don’t really understand work control everything"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-analysis-details-rockstar"><h3>A Video Game Trailer Maker’s Take On The Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer</h3></a><p>"If this was a better trailer, then people would be that much more hyped.
