            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fortnite-app-store-return<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After five years, <em>Fortnite</em> returned to the Apple App Store today. As someone who woke up one morning in August 2020 and tossed up a <a href="https://kotaku.com/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store-1844717397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quick blog</a> about Epic introducing its own payment system on mobile, a niche news hit that quickly spiralled into multiple high-profile court battles between massive companies that dragged on for years, I don't know what I'm going to do with myself now.</p><p>The <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1924949632628523199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fortnite</em> Twitter account </a>announced the news this evening, linking to the game on the App Store. As of this writing, I couldn't find it when I searched "Fortnite," but I was able to find it by searching for Epic Games.</p><p>The game's return follows a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruling</a> at the end of April that Apple was disobeying the orders from the 2021 ruling in the case by <a href="https://aftermath.site/apples-new-app-store-policy-is-petty-as-hell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking a large commission</a> from purchases outside the App Store and overly restricting how developers could point users to alternate payment systems. Following the April ruling, Epic <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1920878504284975585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">submitted</a> <em>Fortnite</em> to the App Store once again, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-pulls-resubmits-fortnites-us-app-store-request-after-not-hearing-back-from-apple-all-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">withdrew and resubmitted it</a> when Apple didn't reply to the request. Yesterday, the judge basically <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/19/apple-fortnite-epic-games.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered Apple to figure it out</a>, and now here we are. In the meantime, <em>Fortnite</em> has been playable on <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-phones-eu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some mobile devices</a> in the US and in the EU on Epic's own mobile storefront, though none of this has been as widespread or as seamless as the App Store.</p><p>To make myself the protagonist of this news story: It's kind of a big moment for me. That very first blog led me into my first foray into reading court documents, and I followed every update of the case for months, spending my weekends tediously reading through filings and looking up every legal phrase I didn't know. When one of the earliest rulings came down, I actually had a nightmare that I'd missed it, only to wake up in the middle of the night and realize I <em>had</em> missed it. The day the <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-thats-happening-in-the-apple-vs-epic-case-1846856678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trial</a> started I was at New York's Javits Center, listening to the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-epic-vs-apple-hearing-is-already-a-disaster-1846811839?_gl=1*ptlplv*_ga*NTc0Nzc5NjU1LjE3NDM3OTkzOTY.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc3ODA5MzgkbzYzJGcxJHQxNzQ3NzgyNjczJGoyMiRsMCRoMCRkY1EtUlFvM1VFcmEyYzRPTWtvNWRzNExseWpnVjkyNzk4Zw.." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disastrous call-in line</a> while waiting to get my first covid shot. By the time the judge decided the case I had left Kotaku, and I found myself frantically posting my way through the court documents on social media while visiting my parents. When they asked what I was doing, I said "working," and they politely reminded me that... no I wasn't, because I didn't have a job, which was one of the first moments my departure from Kotaku really sunk in. I feel like I grew alongside this case as a journalist, while I probably devolved a little as a person, boring anyone who would listen with why, yeah it's that game with all the dances, but <em>listen</em>, Epic's arguments are actually kind of a <a href="https://aftermath.site/epic-google-app-store-ruling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big deal</a> if you care about tech monopolies.</p><p>And now here we are. I don't know what I'll do with all my freed-up brain space, or all the time I'll get back now that I won't feel pressured to constantly keep tabs on Tim Sweeney's Twitter. Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661032/apple-epic-games-app-store-antitrust-ninth-circuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appealed</a> the April ruling, so we'll see if this is really the end, but fittingly, writing this blog has made me late to meet some friends, whom I will absolutely bore to tears with this latest update, and who will humor me politely while wishing I would stop talking about this.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/going-rogue-galactic-andor-star-wars-rogue-one-tabletop"><h3>Tabletop Game Going Rogue Puts The Revolution Back In Star Wars</h3></a><p>Jess Levine, designer of Going Rogue, talks political organizing and taking the Disney out of Star Wars</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/web3-nft-crypto-game-fail-close-scam-snake-oil"><h3>Oh No, Anyway</h3></a><p>'What went wrong?'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-ai-darth-vader-star-wars-epic-games-sag-aftra"><h3>Fortnite’s AI Darth Vader Has, Predictably, Been A Comedy Of Errors</h3></a><p>Swears, slurs, and an unfair labor practice – all in just a few days</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wind-breaker-shonen-anime-toxic-masculinity"><h3>This Shonen Anime Fights Toxic Masculinity</h3></a><p>Wind Breaker is a shonen anime where teenage boys talk about their feelings while punching toxic masculinity in the face.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/going-rogue-galactic-andor-star-wars-rogue-one-tabletop<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Weeks ago, I found myself playing revolutionary over Discord. I was playing Choli, a Charli XCX-esque spy running a nightclub wrapped in layers of gregariousness so that no one would suspect her. What I would be roleplaying that night was the final night of her life.</p><p>I was playing <em>Going Rogue</em>, a companion for the tabletop roleplaying game <em>Galactic</em>, which is inspired by the <em>Star Wars</em> universe. I had been invited to play by the game’s designer, Jess Levine, who had previously asked me to write a piece of fiction as a setting supplement for the game’s physical edition, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/galacticgoingrogue/galactic-and-going-rogue-two-ttrpgs-of-war-among-the-stars?ref=echmoi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is being Kickstarted right now</a>. <em>Going Rogue</em> intrigued me specifically because it was inspired by <em>Rogue One</em> and <em>Andor</em>—in particular,<em> Going Rogue</em> has a mechanic baked into the game where your character is more or less guaranteed to go out in a blaze of glory for the cause.</p><p>“<em>Going Rogue</em> is a game where your characters are fated to die at the end,” Jess told me over a Discord call. “That was one of the things that I wanted from the very beginning, because I was having those feelings, like, was any of this work that we did worth it?”</p><p>Jess first started developing this game during the first Trump administration and the protests for George Floyd. In her experience as a political organizer, she often felt the absence of the kind of catharsis you might get while watching a movie like <em>Rogue One</em>. In a fictional setting, you can know for sure that a character’s sacrifice has been worth it. In real life, you never really know if you’re planting the seeds of trees whose shade you’ll never sit in, or just digging yourself a big hole.</p><figure></figure><p>“With <em>Going Rogue</em>, I was having the emotional struggle of like, was this worth it? And so what I wanted in the design of the game was that I could feel the catharsis, the bleed,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>She explained that “bleed” is a tabletop gaming term for when “you experienc[e] the emotions of your characters, and it bleed[s] out into real life. I wanted to design the game in a way that, as your character realized that they were willing to voluntarily sacrifice their life for this, you were narratively guaranteed by the mechanics that that sacrifice was worth it. You get to see, after they die, how it transforms the galaxy. I wanted you to get that feeling because you don't get that certainty in real life.”</p><p>Levine says that she knows that there are limits to the kind of change one can effect by designing a left wing tabletop roleplaying game. She didn’t make this game to convince anyone to become a socialist, but instead to create an emotional tool that serves as a mirror for the players’ own feelings about what it means to devote your life to a political cause.</p><p>“<em>Going Rogue</em> asks you to design your character, design your world, what you see in it, what you want and what you are struggling with in participation in the struggle, and you feel feelings that you are feeling outside of <em>Going Rogue</em>,” Levine said. “For people who aren't already organizers, it's a fun game, a game that lets them play in some cool themes.”</p><p>Like Levine, I am a huge fan of <em>Star Wars</em>. As every <em>Star Wars</em> fan knows, being a <em>Star Wars</em> fan means you hate <em>Star Wars</em> as much as you love it. <em>Going Rogue</em> was also a way for Levine to work out her issues with the series that inspired these games.</p><p>“You can reskin <em>Going Rogue</em> to be all the original stuff [from <em>Star Wars</em>]. I prefer, at this point, to play it not in canon <em>Star Wars</em>,” Levine said. “And also, there are things I hate about canon <em>Star Wars</em>. I think it sucks that the Jedi are child kidnapping, sexless acetics!”</p><p>In particular <em>Going Rogue</em> is a remix of <em>Rogue One</em>, which depicts the lives of a group of rebel agents who give their lives for the rebellion before the original trilogy.</p><p>“I love <em>Rogue One</em> and I hate <em>Rogue One</em>,” Levine said. “I was just watching that movie and like, watching that conflict happen in these meetings Mon Mothma and everyone else, and I was like, ‘This is what I'm going through in the organizing spaces I'm in right now.’ And that's super compelling.”</p><figure><blockquote><p><em>Going Rogue</em> aims to do more than just allow players to 'fix' <em>Star Wars</em>’s narrative problems.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In playing <em>Going Rogue</em>, you assemble a group of characters who don’t all agree with each other, or maybe have nothing in common with each other than their commitment to the rebellion against a fascist dictatorship. When I was developing Choli in the playsession that Levine invited me to, I was thinking about how to create a character who would deliberately push people’s boundaries and invite friction into conversations. This galactic party girl was someone who was brutal and ruthless, hiding her ability to manipulate and coax information out of people behind charm and opulence. I envisioned her as someone who feels self righteous about how much she has given to the cause, inviting the ire of people who put themselves in physical danger.&nbsp;</p><p>This is basically the kind of character that I wish was in a <em>Star Wars</em> story, but doesn’t ever appear. For Levine, <em>Going Rogue</em> was partially an exercise in fixing the things about <em>Rogue One</em> and <em>Star Wars</em> in general that bother her—especially <em>Rogue One</em>’s lead character, Jyn Erso.</p><p>“Jyn is a terrible character,” Levine said. “This is, from what I can tell, because of a series of rewrites. In the original version of <em>Rogue One</em>, she is a rebel from the beginning and is very committed. And when Gilroy came in, he wrote this character who is more ‘I'm cynical and jaded, and they're forcing me to be here,’ but you end up with a mishmash.”</p><p>Levine said that one of the playbooks for <em>Going Rogue</em> is based on the Gilroy version of the character: the Leveraged.</p><p>“Leverage is defined by the fact that someone is forcing them to be here,” she said. “They are being leveraged, but they have something in their heart, and you get to choose during character creation, what it is that challenges even their cynicism.”</p><p>It doesn’t escape Levine’s notice that this is, essentially, the story of Cassian Andor, lead character of the acclaimed Disney+ series <em>Andor</em>, which has just finished its second and final season. Levine said that she thinks that the <em>Andor</em> show made good on the promise of Jyn Erso’s arc, showing how someone can go from being blackmailed into a cause to being so committed that he ends up giving his life for it.</p><figure></figure><p>But <em>Going Rogue</em> aims to do more than just allow players to “fix” <em>Star Wars</em>’s narrative problems. It also allows players to explore this narrative of rebellion without having to interface with an evil entertainment empire: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/andor-star-wars-leftist-radical.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney</a>.</p><p>“I put this whole crowdfunder together in five months because Disney announced that <em>Andor</em> season two was premiering April 22 and [<em>Galactic </em>creator Riley Rethal] and I had always been like, it would probably be good for us, from a business perspective, to release the physical edition around <em>Andor</em>,” Levine said. “So I start putting it together in late December, early January, and then Riley messages me and goes, ‘Did you see that Disney+ is now on the BDS list?’”</p><p>Currently, Disney+ is a priority target on the <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BDS boycott list</a>, which asks supporters of the rights of Palestinians to economically and culturally divest from Israel. Disney+ is a priority target because of Marvel’s <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> and Disney’s <em>Snow White</em>.</p><p>“[These movies] star actors Shira Haas and Gal Gadot, respectively, that have consciously and irrefutably taken up roles as cultural ambassadors for Israel, directly representing genocidal Israel’s propaganda efforts,” the statement on the <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/Guide-to-BDS-Boycott" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BDS website</a> reads. “For <em>Captain America</em>, Marvel and Disney are reviving the racist character of Ruth Bat-Seraph, whose decades-old backstory includes working for Mossad. Disney+ is therefore clearly implicated in enabling Israel’s genocide by<a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/global/palestinian-filmmakers-accuse-hollywood-dehumanizing-gaza-israel-1236120786/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> dehumanizing Palestinians</a>.”</p><p>Jess Levine and Riley Rethal have both <a href="https://bigbadboycott.carrd.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already participated in a boycott</a> meant to pressure a tabletop roleplaying game convention into making a statement against Zionism, and wanted to figure out a way to make this game compliant with the ongoing BDS boycott. Eventually they settled on including a statement about the BDS boycott that encourages people to cancel their Disney+ subscriptions every time they mentioned the Disney-owned <em>Star Wars</em> property. They both found that including that statement led to people leaving comments about canceling their Disney+ subscriptions in solidarity with the BDS boycott.</p><p><em>Going Rogue</em> is an opportunity for <em>Star Wars</em> fans to make the story of <em>Star Wars</em> their own, including making it more in league with their own politics by taking Disney out of it.</p><p><br>“Something I like about tabletop role playing and adaptational tabletop role playing is it says, ‘Actually, fuck them. They don't get to own this thing,’” Levine said. “We can't fully divest from the connection to <em>Star Wars</em>. Obviously, we are downstream of it in certain ways. But we are also trying to say, fuck [Disney’s] ownership of this thing that you love.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/web3-nft-crypto-game-fail-close-scam-snake-oil"><h3>Oh No, Anyway</h3></a><p>'What went wrong?'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-ai-darth-vader-star-wars-epic-games-sag-aftra"><h3>Fortnite’s AI Darth Vader Has, Predictably, Been A Comedy Of Errors</h3></a><p>Swears, slurs, and an unfair labor practice – all in just a few days</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wind-breaker-shonen-anime-toxic-masculinity"><h3>This Shonen Anime Fights Toxic Masculinity</h3></a><p>Wind Breaker is a shonen anime where teenage boys talk about their feelings while punching toxic masculinity in the face.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
