            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/mobile-suit-gundam-gquuuuuux-pronounce<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Despite my reputation as an anime sommelier, I’m still developing my palette for all things <em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em>. As a show of receipts, I’ve watched all of the very yuri (<a href="https://kotaku.com/gundam-witch-from-mercury-characters-lesbian-anime-1850707971" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">despite Bandai Namco’s protests</a>) <em>Revolutionary Girl Utena</em> spiritual successor, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI_BM736Unw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Witch From Mercury</em></a>, <em>Iron-Blooded Orphans</em>, <em>Thunderbolt</em>, <em>08th MS Team</em>, <em>Hathaway’s Flash</em>, stray episodes of <em>G Gundam</em> on Toonami, Netflix’s <em>Requiem For Vengeance</em> (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/netflix-gundam-requiem-for-vengeance-ending-explained-spoilers-2000515554" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regrettably</a>), roughly 13 episodes of the OG anime, and the first episode of <em>Wing</em>. All that to say, I have yet to even <a href="https://gizmodo.com/every-gundam-timeline-explained-anime-mecha-1849487550" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scratch the surface of <em>Gundam</em>’s 45-year history</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t get it twisted: The above is not a flex. It’s a cry for help from someone with intermediate-level <em>Gundam</em> enjoyer status desperately reaching across the aisle on behalf of the rest of the anime community, who’ve collectively asked themselves how the hell you pronounce the name of the new Gundam anime movie in theaters.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in December, Bandai Namco, Studio Sunrise, and Studio Khara jointly announced their three-way team-up on the next mecha series in the <em>Gundam </em>franchise. If the sheer aura of the aforementioned studios weren’t enough, it is co-written by anime juggernauts like <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>’s <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideaki Anno</a> and <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=4290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yoji Enokido</a> of <em>FLCL, Revolutionary Girl Utena</em>, and <em>Sailor Moon</em> fame. It’s directed by <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuya Tsurumaki</a> (a director for numerous <em>Evangelion </em>episodes and assistant director on <em>FLCL </em>and <em>Diebuster</em>), mecha designs from <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=3734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ikuto Yamashita</a> (<em>Evangelion </em>and <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>), and character designs by <em>Pokémon </em>illustrator, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=85937" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take</a>. The only problem is that the anime (and the compilation film of its early episodes) is called <em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Capital GQ, six Us, capped off with a distinguished capital X to tie the whole vowel-heavy thing together. Is it pronounced “jee-kuuk-ecks” like “Jeez, anime and those kooky mechas?” Do you have to have watched more anime to get it, or is there some untapped phonetic diction unuttered by meager English-speaking tongues to make sense of how to say this anime’s goddamn name? The fuck.</p><p>To make sense of this mess, I asked <a href="https://gizmodo.com/author/ursus-veritas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>io9</em>'s deputy editor James Whitbrook</a> to teach me how to say <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> and SparkNotes the significance behind its esoteric name.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption> © GKids/Bandai Namco FIlmworks<span></span><a href="https://x.com/G_GQuuuuuuX/status/1879136381609644540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunrise/Khara</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> So, what is up with the new <em>Gundam</em> anime's vowel-heavy title? How do you even pronounce that?</p><p><strong>JW:</strong> The katakana for the series title is “ジークアクス”, which is pronounced “Jīkuakusu”–we don’t have an English dub yet to see how it’s specifically pronounced, but it’s basically “G-Kwux” as we’d understand it.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> Is there lore significance behind the name, or is it simply anime nonsense?</p><p><strong>JW:</strong> It’s actually kind of both! The title itself is just a bit of stylization–it’s the official designation of the suit, but no one in the series is saying “G-Kwuuuuuuuuuuuuux” as long drawn out thing or anything. But the name itself comes from a computer science term, Qux, a metasyntactic variable in programming. “Qux” itself is a common placeholder word in coding designed to be replaced at a later date for regular use.</p><p>It makes sense for the show–not to get too deep into spoilers, but the G-Qux itself is a prototype mobile suit when we first encounter it, being used in testing a special piloting interface when it crosses paths with the protagonist, Machu.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> Is <em>Gquuuuuux</em>'s pronunciation ever brought up by the mecha animation warlords behind the series or the characters in the movie for reference?</p><p><strong>JW:</strong> Yes! It’s referred to by name quite a few times, and is referred to as the G-Qux more than it is a Gundam so far. In fact, there’s a few characters we meet early on that are also confused about its name, so it’s not just us viewers who need to get used to it.</p><figure><figcaption> © GKids/Bandai Namco FIlmworks<span></span><a href="https://x.com/G_GQuuuuuuX/status/1874108891673608415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunrise/Khara</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> Are there any other <em>Gundam</em> anime with strange names worth explaining, or is <em>Gquuuuuux</em> in a u-shaped league of its own?</p><p><strong>JW:</strong> The GQux definitely stands out as particularly odd for a mainline <em>Gundam</em>, but there’s tons of mobile suits across the franchise that have peculiar names that have just become part of the franchise, like the Palace Athene, The O, the Agguguy, the Gelgoog, the Hamma Hamma… The Universal Century shows (those set in the same continuity as the original 1979 <em>Gundam</em>) in particular love some odd names.</p><p>My personal favorites come from <em>Turn A Gundam</em>, the series’ 20th anniversary mainline entry. It’s set in a timeline heavily implied to be a far future of the original <em>Gundam</em>, so a couple of familiar mobile suits appear in the show, but the characters have no clue what their names are, so they give them totally new ones–the Capule became the Kapool, the Zaku became the Borjanon. And that’s even before you get to the show’s actually wildly-named suits, like the “WaD” Walking Dumpling, or stuff like the Mahiroo and Muttowooo. I love <em>Turn A</em>, more people should watch it.</p><hr><p>Mystery solved, and then some. Now go out onto the internet and “Um, actually” your peers into submission with your shiny new insight into the orthoepy of the new <em>Gundam</em> anime that you acquired from the good website Aftermath.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[This Irish Language Program From The 90s Is My New Favorite TV Show]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/irish-now-youre-talking</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-irish-language-program-from-the-90s-is-my-new-favorite-tv-show.1123887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/irish-now-youre-talking<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The journey that got me here isn’t important, but I’ve signed up for an introductory Irish language class that starts in a week. Because I’m an overachieving nerd, I decided to start digging around the language in advance, which has trapped me in a horrifying maze of words that aren’t spelled at all like they sound. But on the plus side, it has also led me to <em>Now You’re Talking</em>, an early 90s language learning series that I’m completely in love with.</p><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03znk3q/clips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Now You’re Talking</em></a> was apparently a BBC series tied to a now out-of-print language book. It is, in the nature of all beginner language scenarios, wonderfully surreal. In the first episode, adults walk up to playing children and chilling teens to demand to know how they’re doing; young people lurk around bus stops and bike racks to comment forcefully on the weather. The second episode features a scenario where a couple making out on a couch is constantly interrupted by the girl’s family as an excuse to say the words “brother,” “sister,” and “mother.” The show is narrated by a woman who has to have something to do while she’s explaining language to us, so in the second episode she’s randomly at the gym, walking on a treadmill and telling the viewer about how you ask for someone’s name. Because it’s the early 90s, everyone is in chunky sweaters and windbreakers.</p><figure><figcaption>A video game reference makes this a video game blog I guess</figcaption></figure><p>But my favorite regular <em>Now You’re Talking </em>segment is the story of Sean and Deirdre, two people who meet in the show’s town of An Baile Mór. In the first episode, Deirdre’s horoscope tells her “today the cavalry rides in” and that she’s in for some luck. That luck comes in the form of reaching for the same door as Sean, a man with a delightfully 80s haircut and outfit. They try to use the same payphone (<em>a payphone!)</em>; given his/our limited language skills at this point, Sean can’t make very much conversation, so he playfully takes her bag and then gives it back to her after her call. Then, because they can’t say much else, after she thanks him for giving back the bag he basically stole in some kind of wordless neg, she starts to walk away, and he can only call after her that it’s a nice day out even though they’re inside (Tá lá breá ann). She looks him up and down before agreeing it is (Tá) and then, desperate to say whatever the viewer will understand, he calls out what I <em>think</em> is him saying that it’s hot (Tá sé te), which is very confusing given that Deirdre is wearing a scarf, and she replies with immense flirtatiousness that it certainly is. The whole thing is wildly pregnant with subtext, but not <em>too </em>much, and it makes the whole interaction incredibly trippy.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Now You're Talking - Episode 1" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nz--LpYC30?start=1152&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In the second episode they meet again, when Deirdre is celebrating her parents’ anniversary and he’s the waiter at their restaurant (reader, I gasped!). Since the second episode is about how to introduce yourself and others, Sean says his name and then everyone stares at each other meaningfully until he walks away, because Deirdre doesn’t have the words to explain how they met. Later, Deirdre introduces her family, which feels like something you’d reserve for someone you’re actually dating and not a guy you talked about the weather with at a payphone. Sean makes small talk with her little brother about his identity, asking “And who’s this?" (Agus cé seo?) and “what’s your name?” (C’ainm atá ort?) the way you would for a kid who I feel like would be much younger than her brother seems to be. (Her brother, it should be noted, appears to be wearing a baseball cap with a radio and headphones fitted in, complete with an antenna.) Deirdre’s dad threateningly informs Sean that Deirdre is his daughter (I’ll be honest here, I have no idea how to spell what he’s saying, but I did understand it!), which causes him to gulp and ask for their order.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Now You're Talking - Episode 2" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-WjR1XVOrU?start=1239&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>When the family leaves the restaurant after the meal, they can’t talk about what occurred in any detail because we don’t know any of those words yet, so they grin and say their goodbyes and remind each other how they’re related. Also, there’s some kind of weird lineup across the street that makes it look like the whole town is watching the interaction. <em>But then</em> Deirdre passes back by the restaurant and Sean bluntly suggests coffee (a word we haven’t learned, but which is easy to sound out), to which she eagerly agrees (Cinntae).&nbsp;</p><p>I am on the absolute edge of my seat here. <em>Now You’re Talking</em>’s narrator says the third episode will involve learning about how to say where you live and how to give your phone number, which I hope bodes well for what will surely be an incredibly awkward date given Sean and Deirdre’s limited language skills. Obviously <em>Now You’re Talking</em> isn’t the first show to employ an ongoing narrative to help teach viewers language, but it’s such a good move to get me invested, and the structure of an ongoing meetcute is such a good way to slowly introduce new language concepts.</p><p>Apparently there are multiple different dialects in Irish; <em>Now You’re Talking</em> uses the Ulster dialect, but I don’t know which one my class will be in, so there’s a good chance I’m setting myself up to be a version of the assholes who filled the Japanese class I ferociously failed in grad school 20 years ago, where kids far younger than me confidently asserted incorrect things they’d learned from anime while I could barely spell on my own name. Each roughly 20-minute <em>Now You’re Talking</em> episode I’ve watched so far has taken me hours to get through because I keep pausing to try to understand why the <a href="https://www.acleversheep.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fuaimeanna-agus-litriu-202011.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spelling</a> sounds the way it does, which I doubt a handful of conversational short classes at a local community center will focus on. I wouldn’t say that it’s taught me Irish yet, but this morning I walked around my apartment muttering “Tá sé fuar” (It’s cold) to myself, which is technically speaking a foreign language! I’m so excited to learn more, and <em>so</em> excited to find out what will happen to Sean and Deirdre next.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
