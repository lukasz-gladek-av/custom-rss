            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-walmart-coke-pringles-why<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the stranger storylines to come out of today’s Switch 2 launch – aside from <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-box-staples-gamestop-replacement-launch-1851783684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">receipts being stapled to <em>the device itself</em></a> at a GameStop – has been preorders from Walmart, specifically, arriving with unexpected cans of Coca-Cola and Pringles. Tiny treasure troves of them, in some cases, according to posts across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l3wmqn/walmart_added_pringles_coke_to_my_switch_2_order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/4brandonjs4.bsky.social/post/3lqufnkjo5c2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zhugeex.com/post/3lquqlkl6rk26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>. Why, though? I asked Walmart.</p><p>A Walmart spokesperson told Aftermath that this was, indeed, an intentional companywide effort, rather than a cheeky instance of a few stores going rogue. They said Coke and Pringles were “included in all deliveries” for the purpose of creating a “feel-good moment.” Though the rep did not specifically mention <a href="https://www.cbr.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent Switch 2 preorder cancellation woes</a>, one could surmise that Walmart might have felt more pressure to create a feel-good moment than usual.</p><p>Why Coke and Pringles specifically, though? No matter how widespread gaming becomes, Gamers – as a singular monolith and, of course, voting block – will never be able to shake certain stereotypes.</p><p>"We kinda know the stereotypical gamer, and of course they're gonna need snacks while they game," the Walmart rep told Aftermath.</p><p>All people who play games are not created equal – especially the wider-than-average audience that buys Nintendo products. There is a world in which some Switch 2 earlybirds might have preferred carrot sticks and sparkling water, and though the latter would make them reprehensible to me, personally, we have to respect that. However, by the same token, I doubt anyone has ever been upset to receive free chips and soda, so whatever. At least Walmart did not send them <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-ate-the-giant-game-controller-gummy-and-i-felt-like-1846282889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of these things</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sony-fight-stick-project-defiant-announced"><h3>I Need To Know If Sony’s Fight Stick Is Good Or Not</h3></a><p>Along with a new game from Arc System Works, Sony's announced their first fight stick code-named Project Defiant.
