      <p>The fact <em>Dwarf Fortress</em> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-most-ridiculous-patch-notes-from-10-years-of-dwarf-fortress/?utm_content=bufferc2ebf&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=buffer-pcgamertw" rel="noreferrer">has some incredible patch notes is not a new thing</a>, but even by this game's lofty standards, the latest round of fixes is some wild shit.</p><p>As part of the game's Siege Update, earlier this week some minor patches were also applied, and they include the following:</p><blockquote>Fixed crash when loading certain historical figures from the disk.</blockquote><blockquote>Fixed an occasional crash when doing multi-stage construction.</blockquote><blockquote>Fixed issue where battering ram operators could get stuck in ground when the ram turns.</blockquote><blockquote>Stopped brewing jobs from searching for improper items.</blockquote><p>All fine. Normal patch stuff. The final one, though, is:</p><blockquote>Stopped babies born in fort from worshipping extra deities.</blockquote><p>I have so many questions. Why are they <em>born </em>worshipping any deities at all, let alone <em>extra </em>ones? How have they become aware of them, intravenously? If that's normal, why is worshipping <em>one </em>OK, but not others? </p><p>I need answers. Or...do I? Maybe I should just stop asking questions. Maybe I should just accept that this is the universe the game has made for itself and marvel at the beauty of it:</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/reki.gay?ref=aftermath.site"><span>@reki.gay on bsky</span></a></figcaption></figure>
