      <p><em>Blue Prince</em>, as outlined by our own Chris Person in <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review/"><u>fittingly meticulous detail</u></a>, is a marvel. It’s also a game whose ending has <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending/"><u>proven elusive</u></a> both structurally and thematically. But there is a light at the end of the epically lengthy tunnel – at least for creator Tonda Ros.&nbsp;</p><p>When I asked Ros at DICE in Las Vegas last week if <em>Blue Prince</em>’s brain-pulverizing labyrinth contained any remaining secrets, he reacted with a coy smile.</p><p>“[Players] have certainly mined it pretty well,” he told Aftermath. “Now, is that well enough? I’m gonna leave that for future generations to answer.”</p><p>But <em>Blue Prince</em> will get one last major update before Ros gracefully bows out.</p><p>“There is a little bit still coming that I’m working on – some final touches on the game before I button it up and move on to more projects,” he said. “So even if the people mining [for more secrets] currently turn up empty handed, there will at least be something on the horizon that they can look forward to.”</p><p>This is not to say that Ros feels like he asked players to solve a puzzle sans all the pieces at launch. His goal was to release something that felt complete in a sense that harked back to bygone days; updates, in his mind, are about polish and clarity.</p><p>"I really wanted to get it all in for launch, and I feel like that was my ultimate desire, because I really like the old-school games where they put it out there, and that's the game,” he said. “It's definitive from day one. It's on a disc, and it's timeless. Obviously we have a big temptation in the modern world: You can continually update and tinker with your things, and oftentimes maybe tinker too much, and you'll start dividing your audience. So I really tried my hardest, but it's my first game. Ultimately, it wasn't worth the crunch. ... [I decided to] focus on bugs and catch up on my own time afterwards. But it's gonna be one big final update, and then it's gonna be final forever."</p><p><em>Blue Prince</em>’s last update, Ros said, will not stray from the game’s current path; the plan is just to refine what’s already there.</p><p>"Nothing I'm going to do will fundamentally change any of the narrative according to the structure,” said Ros. “It's mostly just polish details. There'll be a couple more cinematics because I didn't have time to do all the cinematics I planned. I really want to put everything I wanted into the game. ... So I'm gonna finish my vision on the cinematics, and that'll provide more details for people. But fundamentally, I made sure from day one that all the puzzles were in the game – all the narrative and overall structure."</p><p>There’s a reason Ros wasn’t able to include absolutely everything he’d mapped out in <em>Blue Prince</em>’s release version: He was already working himself to the bone.</p><p>"I was working, I think, 80 hours a week for eight years straight," he said.</p><p>Whatever comes after, he added, will necessarily dial things back at least<em> a bit</em> in terms of ambition.</p><p>"<em>Blue Prince</em> will likely be the most ambitious game I ever make, because I don't think I physically can do this again,” Ros said. “It was an incredibly long journey, so it might take as much time [to make my next game], but I certainly won't be working as hard. ... That's just not sustainable now. It's a young man's game."</p><p>Still, Ros, a filmmaker who decided to devote eight years of his life to his first major video game project, hasn’t burnt himself out on games yet.&nbsp;</p><p>“The recognition [<em>Blue Prince</em> has received] certainly helps the decision, but I think I did fall in love with game development,” said Ros, who had just received the DICE game design and independent game awards. “I come from a filmmaking background, but game development just suits me really well. It’s fun to take your time and to be able to fulfill your vision without the stress of running a set. I just kind of love it right now, so I’ll continue doing it as long as I find it enjoyable.”</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending/"><div><p>Does Blue Prince Never End? - Aftermath</p><p>There is so much more to Blue Prince than its stated goal.
