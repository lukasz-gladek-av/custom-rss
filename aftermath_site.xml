      <p>The PS1 was an unrivaled time for soundtracks that go incredibly hard. Games like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurhMeaUThM&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Ridge Racer Type 4</u></em></a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://youtu.be/CuOd_mTABn8?si=plEy7cxdS7K60IZX&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>No One Can Stop Mr. Domino</u></em></a>, <em>Ape Escape</em> (and basically anything that Soichi Terada ever did), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S5ZpFWA16g&amp;list=PLDD61C76EF278E530&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Ace Combat 3 Electrosphere</u></em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9avhp8QuAlk&amp;list=PLF8A81FAC049FB959&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Ghost in the Shell: Megatech Body</u></em></a> all punch well above their weight. Hell, even the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seanseanson.bsky.social/post/3me56ggnr222z?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Animorphs</u></a> game kinda goes. In that vein, if you have never listened to the soundtrack to <em>Sheep, Dog 'n' Wolf </em>AKA<em> Looney Tunes Sheep Raider</em>, you should correct that right now because it contains at least one incredible heater.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wwidcxa3fmY?list=PL8D92393BACD4F09D" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption><p><span>Banger.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><em>Sheep, Dog ‘n' Wolf </em>was a bizarre celshaded stealth action puzzler that came out in 2001 starring Ralph Wolf (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Wolf_and_Sam_Sheepdog?ref=aftermath.site"><u>NOT Wile E. Coyote</u></a>) and described at the time by Infogrames’ Director of Marketing as “E-Rated Metal Gear.” The soundtrack was done by a musician named Eric Caspar, and though a lot of it feels like boilerplate production music, it does have bangers.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Game Informer gave it a 7.25!

It is unclear what this track is called or if it has a name, although I have seen a few sites like KHInsider and Discogs cite it as “<a href="https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/sheep-dog-n-wolf-original-soundtrack?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Fronzy Last</u></a>/Fronzylast_v3.” The track itself appears in the Planet X stage later in the game, which you can see by watching this speedrun attempt.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4usCfvJrSJk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Sheep, Dog 'n' Wolf (Sheep Raider) — Any% Speedrun in 35:00 [Former World Record]"></iframe></figure><p>Anyway, enjoy this oddly specific track that keeps appearing in my YouTube suggested feed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>This week, a peculiar rumor picked up steam: Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced sex trafficker with <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"><u>connections</u></a> to a plethora of the world’s most powerful men, is still alive. Why? It appears that a <em>Fortnite </em>account believed to be his was <a href="https://x.com/DissidentMedia/status/2019520779550122024?ref=aftermath.site"><u>online as recently as last year</u></a>. Today, because we live in a world gone mad, an official Epic account let conspiracy-addled X The Everything App users know that, no, this is not the case.</p><p>"This was a ruse by a <em>Fortnite </em>player,” <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2019817972831780952?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>said the official Fortnite Status account</u></a> in response to a since-deleted tweet echoing the conspiracy theory. “A few days ago, an existing <em>Fortnite </em>account owner changed their username from something totally unrelated to littlestjeff1, following the revelation of littlestjeff1 as a name on YouTube. These Fortnite trackers only display your current name, not any prior changes to it."</p><p>“Littlestjeff1” is a handle that appears over 20 times in the Epstein files, albeit largely <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00629064.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>in association with Epstein’s YouTube account</u></a>. Additionally, at one point in 2019 Epstein appears to have <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02286126.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>purchased</u></a> $25 worth of <em>Fortnite </em>V-Bucks. This, plus an Israeli flag next to a correspondingly named player’s profile pic on unofficial <em>Fortnite </em>stat site <a href="https://fortnitetracker.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Fortnite Tracker</u></a>, was enough to convince many that Epstein was alive, well, and farming victory royales in Tel Aviv – confirming, in their minds, heaps of other rumors that Epstein never actually died. (Officially, Epstein <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Jeffrey_Epstein?ref=aftermath.site"><u>died by suicide in 2019</u></a>. Unofficially, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/flash-orange-caught-video-sparks-161703143.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALyLP-k-f8z1fQKIAqK6Qn6GIqwI_0c3p7frrz64laYitqq04Lzklf2h9fArvxMvMEEJhSk8OEsXL_PZAdZGH-RretfZoznN5kdmFCPZFS8_3iUb7VJs9nM_gPICtCElS9HeqMGK2AU8BicZPBj0W-SB7fzkyJLws3p4vGFfTQde&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>well…</u></a>)&nbsp;</p><p>“We have no record of the subject's email addresses referenced in the public document existing in the Epic account system,” the Fortnite Status account added. “Since the public document releases, people have created <em>Fortnite </em>accounts with similar-looking email addresses and user names.”</p><p>Epic CEO and <a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-x-ai-csam-epic-games-fortnite/"><u>prolific poster</u></a> Tim Sweeney also weighed in.</p><p>“Someone's been having fun renaming their <em>Fortnite </em>account,” he <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2019819940753379740?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>wrote</u></a>, “but it's recent and not connected to the email addresses in the archive.”</p><p>Extremely cool living in a society where public trust has eroded to the point that an official account of a video game for kids needs to wash its hands of a mess made by the massively corrupt oligarchy. Fortunately, this is absolutely the last time something like this will happen. Surely nothing weirder or stupider will happen next week, and the week after that, and the week after that, and the week after that, and the week after that, and–</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-friday-connoreatspants-interview-gavin-newsom/"><div><p>How Fortnite Friday Grew From A Bit Into An Institution That Could Pull Gavin Newsom</p><p>The unlikely rise of one of the internet’s best talk shows</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>
