            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'll admit my heart skipped a couple beats during Wednesday's Sony State of Play presentation: Once, when a presenter mentioned <em>The Last of Us</em> and I thought we were somehow going to get another remake, and again when I heard the phrase "Deus Ex" and briefly imagined that, <a href="https://aftermath.site/eidos-deus-ex-embracer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">against all odds</a>, a new game might be in the works. It's not, but a remaster is. On this week's Aftermath Hours, we talk about whether that's a good or bad thing.</p><p>This week, Chris and I are joined by Aftermath contributor Isaiah. We open with Chris being unable to resist talking more about <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-problems-runback-criticism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong</a></em>, and he also tells us how he's finding <em>Silent Hill f</em>. Then, Chris and Isaiah talk some <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/kiss-or-die-netflix-review-comedy-variety-tv-yakuza-like-a-dragon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yakuza</a></em> while I listen politely, because I have to stop trying to play games <a href="https://aftermath.site/crusader-kings-3-help-why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke likes</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to State of Play. Does Insomniac’s <em>Wolverine</em> need all that blood? Isaiah explains how the presentation's focus on the game's <a href="https://www.polygon.com/marvel-wolverine-blood-tech-insomniac-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood tech</a> might hit different to Marvel fans. Then we ask whether we need a <em>Deus Ex </em>remaster when it basically just makes a game from 2000 look like a game from 2004. Also, Chris is really into those <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/introducing-pulse-elevate-sony-interactive-entertainments-first-wireless-speakers-for-desktop-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speakers</a>.</p><p>After that, we talk about the continued fallout from Charlie Kirk’s assassination, with some game devs <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-gamergate-ghost-of-yotei-probablymonsters-fired" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing their jobs</a> over their comments about it, though not as many as in other fields. We also talk about what’s known about <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/the-ice-shooters-motive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the shooter at a Dallas ICE facility</a> this week, and how it feels like meme culture has taken on the role that video games once played in being blamed for violence. We also discuss <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/microsoft-blocks-israels-use-of-its-technology-in-mass-surveillance-of-palestinians" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft no longer letting the Israeli military use its tech for surveillance of Palestinians</a>, on the back of protest movements and reporting by The Guardian. It’s not enough, but it’s a start.</p><p>Chris then praises his new AirPods before we get to this week’s mailbag, where we give horror anime recommendations and discuss our favorite bridges.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank">Spotify</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lawyers-look-to-consolidate-dozens-of-roblox-child-exploitation-lawsuits.1309917/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Roblox</em> has a <a href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-sexual-exploitation-of-children-lawsuit-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predator problem</a>, according to the dozens of lawsuits filed against the game platform over the past year. Lawyers&nbsp; are looking to consolidate at least 31 different lawsuits filed in 12 different districts into one, big multidistrict litigation. The alleged victims in these cases are all different — and, crucially, all children — but the core of the lawsuits are the same: Parents are looking to hold Roblox accountable for its role in the abuses their children are alleged to have experienced on the platform.</p><p>“The case presents a matter of significant public concern involving a multibillion-dollar technology platform, Roblox, falsely represented as safe for children,” lawyers wrote in a newly filed document asking the court to consider consolidating the cases. “In truth, the platform’s design is alleged to be dangerously and unreasonably defective, providing a platform that enables adult predators to easily target, contact, and exploit minors.”</p><p><em>Roblox</em> is more popular than ever. <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/06/roblox-infrastructure-supporting-record-breaking-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">By Roblox’s own count</a>, more than 30 million people were using the platform in June 2025, a number that has since grown to a reported 47 million concurrent users, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/roblox-is-reportedly-bigger-than-the-entirety-of-steam-with-a-whopping-47-4-million-concurrent-users-almost-exclusively-thanks-to-two-games-steal-a-brainrot-and-grow-a-garden/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per unofficial data</a>. A large number of those people were pouring into two wildly popular games: <em>Grow A Garden</em> and <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> — they both can amass tens of millions of players at one time.</p><p>By design, <em>Roblox</em> is a space for socialization and play rather than a game itself. <em>Roblox</em> is a platform where its users can create games and other experiences. There are thousands of games and experiences, most of which don’t have the immense popularity (and millions of players) of <em>Grow A Garden</em> and <em>Steal A Brainrot</em>. But the promise of <em>Roblox</em> is that anyone can see this potential success, and anyone can play in the created spaces. It attracts a lot of children because of that simplicity, but it’s a space where adults congregate, too. Connection on the app is easy; part of the draw is that people can socialize with others while playing games. But, according to these lawsuits, Roblox isn’t doing enough to keep kids safe from the dangers that bad actors using the platform present.</p><p>Each of these lawsuits has their own individual claims and impacts, and separately detail the way in which a child allegedly met a predator on <em>Roblox</em> who later coerced and exploited that child. In one lawsuit, filed in September, <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/roblox-discord-lawsuit-teen-suicide-b2826315.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a mother is suing Roblox for wrongful death</a> after her son died by suicide following abuse by a 37-year-old man he met on the platform. In a different lawsuit, <a href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-sexual-exploitation-of-children-lawsuit-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a parent said that their child had been coerced and abducted across state lines</a> by a predator the child met on <em>Roblox</em>. The child later escaped. Other lawsuits detail alleged other sorts of exploitation and blackmail, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/air-force-member-charged-sexual-exploitation-nine-year-old-child-long-island" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including bribing children for explicit photographs</a> with money or <em>Roblox</em>’s currency, Robux. The common thread between all these lawsuits is the claim that Roblox is responsible because it failed in creating a space that was truly safe for children.&nbsp;</p><p>Multidistrict litigation is a strategy that’s designed to streamline the court processes in instances where a company is being sued by lots of different people in different districts. Lawyers <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24138572/video-game-addiction-lawsuits-2023-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attempted to consolidate a bunch of different video game addiction lawsuits</a> into a multidistrict litigation case in 2024, but the court panel denied the effort because the cases were levied against too many different companies. (The lawsuits can still continue on an individual level. Some have since been dismissed, while others are ongoing.) However, <a href="https://www.broughtonpartners.com/updates-on-video-game-addiction-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 100 lawsuits alleging video game addiction <em>were</em> consolidated</a> in the California court system in 2025; this consolidation is cited in the exploitation filings as proof that centralizing these lawsuits is appropriate.</p><p>A Roblox representative told Aftermath it “strongly disagree[s] with the characterization by the plaintiffs lawyers and will respond in court.” The company said it has implemented “over 100” new safety features “this year alone,” including age verification, AI tools to monitor voice chats, and the ability for parents to better control what their children have access to.&nbsp;</p><p>“While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing, and prohibiting sexual conversations,” a Roblox spokesperson told Aftermath in an email. “We also partner with law enforcement and leading child safety organizations worldwide to combat the sexual exploitation of children.”</p><p>On Tuesday, Roblox vice president of civility and partnerships Tami Bhaumik addressed the issue and Roblox’s improved safety measures while also claiming that the “negative press has come from things that have happened five years ago,” <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/roblox-negative-press-child-safety-old-events-1236527396/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Variety</a>.</p><p>As press around Roblox’s safety issues continues to grow, so does its userbase, making parents and lawmakers’ continued fight for accountability even more urgent. Alongside these parent lawsuits, Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/louisiana-attorney-general-sues-roblox-calling-platform-perfect-place-rcna225144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in August that she’s suing Roblox</a> over its alleged negligence. Oklahoma attorney general Gentner Drummond announced in mid-September that he, too, <a href="https://oklahoma.gov/oag/news/newsroom/2025/september/drummond-moves-to-hold-roblox-accountable-for-child-safety-failure.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is looking into legal action against Roblox</a> “over serious child safety concerns.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/palestinian-voice-in-games-coalition-helps-game-developers"><h3>New Coalition Seeks To Help Palestinian Game Developers ‘Speak Loudly’ Through Games</h3></a><p>Palestinian Voices in Games aims to ‘push against the dehumanisation of Palestinians’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/easy-delivery-co-impressions-review"><h3>Finding Peace In Work</h3></a><p>I've had a great time playing Easy Delivery Co.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/soulframe-bear-stomach-interview-digital-extremes"><h3>Inside The Soulframe Scene Where You Go Inside A Bear</h3></a><p>"There is a running gag that I watched over 40 hours of bear colonoscopy videos"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kiss-or-die-netflix-review-comedy-variety-tv-yakuza-like-a-dragon"><h3>Netflix’s Kiss Or Die Is Yakuza’s Cringiest Eroge Substory Turned Into A Full-Blown Variety Show</h3></a><p>A sketch show with comedians, AV actresses, and a high-budget production that's more insufferable than entertaining</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/roblox-child-exploitation-lawsuits-consolidation]]></content:encoded>
