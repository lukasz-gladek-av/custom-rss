The latest example of the company's slide comes from Australia, where Tesla sales have backslid a remarkable 72%, but<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/06/australian-tesla-sales-plummet-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> while reading <em>The Guardian's</em> report on those statistics</a> I was reminded of something else that has been bugging me for a while about these cars and their owners.</p><p>The story doesn't just revel in the massive sales decline--"Australian Tesla owners [are] troubled by the increasingly extreme rightwing politics of the companyâ€™s co-founder, Elon Musk"--but also interviews a few people who are recent Tesla buyers and who, in the wake of DOGE and Nazi salutes and everything else, suddenly feel ashamed to be driving a Tesla around.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/tesla-boycott-elon-musk.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> This is not the first or only interview of this type</a>; people all over Europe and North America are also waking up to the reality that they've spent a lot of money on a car that is now seen by a lot of <em>other</em> people as a symbol of white supremacy and an unchecked oligarchy. Womp.</p><p>Not content with being inwardly regretful, though, some of these Tesla owners with a particularly milquetoast strain of buyer's remorse have started putting stickers on their cars that say stuff like "Anti Elon Tesla Club" and "I bought this before Elon went crazy".</p><p>These people are the most perfect encapsulation of the dire state of political and media literacy that has helped lead us to these Bad Times.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/15/elon-musk-british-diver-thai-cave-rescue-pedo-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Elon Musk called a cave rescue hero a paedophile <em>seven years ago</em></a>. The company has faced multiple lawsuits and investigations over everything from<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/elon-musk-tesla-crash-1234930544/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> lying about its dangerous autopilot features</a> to<a href="https://milberg.com/news/tesla-ev-range-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> exaggerating their specs and stats</a> (in particular the range of the cars) to<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-workers-shared-sensitive-images-recorded-by-customer-cars-2023-04-06/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> privacy violations related to Tesla's inbuilt security cameras</a>.</p><figure><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/mar/02/tesla-owners-selling-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><figcaption>To their credit, some owners feeling strongly enough about current events ARE selling their cars, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/mar/02/tesla-owners-selling-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as this Guardian story reports</a>. </figcaption></figure><p>Musk went full Nazi as far back as 2022, when he purchased Twitter,<a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/115561/documents/HHRG-118-IF16-20230328-SD036.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reinstated a bunch of previously-banned abusers and fascists</a> and<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/elon-musk-great-replacement-conspiracy-theory-1234941337/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> began promoting white supremacist propaganda</a>. When it comes to Musk being a Nazi, and the company being<a href="https://observer.com/2024/12/elon-musk-tesla-overvaluation-election/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> more of a stock market con</a> than a car manufacturer, the writing has been on the wall for a <em>very </em>long time.</p><p>Unless you bought a Tesla a very long time ago, you don't get to do this.<a href="https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/tesla-model-3-ranked-least-reliable-ev-in-used-car-testing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Their cars have <em>always </em>sucked</a>, have been outmatched by rivals since at least 2021, and Musk has been very publicly heading down this path for a lot longer than many of these suddenly-regretful idiots have owned their cars. If you bought a Tesla in 2021-25 you made a bad decision, you don't read enough, you don't do basic market research, and now you're stuck with the consequences of that decision.</p><p>If these sticker-buying Tesla owners truly had a conscience, if they really felt that his Nazi sympathies were going to impact their own personal lives by association, they'd simply sell their cars, and if there was a financial hit to take, they would take it. Putting a sticker on the back while continuing to drive and pay for a Tesla is exactly the kind of empty gesture you'd expect from a liberal in 2025, the most meaningless act possible in the face of something that calls for genuine action, and it deserves as much mockery and scorn as...driving a Tesla.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/fiio-ft1-review-sennheiser-hd6xx-best-midfi-headphone-canjam"><h3>I Went To A Fancy Headphone Convention And Fell In Love With The Basics</h3></a><p>The classic Sennheiser HD 6XX and the new Fiio FT1 are the budget kings of headphones, beloved by many.
