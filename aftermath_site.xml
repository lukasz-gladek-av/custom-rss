            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week’s massive layoffs at Microsoft--<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and Xbox in particular</a>--was terrible for all kinds of reasons. Careers were upended (or even ended) for the workers and couples and families and friendships involved, with lives thrown into turmoil and months or even years of work thrown in the bin. For the wider gaming public,<a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-activision-blizzard-xbox-warcraft-rumble" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it means Xbox will have less studios releasing fewer games</a>.</p><p>As the dust has settled on the layoffs, we keep learning more and more about them, and the more we learn the more awful they become.<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-veterans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Stuff like the number of veterans affected, some with more experience than many of you have lived years on this Earth</a>. Or, as I discovered over the weekend, that Microsoft has (like many other gaming and tech companies) found new and innovative ways to fuck their workers over.</p><p>More and more companies around the world, but particularly in the United States, like to offer shares as a 'bonus' to their employees, an extension of their overall compensation. Come and work for us, this says, and keep working for us, and you'll be a part of the company not just on the timesheet but, in some small way, in terms of ownership as well. When it comes to companies like Microsoft, that can be a big deal; at time of posting, a single share in Xbox's parent company is worth $500.</p><p>There's a catch with these shares, though.<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vesting.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> They're usually unvested, which means that while you're <em>kinda </em>given them when you join, you don't <em>actually </em>get to sell them until they become vested stocks at a later time, often after years of service</a>. It's commonly known as a pair of "golden handcuffs", with<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-stock-unit.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the technical term being RSUs, or Restricted Stock Units</a>. And, surprising absolutely nobody, many of those affected by the Xbox layoffs last week had unvested shares.</p><p>So when they were laid off, they didn't get to keep those shares, or at least didn't get to keep most of them (sometimes workers are granted a certain percentage per year), a loss which in some cases (and depending on seniority and bonuses) could have been worth up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more. Instead, all these shares go right back to Microsoft, where they can be sold off to millionaires, billionaires or redistributed to the company's senior leadership.</p><p>As someone who works for a co-op website, and who has previously only worked for a small media company and the NSW Government, last week I had very little knowledge about this concept, so how it affected laid-off employees never even occurred to me. Until I saw a Linkedin post by Noble Smith, who had worked on everything from <em>Killer Instinct</em> to <em>Age of Empires</em> at Xbox, and who shared his story of thinking he had enough Microsoft stock to afford to put his "kids through college", but ended up losing it all when he was laid off in 2023:</p><blockquote><div><p>What happens to all of that unvested stock from the 9,000 people who were just laid off from Microsoft?</p><p>Well, the corporation gets to take it back.</p><p>Poof! Like a conjuror's trick. That promised payment for all your hard work is gone.</p><p>Xbox doesn't pay royalties to people who work on its games. Executives like Matt Booty tell Xbox workers in company meetings (whenever he is asked if Xbox will someday pay out royalties) that your royalty equivalents are the stock shares that you are granted at your signing and any stock shares granted as bonuses.</p><p>Great health insurance and the promise of yearly stock vesting: The twin rings in the Microsoft golden handcuffs. But when you're laid off that stock is as insubstantial as a dream. (And once your COBRA runs out, that amazing healthcare is an apparition too.)</p><p>I lost a small amount of unvested stock when I was laid off from Xbox in 2023. Small by normal standards. But enough to put my kids through college. With Microsoft stock at an all-time high, even a measly 10 shares is worth close to five thousand dollars. A lot of people who got laid off each had hundreds if not thousands of unvested shares.</p><p>And now Microsoft gets to reabsorb all of that vast wealth. Hundreds of millions of dollars? Billions?</p><p>Their coffers runneth over.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>"Microsoft actually did a great job letting you know exactly how many shares were granted, vested and unvested", Smith explained in a conversation with me. "That said, one of the most aggravating things about working there was the constant dangling carrot of those unvested shares. People might think that Microsoft just gives out heaps of stock to employees. Nope. Only if you’re at the executive level. The rest of us grunts had to work HARD to earn our shares. If the annual review cycle came along and you didn’t earn a stock award that year it was crushing."</p><p>"People at Microsoft look at their vesting schedules a lot!", he adds. "Those shares are your kids’ college tuition, or part of your retirement nest egg, or maybe even a down payment on a house. And it hurts when you get laid off with unvested shares that you had earned…but weren’t given enough time as an employee to finally receive."</p><p>I shared Smith's story on social media because the concept blew my socks clean off, and have since heard from many other former Xbox employees, employees of Xbox-owned studios and workers from other major video game companies that stuff like this is pretty common in the AAA space.</p><p>An employee at Bethesda, for example, says that despite the company being bought by Microsoft over four years ago, their promised shares are only just now materialising, and aren't even being <em>given </em>at all. Workers can purchase shares for a 10% discount, but then have to pay tax on them, which in the end works out to be a pretty bum deal.</p><p>Former workers at Bungie and EA (and EA-owned studios like Bioware) tell me they were also promised shares upon starting in their jobs, but upon being laid off--sometimes after <em>years </em>of employment--these had yet to vest, meaning they ended up worthless.</p><p>This is bullshit! To promise some ethereal form of compensation then so routinely (and cruelly) have it disappear in a puff of smoke leaving employees with <em>nothing</em>, sounds to someone from outside the US like it should be illegal. Especially since those shares just revert back to the company and ultimately end up in the hands of those who have, in some way (whether as an executive or a shareholder), contributed to the layoffs in the first place!</p><p>If you've ever experienced something like this in the video game industry and would like your story added to this piece, or have more details on Microsoft's policies with specifics to seniority and tenure, <a href="mailto:luke@aftermath.site" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please get in touch</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-kotaku-sold-endless-mode-microsoft"><h3>Games Media Actually Had A Good Week, For Once</h3></a><p>"Kotaku was sold to what is essentially a mom ‘n’ pop media company; Paste is owned by a guy"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there%E2%80%99s-no-reason-to-keep-putting-up-with-microsoft.1237755/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some moments force you to step back and take stock of a situation, and last week was as good (read: bad) as any: Microsoft announced that it’s<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> laying off another 9,000 people</a>, many of them in games. Meanwhile, Windows has been repeatedly enshittified, Office sucks, Xbox is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everywhere and nowhere all at once</a>, and the company is forcing AI down everybody’s throats, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ai-is-no-longer-optional-microsoft-is-allegedly-pressuring-employees-to-use-ai-tools-through-manager-evaluations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including those of its remaining employees</a>. It is also <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aiding and abetting a genocide in Gaza</a> via its Azure cloud and AI services. Nobody asked for this, and we don’t have to put up with it.</p><p>Recently, Luke argued that Microsoft should try <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-phil-spencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off one person</a>, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, instead of thousands. I don’t hate this idea! But I also immediately saw people reply to Luke’s piece by saying that Xbox president Sarah Bond and/or Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty are the real problem; Spencer is merely the smug face of this flailing operation. That in mind, I come to you with a slightly different argument: No matter who’s in charge, there’s no salvaging Microsoft or Xbox. The entire enterprise is rotten to the core.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if we keep our focus squarely on games, we’re talking about a behemoth that chose to scoop up a mindbogglingly large chunk of fertile game development soil. Recent standouts include the entirety of Activision Blizzard (an operation spanning well over 20 studios), all of Zenimax/Bethesda (which includes subsidiaries like id Software and Arkane), Double Fine, Obsidian, and inXile – all with no apparent long-term plan beyond digging a very deep hole. The story of Microsoft’s tenuous grip on third place has <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not been the games</a>; instead, it’s one of <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cuts</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closures</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>OK, that’s not entirely fair. Microsoft did sort of have a plan: Game Pass, a subscription service that was supposed to become the Netflix of games, but which so far has yet to transform the gaming landscape the way the latter did for TV and film. What if it did, though? What was the long-term play? Arkane founder (and current WolfEye Studios creative director) Raphael Colantonio recently summed it up by declaring the whole enterprise “unsustainable,” echoing a sentiment shared by many in the industry <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflix-of-games-a-threat-to-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for years</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think Game Pass is an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by [Microsoft's] ‘infinite money,’ but at some point reality has to hit," he <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941512826687980019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “I don’t think GP can co-exist with other models; they’ll either kill everyone else or give up.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft has proven <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-confirms-game-pass-cannibalizes-sales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hesitant to publicly admit</a> what common sense would infer to be true: Games included in a relatively cheap – <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though increasingly expensive</a> – subscription package sell less. Microsoft, meanwhile, insists that Game Pass is at least profitable on its own terms, but Colantonio believes otherwise.</p><p>"Game Pass is only [profitable] if you ignore the 100 billions that MS spent in acquiring content for GP such as Zenimax and Activision," he <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941599266004259310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Game Business’ Chris Dring added another layer to this dynamic: “I asked for clarification on the 'Game Pass is profitable' claim, and was told no first-party costs are included,” he <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1941933309900013850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “What they don’t count is the lost revenue that Xbox’s first-party studios are seeing as a result of the service. I have to imagine if first-party studios received similar compensation [to third-party studios on Game Pass], that profitability might not be correct.”</p><p>All of which is to say: Outside of funding indies – money that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/romero-games-reportedly-met-with-microsoft-just-a-day-before-the-publisher-pulled-funding-for-the-studio-and-there-was-no-mention-of-the-decision-that-put-over-100-people-out-of-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be drying up</a> – Microsoft’s presence has in the long run proven actively detrimental to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-delay-doesnt-mean-the-games-industrys-in-trouble-its-already-dead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what remains of the video game industry</a>, in some ways by design. As massive mega-corporations are wont to do, it viewed games as a spigot from which to fill its buckets with capital. The drought it left in its wake – closed studios, laid off employees, a dearth of future opportunities, and a less functional approach to game sales – would be none of its concern. And what do we have to show for it? A first-party slate that, outside of gems like <em>Avowed</em>, is more defined by misses (<em>Crackdown 3</em>), curious absences (<em>Fable</em>), and cancellations (<em>Scalebound</em>, <em>Everwild</em>, <em>Perfect Dark</em>) than anything resembling hits.</p><p>There’s just no reason to support Microsoft’s gaming endeavors at this point. It’s had plenty of time to get things right; it’s not going to. The company’s other endeavors aren’t looking great, either. I’m not saying you’ve got to uninstall Windows right this second, but there’s a wider, better world out there than the misanthropic product universe Microsoft would very much like us all to remain confined to. The best time to start divesting from Microsoft was years ago, or when its products first began sustaining Israel’s endless assault on Palestinians, or yesterday. The second best time is now.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-kotaku-sold-endless-mode-microsoft"><h3>Games Media Actually Had A Good Week, For Once</h3></a><p>"Kotaku was sold to what is essentially a mom ‘n’ pop media company; Paste is owned by a guy"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-game-pass-unsustainable]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideaki-anno-is-anime%E2%80%99s-ultimate-wife-guy.1237752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The anime and manga industry might not flaunt romances between its creators, but it certainly has its share of “it couples.” Arguably, the most beloved is the duo of <a href="https://x.com/catsuka/status/1882592418966675501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hunter X Hunter’s </em>Yoshihiro Togashi and<em> Sailor Moon’s </em>Naoko Takeuchi</a>. But during Anime Expo and Japan Expo weekend, I witnessed a quieter but equally powerful couple in <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> creator Hideaki Anno and his wife, acclaimed manga artist <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/2340/Moyoco_Anno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moyoco</a>, who showed off their bond in the most anime way imaginable: having Hideaki’s Studio Khara produce an animated short honoring the 20th anniversary of Moyoco's magical girl series, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-07-04/moyoco-anno-sugar-sugar-rune-manga-gets-new-anime-projects/.226309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Sugar Sugar Rune</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In tandem with Khara’s release of a CG prologue of <em>Sugar Sugar Rune</em>— directed by <em>Evangelion: 3.0+1.0: Thrice Upon A Time</em> CG director Yusuke Matsui—came with the announcement of the series getting a full anime adaptation. But as far as I and my Twitter timeline were concerned, the real headline wasn’t the adaptation. It was Hideaki being anime’s reigning “wife guy.” What I didn’t realize at the time though was that this sweet gesture was just one of many adorable, deeply supportive moments the Annos have shared over their 23-year marriage. Turns out, the couple’s love story has been quietly unfolding like a real life slice-of-life series, and they might just be my new favorite couple in the industry.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="『シュガシュガルーン』連載20周年記念短編映像「SUGAR SUGAR RUNE　Les deux sorcières」（ シュガシュガルーン  レ・ドゥー・ソルシエール）" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qidzapjAMVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In my own sleuthing on the couple over the weekend as Aftermath’s resident anime correspondent, I stumbled across this gem of a Twitter post. It referenced an old interview with Hideaki Anno, where he was asked about his ideal woman. Without hesitation, he simply replied, “My wife, of course.”</p><p>While this answer was the best he could have given, it hit me a little harder than I expected.&nbsp;Anno, like his mentor Hayao Miyazaki, is often reduced online to a caricature of himself—a brooding auteur with a mecha fixation and a backlog of unresolved self-esteem issues poured especially thick into <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>’s Shinji Ikari.&nbsp;</p><p>This was something else. This was the sign of a man who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideaki-anno-the-final-challenge-of-evangelion-is-the-inside-look-into-anime-creation-fans-need/1100-6495833/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">routinely oscillates between perfectionism and overwork</a> being visibly healed by his partner’s love. Somewhat tastelessly, some fans have joked about Moyoco needing to divorce him or something so his downward depressive spiral would yield another work like <em>Eva</em>, missing the entire point of how their partnership gave way to the rehabilitating theme of the <em>Rebuild </em>movies. The remakes of <em>Evangelion</em>’s narrative in movie form immortalized Anno’s love for Moyoco through <a href="https://evangelion.fandom.com/wiki/Mari_Makinami_Illustrious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mari Illustrious Makinami. </a><a href="https://note.com/anno_moyoco/n/n5d5c137b64ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Despite Moyoco and Khara’s pushing back</a> on Mari being literally Moyoco, she is still <em>a lot</em> like Moyoco.</p><p>On a surface level, Mari’s addition to the sequel-meets-remake animated films disrupted the long-standing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/comments/9u7ybg/rei_vs_asuka/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rei vs Asuka</a> discourse <em>Eva </em>fans are still debating over (<a href="https://youtu.be/abnEeNWxzNM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the correct answer is Misato</a>). However, knowing the real-life inspiration behind Mari makes her role resonate differently with me now. It’s not a stretch to see Shinji as a stand-in for Hideaki himself—an emotionally withdrawn guy burdened by legacy and locked in a strained relationship with his father. And then Mari comes parachuting into his life (<a href="https://youtu.be/4qK87ftbU5A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">literally</a>). She’s bold, irreverent, blunt, and tonally different from anything in the series. She doesn’t just shift the narrative into uncharted waters; she shifts its emotional current for the better as a chaotic symbol of new transformation breaking through the static of an otherwise doomed narrative.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Evangelion 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time ENDING" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XMmcwrb8OIs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In <em>Thrice Upon a Time</em>, Mari is the one who reaches out to a once-doomed kid along the way with gentle nudges as he finally makes peace with his father and steps into adulthood. Given that Mari was modeled after Moyoco, its ending, which shows the two as grown-ups <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmcwrb8OIs&amp;pp=ygUkdGhyaWNlIHVwb24gYSB0aW1lIGV2YW5nZWxpb24gZW5kaW5n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaving a train station hand in hand</a>, becomes even more meaningful. It also helps that his wife was a <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/3786/Shin_Evangelion_Movie_%7C%7C/characters#staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">character designer for the film</a> and is a <a href="https://www.khara.co.jp/info-en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managing director at Khara</a> alongside Anno’s friends <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-kazuya-tsurumaki-interview-2000593812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuya Tsurumaki</a>, Hiroyasu Kobayashi, and Nobuo Kawakami.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Characters from "Neon Genesis Evangelion" drawn by Moyoco Anno (Happy Mania, Sugar Sugar Rune,...) who is also Hideaki Anno's wife. <a href="https://t.co/6uht0UJ1nM">pic.twitter.com/6uht0UJ1nM</a></p>— Otaking 🇵🇸 (@TheOtaking) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheOtaking/status/1533526622057422851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2022</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Hideaki and Moyoco’s love is a collaborative and creative two-way street.

In it, she chronicles the quirks and joys of being married to Hideaki. My favorite moments from the manga was when she revealed that Anno wore <em>Kamen Rider</em> cosplay at their wedding, and that she helped him overcome his picky eating tendencies by introducing zucchini into his diet.&nbsp;</p><p>In a world where Hideaki is so often reduced to a creative who's at his best when he’s going through it like anime’s Adele, it’s genuinely heartwarming to see a different portrait emerge online of him, one which paints him in a softer hue. What’s more, Moyoco didn’t just “fix” Hideaki, as many have joked about online. As she notes, being with him helped her embrace her otaku soul.
