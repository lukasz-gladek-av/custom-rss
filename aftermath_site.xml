            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year, the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added Microsoft to its list of priority targets</a> due to the company’s entanglement with the Israeli military via Azure cloud and AI services. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A recent Guardian report</a> revealed the grisly details of said arrangement, claiming that Microsoft’s “cloud-based storage platform has facilitated the preparation of deadly airstrikes and has shaped military operations in Gaza and the West Bank.” Now game developers at Microsoft-owned studio Arkane, creator of <em>Dishonored </em>and <em>Deathloop</em>, have lent their voices to the chorus demanding that the company stop powering Israel’s assault.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/08/open-letter-from-the-arkan-studios-union-section-to-microsofts-and-its-subsidiaries-management/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an open letter</a> to leadership at Arkane, Zenimax, Microsoft Gaming, and Microsoft more broadly, workers unionized under French union STJV did not mince words about Israel’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians, lending their support to BDS and the Microsoft-worker-led <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No Azure For Apartheid campaign</a>.</p><p>“Arkane Studios’ STJV section joins BDS and the No Azure for Apartheid in their demands for Microsoft to stop supporting the Israeli regime,” Arkane workers wrote. “We think that Microsoft has no place being accomplice of a genocide, and as Microsoft employees, we don’t want to be part of this sinister project for Gaza. Moreover, we think it’s our responsibility, as tech workers, to raise the alarm, and to ensure that our technologies are used to make the voices of the oppressed heard, and not facilitate their demise. Finally, in a more direct manner, we think this could very well affect our life directly, by reducing the audience for our games, thus directly compromising the viability of Xbox Games, and, in the long run, our very own jobs.”</p><p>The letter includes a list of specific demands, which echo those of No Azure For Apartheid: an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, termination of all ongoing or future contracts with Israeli occupation forces, disclosure of all ties to the Israeli military, protection of pro-Palestinian speech within the company, and “a transparent, independent and public audit of Microsoft technologies, contracts, services and investments to make sure they are not used to violate the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols, and Microsoft’s own Human Rights Statement, in Palestine or anywhere else.”</p><p>Ultimately, Arkane workers believe that Microsoft should put its money where its mouth is.</p><p>"Microsoft has a responsibility toward its employees, as we have one toward the company,” Arkane workers wrote. “As stated in the company’s commitment to human rights, and regularly used in the company talk points, ‘Microsoft is committed to protecting fundamental rights.’ But so far, Microsoft has failed both its teams [and] its customers by being actively complicit of the invasion and war crimes happening in Gaza. If those core values are more [than] just talking points to sell more products, it is now more than due time for Microsoft to commit to them."</p><p>Of course, this is just an open letter. As it stands, nothing here is compelling Microsoft to turn over a new leaf that even comes close to matching the intoxicating aroma of ill-gotten cash. But these things have a way of snowballing. When Badru, the creator of open-world tactics RPG <em>Tenderfoot Tactics</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ice-water-games-tenderfoot-tactics-xbox-store-removed-bds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed his game from Xbox in solidarity with BDS</a> earlier this year, he told Aftermath: “Whether we're able to make Microsoft change or not directly, part of the point of targeting them is to be able to advocate around this and show these connections. Otherwise, nobody's interested in Azure Cloud. Nobody wants to talk about whatever Microsoft's bullshit AI is doing. These boycotts create opportunities for us to shine a light.”</p><p>Now news organizations <a href="https://www.972mag.com/microsoft-8200-intelligence-surveillance-cloud-azure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are investigating</a> <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%94-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%92%D7%A8-%D7%A9%D7%9C-8200-%D7%A2%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%AA%D7%99-%D7%9E%D7%99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure Cloud</a>, and mainstream coverage is shifting more and more to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/world/middleeast/gaza-starvation-aid-israel-netanyahu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critique and decry Israel’s actions</a>, especially its long-term starvation of Gazans. Meanwhile, international sentiment continues to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-says-no-starvation-gaza-amid-backlash-rcna224129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turn against Israel</a>. A letter like this both arises from and contributes to that slow cooker of pressure, as do possible future actions like work stoppages or strikes, which STJV-affiliated game workers have <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/02/struggle-pays-a-deal-was-found-at-dont-nod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employed before</a>. Eventually, even a behemoth like Microsoft will cave.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa"><h3>Hell Yeah, Another Blizzard Union</h3></a><p>Members of Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development team have unionized with the Communications Workers of America</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia"><h3>I Bloody Love The Drifter</h3></a><p>A homage to Lucasarts, John Carpenter and so much more</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-bookshop-impressions"><h3>Recommending Books Is The Best Part Of Tiny Bookshop</h3></a><p>Forget The Lorax, kid; it's time for classic architecture</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/microsoft-azure-arkane-israel-palestine-genocide]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Workers on Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development team unionized Tuesday, parent union Communications Workers of America <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzards-story-and-franchise-development-workers-form-latest-video-game-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>. According to the CWA, this makes them the “first in-house cinematic, animation, and narrative studio to form a union in the North American game industry.”</p><p>The new union is made up of 160 workers from Blizzard’s animation, in-house cinematic, and narrative teams, alongside series archivists and historians. “These workers are setting the standard for animation, cinematics, and storytelling across the video game industry, creating the breathtaking cutscenes, trailers, and other narrative content that fans have come to love,” said CWA Local 9510 President Jason Justice in a press release.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m excited that we have joined together in forming a union to protect my colleagues from things like misguided policies and instability as a result of layoffs,” said organizing committee member and cinematic producer John Giarratana, continuing, “I think that organizing gives us an opportunity to make our workplace better and safer.”</p><p>CWA says that Blizzard owner Microsoft has recognized the union, in accordance with the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labor neutrality</a> policy the company agreed to in 2022. In July 2024, <a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500 workers on Blizzard-owned <em>World of Warcraft</em></a> formed a union that they called “the largest wall-to-wall union at a Microsoft-owned studio,” alongside Blizzard QA workers in Austin. Other studios across Microsoft have also unionized in recent years, including at <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-union-unionize-fallout-elder-scrolls-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-online-studios-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeniMax Online Studios</a>, and ZeniMax QA, the latter of which finally <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a contract</a> in May after nearly two years of <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bargaining</a>. Unionized workers at Raven Studios reached a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/raven-software-workers-secure-first-contract-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contract with Microsoft earlier this month</a>.</p><p>In July, Microsoft laid off <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9000 workers</a>, with gaming divisions the hardest hit. These layoffs came on the heels of the company axing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659401/microsoft-layoffs-three-percent-workforce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">6000 jobs</a> in May. ZeniMax QA workers told Aftermath they were <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-zenimax-activision-blizzard-cwa-union-statement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">given no warning</a> about the July layoffs, and CWA president Claude Cummings Jr said in a statement that “We are deeply disappointed in Microsoft’s decision to lay off thousands more workers, including union-represented CWA members, at a time when the company is prospering.”</p><p><strong>Update 8/12/25, 4:10pm--</strong>Added the number of members in the new union.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia"><h3>I Bloody Love The Drifter</h3></a><p>A homage to Lucasarts, John Carpenter and so much more</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-bookshop-impressions"><h3>Recommending Books Is The Best Part Of Tiny Bookshop</h3></a><p>Forget The Lorax, kid; it's time for classic architecture</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa]]></content:encoded>
