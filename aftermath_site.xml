For one, it's held over a weekend, which is also the best time to go outside, see friends and hang out. Also there are also too many games spread over too many shows for even the most resolute of you to hope to sit there live and truly catch it all. </p><p>I found that this year, like any other year, the best thing to do was to skip it entirely and just catch up on trailers over the next few days at my own pace. In the spirit of this delayed (yet also emotionally restorative) approach, here are some of the coolest games I saw after SGF, not because <em>I saw them</em>, but because people I love and trust and who did blow their weekend watching commercials (thank you for your service) said "watch this trailer it's sick".</p><p><strong>WHEEL WORLD</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Wheel World - Official Release Date Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1DDmlRdgcNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>We’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/wheel-world-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written</a> about this game before,<a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-bike-trailer-pc-steam-xbox-ps-bicycle-game-italy-1850593884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> including a couple years back when it had a different name</a>. So not a brand new announcement, but still, I'm glad to see it's finally coming out, because it looks lovely.</p><hr><p><strong>PARALIVES</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Paralives - Release Date Trailer (Early Access)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uvGPV6qQuQM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I have also written about this game before.<a href="https://kotaku.com/paralives-a-new-sims-like-game-looks-cool-1843551132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> In, uh, 2020</a>. So I'm even gladder that this one is almost done, because while we could all do with a decent <em>Sims </em>competitor, it's <em>Paralives</em>' furniture and architecture tools that have got me most excited.</p><hr><p><strong>STRANGER THAN HEAVEN</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="STRANGER THAN HEAVEN - Title Reveal Teaser Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5L3XVVzsmHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Oh look, it's me writing up a RGG game announcement as the highlight of an event,<a href="https://aftermath.site/yakuzas-shopfronts-are-one-of-lifes-little-pleasures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> how off-brand</a>. From the original working title (<em>Project Century</em>) to the fact<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20jMxu3X6lA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> its trailers have been set 30 years apart</a> to the mysterious final revelation of the above clip, a lot of folks are thinking we're about to be signing up for some supernatural shenanigans. Just in case you've ever wanted to see a vampire kick a bicycle over a guy's head. </p><hr><p><strong>LEGO VOYAGERS</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="LEGO® VOYAGERS | Reveal Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bYggKzKdg08?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Builder's Journey</em> was <em>such a good LEGO game</em>, it was a shame to see it...well, not fail. It did really well by all accounts, but I feel like it deserved <em>more</em> recognition than it got when people's focus was perhaps diluted because it had<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Builder%27s_Journey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> such a staggered release schedule across various platforms</a>. Maybe the same team being given the chance to follow it up with <em>Voyagers</em>--a co-op adventure that looks to be making the absolute most of the license--will help make a bigger splash.</p><hr><p><strong>RELOOTED</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Relooted Announcement Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KgPxPfXb734?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>One of my<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqNBhMSzW3Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> favourite TV shows is called <em>Stuff The British Stole</em></a>. <em>Relooted</em> shares the same premise, only instead of asking for the return of historical relics nicely via the medium of television, you're taking the relics directly through the medium of heist.</p><hr><p><strong>MY ARMS ARE LONGER NOW</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="My Arms Are Longer Now | Frosty Games Fest 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RVdbXmz8U5s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Speaking of heists, here's another game about stealing stuff!
