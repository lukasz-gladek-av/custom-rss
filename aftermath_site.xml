            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/metaphor-jrpg-completionism<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is a perfectly reasonable JRPG with a <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-perfect-length" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">correct length</a>. Unlike its spiritual predecessor <em>Persona 5</em>, which <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/15221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overstays its welcome</a> by about 20 hours, <em>Metaphor</em> wraps up in <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/129956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">65-70 for the main story</a> — long by the standards of games generally but right in the sweet spot for sprawling JRPGs. But I can’t just “finish” a JRPG; I am a prisoner to these games, I have been since childhood. So my final playtime was well over 100 hours, pointlessly grinding and optimizing. I need to learn to stop.</p><p>What I am describing is primarily a “me” problem, although you may share it. To both my detriment and benefit, I cannot live an unoptimized life when the optimized one is clearly and directly in my line of sight. Sometimes this compulsion bears fruit and I come out of a fugue state having learned the best multi-ply Japanese cookware set. Other times I get caught in a gameplay sinkhole and cannot do anything until I beat a game, truly beat it, totally and completely.</p><p>JRPGs bring out this behavior in me more than any other subgenre. They are often meant to be a grand investment of your time, something you slowly whittle away at for a few hours every night after work, or consume uninterrupted in your teen years like a seagull swallowing a large fish in one gulp. These games are replete with secrets, often not signposted clearly, and god help you if you miss them and you have to reload an old save. Older JRPGs, particularly the ancient and unreasonable ones, can instill a sense of paranoia in you. This is particularly felt if you have ever saved yourself into a corner before an unreasonably strong boss with little or no way to improve your position.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Some fights in JRPGs and tactical RPGs punish you if you don't over-prepare. If you know you know. Credit: SquareEnix/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzCGAgmc9ns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jasonsgroovemachine</a></figcaption></figure><p>In a classic JRPG&nbsp; there are almost always one to four grueling super bosses whose difficulty will far outstrip the main boss. There are hidden items and ultimate weapons, often with elaborate quests, that may or may not be useful by the end of the game. Modern Ubisoft-coded open world games attempt to ape this mystique superficially, but they always feel like Potemkin objectives — a marker for a marker’s sake, a quest for a quest’s sake. (Ironically, I felt this false accomplishment strongest this year in <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>).</p><p>This is partially why playing the <em>Persona </em>games have been torture for me since <em>Persona 3</em>. The calendared <a href="https://aftermath.site/persona-tokimeki-memorial-coming-of-age" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">schooldays</a> with their various events and quizzes invite a specific, optimized route with little room for deviation. I cannot help but be tied to a guide while playing those games, it is in my nature and the game’s. This rigorous structure sucks the joy away and turns the entire thing into homework for me. To <em>Metaphor’s </em>immense credit, the developers have pulled the guts out of that series and retooled it so that you can easily maximize your social links <a href="https://aftermath.site/metaphor-refantazio-guides-travellers-voices-gallica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without ever looking at a guide</a>.The sheer mercy in that act alone, along with the fact that they don’t do anything terribly tone deaf or egregious, makes it a radical improvement over that team’s previous outings. Maybe it is a recognition that such a brutally narrow schedule was unnecessary in 2024, or maybe the designers realized they were getting too old for this too.</p><p>And yet, despite that, I still spent 146 hours according to Steam (some of this was screen idling or involved reloading old saves to maximize the final days) pummeling this game into the pavement, grinding well beyond the threshold of being able to beat the secret dragon bosses handily. <em>Metaphor </em>makes it simple to grind enemies below your pay grade — small fry enemies can be easily wiped out in the dungeon without having to engage in combat, which makes the entire loop feel like you’re playing a game in an emulator with frameskip on. It also makes the question of money trivial by making the Merchant Archetype a money printer – simply grinding weak foes in dungeons trivializes any financial woes. But <em>Metaphor</em> also has a deep job class system — a succulent time sink for each and every one of your characters.</p><figure><figcaption>If you are old like me you remember that they occasionally would sell PC games in Trapezoids. </figcaption></figure><p>I remember a summer in middle school playing <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>for the second time. The first time had been on PlayStation, a rental from Blockbuster Video that I had returned many weeks late and stopped right before the last boss on the third disk. The second was on PC, in my bedroom with crisp, Voodoo 2 accelerated graphics. I had the family’s hand-me-down TV going in the background with DVDs on a loop (a TV and a computer in your room was an extravagance at the time). I did not see the end of <em>FFVII</em> until each and every character was at level 99. By the time I had completed it, I had forgotten why I was doing it except that I had chosen to do it. I got no reward from it, no special ending with all the characters telling me what a good job I did. I don’t think I felt more satisfied having done it. The light of that game had long gone away, and nothing had remained except the impulse to see the number go up until it couldn’t any more.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Final Fantasy Tactics How To Learn Ultima (Limberry Castle Gate)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kF7AijdBwRc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The easiest way to learn Ultima in Final Fantasy Tactics is to have Ramza be attacked by the assassins at Limberry Castle Gate while he is a squire. It isn't a particularly good skill and I never used it after I got it. </figcaption></figure></div><p>I remember doing lesser versions of this countless times. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</em> for the GBA consumed a summer. <em>Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King </em>consumed a semester. <em>Disgaea </em>felt like it was designed in a lab specifically to fuck with me. Recently I replayed the original <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>on my MiSTer and power leveled my jobs far beyond what was required, going out of my way to save scum Limberry Castle Gate until Ramza learned Ultima despite Ultima not being that good a spell. I have had never touched <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> because I have lived the MMO lifestyle and I know precisely how badly it would fuck my life up.&nbsp;</p><p>This is also why I have such a deep respect for shorter JRPGs like <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, <em>Live-A-Live</em> and <em>SaGa Frontier </em>– games that are either so brief that they can’t trap you in a grinding loop or introduce multiple characters and storylines to interrupt the temptation of linear progression to level 99. One of the strongest choices a game can make is to decouple or mess with the attachment players have towards their digital selves, <em>Nier Automata </em>being the best example. We are all going to die one day, some of us sooner than others. Trite though it is to say, it’s true that the journey is the important part, and most of us will never return to these over-optimized selves. Maybe we should let go and delete our save files, dumping those personas into the ocean. I don’t want to say that the completionist path is time wasted, I can only speak for myself, but I can think of several uses for my time that would have made me feel more fulfilled.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="LIVE A LIVE - Launch Trailer - Nintendo Switch" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G0oOta9Lfts?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Games like <em>Live A Live</em> and <em>SaGa Frontier</em> prevent you from falling into this trap by being shorter games with multiple, selectable characters that can be played in any order. The former is my favorite retro remake of all time.</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Metaphor </em>is ultimately a far more reasonable game than the ones that I let suck me in before. And as I approached the end, after I had beaten the super bosses, I did loosen up a little bit. I did not maximize all my Archetypes, although I did spend some time seeing how hard I could hit the last boss by throwing money at him. I am older, I am thinking about having children, and I do not have the kind of time that I used to have. I am learning to take things easy, to be a little less optimized and at a lower level. One day I will figure out how to play these games normally, though I guess that what I’m describing is far more common an affliction than any of us would like to admit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/bathroom-bill-nancy-mace<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Trans people using the bathroom has been… well, I was going to write “a going concern since I came out in the early 2000s,” but that’s not entirely the case. It was very much a concern for <em>me</em> back then, particularly following the <a href="https://www.deanspade.net/2016/12/16/interview-about-drugs-and-sex-and-bathrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2002 arrest</a> of one of my friends in Grand Central, and it’s always been an issue in <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/grimm-v-gloucester-county-school-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">schools</a> and other spaces where, like so much of today’s anti-trans panic, concern about children can be invoked as cover. But, at the risk of sounding very very old, I am kind of astonished by the level to which it has now become <em>a thing</em>.</p><p>I’m sure I don’t need to tell you that this is <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/11/lgbtq-trans-issues-trump-second-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not a great time to be trans in America</a>. I’ve always struggled to articulate how I feel about this–there’s a confusing way in which I tend not to panic about the new slates of bans and laws, because I came out at a time when many of the things they outlaw weren’t legal anyway. But I always follow this up with: it didn’t matter so much what the law said, because even if medical care or hormones or document changes weren’t protected by law, in my experience, no one in power knew or cared enough to actually <em>stop</em> you from doing them. Insurance wouldn’t cover <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1507171607747481609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hormones</a> or surgery, but there could be ways around this. The letter I got from my doctor to change the gender marker on my documents was artfully vague enough to work. You could be fired or discriminated against–I was once rejected from a job in the very last phase after a background check revealed what it clearly revealed, and there was no recourse for this but to feel shitty about it–and the world was still the world, but as much as legal and medical neglect made things harder (and as much as I will never forgive Barney Frank for <a href="https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/11/06/10-years-later-firestorm-over-gay-only-enda-vote-still-remembered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ENDA in 2007</a>), I’ve always a little bit thought they made it easier, too. “Visibility was a mistake,” I sometimes joke crassly, even as the world spins–or, <em>was</em> spinning–forward into a level of protection and acceptance I honestly never thought possible, and, as much as I like to pretend I am a jaded old man, sometimes brings me to tears.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a long-winded way to introduce how messed up I feel about the latest turn in anti-trans bathroom laws, in which South Carolina Representative Nancy Mace is trying to introduce the “<a href="https://mace.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-nancy-maces-resolution-protect-womens-private-spaces-united-states-capitol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Protect Women’s Private Spaces Act</a>,” which would ban trans women–<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/nancy-mace-defends-anti-trans-bathroom-bill-says-absolutely-targets-sa-rcna180805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">specifically</a>, and I cannot believe I am writing this, incoming Representative Sarah McBride–from bathrooms in the Capitol. Today, Mace announced that she’s “<a href="https://x.com/RepNancyMace/status/1859260706144539077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubling down</a>” on this to extend the ban to all federal facilities; journalist Erin Reed <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erininthemorning.bsky.social/post/3lbfe65yshs24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writes</a> that this would include “bathrooms in DCA and Dulles airports, national park bathrooms, museum bathrooms, and all federal building bathrooms.” <a href="https://x.com/RepNancyMace/status/1859263432123633697" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Screenshots</a> of the proposal would seem to include trans men in these bans, though of course–<em>of course</em>–it is trans women that Mace seems most concerned with.</p><p>As a trans man, it’s always hard for me to know what to say about this kind of thing. I have been on hormones for a little over 21 years; bathrooms are still a source of stress for me, but not nearly as much as they used to be, and at a distinctly different level than people who present to the world differently than I do. On a practical level, these kinds of bans are unlikely to affect me personally all that much. It’s hard for me to think about this without bringing complicated ideas about “passing” into the mix, a concept that has never been important to me but which I cannot pretend I do not benefit from. (My joke about this is usually, it isn’t so much that I “pass” as it is that no one knows what a trans man looks like; I move through the world generally assuming everyone knows I’m trans and am shocked when they don’t, though obviously that is a simplistic summary.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For other people, it’s hard to say what these bans would mean if they go into law. (Well, except for McBride I guess? Which is, I must again stress, mind-blowing.) Are regular people going to police bathrooms in this way? Is anyone going to take time out of their one and only life to enforce this? Part of me wants to not take these kinds of things seriously because it lends them legitimacy, but at the same time, they aren’t Tinkerbell; they don’t go away if I just ignore them.</p><p>For me–the only perspective from which I can confidently speak–these bans do what they are clearly intended to do, which is make me feel shitty and like I don’t belong. As unlikely as <a href="https://www.aclufl.org/en/know-your-rights/know-your-rights-floridas-public-restroom-changing-facility-ban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Florida</a>’s trans bathroom bans are to affect me, they–along with <a href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/gov-desantis-signs-slate-of-extreme-anti-lgbtq-bills-enacting-a-record-shattering-number-of-discriminatory-measures-into-law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other</a> laws–have stopped me from visiting my aging parents who live in the state, which has become a regular, painful argument between us. The idea that I would feel unwelcome in the <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-road-goes-ever-on-and-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">national parks</a>–in, not to get religious but to get religious, places on this earth that belong to me as much as any other person in this world by virtue of being born into the world in the first place–is upsetting to me in a way that’s embarrassing because it means I care what Nancy Mace does, it means that she has the ability to affect me, and I do not want to give her that.&nbsp;</p><p>This is how these people <em>want</em> trans people to feel, and I don’t want to let them win by feeling those ways. But hardening my heart against it <em>also</em> does what they want it to. It separates me from my emotions, it cuts off my connection to a core human part of myself and to part of being alive that–let’s get religious again–I believe God put me on this earth to experience in its fullness. I’m in that <a href="https://mckitterick.tumblr.com/post/181377996055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tumblr meme</a> camp of “you cannot kill me in a way that matters” when it comes to these people, again because of my faith, but that doesn’t mean they can’t do their best to really fuck me up anyway. And I don’t want to give them the power to fuck me up! But then… well, here we are.</p><p>Who knows what will actually come of this garbage, which we can only hope is performative hate that will fizzle out before being replaced by whatever new horror. I do not care about this bill, but I also care about it a lot, more than I want to, and I hate that. I hate that I’m writing this, and that you’re reading it, but I also hate the idea that we <em>wouldn’t</em> write and read about it. What–sorry–a shit show.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
