            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The twelfth and final episode of <a href="https://aftermath.site/mobile-suit-gundam-gquuuuuux-pronounce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em> <em>GQuuuuuuX</em></a> has finally landed on Prime Video, bringing the curtain down on the newest installment of a mecha franchise that’s defined anime history for nearly 50 years. When I first covered its<a href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> theatrical debut</a>, my knowledge of the original series came secondhand via fandom chatter. But after completing the sidequests of watching the 1979 classic and sampling its sequel, I can say with confidence: <em>GQuuuuuuX</em>’s finale delivers a powerpayoff, but only if you’ve done the homework of watching the OG show that set it all in motion.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em>, a joint venture between studio Sunrise and Khara, boasts writing from <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>’s Hideaki Anno and <em>FLCL</em>’s Yoji Enokido, mech designs from Ikuto Yamashita (of Eva fame), character art from <em>Pokémon</em> designer Take, and is directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki, the visionary behind <em>Rebuild of Evangelion</em>, <em>FLCL</em>, and <em>Diebuster </em>fame. The premise rewrites history with a twist, where the original antagonist, Char Aznable, successfully steals protagonist Amuro Ray’s titular mech, reverse engineers its specs, and alters the course of events of the original anime’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-one-year-war-explained-gquuuuuux-2000573253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“One Year War”</a> in favor of his nation, Zeon. The moment Char is about to cinch success, he’s cast into a cosmic timeout, setting off the show’s actual plot. Enter Machu, Nyaan, and Shuji, three misfits who stumble into piloting Char’s rebanded Gundam and a mysterious prototype called the GQuuuuuuX years after his disappearance, sparking a new kind of battle where timelines bend and legacies collide.&nbsp;</p><p><em>GQuuuuuuX</em> is littered with deep-cut Easter eggs and mechanical resurrections, chief among them being the return of the <a href="https://www.gundam.info/feature/gquuuuuux/mecha/29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psycho Gundam</a>, a mech I pogged out for hard as a newfound <em>Gundam </em>fan, and I can only imagine tenured fans losing their minds. There’s even a subtle but potent tip of its hat at <em>Zeta Gundam</em>, its sequel series. These inclusions never feel intrusive. Instead, they’re the kind of thoughtful fanservice that rewards attention to viewers who “know ball” and feels earned in its execution. All of it is rendered with <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-06-20/cgi-veteran-hiroyasu-kobayashi-breaks-down-how-he-mech-ed-the-magic-happen-in-mobile-suit-gundam-/.224743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vibrant CG and 2D animation</a> that somehow walks the line between spectacle and reverence.&nbsp;</p><p>OG players like <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Kycilia_Zabi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lady Kycilia</a> and tragically overlooked <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Newtype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Newtypes</a> like <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Challia_Bull" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chalia Bull</a> return with real narrative weight as the surrogate parents, pitting Machu and Nyaan against each other, transforming their throuple with the milquetoast Shuji (until its finale, to my surprise) into a gripping space Shakespearean tragedy.&nbsp;</p><p>At its core, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> is a story about a multiverse collapsing in on itself. But, even more so, it’s metatextually about the generational pressure that every new Gundam series carries: measuring up to the seismic impact of the 1979 series. <em>Zeta </em>came the closest, at least in my tentative steps through the Universe Century catalog. Other shows, for all their innovations, can’t escape the long shadow cast by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundams-char-aznable-is-still-the-most-magnificent-bast-1824117617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Char Aznable</a>.</p><p>What <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> gets right, and audaciously so, is that it doesn’t step at the plate and gesture at Char’s legacy. Rather than fracturing timelines for the sake of novelty, the show remixes continuity with purpose, becoming a multiverse sequel that interrogates the past. At the center of that inquiry is the relationship that gave the original series its pulse: <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-episode-11-char-amuro-2000617187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Char and Lalah Sune</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Spoilers for that.</strong></p><p>In the original <em>Gundam</em>, Char, Lalah, and Amuro fall into a dynamic not unlike Zendaya and those two white bois in <a href="https://aftermath.site/challengers-soundtrack-reznor-ross-playstation-wipeout-2097-ape-escape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Challengers</em></a>—only with psychic powers and giant robots. Char and Amuro may be bitter rivals on the battlefield, but their connection to Lalah—and the complicated, half-spoken romantic web that ties the three together—is the emotional core that gives the series its gravity.</p><p>That’s why one of the OG show’s most gutting moments was Lalah sacrificing herself in the heat of battle by intercepting Amuro’s attack meant to kill Char. Her death, delivered by the very hands of someone who loves her, sends shockwaves through both men, triggering a guilt that echoes across the rest of the original series and well into its sequel. It’s that tragic triangle, equal parts war and destiny, and doomed by the narrative that makes the original <em>Gundam </em>sing.</p><p>In many ways, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> is once again The Char Aznable Show—a distinction that, frankly, I’d happily vote for any day of the week. The series transcends basic fanservice by steering its narrative away from the man himself and toward his ever-fraught bond with Lalah Sune, reframing her not just as a symbolic Newtype linchpin, but as the emotional culmination of the story itself. Instead of keeping her in the background as a spectral presence, the finale repositions their relationship as its final, devastating denouement.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Lalahs death" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ht1iZieFjf0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Before an alternate-timeline <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-episode-9-explained-lalah-rose-of-sharon-2000610640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lalah even appears in episode nine</a>, pilots Nyaan and Machu are drawn to a mysterious melody—the so-called “<a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-la-la-sound-explained-lalah-sune-char-2000596117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lalah Song</a>”— a glittering, otherworldly beacon that ignites a sparkling light show only they can see. Dubbed the “kira kira,” it becomes a psychic siren call and their shared obsession. Think of it as <em>GQuuuuuuX</em>’s version of <em>FLCL</em>’s “fooly cooly”—a provocative phrase folks don’t entirely know the meaning of, but get its meaning.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s here that the series shifts gears from a playful alternative history remix into a genuine sequel that dares to ask a question that’s been circling the fandom for decades: What if Lalah didn’t die? Instead of delivering easy fanservice or nostalgic bait, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> offers a rich, surprising answer that reshapes our understanding of Char, Newtypes, and the legacy of <em>Gundam </em>itself.&nbsp;</p><p>In its final act, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> lays all its cards on the table and flips its foundation entirely. Through Machu, we meet Alt-Universe Lalah, one who has already glimpsed her tragic fate from the original timeline and comes to terms with dying to save the man she loves. However, in a twist that reconfigures the show’s stakes, we learn that the original Lalah was spirited away into Machu’s timeline, trapped in the ocean inside the ship where she died, reimagined as a living MacGuffin, “Rose of Sharon.” In the show, Lalah is once again portrayed as an object of power that the villains intend to utilize in a genocidal plan to wipe out humanity and crown Newtypes as the sole, evolved heirs of the galaxy.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>Then there’s Char, who in typical fashion, has been hiding in plain sight, coming out of the shadows in a finale where all of the show’s big players butt heads. But wait, there’s more. The biggest reveal is Shiji, a character who’s essentially just …around, reveals he’s a transplant from the original <em>Gundam </em>timeline who wants to destroy Machu’s universe.&nbsp;</p><p>With each reveal, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> peels the layers back like a mecha nesting doll—but instead of losing the plot, it deepens its emotional core. In my reading of its finale, Shuji graduates from being a minor character to the spiritual echo of Amuro’s RX-78-2, haunted by the guilt of killing Lalah across infinite timelines. His mission isn’t destruction, it’s liberation. He wants to break the cycle, to free Lalah from the narrative that’s kept her locked in tragedy for half a century.&nbsp;</p><p>And somehow, the show—crafted by true mecha freaks who spent much of production arguing over which mobile suits could win in a fight—pulls off the most emotionally resonant <em>Gundam </em>anime in years. It goes full <em>Rebuild of Evangelion</em>, not just remixing canon but offering a sequel that dares to imagine healing where OG legends and fresh-faced pilots collide in a final battle that’s both about firepower and rewriting fate.</p><p>In the chaos, I got everything I could’ve hoped for as a born-again <em>Gundam </em>fan: Lalah gifting Char a full-blown <a href="https://gizmodo.com/revolutionary-girl-utena-is-as-lynchian-as-shojo-anime-has-ever-been-2000566141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Revolutionary Girl Utena</em></a>-style magical girl transformation, a tag-team brawl where <a href="https://www.gundam.info/feature/gquuuuuux/mecha/31/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GFreD</a> (the show’s Eva Unit One send up) and the titular <a href="https://www.gundam.info/feature/gquuuuuux/mecha/1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GGuuuuuuX</a> take on the original RX-78-2 in a handicap match so hype I found myself rooting for the legacy mech to lose. And then there’s Char getting a tender <em>Code Geass</em>-flavored finale with Lalah and queer, long overdue send off with Chalia Bull.&nbsp;</p><p>Controversially, even Amuro makes a cameo—one that hits hard in universe and feels gross in the way only anime can, by having his original voice actor Toru Furuya reprise his role following last year’s scandal where he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/voice-actor-toru-furuya-resigns-from-one-piece-following-affair-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted to having an affair and physically abusing a fan</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Distasteful as this element in the finale is, it's hard not to appreciate that <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> not only became required viewing in <em>Gundam </em>canon with gusto but also served as a gateway for newfound fans, giving the show a try and developing an interest in watching the original anime, myself included. When I spoke to director Tsurumaki about what he wanted the show’s impact to be, he said precisely that.&nbsp;</p><div><p>“<em>Gundam</em> is a series that has a long history. I watched it as a child, and it has continued on. It’s been around a long time. However, the generation of fans has really been extended. We now have many young generations who have never even watched the first <em>Gundam</em>. I think the first <em>Gundam </em>is extremely interesting, so I really want the young people to watch it because I know they will find it interesting as well,” <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-kazuya-tsurumaki-interview-2000593812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tsurumaki told me</a>. “I hope that the new generation could also watch the old <em>Gundam </em>as well. If that is materialized, I would be really happy.”</p><p>Long story short, it pulls off the impossible, weaving a standalone tale that lightly scaffolds enough context for newcomers while anchoring its emotional payoff in the deep waters of the original <em>Gundam </em>series. By the time its credits roll. <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> doesn’t just earn its place in <em>Gundam</em>’s towering legacy; it canonizes itself, making it required viewing for any fan of the original series and funneling newfound fans to check out the original.</p></div></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review"><h3>Lies Of P: Overture Is The Best Parts Of The Game Executed With Confidence</h3></a><p>Lies of P: Overture proves the success of the first game was no fluke, and establishes a bold house style.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/adventure-gamers-online-casino-gambling-website-sale-parasite-seo"><h3>Adventure Games, Poker And Casinos Do Not ‘Overlap’, You Weirdos</h3></a><p>No normal person could type 'Recognizing the growing convergence between gaming and gambling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dont-rank-cuomo-video-game"><h3>Experience The Joy Of Rejecting Andrew Cuomo Through A Video Game</h3></a><p>Robert Yang's latest browser game lets you, too, not rank Andrew Cuomo for NYC mayor</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/gquuuuuux-finale-gundam]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lies-of-p-overture-is-the-best-parts-of-the-game-executed-with-confidence.1227369/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As <em>Lies of P</em> progresses, it moves away from the veiled story beats of its Souls game inspirations and veers closer to a direct melodrama. In these moments you can see something beautiful happen, not just a game finding its footing but a developer establishing a house style. The DLC, <em>Lies of P: Overture </em>takes this approach and hones it further, establishing the main game’s pattern as a clear-eyed approach to telling a story that goes beyond its simple premise.</p><p>For those who did not play the original <em>Lies of P</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-is-good-overture-annoucement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you should</a>. A take on the Pinocchio<em> </em>story in the style of <em>Bloodborne </em>and <em>Sekiro</em>, <em>Lies of P </em>is one of the few titles to riff on what FromSoft established in a way that’s transformative and well-executed enough to be ranked as an equal. The main story takes place in the wake of societal collapse; the city of Krat is dominated by murderous puppets, mercenary humans known as stalkers, and people mutated into ambling creatures by a horrible petrification disease. As the game unfolds you begin to piece together how Krat fell, and who is to blame.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Overture</em> is chronologically a prequel, but mechanically one that involves P going back in time. It does not show Krat before its collapse; that part is still veiled, and I imagine would be far more complex than the scope of a DLC would allow. Rather, it shows the final days, following the events in the web of relationships that led to the creation of P. You follow the Legendary Stalker, a character whose importance is only alluded to in the main game.&nbsp;</p><p>The original <em>Lies of P </em>takes time to find its footing. <em>Overture </em>does not have that problem: those lessons have been learned already, and so when you play it you hit the ground running. This is true not just in how the narrative lays itself out, but also mechanically. <em>Overture</em> adds several new weapons, items, and legion arms, and thankfully none of them feel extraneous. The conceit of <em>Lies of P</em>’s weapon system is handles and blades that can be mixed and matched, but while the main game featured many weapons that felt like filler, <em>Overture </em>adds far fewer and makes the ones that it does include far more interesting.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The puppet has a gun. Credit: Neowiz</figcaption></figure><p>Most notable here is the Royal Horn Bow, which allows P to go medium range and totally changes combat. But there’s also a gunblade, a pair of Wolverine-style talons, and a lightning blade that all radically alter the flow of combat. The added legion arms, the trick weapons attached to P’s mechanical arm, are also welcome additions, and I spent the majority of <em>Overture</em> using the Cataclysm – a big shotgun that P can charge like Mega Man and, at higher levels, Active Reload like Gears of War. That’s right, they gave Pinocchio a shotgun.</p><figure><figcaption>They added a kitty. Credit: Neowiz</figcaption></figure><p>If I went out of my way to find a major flaw in <em>Overture</em>, it is that it hews closely to the established patterns and tone of the main game. While it is clear that Krat has fallen and that the world is slightly less decrepit, it doesn’t take place far enough back chronologically to feel as distinct as it could. You are still fighting a lot of grotesque humans and animals, the latter of which are some of the most disgusting monsters I have ever fought in almost any game.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>These things are nasty. Credit: Neowiz</figcaption></figure><p>But practically speaking I’m not bothered. While <em>Overture </em>is more <em>Lies of P</em>, it’s more of the best part of <em>Lies of P.</em> A few of <em>Overture’s </em>locations rank among the most striking in the game, like the Zoo in the beginning, or a frozen shipwrecked area under a beautiful Aurora. There’s a side quest in it that hits harder than any in <em>Nier: Automata</em>. The bosses are tremendously challenging, and the final confrontation is both a fantastic reveal and a legendary fight. And when P finally does catch up with the Legendary Stalker, how the game chooses to fill in that backstory is a reveal that is heartbreaking and melodramatic in a way that could only come from these developers.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Neowiz</figcaption></figure><p>There’s only so much you can efficiently do with DLC, particularly when it is abundantly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-sequel-confirmed-first-dlc-and-game-update-teased" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clear</a> that you are making a sequel. But <em>Overture</em> succeeds at its task of assuring the player that the success of the original game was no fluke.&nbsp; If <em>Lies of P </em>was developers Round 8 Studio and Neowiz announcing that they had arrived, <em>Overture </em>is a confirmation that they are here to stay.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/adventure-gamers-online-casino-gambling-website-sale-parasite-seo"><h3>Adventure Games, Poker And Casinos Do Not ‘Overlap’, You Weirdos</h3></a><p>No normal person could type 'Recognizing the growing convergence between gaming and gambling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dont-rank-cuomo-video-game"><h3>Experience The Joy Of Rejecting Andrew Cuomo Through A Video Game</h3></a><p>Robert Yang's latest browser game lets you, too, not rank Andrew Cuomo for NYC mayor</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review]]></content:encoded>
