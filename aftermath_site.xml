            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year, the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added Microsoft to its list of priority targets</a> due to the company’s entanglement with the Israeli military via Azure cloud and AI services. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A recent Guardian report</a> revealed the grisly details of said arrangement, claiming that Microsoft’s “cloud-based storage platform has facilitated the preparation of deadly airstrikes and has shaped military operations in Gaza and the West Bank.” Now game developers at Microsoft-owned studio Arkane, creator of <em>Dishonored </em>and <em>Deathloop</em>, have lent their voices to the chorus demanding that the company stop powering Israel’s assault.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/08/open-letter-from-the-arkan-studios-union-section-to-microsofts-and-its-subsidiaries-management/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an open letter</a> to leadership at Arkane, Zenimax, Microsoft Gaming, and Microsoft more broadly, workers unionized under French union STJV did not mince words about Israel’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians, lending their support to BDS and the Microsoft-worker-led <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No Azure For Apartheid campaign</a>.</p><p>“Arkane Studios’ STJV section joins BDS and the No Azure for Apartheid in their demands for Microsoft to stop supporting the Israeli regime,” Arkane workers wrote. “We think that Microsoft has no place being accomplice of a genocide, and as Microsoft employees, we don’t want to be part of this sinister project for Gaza. Moreover, we think it’s our responsibility, as tech workers, to raise the alarm, and to ensure that our technologies are used to make the voices of the oppressed heard, and not facilitate their demise. Finally, in a more direct manner, we think this could very well affect our life directly, by reducing the audience for our games, thus directly compromising the viability of Xbox Games, and, in the long run, our very own jobs.”</p><p>The letter includes a list of specific demands, which echo those of No Azure For Apartheid: an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, termination of all ongoing or future contracts with Israeli occupation forces, disclosure of all ties to the Israeli military, protection of pro-Palestinian speech within the company, and “a transparent, independent and public audit of Microsoft technologies, contracts, services and investments to make sure they are not used to violate the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols, and Microsoft’s own Human Rights Statement, in Palestine or anywhere else.”</p><p>Ultimately, Arkane workers believe that Microsoft should put its money where its mouth is.</p><p>"Microsoft has a responsibility toward its employees, as we have one toward the company,” Arkane workers wrote. “As stated in the company’s commitment to human rights, and regularly used in the company talk points, ‘Microsoft is committed to protecting fundamental rights.’ But so far, Microsoft has failed both its teams [and] its customers by being actively complicit of the invasion and war crimes happening in Gaza. If those core values are more [than] just talking points to sell more products, it is now more than due time for Microsoft to commit to them."</p><p>Of course, this is just an open letter. As it stands, nothing here is compelling Microsoft to turn over a new leaf that even comes close to matching the intoxicating aroma of ill-gotten cash. But these things have a way of snowballing. When Badru, the creator of open-world tactics RPG <em>Tenderfoot Tactics</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ice-water-games-tenderfoot-tactics-xbox-store-removed-bds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed his game from Xbox in solidarity with BDS</a> earlier this year, he told Aftermath: “Whether we're able to make Microsoft change or not directly, part of the point of targeting them is to be able to advocate around this and show these connections. Otherwise, nobody's interested in Azure Cloud. Nobody wants to talk about whatever Microsoft's bullshit AI is doing. These boycotts create opportunities for us to shine a light.”</p><p>Now news organizations <a href="https://www.972mag.com/microsoft-8200-intelligence-surveillance-cloud-azure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are investigating</a> <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%94-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%92%D7%A8-%D7%A9%D7%9C-8200-%D7%A2%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%AA%D7%99-%D7%9E%D7%99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure Cloud</a>, and mainstream coverage is shifting more and more to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/world/middleeast/gaza-starvation-aid-israel-netanyahu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critique and decry Israel’s actions</a>, especially its long-term starvation of Gazans. Meanwhile, international sentiment continues to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-says-no-starvation-gaza-amid-backlash-rcna224129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turn against Israel</a>. A letter like this both arises from and contributes to that slow cooker of pressure, as do possible future actions like work stoppages or strikes, which STJV-affiliated game workers have <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/02/struggle-pays-a-deal-was-found-at-dont-nod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employed before</a>. Eventually, even a behemoth like Microsoft will cave.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa"><h3>Hell Yeah, Another Blizzard Union</h3></a><p>Members of Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development team have unionized with the Communications Workers of America</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia"><h3>I Bloody Love The Drifter</h3></a><p>A homage to Lucasarts, John Carpenter and so much more</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-bookshop-impressions"><h3>Recommending Books Is The Best Part Of Tiny Bookshop</h3></a><p>Forget The Lorax, kid; it's time for classic architecture</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/microsoft-azure-arkane-israel-palestine-genocide]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Workers on Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development team unionized Tuesday, parent union Communications Workers of America <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzards-story-and-franchise-development-workers-form-latest-video-game-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>. According to the CWA, this makes them the “first in-house cinematic, animation, and narrative studio to form a union in the North American game industry.”</p><p>The new union is made up of 160 workers from Blizzard’s animation, in-house cinematic, and narrative teams, alongside series archivists and historians. “These workers are setting the standard for animation, cinematics, and storytelling across the video game industry, creating the breathtaking cutscenes, trailers, and other narrative content that fans have come to love,” said CWA Local 9510 President Jason Justice in a press release.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m excited that we have joined together in forming a union to protect my colleagues from things like misguided policies and instability as a result of layoffs,” said organizing committee member and cinematic producer John Giarratana, continuing, “I think that organizing gives us an opportunity to make our workplace better and safer.”</p><p>CWA says that Blizzard owner Microsoft has recognized the union, in accordance with the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labor neutrality</a> policy the company agreed to in 2022. In July 2024, <a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500 workers on Blizzard-owned <em>World of Warcraft</em></a> formed a union that they called “the largest wall-to-wall union at a Microsoft-owned studio,” alongside Blizzard QA workers in Austin. Other studios across Microsoft have also unionized in recent years, including at <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-union-unionize-fallout-elder-scrolls-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-online-studios-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeniMax Online Studios</a>, and ZeniMax QA, the latter of which finally <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a contract</a> in May after nearly two years of <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bargaining</a>. Unionized workers at Raven Studios reached a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/raven-software-workers-secure-first-contract-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contract with Microsoft earlier this month</a>.</p><p>In July, Microsoft laid off <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9000 workers</a>, with gaming divisions the hardest hit. These layoffs came on the heels of the company axing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659401/microsoft-layoffs-three-percent-workforce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">6000 jobs</a> in May. ZeniMax QA workers told Aftermath they were <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-zenimax-activision-blizzard-cwa-union-statement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">given no warning</a> about the July layoffs, and CWA president Claude Cummings Jr said in a statement that “We are deeply disappointed in Microsoft’s decision to lay off thousands more workers, including union-represented CWA members, at a time when the company is prospering.”</p><p><strong>Update 8/12/25, 4:10pm--</strong>Added the number of members in the new union.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia"><h3>I Bloody Love The Drifter</h3></a><p>A homage to Lucasarts, John Carpenter and so much more</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-bookshop-impressions"><h3>Recommending Books Is The Best Part Of Tiny Bookshop</h3></a><p>Forget The Lorax, kid; it's time for classic architecture</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’d been excited for the return of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/studio-trigger-anime-new-panty-stocking-with-garterbelt-is-a-raunchy-foul-mouthed-riot-2000626852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>New Panty &amp; Stocking</em> <em>with Garterbelt</em></a> ever since it was first announced at <a href="https://kotaku.com/bleach-trigun-stampede-panty-stocking-anime-expo-1849144771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anime Expo 2022</a>. Since Studio Trigger is handling the edgy, cult classic anime instead of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gainax-bankruptcy-khara-evangelion-hideaki-anno-1851526631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gainax,</a> I trusted that the show would be in good hands. After all, Trigger is one of my favorite anime studios, and with <a href="https://gizmodo.com/hell-yeah-cyberpunk-edgerunners-ii-is-happening-2000624411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cyberpunk:</em> <em>Edgerunners</em></a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/delicious-in-dungeon-season-2-studio-trigger-1851542772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Delicious in Dungeon</em></a> follow-ups in the works, I had faith the show would live up to its thirteen-year cliffhanger. My trust has yet to be misplaced, but I was overwhelmed by the sex-driven show’s unexpectedly wholesome short about adopting a ghost cat, which turned me into a sobbing mess.</p><p><em>New Panty and Stocking</em> has been a nonstop riot. The show follows two angels, one named Panty, whose vice is that she likes to fuck, and the other named Stocking, who loves to eat sweets. They work for a priest named Garterbelt in Daten City, and they spend most of their time slaying demons. Why those names? The show operates under <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> naming conventions, trading produce references for underwear, naming characters Kneesocks and Brief to match its raunchy energy.</p><p>Every Wednesday, as if to make up for lost time since the cult classic premiered 13 years ago, the show has been moving quickly, incorporating plenty of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/new-panty-and-stocking-episode-3-mandalorian-reference-star-wars-2000633241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pop culture references</a> and sharply targeting Millennial and Gen-Z humor. One of my favorites is a <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> spoof that reimagines Dom’s family as sperm, and a <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> meets <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> episode where they joked about the rise of weed dispensaries popping up everywhere, doubling as GPS landmarks. They even managed to create that <em>Fantastic Four</em> spoof, combining Jack Kirby and <em>Space Ghost</em> art styles, just days after Marvel’s new movie was released, honoring the late <a href="https://gizmodo.com/george-lowe-star-of-adult-swims-space-ghost-has-died-2000571346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Space Ghost</em> voice actor, George Lowe</a>, in one fell swoop. All of this is even more commendable considering Prime Video hasn’t been promoting it (or any of its anime, for that matter) at all.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="【New PANTY &amp; STOCKING with GARTERBELT】#01 メイキング" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GNQdNp2_uc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>A short segment in the third episode of <em>New Panty &amp; Stocking</em>, “Pet Cematary Hills, Panty Anarchy knocks over a tombstone on her walk home. The next morning, she wakes up to a kitten purring so loudly that it vibrates on her lap. It turns out to be the soul of a cat whose tombstone she knocked over. This is where the waterworks begin, but explaining will spoil the episode.</p><p><strong>So spoilers for that.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Because <em>Panty &amp; Stocking</em>’s world involves the Anarchy sisters earning coins like <em>Mario</em> for every demon they slay in the hope of buying their way into heaven, Panty considers murking the cat to get a coin and going about her debaucherous way. Everyone dislikes this, including their former rivals-turned-new roommates, the Daemon sisters, who have all fallen for the cat as their house pet. Plus, the kitten is so small that its death wouldn’t earn Panty a coin anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, Panty hatches a scheme to get the cat, which she names Vibe (named after a vibrator), nice and fat so that it’ll grow up to be worth a gold coin. Her methods to ensure this include hiding the pet toys her housemates bought for Vibe to limit her exercise and being heavy-handed with portion sizes at dinner time.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Prime Video/Studio Trigger</span></figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote><p>“Good girl, Vibe. Get nice and fat. Nice and fat, and we’ll both be the fattest cats around!”</p></blockquote></figure><p>In the blink of an eye, Vibe goes from being three apples tall to being a full-grown cat. So Panty decides now’s the time to put her pistol to Vibe’s temple. But she doesn’t pull the trigger. Like the Grinch, she acquiesces and remarks about how Vibe hasn’t been her usual energetic self. All the same, she pets Vibe and promises to bring back more of her favorite food.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>She just like me fr.<span></span><span>Prime Video/Studio Trigger</span></figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote><p>“Hey, Vibe, you’re not living up to your name so much these days. All right, all right. I’ll get you a nice, yummy Fish Ghost for when I get back. Be a good baby and look after the house, okay?”</p></blockquote></figure><p>But when Panty returns home, her housemates tell her something about Vibe, causing her to rush outside to see the black ghost cat turn into a transparent hue. Turns out, something was wrong with Vibe, and she’s going to disappear. In another twist, the something wrong wasn’t that she was dying for a bad reason, but that she was able to pass on properly because of the love she received from Panty.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>“That Ghost was abandoned by humans. She had never known love. But you loved her, Panty, and now she’s ready to move on.”</p></blockquote></figure><p>I’m honestly getting misty-eyed while typing this. Which of course doesn’t help, especially since Panty’s following line saying goodbye to Vibe with one last forehead boop obliterated me.</p><figure><blockquote><p>“I had big plans for you, you know? You were gonna give me so many Heaven Coins. Vibe…”</p></blockquote></figure><figure><figcaption>┗( T﹏T )┛<span></span><span>Prime Video/Studio Trigger</span></figcaption></figure><p>And there it is. I’m crying over a cat named after a vibrator passing on because the show’s selfish, bratty lead loved it enough to make up for its misfortunes in life. It also doesn’t help that I didn't cry during the show's memorializing of Vibe in the most <em>Logan</em>-esque final scene possible, by putting up a crucifix made out of pink vibrators outside their house with her name on it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I'm in shambles. <span></span><span>Prime Video/Studio Trigger</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like, yo, what the fuck, man?</p><p>As someone who also owns an all-black cat named Majima, whom I adopted from PAWS Chicago—learning he was an alley cat for nine years—seeing this scene hit me hard. Like Vibe, Majima also grew accustomed to being called outside by his name, with me jokingly calling him an asshole or brat whenever we’re at home. Still, like Panty, we formed a bond. He’s my little guy, and Vibe was Panty’s baby girl.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Family portrait<span></span><span>Isaiah Colbert</span></figcaption></figure><p>Watching Panty, a crude, selfish character, have her tsundere walls break down unexpectedly floored me. Quips are kind of the heart of the anime, so seeing the show stick to telling a wholesome story in an episode where they <a href="https://x.com/PSGarchive/status/1954978577637839216" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kill the president</a> and <a href="https://x.com/d0nut2x/status/1950601031001190841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become the <em>Fantastic Four</em></a> gave me the kind of tonal whiplash I’m still thinking about weeks later.&nbsp;</p><p>To my delight, the show didn’t just make a one-time reference to Vibe. In the latest episode, which featured Panty and Stocking battling knockoff <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, Panty joked about not giving a shit about pets. Panty’s sister, Stocking, promptly called her the fuck out by mentioning Vibe and how Panty loved her.&nbsp;</p><p>The lack of energy from Amazon Prime surrounding one of the most surprising comedy shows of the season—especially since Prime Video is a strong contender with two gems, including the spiritual successor to the best slice-of-life comedy of all time, <em>Nichijou</em>, <a href="https://www.primevideo.com/detail/CITY-THE-ANIMATION/0S1DSDV3YPNM8W8GZQK8FJTZ9H" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>City The Animation</em></a>, which is streaming exclusively on its platform—is not surprising but still disappointing. They did the same with <a href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mobile Suit</em> <em>Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em></a>, so I guess dropping the ball is just what Prime Video does, and promoting itself as a marketplace where people can subscribe to other anime services, such as HIDIVE and Crunchyroll, through its storefront.&nbsp;</p><p>Every week, the official Studio Trigger account posts behind-the-scenes materials for its episodes, like <a href="https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-sakuga-science-saru" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dan Da Dan</em>’s Science Saru</a>, to generate excitement and increase online engagement with the show. It also uploaded a documentary-style behind-the-scenes video to its official YouTube channel, connecting with fans and giving them a glimpse into the production process behind its premiere episode. Meanwhile, Prime Video has yet to say a word about the show’s new episodes.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="City: The Animation: Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LsfqDEfmng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Regardless, Trigger’s efforts to let their younger artists showcase their skills through lively animation that fills in the gaps of <em>New Panty &amp; Stocking</em>’s storyboards, along with sharp jokes, pop culture references, and emotionally resonant scenes—like Vibe and a moment where the girls <a href="https://x.com/AniTrendz/status/1954241269971947789" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">help baby turtles on their arduous pilgrimage to the ocean</a>—not only prove the show’s status as a revival of a cult classic worth watching but also serve as reminders that its bratty leads have a soft, angelic side after all.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa"><h3>Hell Yeah, Another Blizzard Union</h3></a><p>Members of Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development team have unionized with the Communications Workers of America</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-response"><h3>Krafton Responds To Subnautica 2 Lawsuit, Doubling Down On Claims That Executives ‘Abandoned’ Development</h3></a><p>Krafton lawyers say the lawsuit is over ‘a multimillion-dollar payday [the former executives] haven’t earned’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-bookshop-impressions"><h3>Recommending Books Is The Best Part Of Tiny Bookshop</h3></a><p>Forget The Lorax, kid; it's time for classic architecture</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-best-video-game-boats"><h3>Let’s Remember Some Good Video Game Boats</h3></a><p>"Assassin’s Creed is reinventing interest in sea shanties.
