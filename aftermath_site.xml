            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>If you’re prone to scrolling for a frankly unhealthy number of hours per day, you might have recently seen a couple names pop up with borderline-bizarre frequency: <a href="https://polymarket.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Polymarket</u></a> and <a href="https://kalshi.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kalshi</u></a>. These sites bill themselves as “prediction markets,” but the activity they center around is, on no uncertain terms, gambling. Polymarket and Kalshi shroud this in marketspeak, allowing people to buy up yes/no “contracts” on real-world events and adopting a peer-to-peer approach instead of heralding down edicts about house odds, with prices instead set by trades a la financial markets. But the sites still take a cut of transactions, and people are still, in aggregate, betting millions.&nbsp;</p><p>Polymarket and Kalshi let users place cash or crypto wagers on just about anything. For example, as of this writing, Polymarket’s trending tab included Time’s 2025 person of the year, a bunch of different sports matches, Netflix’s proposed acquisition of WB, Elon Musk’s tweets, Trump’s release of the Epstein files, and most grimly of all, whether or not the US will sink another oil ship associated with Venezuela.&nbsp;</p><p>Polymarket – which was <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8478-22?ref=aftermath.site#:~:text=The%2520Commodity%2520Futures%2520Trading%2520Commission%2520(CFTC)%2520has,from%2520violating%2520the%2520CEA%2520and%2520CFTC%2520regulations"><u>banned in the US back in 2022</u></a> after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission found it was offering betting contracts without the agency’s approval, only for the agency to drop its investigation this year and give the site a regulatory thumbs up – even allowed users to bet on whether it would go live in the US this year. Odds prior to its rollout this month were at 99 percent, <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/12/04/polymarket-announces-return-to-the-u-s/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to Fortune</u></a>. Kalshi, meanwhile, has managed to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/10/sports-betting-kalshi-cftc/684689/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>circumvent states’ laws</u></a> against sports betting due to its financial market status, though Nevada recently <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f07aed7-58b0-45d3-87d4-c3c883a616fa?ref=aftermath.site"><u>closed that loophole</u></a>, and Massachusetts <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/massachusetts-seeks-block-kalshi-operating-sports-prediction-market-2025-12-09/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>may soon follow suit</u></a>.</p><p>While obvious offshoots of the sports gambling craze that has swept the nation <a href="https://www.espn.com/sports-betting/story/_/id/23501236/supreme-court-strikes-federal-law-prohibiting-sports-gambling?ref=aftermath.site"><u>in recent years</u></a> – promising impoverished citizens a last-ditch means of getting out of debt while actually just miring them in more – Polymarket and Kalshi have recognized that their fortunes are tied to news. The two have approached this in different ways. Kalshi recently struck deals with both CNN and CNBC to integrate its prediction data across the networks’ programming. In <a href="https://news.kalshi.com/p/kalshi-cnn-prediction-market-partnership?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a press release</u></a>, Kalshi cited the fact that it "recently called the NYC Mayoral election eight minutes after polls closed, hours before the media" as evidence that this is good for news and society, actually, and not yet another rotten seed that will eventually sprout an ill-gotten money tree. Also, the system is easily gamed, as <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/12/cnn-kalshi-election-polling-prediction-betting-market-harry-enten.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Slate recently pointed out</u></a>:</p><blockquote>If a Republican political firm wanted to buy $50,000 in contracts on the GOP to win the House, that purchase alone could move the price — and thus the implied odds — significantly. If a Republican political consultant wanted to buy $100,000 worth of contracts on the GOP to hold the House, they could materially move the price and thus the implied odds. With CNN providing free media coverage of the party’s improving chances, wouldn’t that be a compelling alternative to simply buying some commercial time? Are you starting to see the problem with a major news channel using an opaque tool of financial speculation to sum up conventional wisdom about an election?&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Polymarket, on the other hand, has favored a more digital-first approach, striking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/06/x-names-polymarket-as-its-official-prediction-market-partner/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a deal with Twitter</u></a> to become the platform’s official prediction partner and going all-in on news aggregation with both its <a href="https://x.com/Polymarket?ref=aftermath.site"><u>official account</u></a> (which has over 800,000 followers) and offshoots, including <a href="https://x.com/NewsWire_US?ref=aftermath.site"><u>NewsWire US</u></a>, a separate aggregator it recently purchased. Both Polymarket and Kalshi have also partnered with various influencers, some <a href="https://archive.is/FNk5V?ref=aftermath.site"><u>laughably disreputable</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>All this in mind, you will not be surprised to learn that Polymarket and Kalshi both have pages for multiple video game award shows, most prominent among them last weekend’s Streamer Awards and today’s Game Awards. Polymarket’s Streamer Awards <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/the-streamer-awards-streamer-of-the-year?ref=aftermath.site"><u>streamer of the year category</u></a> commanded a total trading volume of $24,169 – an impressive sum until you consider The Game Awards’ <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/game-awards-game-of-the-year-2025?ref=aftermath.site"><u>game of the year category</u></a>, on which users have wagered nearly $40 million. Kalshi users, meanwhile, have wagered <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxstrmrsoty/streamer-of-the-year/kxstrmrsoty-25?ref=aftermath.site"><u>$218,771</u></a> and <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxgameawards/game-awards?ref=aftermath.site"><u>$3 million</u></a>, respectively, on the same award categories. Both sites feature additional pages for other award categories, as well as things hosts might say.</p><p>When The Streamer Awards’ host, popular Twitch streamer QTCinderella, caught wind of her event’s Polymarket pages, she was furious.</p><p>“I would like to make this very clear: I am in no way associated with that website, and I am in no way condoning that website,” she said <a href="https://x.com/Awk20000/status/1995706110121254943?ref=aftermath.site"><u>during a stream</u></a> earlier this month in response to a viewer who accused her of supposed “insider trading.” “I have no association with them. I do not. In fact, my lawyers are talking to their lawyers because I am not happy about that.”</p><p>She added that her IP was being used without her consent and that her lawyers sent the site a cease and desist letter. As of this writing, however, Polymarket’s Streamer Awards pages remain accessible – as do Kalshi’s – even though the event has since concluded.</p><p>Aftermath reached out to QTCinderella and Polymarket for more information but did not receive a reply.</p><p>The Game Awards’ stance on prediction markets is unclear. Aftermath reached out to the organization to ask if Polymarket and/or Kalshi have received Geoff Keighley’s world exclusive seal of approval, but did not receive a reply.&nbsp;</p><p>Kalshi does not even consider The Game Awards to be that big of a deal, in the grand scheme of things.</p><p>“That is a… decent number,” Kalshi rep Jack Such <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-the-year-goty-gambling-prediction-markets-kalshi-polymarket/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>told Polygon</u></a> about The Game Awards’ market. “It’s OK. But some markets have hundreds of millions.”</p><p>While Such claimed that individual pages are tended to by a dedicated market team because “every market you see on Kalshi requires a pretty extensive legal contract,” it’s hard to imagine that any specific page registers as more than a temporary blip on Kalshi or Polymarket’s radar. After all, they make their money in aggregate. That’s why it behooves both companies to, as Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour <a href="https://gizmodo.com/kalshi-ceo-says-he-wants-to-monetize-any-difference-in-opinion-2000695320?ref=aftermath.site"><u>recently said</u></a>, “financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference in opinion.”</p><p>Somehow, what that actually entails is even more sinister than it sounds.</p><p>"It's part of a larger trend in Silicon Valley to insert themselves into the cracks of modern society,” Ryan Broderick of <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Garbage Day</u></a> said in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSBNZb2CdBb/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a recent video</u></a>. “Everything that's bad about the world, they don't want to fix it. What they want to do is figure out a way to become a middle man in that system to offer a crappier version of what we already used to do."</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/adventure-gamers-online-casino-gambling-website-sale-parasite-seo/"><div><p>Adventure Games, Poker And Casinos Do Not ‘Overlap’, You Weirdos - Aftermath</p><p>No normal person could type ‘Recognizing the growing convergence between gaming and gambling’</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Quitting Spotify might have almost beaten Luke, but I’ve fared a little better thanks to my brand new digital audio player</p><p>Before there was the iPod, there was the cheap MP3 player. I remember these devices from my teenagerhood. Small and with barely a UI to speak of, they had robust storage and could hold hundreds upon hundreds of songs. Of course, the design improvements of the iPod would put all these also-rans out of business—it turns out that being able to access any song on your device within three clicks of that scroll wheel was an incredible boon for those of us with huge music libraries. From there the chain of history is easy to link together. The iPod leads to the iPhone leading to no one ever needing to have a standalone music playing device because they’re all subscribing to services like Spotify.</p><p>Because I have a lot of friends who are working musicians, I have absolutely <a href="https://aftermath.site/cancel-spotify-wrapped-ai-ceo-apple-music/"><u>no love for Spotify</u></a>. They pay artists peanuts and they also make the music sound like shit due all the compression necessary for streaming audio to your device over the internet. I listen to tons of music, and have especially been interested in the <a href="https://aftermath.site/dungeon-synth-erang-tome-zero-fantasy/"><u>dungeon synth</u></a> scene, a very small scene of very small artists. While almost all the music I want is available streaming, I’d rather buy the music on Bandcamp, knowing that a higher percentage of my money goes to the artist—especially from artists who I know won’t make much money from streaming.</p><p>Up until I bought a Digital Audio Player, those Bandcamp purchases were largely theoretical. Sure, I’d bought the album, but I never downloaded the audio files, instead opting to listen to my music either on the Bandcamp app or on Tidal. Because Tidal also offers its listeners basically all music ever recorded in human history, that meant I wasn’t listening to the music I bought. A digital audio player forces my hand—and I’ve found that I genuinely enjoy this experience of listening to music a lot more.</p><p>While there is a fascinating world of people buying and refurbishing old iPods, when I looked at the broad price range and options for the wide variety of DAPs, I wanted to try something new. While I don’t think any device on the market holds a candle to the classic iPod, design-wise, I am extremely happy with my <a href="https://www.fiio.com/echomini?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Snowsky Fiio Echo Mini</a>.</p><figure></figure><p>What attracted me to the Echo Mini was that it doesn’t have any features I didn’t want and also that it is adorable. If you’re looking into the world of DAPs, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by choice. There are extremely expensive DAPs from <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/walkman-digital-recorders/walkman-mp3-players/p/nwa306-b?ref=aftermath.site"><u>companies like Sony</u></a> that can also access the internet and download apps like the iPod Touch of yesteryear. But I don’t want any of that shit. I don’t even want Bluetooth. I want an object that plays MP3s that I listen to with my new wired in-ear monitors.</p><p>The Echo Mini is shaped like a tape deck and is even smaller than I expected when I grabbed it. For under a hundred dollars, this device can hold more music that I can reasonably listen to, even on my five hour Thanksgiving flight to Los Angeles. Because the Echo Mini has both onboard storage and a slot for a micro SD card, I have 256GB of storage and I’ve barely scratched the surface. The battery life is also remarkable, especially compared to my phone, which was previously my main music listening device. I haven’t had to charge it once since I bought it about a month ago.</p><p>Although the user experience leaves something to be desired—you’re forced to scroll through nested menus with multiple tiny buttons, reminding me of playing a Japanese RPG on the Playstation, complete menu hell—I love using this device. It slips right in my pocket and it frees me from the yoke of always looking for my phone when I’m out and about. Its clunky UI actually forces me to pick an album and stick with it, where having access to the entirety of all recorded music in history often gave me choice paralysis. It’s also revealed that if I make sure I have a couple of my comfort albums—<em>how i’m feeling now, The Downward Spiral</em>, a handful of Talking Heads albums—I don’t actually <em>need</em> to have access to every album ever. I appreciate the albums I have already bought so much more when I don’t have a choice but to listen to them.</p><p>But most of all—the music sounds amazing. I haven’t even dived into the alternate file formats like FLAC, and I’m already hearing new details in songs I’ve listened to over and over. Rosalia’s most recent album <em>LUX</em> sounds fantastic, surrounding me with the lushness of the orchestral compositions. Even pop music sounds a lot fuller. I was listening to the Dev Lemons album <em>Surface Tension</em>, and you can hear intonations from her deep in the mix that I simply cannot hear on streaming services.</p><p>After a month of using a DAP I can envision a future where I totally ditch streaming. Listening to albums purposefully, instead of just through the convenience of having literally everything available at all times, has allowed me to fall back in love with the music I have. I think there should be a little more friction in life, in general, but the friction of needing to actually buy an album was something I didn’t even realize I missed. </p>
