            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/4x-game-climate-capitalism-civilization-future<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've historically been an enjoyer of post-apocalyptic media, but as our actual times threaten to become as dystopian as our fiction, I'm finding it a bit harder than usual to stomach doom and gloom during my rare moments of free time.</p><p>Too many games--even some of the most commercially successful ones--are set in futures that are unpleasant at best and outright despairing at worst. <em>Fallout</em>, <em>The Last Of Us</em>, <em>Horizon</em>, <em>Cyberpunk</em>–they're all a huge bummer. I could go on forever listing games like this, but something that's got me especially downbeat about this preoccupation with pessimism is that it's found even in my favourite place, strategy gaming</p><p>The genre could and should do better. It's one thing for a game with a pre-baked narrative to be set in the post-apocalypse, that's a creative team's call. But strategy games are about control, and shaping things, and creating your <em>own</em> stories through decisions and actions.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's take <em>Civ </em>as an example: the 4X genre is so flexible in its actions and outcomes that it's a form of story-telling through systems. Yet even <em>Civ </em>can't escape the lure of Bad Times. Multiple games will not only have the player actively causing a climate emergency, but then be unable to stop it, their only containment measures being to try to clean up pollution as it's caused or adapt to rising sea levels. And every <em>Civ</em>, with the series built as it is on a bedrock of Western ideas of progression and technical advancement, is always pointing towards the same endgame: one where nuclear-armed states fight globally-destructive conflicts, and where ideas about politics and society, which we've been able to shape for thousands of years, end abruptly with the systems we're trapped in today.</p><p>But what if we don't <em>like </em>today? What if we, as players of a genre that can do literally anything it wants with the world, want to imagine and create something else, something <em>better</em>? Why do so many video games see the flaws in our world and follow them to their most depressing conclusions, instead of actively working to rewrite them?</p><p>Let's all watch a short video that explains what I'm talking about. Yeah, it's a yoghurt commercial, but still, I think about it a lot:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dear Alice" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-Ng5ZvrDm4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Dear Alice</em>--which featured a soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi, and is often described as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solarpunk</a>"--is a beautiful piece of animation, and deserved all the credit it received upon release in 2021, but what's made it stick with me so many years later is its outlook. It's a rare vision of the future that doesn't shrug its shoulders and say "we're all fucked", it says "we can fix this". As someone who gets overly-obsessed with climate doomerism far too often for my own good, I want to engage with more media like this.</p><p>I don't want to read too much into a one-minute yoghurt ad (<a href="https://thelinestudio.com/work/chobani" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though you can do that here and check out some art from it if you'd like</a>), but <em>Dear Alice</em> envisages a world where things have got better. There's a sense of community; there's renewable energy; there's a focus on nature and the natural and our place alongside them. Even the skyscrapers of this world are covered in greenery. Future technology still exists, from robot drones to holographic water wheels, but it's on the periphery, serving nature rather than destroying it. Did these people avert a climate disaster by living like this? Or is this how they recovered from one? I don't know! I like thinking about that, though, and it was a recent rewatch of that video that got me thinking about strategy games and the future.</p><figure><figcaption>Not every work of optimistic futurism has to look like a Studio Ghibli film. In a way <em>The Expanse</em> is a feel-good story, because it's a world that managed to react to the climate emergency, even if it came a little too late to stop the sea levels rising. Sure, it now has its own fresh problems, but that's humanity, baby.</figcaption></figure><p>A game I've badly wanted to exist ever since I first saw <em>Civ </em>dabble with climate change is a 4X that doesn't go from 2000BC to today, but one that starts today and goes 2000 years into the future. That doesn't see democracy and capitalism as endpoints, improvements on what's come before, but as the things that need to be improved, or thrown out altogether. </p><p>I want to play a game that has ideas about how money and economies can look in the future, not just about recreating those from the past; games that can picture something, <em>anything </em>else to replace our current obsession with share dividends and quarterly results.<br></p><figure><figcaption>Anno 2070 did a lot of what I'm talking about here, albeit in a pre-baked, city-building game. I'd like something <em>grander</em>, though. </figcaption></figure><p>Surely somebody out there at Firaxis or Paradox or somewhere or <em>anywhere </em>has ideas of their own, or that they can pull from--and I gain physical pain from typing this corny-ass word, but I have to--"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopepunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hopepunk</a>", about what we can replace our current world order with. And, to make it a game, maybe they can pull some different, competing ideas, and pit them against traditionalists and each other, just to make it interesting.</p><p>Like, what could we replace capitalism with? Could we replace it peacefully, or with a second, more heated Cold War? What do we call those ideas, and more importantly, what would their stats and characteristics look like for a 4X game? What effect would implementing something like Universal Basic Income have on a people's productivity and happiness, and what would we be measuring that against? What would "factions" look like: Would Ecofascists clash with AI proponents, who are also at war with a Commonwealth Of Socialist Guilds?</p><p>I have so many questions! How can we mobilise to fix this planet, would a game like this work toward uniting the world behind a single joint effort, or would every faction be left to fend for themselves, doing their part while wheeling and dealing with pacts and treaties? I want to manage the unrest of a robot revolution, I want to see if progressive social ideas married to militarism can overthrow a despotic<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_fascism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Christofascist</a> regime.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Terra Nil - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzVkzahcepY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I know some games have tried at least some of this already; <em>Civ </em>deserves credit for at least modelling an ecological collapse and giving us some tools to mitigate it, <em>Anno 2070</em> has some cool ideas, <a href="https://aftermath.site/synergy-pc-city-builder-impressions-review-moebius" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Synergy </em>is cool with the planet but it’s not <em>our </em>planet</a>, and <em>Alpha Centauri</em> got weird with its sci-fi politics, but again, it’s not Earth. As for <em>Terra Nil, </em>it's an uplifting game about restoring life to a dead planet, but I'd rather terraform the Earth <em>before </em>we're all wiped out and have to send robots from space to clean everything up.</p><p>And I know there's positive media out there, some of it better than others, but I'm not here asking for someone to tell me a story. I'm specifically asking strategy game developers to give me the tools to tell my <em>own </em>story, to explore a future that doesn't select "apocalypse" as the default, but gives us the promise and the hope to do something about our planet before things get that bad.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/social-media-tiktok-instagram-notifications"><h3>Social Media Has Me Ducking My Friends And It Sucks</h3></a><p>We were never meant to have this much always-on access to each other</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-elon-musk-twitter-ratio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are certain crystalizing moments that drown out all of life’s other tiny cacophonies to reveal essential truths. These arrive thunderously, yet the effect is akin to standing in a pin-drop silent room and watching, in slow motion, as the pin clatters to the ground. Perhaps for you it was the birth of a child, or the death of a close friend. Maybe it was something as simple as realizing you hated your job and needed to find a new one. For me, it happened yesterday: I found myself rooting for a brand account in an online dispute.</p><p>Admittedly, this online dispute happened to involve Elon Musk, the de facto shadow president of the United States – but so do most of them these days. In the other corner was Ubisoft’s official <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> Twitter account. If you’ve even <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-controversies-are-for-babies-and-racists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cursorily been following commentary</a> surrounding the latest game in the series, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, you don’t need me to tell you how dumb these next several sentences are going to be.&nbsp;</p><p>It began with disgraced <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/firefall-mark-kern-sacked-the9-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former bus owner</a> Mark “Grummz” Kern (sentence already at apex stupidity) <a href="https://x.com/Grummz/status/1904590090233667905" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accusing Ubisoft</a> of platforming terrorists by cutting a deal with pro-Palestine leftist Twitch streamer Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker to play <em>Shadows </em>on stream (oh no it got dumber somehow). Musk, who extremely evidently does not have a real job, chimed in <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1904592159862645118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exactly nine minutes later</a> to call Piker a “fraud” and then again <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1904594321199988935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eight minutes after that</a> to correct himself, adding in a new tweet that "'Sell-out' would be more accurate. Objectively, he is promoting a terrible game just for the money." I shouldn’t have to explain that nothing can be objectively terrible because “terrible” is a subjective value to a man who believes himself so intelligent that he uses it as the basis for <a href="https://www.disconnect.blog/p/why-silicon-valley-is-bringing-eugenics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his support of eugenics</a>, but here we are.</p><p>Piker and others both in and out of his orbit proceeded to mock Musk and Kern, and then a couple hours later – drawing on <a href="https://x.com/hasanthehun/status/1904597441011462421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jokes some had already made</a> – the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> account leaped off a nearby rooftop to deliver the finishing blow. "Is that what the guy playing your<em> Path of Exile 2</em> account told you?" regular human Twitter user @assassinscreed replied to Musk, referencing Musk’s self-admitted <a href="https://aftermath.site/elon-musk-treasury-protest-diablo-path-of-exile-cheating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">history of cheating at video games</a>, which he plays on <a href="https://aftermath.site/does-elon-musks-gaming-rig-suck-or-not" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a setup just as embarrassing as everything else about him</a>. The account went on to <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1904661876681699351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">further</a> <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1904669672995254571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advertise</a> <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, which has already <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/assassins-creed-shadows-hits-2-million-players-putting-it-on-track-to-be-the-series-most-successful-game-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold millions of units</a> and clearly has Ubisoft feeling confident, bordering on cocky, after <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/ubisoft-had-an-absolutely-dire-2024-and-desperately-needs-a-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an undeniably rocky period</a>.</p><p>As of now, roughly 24 hours later, Musk’s initial tweets have accrued 20k and 31k likes respectively. The official AC account’s tweet has over 615k. Countless other non-brand accounts have since joined this cathartic mass-dunking, with Kern <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ratboy.bsky.social/post/3llcg3mlb7s2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conspiracy theorizing</a> that foul play must be afoot – and not that if you’re still acting like a sad, horny teenager after nearly six decades on this Earth, people will dislike you – while various other conservative creators are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thepixelrobot.bsky.social/post/3llc36rjjh22b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clutching their pearls</a> over a company account behaving unprofessionally. In other words, more weak crybully shit from the same people who believe you should always be able to make fun of anyone and anything, unless it’s them, in which case it should be illegal.</p><p>So yeah, some of the internet’s – and by extension the world’s – worst and dullest got taken down a peg, further evincing what we already know to be true: These people, despite amassing tremendous influence via the series of broken systems that make up the modern world, which they themselves <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/09/elon-musk-doge-federal-it-national-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believe need to change</a>, are hideously unpopular even on their own platform of choice. Cool! Great! What are we doing here!&nbsp;</p><p>If you told me even a year ago that I’d be tepidly rooting for a brand account associated with a series that can be fun, but which is largely known for its formulaicness, I’d have slapped you, and then myself, in the face. I’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dragon-age-veilguard-review-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said it before</a>, and I’ll say it again: What I dislike most about the rise of right-wing grifters in gaming spaces, aside from all the fascism, is the astounding degradative effect these people have had on how we discuss games in general.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong: This shit was never particularly sophisticated to begin with, but it was better than constant culture war of the week nonsense (that sometimes leads to real-world harassment despite <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-streamer-goes-viral-after-confronting-whining-commenters-normal-people-dont-get-upset-about-this-sh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">categorically not mattering</a>). It was better than <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conspiracy-addled</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/testjd/asmongold_used_a_dead_rat_as_an_alarm_clock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rat clock</a> aficionados dictating the terms of engagement. It was better than Twitter war bloodsport between a smirking doofus who’s been <a href="https://observationalepidemiology.blogspot.com/2018/06/elon-musk-is-terrible-engineer-and-why.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laughed</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/14/23458247/elon-musk-fires-engineer-correcting-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">out</a> of every serious space he’s stepped foot in and a brand account.&nbsp;It was better than proudly proclaiming you're going to buy a product as a form of performative faux-activism because said brand account, in a shrewd act of advertising, took aim at someone you don't like.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Brand accounts are for making fun of, not siding with. They exist to sell things. Aiding them in that pursuit, whether with likes or dollars, will <a href="https://www.404media.co/you-cant-post-your-way-out-of-fascism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not help stop the rise of fascism</a>. There are <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-election-donald-trump-unions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many, many other ways</a> of doing that.<em> Assassin’s Creed</em>, like <a href="https://aftermath.site/suicide-squad-discourse-impressions-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so many other culture war battlefields before it</a>, is mid. Life is full of actual bounties – real highs and lows, not the beige simulacrum of meaning the internet offers us. Life is also short. When yours ends, today will feel like yesterday as it flashes before your eyes, or you won't remember it at all. Do with that information what you will.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/4x-game-climate-capitalism-civilization-future"><h3>Give Me A Future Worth Fighting For</h3></a><p>I want to build a better world, not live in the ruins</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/social-media-tiktok-instagram-notifications"><h3>Social Media Has Me Ducking My Friends And It Sucks</h3></a><p>We were never meant to have this much always-on access to each other</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
