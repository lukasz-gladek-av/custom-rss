            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sony-playstation-1-startup-sound-30th-anniversary<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Somehow, against all odds (read: me not wanting to get old), the PlayStation is now 30. That means its startup noise, which eternally rings in the minds of people of A Certain Age like our own personal Big Ben, is also getting up there in years. And yet, today I learned something new about it. Well, new to me.</p><p>According to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSd30d7JzM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video from YouTuber Nitrocosm</a> (brought to my attention by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/janus.bsky.social/post/3lcg5lnhcp22f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath pal and freelance contributor Janus Rose</a>), the PS1 startup noise is not one sound, but three. On top of that, they’re stored directly in the PS1’s BIOS – firmware that contains basic software for booting the console and running games&nbsp; – which explains why they’re chopped up and individually modified instead of lumped together into a single file: The BIOS is just 512 kilobytes. Today’s vast audio libraries would make it melt like the mind of a Victorian peasant experiencing a single crumb of Dorito dust.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Playstation Startup Sound Explained" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lkSd30d7JzM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The three audio samples are: 1) a chime, 2) a synth sound with a phaser effect on it, and 3) a reverse tape sound effect. These, according to Nitrocosm, are played at different speeds and mixed together to create the final product. If you want to hear the original sounds in all their individual glory, you can watch the video.</p><p>This is, I imagine, a far cry from how the sound effect is generated on the PlayStation 5, which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/playstation/488901/playstation-anniversary-aesthetics-graphics-sounds-how" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just added a nostalgia-laden startup sequence</a> to celebrate the 30-year anniversary. But I’ll never get tired of appreciating instances in which constraints bred creativity and limitations led to something that stuck with us for decades. We must, if nothing else, respect the old ways. We wouldn’t be here without them.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disney-speedstorm-has-the-most-bizarre-soundtrack-i%E2%80%99ve-ever-heard.1051167/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/disney-speedstorm-soundtrack-ost-gameloft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s understandable if you haven’t played the 2023 game <em>Disney Speedstorm</em>. It is a free-to-play Disney-themed kart racer made by Gameloft, and you can be forgiven if that combination of words does not sound particularly appealing. But it is, by all accounts, pretty solid. What is more important than the game itself, however, is the soundtrack, which is one of the strangest things I have ever heard in my life.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLauxD4ZvQhqsPp1ftsJUV9YjO_nFTudHM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Every song on the <em>Disney Speestorm </em>soundtrack is, for better or worse, a maximal club mix of an existing Disney theme. <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>, <em>Inside Out</em>, <em>Frozen </em>, <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>, <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, <em>Lilo and Stitch</em>, <em>Aladdin</em>, <em>Toy Story</em>, <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>, <em>Hercules</em>, and<em> Monsters Inc.</em> are all represented. Some of the tracks are so confusing as to be simply disorienting. There are not one or two, but three separate versions of the Randy Newman song “You’ve Got A Friend In Me”. Others, like “Zero To Hero”<em> </em>from <em>Hercules</em> and “Trust In Me”<em> </em>from <em>The Jungle Book</em>, are better than they have any right to be.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not typically electronic music that I enjoy, but the sheer amount of fun the composers are having here is incredible to behold and appropriate for a goofy kart racer. There is clearly a lot of love here. In no particular order, here are some of the more beguiling and/or compelling tracks. Please enjoy.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm - Atlantica ( Part of Your World ) Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jGtGPzBJttU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>“Part Of Your World” from <em>The Little Mermaid</em> from Disney Speedstorm.</figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm - Arendelle ( Do You Want to Build a Snowman ) Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D6B0pAvKOTA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>“Do You Want To Build A Snowman?” from <em>Frozen</em> from Disney Speedstorm.</figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm - The Nightmare Festival ( This Is Halloween ) Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JldCm_fH7O4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>“This Is Halloween” from <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em></figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm - Andy's Room ( You Got A Friend In Me ) Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylAJF85xpm4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>“You Got A Friend In Me” from <em>Toy Story</em> as it appears in Disney Speedstorm.</figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm - The Great Wall ( I'll Make A Man Out Of You V3 ) Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B7Qh2GmaQXA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>“I’ll Make A Man Out Of You” from <em>Mulan</em></figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm - Jungle Ruins ( Trust In Me V2  ) Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cb3ovKS-cH0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>“Trust In Me” from <em>The Jungle Book</em></figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm - Mount Olympus ( Zero to Hero ) Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z1h0i6Wd0Pw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>“Zero To Hero” from <em>Hercules&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm - Toon Village ( Mickey Mouse! ) Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OC5D0VouHRk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The theme from The Mickey Mouse Club from the 50s</figcaption></figure></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
