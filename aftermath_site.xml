            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-review-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Having bounced off the last two games in what's now a fairly long-running series--<em>Two Point Hospital</em> (2018) and <em>Two Point Campus</em> (2022)--I wasn't super pumped to be sitting down with <em>Two Point Museum</em>. A week later I can see that my indifference was <em>wildly </em>misplaced; it's one of the best, if not <em>the </em>best management games I have ever played.</p><p>My main problem with the first two games in the series wasn't necessarily with them as <em>games</em>, per se, but more their setting. I found them weirdly stressful: As the custodian of a hospital and then a school, there was a duty of care, a constant pressure to get people in, make them better (or smarter) then get them out. Fail and I could get people hurt, or even <em>killed</em>, a level of responsibility I absolutely do not want in a relaxing "click and watch some little guys move around" video game.</p><p>Not here. <em>Two Point Museum</em> just wants you to give a never-ending stream of guests and customers a good time. The general public are rarely in danger, are surprisingly patient as you repair stuff around them and are basically in your museum for the same reason you are: they want to have a coffee, learn some stuff and see some cool shit. This shift in focus changes the experience entirely; it's no longer a game about care, it's a game about being a fun guy.</p><p>And that's fun! Thanks to the vibe switch, <em>Two Point Museum</em> feels almost <em>Sims</em>-like at times, because there's less emphasis on the pinpoint optimisation of your museum (though you can do that if you like) and more of a focus on creative sandboxing, designing cool exhibits, then agonising over how you're going to decorate them.</p><p>This construction side of the game is so important here because your museum runs on "buzz". You generate buzz via the quality of your exhibits, which is partly down to stuff like their rarity, but mostly down to how you style them by adding stuff like plants, information displays, lighting and speakers. There aren't hard rules you need to stick to in order to upgrade your exhibits; the game assesses you more on the quantity of stuff you add, not the quality of its placement. You can spend hours dressing up your dinosaur bones exactly how you like, and if that's how you like it, the game will reward you for it.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Two Point Museum | Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BXgVvAMUZ4Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Beyond the positive vibes and very enjoyable sandbox/construction tools, this is also a <em>very </em>good management game. Its interface, combining on-screen alerts (like icons appearing over the heads of guests and staff) with a speedy set of menus, is almost frictionless; you're always alerted to the exact location and cause of a problem (or even a shortcoming) almost instantly, and solving those issues usually only takes a click or two. Not once during my entire week with this game did I ever feel lost, or wondered exactly what was causing an issue, or how I was supposed to make something better. While I know that sounds like the absolute basics of this genre, you'd be surprised--<em>Planet Coaster 2</em>, I'm looking at you--how many rivals can't get it right.</p><p>Well, no, I did get lost <em>once</em>, and that was when crimes were being committed. <em>Two Point Museum</em> is full of crime. It has a whole system attached to detecting and defeating it that would be more at home in a game about art heists or jewellery stores. Criminals are forever trying to break in and steal your stuff, and you have various ways of trying to stop them, from putting security guards near exhibits to building a network of cameras around the museum. But the act itself is strangely punitive; you sometimes get almost no time to react before you can lose a whole exhibit when a single thief drags an entire Stegosaurus skeleton down a toilet (don't ask) and escapes. Those things can take ages to build, so to lose them in an instant is weirdly at odds with the rest of the game's casual, fun-loving, build-whatever nature.</p><p>A game about running a modern museum and managing a diverse staff of skilled workers could also have been areas <em>Two Point Museum</em> tripped up, but I was pleasantly surprised by its handling of both. First, how they managed to make a whole game about museums work without once having to whistle awkwardly as we collected antiques or raided tombs is a miracle--you instead build collections based on dinosaur bones, fossils, fish, ghosts and space--which <em>sounds </em>weird, but once you start playing the game it really does make sense within <em>Two Point's </em>cartoonish universe.</p><p>And second, there aren't many games where the phrase "pay your workers" is more important. Everyone you hire can eventually be trained to be <em>elite</em>; as they learn more and get better at their jobs, they ask to get paid more, and you have to pay them a lot more. Unlike loads of other management games, you can't skimp here; if you don't pay them they get angry and walk, and losing your best workers can cripple your entire operation. So look after your people! Good lesson!</p><p><em>Two Point Museum</em> is out now on PC, Mac, Xbox and PlayStation.</p><figure><figcaption>My copy came with some bonus Sega stuff.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-magic-system-anime<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ll let y’all in on a little secret: I do not watch every seasonal anime. As someone who was once tasked with writing up <a href="https://kotaku.com/fall-anime-guide-2023-crunchyroll-netflix-hidive-hulu-1850871611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-ass slideshows</a> breaking down each anime, I no longer have time to watch every new show that crops up on the scene. I’m gonna die one day, so unless I come across a show that catches my eye or gets enough word-of-mouth recommendations from folks whose taste I trust, I’m not tuning in. This feeling is doubly true for new-age shonen anime.&nbsp;</p><p>Having served my time watching <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Bleach</em>, and <em>Naruto </em>when they were concurrently airing, I’ve no big desire to jump on new-age shonen like <em>Fire Force</em> and <em>Black Clover</em>, much less engage in sweaty online conversations about which shows will be the next <a href="https://otaku.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Three" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shonen big three</a>. While I’m of the mind that there will <a href="https://gizmodo.com/shonen-jump-big-three-future-2000501015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never be another shonen big three</a>, I’ve tapped on the enclosure of anime fans ramping up their debates over which series to christen as the forerunner of the <a href="https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-science-saru-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">industry’s best and brightest</a> as heavy hitters like <a href="https://aftermath.site/jujutsu-kaisen-magneto-xavier-gojo-geto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em></a>,<em> My Hero Academia</em>, and <em>Demon Slayer</em> near their end.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Babe Ruth signaling a home run, Crunchyroll has given full-throated confidence points that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gachiakuta-anime-trailer-crunchyroll-release-date-2000575939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gachiakuta</em></a> will be that series when it premieres in July. Having peeked at the manga before the release of its official trailer on multiple recommendations from friends, I think it will live up to that lofty claim of the merit of its magic system alone.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gachiakuta | OFFICIAL TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3UkmWacjR7Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Before I recount <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s logline, I wanna give an anecdote that’ll tie into its unique magic system and why I think it’s got the juice to be shonen anime’s next big thing. Most of the cool-looking furniture in my apartment came from spontaneous dumpster dives and pawn shop finds. Key among my finds is a perfectly good <a href="https://business.walmart.com/ip/Kings-Brand-Furniture-Kitchen-Island-Storage-Cabinet-with-Marble-Finish-Top-White/3927260608" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kitchen island with a marble top</a>, a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/BICIK-63-7-in-Black-Dimmable-Column-Floor-Lamp-with-Display-Shelves-Remote-Control-1-USB-and-1-Type-C-Ports-1-Power-Outlet-H-CJD04-US-MB/330426954?source=shoppingads&amp;locale=en-US&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoqQ4vtFw0bLM_fmfCIGM-2X3ak4DLvkqAyCILzuUbxmwSYbQZvhkqA&amp;gQT=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">column paper lantern floor lamp with built-in outlets and USB ports</a>, and a <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/support/product/lg-42LD520.AUS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">42” Logitech TV</a> that I found in the alley behind my current apartment with a sticky note saying it still worked. Whether they were thrown away during a move that couldn’t consolidate space or no longer matched their previous owners' ethos, they’ve come into my possession as pretty nifty mainstays in my apartment.&nbsp;</p><p>So imagine my surprise when my partner told me we should get rid of the dingy TV we swapped out of our bedroom for the better back alley Logitech one we’ve got. Sure, she’s got a point that owning three TVs is a bit much. Plus, since swapping it out in the bedroom, it's been politely sitting by our recycling bin as a reminder that it's overstayed its welcome. But I couldn’t get myself to part with it. Despite that shitty RCA TV having a considerable blue pixel blemish in its lower third, it's been with me longer than any other object in my house. That TV has been with me since my first year of college. It also gave me comfort during hard times when I was fighting off homelessness, living in the basement of a friend of a friend as I used FYE paychecks to slowly pay my way from Cheyenne, Wyoming, back home to Chicago. It was the only TV I ever needed in my first studio apartment when I got into games journalism. If anything, the blue blemish in its lower third was a battle scar, noting how far it has come in its country-wide journey from City National Pawn for the low price of $105.&nbsp;</p><p>To make a long story short, I didn’t get rid of the TV. It's found a new home atop a bookshelf (which I also dumpster-dived for) in my home office with my “work PS5” (which my partner’s rich coworker just gave away because they didn’t want it anymore). Finding a new purpose for my old TV made my heart grow three sizes on some real sentimental shit.&nbsp;</p><p>That feeling is quite literally at the heart of <em>Gachiakuta</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Gachiakuta</em>, created by Kei Urana, is a dystopian action manga. Its hero, Rudo, is a social outcast who spends his days repairing and finding new purposes for trash discarded by rich people. His life is as good as it could be living off the garbage of the rich until he's framed for the murder of his uncle and thrown from a luxurious floating city into the bottomless abyss of a landfill called The Pitt. His ultimate goal is to return to the floating city and exact revenge on the people who threw him away like trash. The only obstacles in his path are Pitt's toxic air, wasteland raiders, and giant kaiju constructed from living piles of junk. While the manga is poised to depict a generational crashout with Rudo, its magic system has me believing <em>Gachiakuta</em> might actually be the next big shonen series.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The power of friendship with inanimate objects. </figcaption></figure><p><em>Gachiakuta</em>‘s power system allows its heroes to transform sentimental objects into all-powerful weapons. These "vital instruments" can range from construction gloves to a walking cane to a dingy umbrella. While its cast of supporting characters only has one vital object, Rudo — being the main character — can turn any discarded object into a vital instrument. From the 20 chapters I've indulged in the manga ahead of its anime premiere, I've seen this ability used with the utmost emotional climax, repurposing childhood trinkets and weapons from his fallen allies. It's a simple concept, sure, but it's more intriguing than watching characters charge up and arbitrarily get stronger. Put that in the mix with the series’ worldbuilding of the rich dumping trash on the poor à la <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18207027/alita-battle-angel-review-rosa-salazar-robert-rodriguez-christoph-waltz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Battle Angel Alita</em></a>, and you’ve got pretty interesting new-age shonen on your hands.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Gachiakuta </em>tapped into a part of my brain that few new-age shonen manga have since <em>Chainsaw Man</em> hit the scene with its demons powered by the fear of concepts like death and falling. It also doesn’t hurt that the series is being adapted by <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2024-10-02/studio-bones-spins-off-production-department-as-new-company-bones-film/.216251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bones Film</a>, the spin-off production company behind hit anime like <em>My Hero Academia,</em> <em>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</em>, and <em>Mob Psycho 100. </em>I’ll be watching to see if the series lives up to the hype on my RCA TV.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-review-impressions"><h3>Two Point Museum: It’s Great</h3></a><p>No tombs were raided in the making of this video game</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/monster-hunter-movie"><h3>That Live Action Monster Hunter Movie Kinda Rips</h3></a><p>Who would’ve thought Paul W.S.
