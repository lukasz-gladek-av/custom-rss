      <p>Yesterday, news broke that as part of layoffs affecting around 10,000 people at Meta, the company had <a href="https://aftermath.site/meta-ubisoft-unity-layoffs-2026/"><u>closed three VR studios</u></a>: Sanzaru, Armature, and Twisted Pixel. Now former Meta employees tell Aftermath that <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> developer Camouflaj has suffered heavy layoffs as well, and that in-development game projects have been canceled.</p><p>Speaking under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, former Meta employees said that Camouflaj is now made up of “just a handful of employees” who are working on "the new user experience for upcoming hardware." Studio heads, they told Aftermath, have been let go, and active game projects under development have been shut down. Additionally, they say, a sequel to <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> was in development at Sanzaru – rather than Camouflaj – but as of yesterday, Sanzaru no longer exists.</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Meta for additional details, but did not receive a response as of this publishing. A Meta spokesperson <a href="https://kotaku.com/meta-game-quest-vr-facebook-deadpool-sanzaru-twisted-pixel-layoffs-2000659376?ref=aftermath.site"><u>told Kotaku</u></a> that Camouflaj was affected by layoffs but is not shutting down.</p><p>While Camouflaj is best known these days for Batman: Arkham Shadow, it got its start with <em>Republique</em>, a 2013 stealth action-adventure that drew on studio founder Ryan Payton's history as a producer on the <em>Metal Gear</em> series. Camouflaj also released <em>Iron Man VR</em> in 2020.</p><p>A handful of Camouflaj employees have taken to LinkedIn to mourn what they’ve lost.</p><p>"I was a part of the recent Meta layoffs that hit Camouflaj," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kaitlinspangler_hey-everyone-i-was-a-part-of-the-recent-activity-7417305593205403648-l6wM?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGs78MBAu8ABzhFGUjynFfCNjxCGUPune0"><u>wrote</u></a> senior animator Kaitlin S. "It's been an incredible 12+ years with the team, and I am so proud of what we accomplished in that time! I will miss the Camouflaj team a great deal. It was an incredible group of game devs."</p><p>"Like many folks in the industry right now, I was recently impacted by layoffs at Meta and Camouflaj," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordan-santiago-pearson_like-many-folks-in-the-industry-right-now-activity-7417335554993860608-keUE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGs78MBAu8ABzhFGUjynFfCNjxCGUPune0"><u>wrote</u></a> cinematic and level designer Jordan Pearson. "I can’t begin to describe my gratitude for my time there. I initially joined the studio early in my career and had the opportunity to grow from intern to production assistant, then into level design, and before I knew it I was taking the lead on cinematic design &amp; implementation in <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>. Camouflaj gave me space to take ownership and follow my passion for storytelling. I'll always be thankful to the teammates who trusted me and mentored me. I’ve never before worked with such talented, compassionate people."</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/meta-ubisoft-unity-layoffs-2026/"><div><p>Bad Day</p><p>Two weeks into the year, too many layoffs</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <title><![CDATA[Finally, Some Good AI Policies]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/bandcamp-games-workshop-ai-ban/</link>
            <guid>1406416</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>For the lion’s share of companies, there seem to be two schools of thought around generative AI: 1) We’re gonna add it to everything, <a href="https://aftermath.site/please-seek-help-immediately/"><u>customer sentiment be damned</u></a>, and then we’re gonna be rich, rich, rich, or 2) Of course we’re wary of AI’s implications, but <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-larian-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate/"><u>c'maahn I'm just a little guy, it's also my birthday, I'm a little birthday boy</u></a>. I’d like to personally commend Games Workshop and Bandcamp for bucking this trend.&nbsp;</p><p>The former, which makes <em>Warhammer</em>, said as part of its recent financial results that while a few senior managers at the company are well-versed in AI and have been given free rein to be “inquisitive” about potential usage, “none are that excited about it yet,” and it’s banned otherwise.</p><p>“We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorized use outside of GW including in any of our competitions,” said CEO Kevin Rountree (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-maker-games-workshop-bans-its-staff-from-using-ai-in-its-content-or-designs-says-none-of-its-senior-managers-are-currently-excited-about-the-tech?ref=aftermath.site"><u>IGN</u></a>). “We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective; the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.”</p><p>He added that “we have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our <em>Warhammer </em>Studio – hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make <em>Warhammer </em>the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.”</p><p>Bandcamp, one of the few services that still tries to help musicians make money, took things a step further, <a href="https://blog.bandcamp.com/2026/01/13/keeping-bandcamp-human/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>announcing this week</u></a> that music generated “wholly or in substantial part by AI is not permitted.” AI impersonations of existing artists are also not allowed.</p><p>“We believe that the human connection found through music is a vital part of our society and culture, and that music is much more than a product to be consumed,” the company wrote. “It’s the result of a human cultural dialog stretching back before the written word. Similarly, musicians are more than mere producers of sound. They are vital members of our communities, our culture, and our social fabric. Bandcamp was built to directly connect artists and their fans, and to make it easy for fans to support artists equitably so that they can keep making music.”</p><p>Bandcamp’s stance is a crucial one as the popularity of AI-generated music, regrettably, explodes. Take, for example, neo-soul artist Sienna Rose, who has three songs in the Spotify top 50 <a href="https://www.avclub.com/the-hottest-neo-soul-artist-on-spotify-doesnt-exist?ref=aftermath.site"><u>despite not existing</u></a>. “She,” unfortunately, is just <a href="https://www.avclub.com/ai-music-slop-haven-timbaland-tata-spotify-breaking-rust?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the tip of the iceberg</u></a>. This does not mean AI has reached a standard of quality such that it’s an acceptable substitute for art made by people with hopes, dreams, and, well, souls; rather, decades of paint-by-numbers pop formulated by the same nine producers and the hyper-commercialization of music by services like Spotify – turning artists’ blood, sweat, and tears into disposable background noise – have primed people to accept watered-down, machine-made gruel. It’s not unlike the way SEO and algorithms turned numerous websites into barely sentient content mills <em>before </em>AI swooped in and finished the job. The powers that be have been trying to build this world for decades. AI was just the missing puzzle piece.</p><p>All we can do now is support the people and organizations that prioritize authentic human ingenuity while doing the slow, hard work of constructing something, anything, better than the modern internet – preferably somewhere else.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/please-seek-help-immediately/"><div><p>Please Seek Help Immediately</p><p>Motherfucker have you listened to yourself</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <title><![CDATA[I Nearly Made It Through All Of 2025 Without Playing A Single Console Game]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/gran-turismo-7-review-impressions-ps5/</link>
            <guid>1406383</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Right before Christmas time,<a href="https://aftermath.site/game-of-the-year-2025-aftermath-luke-plunkett/"> <u>when I started putting my Game of the Year list together</u></a>, I had an odd realisation: not only was not a single game on the list something I played on console, but I didn't remember playing <em>any </em>console games through all of 2025.</p><p>I mean, I'd <em>dabbled</em>. You can't work in this job without picking up a controller at some point, and so if you were being a pedantic asshole you could say I "played" <em>Mario Kart World</em> and <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> at a friend's place. But both were for a matter of minutes, literally to check them out; to say I'd <em>played </em>them would be like sitting through the first four minutes of <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em> then saying you'd seen the movie.</p><p>It was an odd thing to reckon with. Partly because it must surely have been the first year I hadn't properly played a console game since the 1980s, which would have been a hell of a run, but mostly because I quickly realised that instead of being some life-changing realisation, shaking the very foundations of my understanding of this medium and my place in it, it ended up as some harmless trivia. I just didn't really care. It was 2025, you can play <em>The Last of Us</em> on PC now, who gives a shit what machine you play a game on.</p><p>Not that it really mattered, because on December 25 I opened a present from my kids and it was a copy of <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> for the PlayStation 5.</p><p>The most perfect game to land in this situation, given the fact it's probably the most console-ass AAA title left on the planet that doesn't have the word Nintendo on the box. Sony has put a lot of PlayStation games on PC over the last few years, from <em>Horizon </em>to <em>God of War</em> to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, but not this. Never this. <em>Gran Turismo</em> IS PlayStation, it is born of the console; PC racing games are a different breed, and Polyphony must rightly reckon that this experience, a quintessential Japanese console game right down to the music and menus, just wouldn't work there. So if I wanted to play <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, and I did, it was going to have to be on the PlayStation 5.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Those are Australian dollars, but whatever dollars you're using, it's a lot</span></figcaption></figure><p>Why now? This game came out in 2020! Well, I'm not ashamed to say that while I am an enemy of brands and the idea of loving brands, I have one glaring and fatal exception: the electric car manufacturer Polestar. I'm very into the company's focus on both design and sustainability. I own a Polestar 2 and it's incredible, but I want a Polestar 5 more than I have ever wanted a car in my life. Thing is, it's priced at roughly <em>AUD$250,000 </em>(see above), so it's a car I'll likely never get to even <em>drive</em>, let alone park in my garage. So the closest I'll probably ever get is driving one in a mostly-realistic driving video game, where it recently arrived as part of an update that doubled as a marketing exercise for Polestar (see below). A cheap and obvious marketing trick, but they got me.</p><p>I'm still not buying the car (<a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/" rel="noreferrer">unless?!?!</a>), but PlayStation in particular got me, because I <em>love </em>this game. I've always been a fan of <em>Gran Turismo</em> for the simple reason that while it's got its fair share of car tweaks and spare part settings, the main purpose of the series is to serve as an interactive car brochure, a digital exploration of the fancier end of automotive culture. This isn't a driving game with radio DJs and a neon interface,<a href="https://aftermath.site/assetto-corsa-rally-impressions-review/"> <u>nor is it <em>Assetto Corsa</em></u></a>; this one goes out to everyone who obsesses over driving a car that costs more than an apartment, but who doesn't mind having to drive a Mazda 3 for a few laps first. Like me.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lBDF7TuSjQM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Polestar 5 meets Gran Turismo 7 | Polestar"></iframe></figure><p>To give you an idea of the game's tone, if you haven't already played it: Your main source of progression in <em>GT7 </em>is visiting a lovely little cafe in the woods and getting missions from its friendly owner, while a camera pans lovingly over whatever car you're driving at the time and a succession of automotive celebrities and designers share trivia with you about some random BMW from the 1970s. For anyone who is into the looks and history of cars, this is sicko stuff, it's perfect.</p><p>It's also great that despite all the advances in video game horsepower over the last three decades, this is still very much a <em>Gran Turismo</em> game, with the same pros and cons I could have listed after a few hours with <em>GT2</em>. It feels "real" but also weirdly sterile, and the sound effects are realistic but also empty, but the handling and races are all honed so perfectly that none of that really matters. The urge to win a few more bucks so you can buy an old Ferrari overpowers every other complaint I have about spending more time in menus than on the track, or the game still somehow not having a proper damage system. About the only things that <em>have </em>changed since 1997 are that the graphics have got better while the music has got worse.</p><figure></figure><p>Not that I bought too many Ferraris; I wanted this game for the Polestar 5, and after a little grind to unlock it I got my hands on it and never looked back. This thing <em>flies</em>, especially with upgrades, and while I'll never own one I can now at least say I've come as close as I ever will, from getting to hear its electric whirr through my soundbar to panning the in-game camera around its interior and leaving its cinematic driving videos to play on my TV like an aspirational screensaver.</p><p>For the sake of trivia, it would have been interesting to make it through all of 2025 without properly playing a console game. But for the sake of my own enjoyment, I'm very glad I broke that streak with just a few days to spare.</p>
