            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/12/buy-now-pay-later-fall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predatory morass</a> of “buy now, pay later” schemes – which <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/doordash-klarna-payments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">famously and meme-ably</a> made their way to the world of DoorDash food deliveries earlier this year – arises a slimy new option: financing in-game purchases. I’m sure nothing regrettable will come of this, considering how <a href="https://aftermath.site/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-game-currency-rule-roblox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-regulated</a> and famously <a href="https://kotaku.com/loot-boxes-are-designed-to-exploit-us-1819457592" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immune to exploitation</a> in-game transactions tend to be.&nbsp;</p><p>The new system is the result of a partnership between Affirm, a prominent BNPL provider, and Xsolla, a company that makes payment software used by thousands of companies like Epic and Sega, as well as numerous free-to-play and mobile games. In <a href="https://investors.affirm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/xsolla-and-affirm-partner-help-game-developers-offer-players" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an announcement</a> published late last month, Affirm said that its services are now “automatically available to [Xsolla partners’] players – enabling them to split purchases into interest-free biweekly payments or longer-term monthly installments for carts starting at $50.” </p><p>While the companies did not specify which games this has been applied to, it is not hard to imagine a scenario where a player piles up a heap of cosmetics in a free-to-play MMO or a bunch of currency in a battle royale and then pays off the real-world cost in installments.</p><p>The two companies went on to bloviate about how they prioritize “empowering” developers and players “by putting transparency and personalization at the center of every transaction.”</p><p>This news flew under the radar a little bit, which is why I’m dredging it up now. BNPL advocates, which tend to be the companies benefitting from this new, tech-facilitated form of debt, will tell you that they’re offering a service preferable to traditional credit, as payment plans involve fixed terms, can be interest free, and don’t require high credit scores.&nbsp;</p><p>But anybody with a functioning brain will counter that you cannot separate these things from one another as though you’re an old-timey prospector panning for gold. America is a nation built on debt, with a 2024 New York Fed report finding that American household debt sat at <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2024/20240806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$17.8 trillion</a>. Companies large and small worm their way into the cracks of this busted foundation and, of course, extract profit.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/12/buy-now-pay-later-fall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>, research has shown that some BNPL users exhibited symptoms of greater financial distress.&nbsp;</p><p>“What you need to think about is the rest of the consumer’s portfolio. If they’re making BNPL payments … maybe they’re not paying off their credit card, maybe they’re not paying their cellphone bill, and that’s actually more concerning,” said Ed deHaan, a researcher who <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4230633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a paper on the matter in 2023</a>. “They’re essentially substituting one payment for another.”</p><p>Additionally, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – which was trying to <a href="https://aftermath.site/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-game-currency-rule-roblox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subject games with robust in-game currency marketplaces to cursory regulation</a> before the Trump administration <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-doge-cfpb-elon-musk-456b747c367fccbcf3b74d2893cd1a35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gutted it earlier this year</a> – published <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-research-reveals-heavy-buy-now-pay-later-use-among-borrowers-with-high-credit-balances-and-multiple-pay-in-four-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report</a> in January showing that more than 60 percent of BNPL users had simultaneous loans and held higher balances on other credit lines, and that most BNPL loans went to consumers with subprime or lower credit scores.</p><p>If you want more granular examples, social media is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkN6I3gZfGI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rife with them</a>.</p><p>In other words, these systems disproportionately target people who are either on a slippery slope or have already hit rock bottom. They are parasitic, yet another byproduct of rising costs, economic instability, and wealth disparity. In a functioning society, there would be no need for such a thing, which is why the ludicrous notion of financing burritos became such a pervasive meme. But here we are.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, I doubt an increasingly desperate video game industry will have any qualms with leaning on Affirm. Young people are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/young-american-consumer-spending-cut-f2b482e5?st=HJkcW3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spending less on games</a> this year compared to last, but US spending on video game subscriptions, specifically, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ltjvylgirs2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached an all-time high</a> in May 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>"Looks to me that the pressures of higher prices in everyday spending categories like food and general economic uncertainty has folks looking for value," Circana video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ltjvylgirs2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Bluesky</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/buy-now-pay-later-in-game-items-xsolla-affirm]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[With Anthem’s Impending Server Shutdown, I’m Trying It For The First Time]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/anthem-server-shutdown-trying-for-the-first-time-bioware-ea</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/with-anthem%E2%80%99s-impending-server-shutdown-i%E2%80%99m-trying-it-for-the-first-time.1239894/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare’s multiplayer shooter <em>Anthem</em> was released in 2019 and simply didn’t meet the expectations of players or Electronic Arts. There have been some tweaks over the years, but EA stopped supporting the game in 2021. Last week, EA <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the servers will be shut down on January 12, which came as a surprise to the numerous people who had assumed they’d been shut down already. You can’t buy the game or purchase its premium currency anymore, but you can still play it, so I did.</p><p>I flew around the lush planet of Coda, landing by beacons emitting strange power. I weaved through waterfalls and dodged wyverns, sought out new creatures to observe (like a meerkat-esque beast with colorful plumage), and practiced my barrel roll. Though I haven’t encountered any other people playing <em>Anthem</em> — a problem for the online-only multiplayer game that encourages four players per server — I’m not the only one giving <em>Anthem</em> a shot years too late.&nbsp;</p><p>“I personally started playing like a week ago because I saw that it was free with Game Pass Ultimate on Xbox and decided to give it a try to see if the game is as barebones as people say it is,” one player told me. Another player told me they started recently because they were curious why a friend liked the game so much. All three of us are enjoying it — the flying, especially. “The traversal is single handedly the most fun I've had with a game,” one player said. “People call it the best Iron Man game for a reason.”</p><p><em>Anthem</em> hinges on its movement; people like me, who are early on, are still enjoying the novelty of it all. The game’s exosuits give it a sense of movement that’s rare to find in video games, one that’s forgiving but requires precision, simple yet dynamic. Flight is central to <em>Anthem</em>, but BioWare found ways to constantly keep the mechanic interesting, even when you’re not in combat — balancing traveling long distances with using the environment to keep your suit from overheating, therefore staying in flight longer.</p><p>“You couldn't fly indefinitely, your suit would overheat and you'd have to land ‘til it recovered," a player told me. “But if you flew through a waterfall, or through the spray of water at the top of a waterfall, it would completely cool your suit down, and if you flew right over a river or body of water it would also cool your suit down.”</p><p>The best part of the game, that player said, was playing in the free roam mode: “Every so often I'd see another player flying around too, they or I may follow the other and fight alongside them for a while.”</p><p>But <em>Anthem</em> couldn’t live on its movement and flight mechanics alone. The game didn't live up to the ambitious promise of its marketing and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/anthem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched to abysmal scores</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/anthem-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviews</a>. A <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/anthem-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku report</a> published after <em>Anthem</em>'s launch told a story of mismanagement at BioWare: The game was in development for almost seven years, but "didn't enter production until the final 18 months, thanks to big narrative reboots, major design overhauls, and a leadership team said to be unable to provide a consistent vision and unwilling to listen to feedback." After the troubled launch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-plans-a-complete-overhaul-for-anthem-1839892415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BioWare and EA vowed to reboot the game as <em>Anthem NEXT</em></a> as a way to fix the game's many problems. In February 2021, <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2021/02/24/anthem-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BioWare announced it was canceling <em>Anthem NEXT</em></a> and would instead simply keep the servers online as they already were. <em>Anthem</em>'s existed in that state since.</p><p>Despite all this, <em>Anthem</em> continues to support a small, dedicated community of players. For years now, players in private Facebook groups and Discord servers have been gathering to look for groups on all platforms. Sure, you can’t just jump into a game and queue up with three other people, but one veteran player I spoke to, Jon, said he can usually find at least one or more people in the game’s free roam modes.</p><p>But the announcement of the game’s closure is one last breath of life for the game before it’s killed off. “The game feels almost alive again, as if support is [bringing in back],” he said. “Almost like a hope of breathing life back into the game. The community has come back alive from what it was.”</p><p>I’ll keep playing <em>Anthem</em> until it leaves Game Pass on August 15, when it will be tossed into the ether with the rest of the games that have been shut down — games like <em>Dauntless, The Crew</em>, <em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em>, and <em>XDefiant</em>. It’s a common practice for companies to stop supporting games with diminishing returns and low player counts, but one that’s especially painful for the small, dedicated fan bases of online-only games like <em>Anthem</em>. Once a server goes down, there’s nothing left to play.&nbsp;</p><p>Some players are organizing initiatives to stop publishers from taking down games that people have purchased, such as the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stop Killing Games</a> movement, which is currently petitioning people in the UK to bring the issue to Parliament. <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The petition has hit a signature threshold</a> (more than 100,000 signatures), and organizers hope the government will discuss this as a consumer rights issue.</p><p>For now, it’s seemingly too late for <em>Anthem</em>. Any minor boost of the playerbase is just a bump in nostalgia for what the game was or could have been, or simply curiosity.</p><p>“With a shutdown like this around the corner, there's this air of ‘now or never,’ and it's definitely brought me back to the playthrough I'd started,” a player named Leo told me. “So I have to imagine the same might be the case for a few others.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/anthem-server-shutdown-trying-for-the-first-time-bioware-ea]]></content:encoded>
