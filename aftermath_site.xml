            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/luke-plunkett-aftermath-game-of-the-year-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I played a lot of video games last year. Here are the ones I enjoyed the most. </p><p>You might be thinking that mid-January in 2025 is awfully late to be sharing a list like this, especially since practically every other writer and site has done so already. But I have reasons! Firstly, I've been on vacation for three weeks. And secondly, I didn't want to post a list like this while the calendar still read "2024", because there are 365 days of video game releases in the year, and I wanted to give each and every single one of them a chance for its games to make the cut.</p><p>In no particular order, then, here are my favourites, from the most expensive AAA release to the tiniest little game about a naughty dog. </p><p><strong>Yakuza: Infinite Wealth</strong></p><figure></figure><p>A modern masterpiece. <a href="https://aftermath.site/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-spoilers-kazuma-kiryu-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The game so good</a> I <a href="https://aftermath.site/infinite-wealth-ichiban-kasuga-friendship-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviewed it twice</a>. A single sprawling, joyous RPG that managed to simultaneously farewell an old hero and chart an exciting new course for the series.</p><hr><p><strong>Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</strong></p><figure></figure><p>If it's not the greatest video game adaptation ever, it's certainly near the top, <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-douglas-slocombe-cinematography-cutscenes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so faithful it even paid attention to the <em>cinematography</em></a>. With its <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-immersive-machinegames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laboured movement and devotion to the first-person perspective</a> it felt as much like a new Indy movie as it did an Indy video game, and I mean both of those as the highest order of compliment. </p><hr><p><strong>Star Wars Outlaws</strong></p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-outlaws-review-impressions-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This was a great game, and some very good Star Wars</a>. With a fun cast of characters, and an exploration of a side of the universe that mercifully didn't include Jedi, you'd be a moron to let the "discourse" surrounding this sour you on it. </p><hr><p><strong>Songs Of Silence</strong></p><figure></figure><p>One of the best-looking games of the year came out of absolutely nowhere to <a href="https://aftermath.site/songs-of-silence-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not only stun my eyeballs, but strip a tiring Total War formula to the bone as well</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>The Plucky Squire</strong></p><figure></figure><p>With one eye on gaming's past and another on its future, <a href="https://aftermath.site/plucky-squire-pc-switch-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this puzzling quest oozed character and class</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>Caravan Sandwitch</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Rarely a week has gone by where <a href="https://aftermath.site/caravan-sandwitch-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I haven't thought about this game, its beautiful soundtrack and its cast of misfit characters</a>. I had more fun in its small, fully-realised sandbox than worlds ten times--and ten times emptier--its size.</p><hr><p><strong>Wild Bastards</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Did you know I've never played <em>Balatro</em>? Because I know myself and my habits, and I know if I ever allowed myself to, I'd be in trouble. Did you know I'm also an idiot, because <em>Wild Bastards</em>--with its quickfire missions and roguelite escapades--<a href="https://aftermath.site/wild-bastards-blue-manchu-fps-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped in and fucked me up for weeks all the same</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>Tactical Breach Wizards</strong></p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/tactical-breach-wizards-pc-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turns out 2024's best tactics game was also 2024's funniest video game</a>. And those are two of my favourite things. </p><hr><p><strong>Total War: Pharaoh</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Talk about pulling it out of the fire! Creative Assembly released one of the worst Total Wars of all time in 2023, but just a few months later dropped all of its planned DLC at once and, <a href="https://aftermath.site/total-war-pharaoh-dynasties-impressions-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whaddya know, suddenly it was one of the best</a>. </p><hr><p><strong>Thank Goodness You're Here</strong></p><figure></figure><p>An outrageously <a href="https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funny video game</a>, animated and written and voiced all so wonderfully that even months on from release<a href="https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-impressions-north" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I'm still thinking about smoking fish, meat pies and Matt Berry</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>Cataclismo</strong></p><figure></figure><p>A marriage of beautiful art, grisly monsters, fashionable soldiers and sandbox fortress building, this tower defence/RTS/city-builder hybrid came very close to being <a href="https://aftermath.site/cataclismo-impressions-rts-city-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the perfect video game</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>Synergy</strong></p><figure></figure><p>It's not the best city-builder I've ever played, <a href="https://aftermath.site/synergy-pc-city-builder-impressions-review-moebius" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but it's certainly the most interesting</a>, and with its Moebius-inspired visuals also one of the downright <em>coolest</em>. </p><hr><p><strong>Galacticare</strong></p><figure></figure><p>I don't know anybody else who played this, or even wrote about it, which is weird. It's a <em>Theme Hospital</em>-style game that is, I think, better than many of its peers--<em>Two Point Hospital</em> included--<a href="https://aftermath.site/galacticare-review-impressions-pc-bullfrog-theme-hospital" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and is not only genuinely funny, but has a super smart interface to boot</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>Homeworld 3</strong></p><figure></figure><p>I appreciate its attempt to try something slightly different, coming so many years after its predecessors, <a href="https://aftermath.site/homeworld-3-pc-review-impressions-blackbird-steam-rts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but it fell short and so didn't <em>quite</em> hit the same highs</a>. Ah well! What's there was still great, <a href="https://aftermath.site/homeworld-3-concept-art-making-of" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and it was lovely to see all those incredible little ships again</a>. </p><hr><p><strong>Little Kitty Big City</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Much like <em>Caravan Sandwitch</em>, it was another triumph for a bite-sized sandbox. I got to know every corner and shop in these city blocks, and gliding a cat around them doing dumb cat stuff was a blast. <a href="https://aftermath.site/little-kitty-big-city-cat-game-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">There have been a few cat games released recently, but this is by far my favourite</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>Doronko Wanko</strong></p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/dorongo-wango-impressions-steam-pc-bandai-namco-pomeranian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I love this naughty little dog so much</a> and I just wanted to see him make a GOTY list. </p><hr><p><strong>1000xRESIST</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Stop the presses! As you might be able to tell from the lack of hyperlinks in this paragraph, this is the only game on this entire list I hadn't already written about on Aftermath because, well, I only just played it on my vacation. It takes a little while to get going, but once it starts getting comfortable with its party trick, <em>holy shit</em>.</p><hr><p>And that's it! Lots of good video games that I enjoyed very much! Thanks for all the good times! </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-rumors-reveal"><h3>You Can’t Rush Christmas</h3></a><p>A thing is announced when it's announced</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
