            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gamescom Opening Night Live took place earlier today, and like I've done every show since leaving My Old Job, I didn't watch it.<a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> You didn't need to watch it either</a>. If you <em>did</em>, though, or are only now catching up on some of the reveals, have you ever wondered how much it costs to get a game in front of that many eyeballs at the same time?</p><p>As<a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> we've learned from Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest</a>, these things don't come cheap! In Gamescom 2025's case (thanks to Christopher Kassulke<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christopherkassulke_gamescom-onl-gamesindustry-activity-7363542070583521280-nvBy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> for first posting these</a>),<a href="https://forms.gamescom.global/en/booking-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> prices</a> ranged from a downright affordable (RELATIVE) €70,500 (USD$82,000) for a 30-second spot in the pre-show, and went all the way up to €465,000 (or USD$520,000 at time of publishing) for 180 seconds in the main event.</p><p>Here's the full breakdown:</p><blockquote><h3>ONL Pre Show</h3><p>30 Sec - 70,500.00 EUR</p><p>60 Sec - 102,500.00 EUR</p><p>90 Sec - 135,000.00 EUR</p><p>120 Sec - 167,500.00 EUR</p><p>150 Sec - 200,000.00 EUR</p><p>180 Sec - 232,500.00 EUR</p><h3>ONL Main Show</h3><p>30 Sec - 140,000.00 EUR</p><p>60 Sec - 205,000.00 EUR</p><p>90 Sec - 270,000.00 EUR</p><p>120 Sec - 335,000.00 EUR</p><p>150 Sec - 400,000.00 EUR</p><p>180 Sec - 465,000.00 EUR</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Note that not <em>every </em>trailer making up the show was paid for like this. Again, like Summer Game Fest, access to the showcase could come via one of two ways: a "sponsorship" slot, which is paying the prices above, or as an "editorial" slot, which were reserved for "brand new game announcements and breaking game news to drive awareness/audience during the livestream", and which came "without additional costs". </p><p>For those that did spend, that's a <em>lot </em>of money. Especially when you consider a lot of these bigger companies aren't just stumping up for a trailer or two, but for<a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/info/exhibitors/exhibit/pricing-and-packages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> booths</a> and other deals (<a href="https://media.koelnmesse.io/gamescom/redaktionell/gamescom/downloads/pdf/exhibitor/gamescom-sponsorships.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like €75,000 for an 'event module'</a>) across the multiple days.</p><p>Hope it was worth it! And by worth it I mean that for over half a million dollars you got your trailer near the <em>top</em> of a website's "ALL THE STUFF WE SAW AT GAMESCOM OPENING NIGHT LIVE" blog, and not buried somewhere near the bottom.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/la-divina-commedia-game-gamescom-dantes-inferno"><h3>OK History, That’s Enough Rhyming For One Day</h3></a><p>Another Dante's Inferno action game was not on my bingo card for this year, or... life</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bioshock-4-rod-fergusson-cloud-chamber-layoffs-2k-games"><h3>History Doesn’t Repeat, But It Often Rhymes</h3></a><p>There’s always a lighthouse, there’s always a man (Rod Fergusson), there’s always a city</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mafia-old-country-review-impressions"><h3>Curling Up With A Sandwich, A Warm Drink And Mafia: The Old Country</h3></a><p>'I'm genuinely wistful for a good 'ol 7/10, last-days-of -summer video game'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esports-world-cup-new-global-sport-conference-2025-hideo-kojima"><h3>Come On, Guys</h3></a><p>Nobody is forcing Hideo Kojima and a host of industry luminaries to attend a Saudi sportswashing conference.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is 2025, and someone just announced an action game based on 14th century narrative poem<em> The Divine Comedy</em>, the first part of which is <em>Dante’s Inferno</em>. This is not to be confused with EA’s 2010 action game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante%27s_Inferno_(video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dante’s Inferno</em></a>, an idea so unlikely that I remain shocked it ever came to fruition. And now it’s happening again, completely independently of EA’s cult classic.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="La Divina Commedia World Premiere Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DEfaEEKyGI8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><a href="https://ladivinacommedia.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>La Divina Commedia</em></a>, which made its debut today at Gamescom Opening Night Live, bills itself as "a dark fantasy ARPG with hack and slash elements inspired by the famous masterpiece opera by Dante." It’s in development at Italian studio Jyamma Games, which previously released an action Soulslike called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102450/Enotria_The_Last_Song/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Enotria: The Last Song</em></a>. For now, there’s no release date.</p><p>This on the same day that Rod Fergusson, <em>BioShock Infinite</em>’s famed “closer,” <a href="https://aftermath.site/bioshock-4-rod-fergusson-cloud-chamber-layoffs-2k-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returned to the series</a> as franchise head following reports of a troubled decade-long development cycle. And of course<em> La Divina Commedia</em> made its debut during one of Geoff Keighley's announcement smorgasbords, which might be <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-2025-switch-2-launch-geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the greatest anachronism of all</a>. What year is it again? I guess sometime between 2010 and 2013, depending on how you’re counting.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bioshock-4-rod-fergusson-cloud-chamber-layoffs-2k-games"><h3>History Doesn’t Repeat, But It Often Rhymes</h3></a><p>There’s always a lighthouse, there’s always a man (Rod Fergusson), there’s always a city</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mafia-old-country-review-impressions"><h3>Curling Up With A Sandwich, A Warm Drink And Mafia: The Old Country</h3></a><p>'I'm genuinely wistful for a good 'ol 7/10, last-days-of -summer video game'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esports-world-cup-new-global-sport-conference-2025-hideo-kojima"><h3>Come On, Guys</h3></a><p>Nobody is forcing Hideo Kojima and a host of industry luminaries to attend a Saudi sportswashing conference.
