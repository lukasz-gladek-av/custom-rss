Do you think the company cares as much about the rights of <em>other </em>people's games on their platforms?</p><p>Hrm, I dunno, let's take a look. Anyone who's tried to wade through the garbage prominently available on the eShop would already have some doubts about the company’s standards on that front already, but for a more specific case study, check this out:</p><figure></figure><p>On the top left is <em>Unpacking</em>, which is a very good video game. The next five games are most definitely not <em>Unpacking</em>, even though their key art makes them very much look like it. They're not made by the same team, they're not continuations or sequels, they're just some slop--seemingly using AI art on the thumbnails, no less--made to try to cash in on the established game's brand.</p><p>That's some mobile gaming-type bullshit. Surely Nintendo--with the company's history of quality control and video game litigiousness--would not allow such a thing? Like, if <em>Super Mario Galaxy's</em> shop listing was immediately followed by an AI-generated thumbnail for <em>Super Mario Galaxy: New Chapters</em>, someone would end up either bankrupted or strangled and stuffed in the back of a black Toyota Crown.</p><p>Here, though, even <em>Unpacking's </em>creators are being left on read. This is<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wrenegade.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Wren Brier</a>, the game's creative director:</p><figure></figure><p>At time of posting these <em>Unpacking </em>clones are available for download in Australia, Europe and Japan, but not the United States.</p><p>I've contacted Nintendo for comment.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-netflix"><h3>Squid Game: Unleashed, Like Other Squid Game Spinoffs, Misses The Point</h3></a><p>Netflix's mobile game highlights how weird it is to turn Squid Game into IP</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
