            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/deliver-at-all-costs-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/steam-next-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Next Fest</a> is probably the only time I play demos these days, partly because there are simply too many games on Steam and I couldn't get around to most of them even if I wanted to, but also because I'm not someone who normally likes to partake in a game before it's done.</p><p>I don't like to dabble! I don't want to eat two slices of pizza in the car then the rest on the couch; I like to get home, put my feet up, put a movie on, get in the mood <em>then </em>eat all the pizza.&nbsp;</p><p>With demos though, as with everything else in life, there are exceptions, and mine normally come in two forms: sandboxy games where the demo is just letting me kick some tyres for a minute (<a href="https://aftermath.site/islands-and-trains-steam-next-fest-demo-impressions-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Islands And Trains</em></a>), and demos like <em>Deliver At All Costs</em>, where I don't care that I'm having the intro and some missions spoiled early because I'm simply not paying attention to them.</p><p><em>Deliver At All Costs </em>is an isometric game where you drive a car around running errands and making deliveries. As an isometric-enjoyer I'm a huge fan of the perspective as it is, but this game's party trick isn't its viewpoint, it’s the carnage. For whatever reason--and I don't know if the game's narrative will support this, or if anyone will care--but <em>Deliver At All Cost's </em>world is almost <em>fully </em>destructible.</p><p>Look at this!</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Deliver At All Costs - Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRUAafYY32A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Looks fun, right? It <em>is </em>fun. You can download this demo, install it and within minutes be fishtailing a 50s pickup through someone's house before crushing a fence and flattening a whole row of trees. Not for any reason, just because you can.</p><p>I could and should be telling you everything else about the game now, what the rest of the demo was like, its story and structure, but to be honest I have no idea. Every time I've booted this up I've made one right turn out of a garage and just started driving into everything I see.</p><p>Which is fine, it's a demo. The nuance and meat of this game is the pizza, which I'm sure I'll make time for later down the line when this is done. Lights out, whole thing at once, yada yada. For now, as a demo, I just want to wreck shit, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1880610/Deliver_At_All_Costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and for as long as the demo is still available</a>, you should too.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible"><h3>Gundam GQuuuuuuX Is The Sum Of Its Parts In The Best Way Possible</h3></a><p>The new Mobile Suit Gundam is FLCL, Pokémon, and a hint of Evangelion</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-twitch-ban-rick-scott-medicare-medicaid<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker, the biggest leftist political streamer and one of the few progressive voices to rival the right’s small army of endlessly-aggrieved attack dogs, was suspended from Twitch. The cause? During a broadcast last week, Piker suggested that if House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans were as serious about Medicare and Medicaid fraud as they claim, they would “kill Rick Scott,” a current senator and former CEO who oversaw what <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2003/June/03_civ_386.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Department of Justice called</a> “the largest health care fraud case in US history,” instead of elevating him to the upper echelons of the party. This is notable not because of Piker’s suspension, but because of how people – especially other content creators – ended up framing the larger issue.</p><p>Not long after Piker made his incendiary statement last week, the outrage machine kicked into overdrive, with the likes of <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/libs-tiktok/bomb-threats-follow-libs-tiktoks-campaign-against-planet-fitness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actual-violence-encourager Libs of TikTok</a> and rebranded <em>WoW </em>streamer Asmongold – who unsurprisingly <a href="https://x.com/gremloe/status/1890592255947190624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did <em>not </em>turn over a new leaf</a> following his own suspension for <a href="https://aftermath.site/asmongold-apology-palestine-hasan-piker-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2024 racist rant against Palestinians</a> – <a href="https://x.com/libsoftiktok/status/1895556175284036051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clutching</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oqp5_ZYLXs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their pearls</a> at what they suggested was a violent threat against Scott. Numerous others across Twitter and YouTube – some connected to <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a longer-term effort to deplatform Piker and other pro-Palestine streamers</a>, others not –&nbsp; took up their cause, and Twitch suspended Piker a few days later.</p><p>After just one day, Piker’s suspension has concluded, and other usual suspects like Tim Pool are <a href="https://x.com/Timcast/status/1896982287692259588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acting like</a> Twitch is turning a blind eye to murder. Never mind that even Piker did not suggest viewers should harm Scott. He remarked that Johnson and other high-ranking Republicans <em>would </em>do it if they stood by their stated principles, an idea so far outside the realm of possibility as to be on its face absurd.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="i got cancelled." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vmzLMjCbLXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>"My statement was hyperbolic,” Piker said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmzLMjCbLXg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a YouTube video</a> addressing the suspension today. “But the intention of it was not a call to violence directly against a sitting senator, but instead was to show the hypocrisy of the Republican party in terms of how little they truly care about Medicare and Medicaid fraud – because that happens at the point of the provider and not necessarily at the point of the recipients. They want to cut Medicare and Medicaid for the recipients <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/medicaid-cover-congress-proposed-budget-cuts-felt-rcna193897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the tune of $800 billion</a>, and in order to justify that they will do everything in their power to lie and claim that it's actually your grandparents that are stealing from Medicare, and not people like Rick Scott."</p><p>Piker, who back in 2019 found himself in hot water over <a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-suspends-popular-leftist-streamer-after-controve-1837518859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a similarly de-contextualized remark</a> that America “deserved 9/11,” resolved to use “more deliberate and more careful language” in the future. Probably a smart move, though as Piker observed in his video, nobody is going to be perfect 100 percent of the time when they’re live day in and day out, going back and forth with a contentious chat. All the while, creators espousing right-wing viewpoints – which often explicitly or implicitly advocate for violence against immigrants and trans people – are <a href="https://aftermath.site/nickmercs-twitch-ban-transphobia-slur" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">held to vastly different standards</a>.</p><p>Also, more importantly, the streamer drama portion of this story barely matters! The problem Piker pointed to during the stream that got him suspended – a former CEO of a healthcare company that copped a record $1.7 billion in fines going on to dodge material consequences, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article288431251.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walk away with $10 million in severance and $300 million in stock options</a>, and become a US senator – is an issue of so much more consequence than Piker's word choice that these things are not remotely comparable. It is deranged that millions of people are getting their news from creators who act like a damn Twitch streamer using harsh language to state documented facts is where this story starts and ends, rather than in the halls of actual power.&nbsp;</p><p>We’re all being robbed. It’s as clear as day. There was <a href="https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an (alleged) murder about it</a>, and many people <a href="https://aftermath.site/awesome-games-done-quick-speedrun-luigi-skyrim-zelda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sided with the (alleged) murderer</a>. Think about why political pundits and content creators might now be incentivized to muddy the waters, especially where healthcare is concerned. Think about how they might stand to benefit from your distraction, even as normal people’s material circumstances <a href="https://thehill.com/business/5175396-trump-tariffs-economic-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">degrade by the day</a>. Think about how platforms make themselves complicit by algorithmically favoring outrage and drama dogpiles over discussion that threatens the status quo. Anybody who frames this conflict in any other way – who suggests different stakes or a different central cast of characters – is either deeply unserious or outright lying to you. Do not listen to them. Odds are, they’re trying to rob you too.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible"><h3>Gundam GQuuuuuuX Is The Sum Of Its Parts In The Best Way Possible</h3></a><p>The new Mobile Suit Gundam is FLCL, Pokémon, and a hint of Evangelion</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/valkyrae-cinna-emiru-attacked-amouranth-robbed-twitch-kick"><h3>Three Big Twitch Streamers Attacked, Another Robbed At Gunpoint, On Same Night</h3></a><p>Multiple instances of streamers in severe peril have the Twitch community reckoning with sexism and security</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
