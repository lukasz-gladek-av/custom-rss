      <p>Over the weekend my daughter came to me with a problem: One of her airpods wasn't as loud as the other. After asking her if she'd done some obvious first steps--had she disconnected and reconnected them, had she rebooted her phone, both of which got me a groan that said "<em>of course</em>"--I sat down with her to try to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>First stop was a Google search, which in 2026 brought up an AI-generated summary of some helpful advice, which read:</p><blockquote>If one AirPod is quieter, first&nbsp;check and adjust the&nbsp;<strong>Audio Balance slider</strong>&nbsp;in your iPhone's Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Audio/Visual to the center, then perform a deep clean of the speaker mesh on both AirPods, and if issues persist, try a full reset of the AirPods and restart your device.&nbsp;1. Check Audio Balance (Most Common Fix)&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Audio/Visual</strong>.</blockquote><blockquote>Find the&nbsp;<strong>Balance</strong>&nbsp;slider and ensure it's centered (at 0.00).</blockquote><blockquote>If it's off-center, move the slider towards the quieter AirPod to even out the volume.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>2. Clean Your AirPods</blockquote><blockquote>Remove the ear tips (for AirPods Pro).</blockquote><blockquote>Carefully inspect the speaker and microphone mesh on both AirPods for debris, earwax, or lint.</blockquote><blockquote>Gently clean them with a dry, soft-bristled brush or a cotton swab to remove blockages.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Not wanting to trust a predictive text system with delusions of grandeur, I checked the links those results were pointing towards, and because they were all Apple Support pages I went directly there for help. They...said the same thing, that's why Google had pulled those answers for the AI result.&nbsp; We tried all of them, right down to the cleaning, and none of them worked.</p><p>So I decided to ask the same question but point the search towards Reddit, and was given a post called "My left AirPod is much quieter than my right. How do I fix it?". That was <em>exactly</em> our problem, so I clicked the link, checked the top reply and it was someone saying..."Suck on the one with low sound".</p><p>User MarbledCats didn't say <em>where </em>to suck on it, but it looked like the bit with the speaker mesh that goes inside the ear was the only place that made sense, so I wiped the outside of it, closed my eyes, shut out the sound of my daughter saying "oh my God what are you <em>doing</em>" and sucked. Then I sucked again, just to be sure. To paint the picture of a grown man sucking on a tiny white plastic earbud, it wasn't a huge toke, just a couple of puffs. I had no idea why exactly I was doing this, what this was supposed to achieve or how it was all working, but MarbledCats had been upvoted for this advice, so it was worth a shot.</p><p>Wiping down the earbuds again--I felt bad for them, they were never designed for this kind of bodily fluid exchange--I handed them to my daughter,<a href="https://aftermath.site/cancel-spotify-wrapped-ai-ceo-apple-music/"> <u>she hit PLAY on Spotify</u></a> and hey. Problem solved. The volume was back, they were working perfectly, and she went away happy.</p><p>I'm still not sure what I actually <em>did</em>. Comments under MarbledCats' post suggested that the shock of a suck hitting those confined spaces would separate any wax or dirt that were sitting on the earbud's drivers--and which would have been covering them, muffling the sound–knocking them loose. Maybe that's the case, I don't know, all I know is that I followed the advice and it worked.</p><p>Perhaps the more pressing question you've got beyond how it worked is why did I follow that advice in the first place? Sucking on an earpod sounds like prank advice, gross shit, something a kid on Reddit would post just to fuck with me. But when I followed the link and saw responses like this, I just had to try it.</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>Add me to the list of people saying "wow I thought this was joke and it worked wtf". </span></p></figcaption></figure><p>It felt good to have fixed my kid's problem, sure, but it felt even better to have had yet another moment to cherish that despite tech's best efforts to cram AI into every facet of our lives against our will, in ways that make daily tasks pointlessly more difficult and in cases like this actively worse, a bunch of people had got together to try some weird shit and it worked, and were sharing that information for the benefit others, in a way the plagiarism lake boiling machine's best efforts could never.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>Highguard</em>, the PvP “raid shooter” with phantom horses from former <em>Titanfall </em>devs, is out today. The road to this point has been long and winding, albeit only in terms of how it’s <em>felt </em>to traverse: Revealed as The Game Awards’ “one more thing” final trailer in December, <em>Highguard </em>proceeded to disappear into a month-long cloud of speculation and derision.&nbsp;</p><p>What was this generic-looking multiplayer game that dared to occupy a slot reserved, in viewers’ minds, for <em>Half-Life 3</em> or <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em>? Details were scant bordering on nonexistent. Ragebaiters and clip farmers on X and YouTube feasted. <em>Highguard</em>, the narrative went, had doomed itself to being the next <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation/"><em><u>Concord</u></em></a>. As of today, we finally have an answer to the question of how <em>Highguard </em>actually plays – <a href="https://www.avclub.com/highguard-game-hands-on-preview?ref=aftermath.site"><u>decently enough, apparently</u></a> – as well as a greater understanding of how we ended up here in the first place. It didn’t have to be this way! But it also sort of did.</p><p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Speaking with Kotaku</u></a>, Wildlight Entertainment co-founder Chad Grenier explained that the plan since “day one” had been to shadow drop the fantastical FPS, as it had worked out well for his previous project, <em>Apex Legends</em>. But then Geoff Keighley, an old friend, stepped in.</p><p>“We’ve known Geoff for a long time, and he said, ‘let me do something,’ that’s maybe a little risky in hindsight – but different, [to] take a free to play PvP Raid Shooter and do something with it,” Grenier said. “So we rushed a trailer together. I wish the reception had been better, but in hindsight we made a trailer to entertain really quickly, and didn’t show the gameplay loop, and what’s different and unique.”</p><p>Releasing your first game as an independent – although clearly well-funded – studio, who’d turn down that kind of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/hero-shooter-highguard-reportedly-didnt-even-pay-for-the-game-awards-slot-thats-earned-it-so-much-preemptive-hate-the-showrunners-thought-it-deserved-the-spotlight/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>free marketing</u></a>? Especially when your game is cannon-balling into a crowded genre rife with high-profile failures? In a previous era, it would have been a no-brainer, a gift horse you wouldn’t even think about looking in the mouth. But a confluence of modern and age-old factors quickly turned the tide against <em>Highguard</em>.</p><p>Much of the ensuing ugliness stemmed from the fact that Wildlight went radio silent following the initial Game Awards reveal. Those who expected a more traditional marketing campaign – a drip feed of character and map reveals, or even just a more elaborate trailer – got nothing, so they used their imaginations to fill in the blanks. In response, Wildlight decided to maintain course.</p><p>“We stayed silent because we knew that the first time, the next time that we say anything to the audience, it better be the game and let the game speak for itself,” Grenier told Kotaku.</p><p>Depending on how you measure it, this ended up being a mistake. I totally understand the allure of a splashy, <em>Apex Legends</em>-style shadow drop, but after doubling back and deciding to reveal the game shortly before release, you can’t really have it both ways. Moreover, the internet of now is very different from the internet of 2019. Covid transformed social media into an endless, awful conversation; once you pop, the horrors never stop. Debuting and then disengaging isn’t really an option – at least, not if you want to keep the vultures away. Recent years have only worsened this dynamic, with short-form video content taking over as the predominant mode of expression and <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers/"><u>giving rise to a generation of caustic clip farmers</u></a> who yank at the udder of any perceived drama of the week until it’s chafed and bone dry. Then they move onto the next thing and deploy the same playbook again.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Highguard </em>got hit even harder than it otherwise might’ve due to the fact that, at least in games, December constitutes the dead of winter, and there wasn’t really a “next thing” for cynical, opportunistic content creators to monkey-bar over to. So one video became two, and then three, and four, and so on. With each passing week, continued silence from Wildlight functioned as additional evidence that something was amiss. The <em>Highguard </em>mystery, unfortunately, lent itself perfectly to sloptubers’ regular stream-of-videos approach.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>One example among many</span></figcaption></figure><p>And then there was the <em>Concord </em>of it all. While comparisons were clumsy at best – <em>Highguard </em>does not have major publisher backing, for one – the facts of a situation do not matter in the modern social media landscape. Feelings dictate people’s response, and they are easily and algorithmically manipulated. The rough outline of a situation similar to <em>Concord</em>’s was there, and that’s all content creators needed to whip portions of the internet into a frenzy: The Game Awards, in this case, functioned like Sony, an institution propping up a safe-looking hero shooter no one asked for.&nbsp;</p><p>Rage at the industry, misdirected or not, did the rest. Certainly, there is warranted fatigue around live service games emerging from the triple-A (or in Wildlight’s case, triple-A-adjacent) sector. Big, more traditional video game companies want a ladle full of the perpetual stew <em>Fortnite</em>,<em> League of Legends</em>, and a small handful of others have transformed into an infinite food supply, and in pursuit of that, they’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-franchises-ip-sony-ea/"><u>misused and abused</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-layoffs-ea/"><u>once great</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/bungie-layoffs-destiny/"><u>studios</u></a> and released a series of duds like the aforementioned <em>Concord </em>– by no means a terrible game, but something so aggressively Fine that it failed to really grab anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>But right-wing sloptubers have repeatedly harnessed this energy to feed their endless culture wars, <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service/"><u>claiming that diversity is the reason these games fail</u></a>. More than that, they <em>want </em>them to fail; they approach the prospect with a sort of knives-out glee. All of it fits their narrative that even with hundreds of thousands or millions of followers, they are the brave little guy(s) speaking truth to power amid an industry of shill-happy journalists and agenda-pushing developers. Within this framework, there is room to advance <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2015906199527686220?ref=aftermath.site"><u>conspiracies</u></a>, to present the industry as a series of shadowy cabals working against The Common Gamer (rather than a series of <a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump/"><u>out-in-the-open cabals working against everyone except themselves</u></a>). Again, <em>Highguard</em>’s prolonged period of silence – after a push from Geoff Keighley, gaming’s self-appointed kingmaker – provided a perfect seed bed for those kinds of tall tales to take hold.&nbsp;</p><p>Facing down a truly nightmarish minefield, it’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/highguard-game-awards-marketing/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>hard to fault</u></a> <em>Highguard</em>’s developers for opting to disengage from all the engagement bait. Arguably, there was no correct way to play this. Turn down an opportunity to get millions of eyes on your game during the biggest event of the year? No shot. Spin up a whole marketing campaign when your trailer was already a last-second effort? Basically impossible. Play whack-a-mole with conspiratorial nonsense ginned up by the usual sloptuber suspects? Would’ve almost certainly been used as additional fuel for the fire. Maybe a little good faith communication directly from the developers would’ve helped put faces to names and engender trust, but there’s no way to know – and the risk was obviously very high.</p><p>Regardless, <em>Highguard </em>now finds itself positioned awkwardly at the starting line, albeit well ahead of where many others begin. On one hand, you can’t deny that all of this free publicity bolstered the game’s player count, with its launch day numbers <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>peaking at nearly 100,000 concurrents</u></a> (and hundreds of thousands more watching on Twitch and YouTube). That is… uncommon, for an indie shooter, to say the least. On the other, public sentiment is not great. <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-launch-pc-ps5-free-to-play-servers-is-it-good-titanfall-apex-2000663135?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Technical issues and performance problems</u></a> are being received even worse than they otherwise would be, and every design decision has been met with intense doom-and-gloom scrutiny – despite the fact that this is day one of a game meant to have a long tail. The game’s Steam reviews have cratered to “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/?ref=aftermath.site#app_reviews_hash"><u>mostly negative</u></a>.” Geoff is <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2015164852743065967?ref=aftermath.site"><u>running a weird sort of victory lap</u></a>, which probably isn’t helping matters. </p><p>Lending more credence to my assertion that the internet has decayed past the point of usefulness, meanwhile, is the fact that Guy "DrDisrespect" Beahm – a sad middle-aged man who dresses up like an even sadder middle-aged man and who in 2024 confessed to inappropriate DMs with a minor – <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-lies-about-being-invited-to-highguard-preview-event-2000663184?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">lied about attending a <em>Highguard </em>event last week</a>, going so far as to post an image of a fake badge. This led to outrage and controversy, followed by debunkings that, per <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0181821&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">how these things tend to work</a>, almost certainly didn't spread as far as the initial misinformation.  </p><p>Where things go next from here is anybody’s guess, but I imagine many will be watching with great interest – and not necessarily for the right reasons.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers/"><div><p>Beefed Up TwitchCon Security Couldn’t Stop The Internet’s Issues From Spilling Over Into Real Life - Aftermath</p><p>Despite all the sights and sounds, one scene defined TwitchCon 2025.
