            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>In an article called “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/08/business/ai-claude-romance-books.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>The New Fabio is Claude</u></a>,” the New York Times speaks to romance novel “authors” who claim that AI is the future of the genre. This is both obviously untrue, but also not at all what these two authors have demonstrated with their financial success from using AI.</p><p>The Times spoke to two authors who use AI to write entire books. One, who uses the pen name Coral Hart, says that by using prompting and Claude, she can generate an entire book in 45 minutes. Interestingly, she also sells courses about how to best use AI to write romance novels.</p><p>“Ms. Hart has become an A.I. evangelist,” the article reads. “Through her author-coaching business, Plot Prose, she’s taught more than 1,600 people how to produce a novel with artificial intelligence, she said. She’s rolling out her proprietary A.I. writing program, which can generate a book based on an outline in less than an hour, and costs between $80 and $250 a month.”</p><p>Out of curiosity, I checked out the Plot Prose website. The “script the draft” package on the homepage of Plot Prose promises it can deliver “your next novel 90% complete and fully packaged for publication,” saying you can skip the “hardest part” of writing, which is writing. She also offers “AI creation kits,” which are pre-packaged drafts and outlines that also include “AI-writer optimized scene beats for fast execution.”</p><p>Another so-called “author,” Elizabeth Anne West, says that eventually, readers won’t care if a book is written by AI. Coincidentally, West <em>also</em> sells courses on how to use AI to write romance novels.</p><p>“Ms. West, who also teaches classes on how to write with A.I., has gotten blowback from opponents of the technology, including occasional death threats on social media,” the article says. “But she believes that in time, A.I. generated fiction will become widespread and popular.”</p><p>In between these two buried pieces of context–that both of these writers have an economic interest in the success of AI in the writing space because they sell courses on how to use AI to write books–this article only barely describes whether or not these books are any good or if readers like them. Another author who uses AI to write romance novels even admits that the technology is pretty bad at doing so.</p><p>“Whenever Ms. Rompoti’s curvy protagonist, an event planner named Sienna, was in a scene, the A.I. constantly referenced her weight, for example, noting that a chair groaned when she sat down,” the article reads. “‘When you make a point that someone is plus size, it will exaggerate, somebody is suddenly humongous,’ Rompoti said.”</p><p>Both Hart and West claim that their courses are popular—Hart makes the claim that even authors who are against AI in public sign up for her classes–but of course they would. They both run businesses that depend on the idea that romance novels are best written with AI. Except, curiously, West also says that the books that have a disclaimer about AI being used in the writing process don’t sell as well.</p><p>“If you hide that there’s A.I., it sells just fine,” she told the Times.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/nanowrimo-ai-statement-controversy/"><div><p>You Don’t Need AI To Write A Novel - Aftermath</p><p>AI isn’t a privilege issue, no matter what National Novel Writing Month says</p><p><span>Riley MacLeod</span></p></div></a></figure><p>My response to this as a journalist and reader of the occasional romance novel is: of course she would say that. Of course she would say that “eventually, audiences won’t care.” Hart and West have a vested economic interest in this technology succeeding in the literary space. Hart claims she made six figures off of her AI-published romance novels, mostly because she uses AI to produce a manuscript in under an hour. She said that her 200 AI books garnered collectively 50,000 sales, meaning each book sold on average 250 copies. The only way this is a viable business model is if you don’t care if the books are good or if people like them.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, my friend and romance novel author Ella Dawson pointed out that the GoodReads presence for both Hart and West paints a sobering picture of how these books are received. Most of Coral Hart’s books on GoodReads<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/54945185.Coral_Hart?ref=aftermath.site"><u> are rated one or two stars</u></a>. West’s work seems better received, but I think it’s worth pointing out that it appears that <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/5204939.Elizabeth_Ann_West?ref=aftermath.site"><u>every single piece of fiction she has published is fanfic about <em>Pride and Prejudice</em></u></a>, a work currently in the public domain, making her entire output dependent on the work of another author as a baseline.&nbsp;</p><p>“This reporter got snowed,” Dawson told me over text. “The New York Times has a bumpy track record when it comes to taking the romance genre seriously (a Fabio headline? In 2026? Seriously?) but I’m still baffled by their decision to profile these AI-reliant con artists masquerading as authors.”</p><p>For these AI evangelists featured in this article, finding a dedicated audience and reaching those readers through the quality of your work is not the goal. Writing for readers to “feel seen,” as Rompoti describes in the Times’ article, is immaterial. The goal is to make money using fiction. These people have already decided that the fiction they produce is not art—it is content, and the best way to make money through content is either to produce a lot of it, or sell a course on how to get rich fast by producing a lot of content.</p><p>Even according to the Times’ own reporting, readers do not seem to like AI romance novels. One of the two AI critical sources quoted in the article said that she would never knowingly pick up a book written by AI. Another, an author whose work had been scraped by Anthropic to train their AI model, pointed out that flooding the zone with slop makes it much harder for real human authors to be discovered by readers.&nbsp;</p><p>What I found most curious was Coral Hart’s reasoning for using a pseudonym in the article. Coral Hart is a retired pen name and the source would not give any of her current pen names “because she still uses her real name for some publishing and coaching projects. She fears that revealing her A.I. use would damage her business for that work.” Huh! That’s weird!</p><p>The lack of care paid to the actual readers of these AI books feels like a deliberate exclusion. The article describes romance readers as “voracious” and romance novels as “reliant on formula." Ergo, romance novels don’t have to be good, because romance readers will read any old shit as long as it has a Happily Ever After!</p><p>“Credulous reporting like this does nothing but prop up the lie that these ‘authors’ and AI companies desperately want us to believe: that the proliferation of AI across every industry is inevitable .It isn’t! I mean seriously, why would you ever take the word of a self-proclaimed coach who sells courses on using AI to create novels?” Dawson told me. “Readers are not ATMs, romance novels are not content to farm, and if you can’t write a book without firing up a plagiarism machine, you’re not meant to be an author.”</p><p>There’s not much daylight between what these two women do and what’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3xSJuoUnN8&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>described in this Super Eyepatch Wolf video about “Influencer Courses” grifts</u></a>. Through the course of this video, the improbably named John Walsh actually takes some of the YouTube influencer courses only to discover that the people selling these courses don’t even have the YouTube numbers to back up the claims they make. One person selling a multihour lecture about how to be successful on YouTube only had 4,000 subscribers.</p><p>It’s the same model for these grifters. If you make the claim that you are successful—claims which the Times makes very little effort to confirm independently—then you can become a subject matter expert, and sell your expertise for a pretty penny. And the content itself can be complete bullshit that sucks and no one likes, because the content is merely an advertisement for the courses you sell. And those courses don’t have to be good, either! You can just charge $250 for bullshit!</p><p>To me, this is all evidence that <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-is-the-ultimate-forced-meme/"><u>AI is still a forced meme</u></a>. You don’t have to listen to the grifters who tell you that “eventually” everyone will be using this technology and that no one will mind if their books are written by AI. That eventuality is not a guarantee, and there is no real indication that it will ever arrive. Similarly, Christa Désir, vice president and editorial director of Bloom Books, says that AI books will become “undetectable at a certain point.” Handily, to make a prediction like this, you don’t have to provide any evidence to support your claim. You can just say shit, and the Times will print it.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-is-the-ultimate-forced-meme/"><div><p>AI Is The Ultimate “Forced Meme”</p><p>There are few things in this world more insufferable than a rich person trying to force their shitty ideas on everyone else.

    <p>“Your life is going to be horrible, so that’s free money as far as I’m concerned,” streamer Northernlion said before setting a short position on a small alien baby made of molten igneous rock. He was playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3642000/Space_Warlord_Baby_Trading_Simulator/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</u></em></a>, an absurdist stock market simulator that lets you speculate wildly on the lives of alien babies. Short, brutal and laugh out loud funny, it is a game that is only marginally more evil than the financial markets that rule our lives.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/app.bsky.feed.post/3meacbkreps2u" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreicndkjei5x4d6qyacndmxrdfzhjnq47xmzgygutatsuzlkmrtymq4">— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Chris Person (@papapishu.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/post/3meacbkreps2u?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2026-02-07T01:45:21.507Z</a></blockquote></figure><p><em>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</em> starts on a positive note: in the year 3478, devices called FutureSee terminals have given the intergalactic masses limited insight into the long term consequences of the future of companies, conflicts and star systems. This was a massive boon for civilizations everywhere, as technology improved and most wars were now avoidable. But it also devastated all speculative financial markets, as now nothing could be speculated on. With no other options, the financial industry turned to the only speculative asset it had left: the lives of individual babies, which were too volatile and immediate for the terminals to see. That’s right, it’s time to get out there and speculate on the lives of babies.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PCiL6h8x7qM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator -  STEAM LAUNCH TRAILER"></iframe></figure><p>The latest game from publisher <a href="https://aftermath.site/xalavier-nelson-interview-strange-scaffold-el-paso-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/"><u>Strange Scaffold</u></a>, <em>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</em> feels retro in a thoroughly specific way. It feels like a throwback to a game like <em>Drug Wars</em>, a game I spent <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/history-drug-wars-calculator-game/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">endless hours playing on a TI-83 </a>instead of getting work done in math class. Tonally and aesthetically it feels indebted to games like <em>Dinopark Tycoon</em>, <em>Afterlife</em> (a<a href="https://aftermath.site/27-years-later-lucasarts-afterlife-is-brilliant-brutal-and-few-know-how-to-beat-it/"><u> game I was obsessed with</u></a>) and the masterpiece that is <em>Star Control 2</em>. It is absurd on its face, totally unsubtle with what it’s saying, and none the worse for it.</p><figure><figcaption><span>"Likely event: MELTED DOWN FOR BEING TOO OLD" Credit: Strange Scaffold</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like <em>Drug Wars</em> before it and the stock market generally, the goal is to buy low and sell high. You follow the lives of individual babies on a market-style ticker, buying stock in their lives at their worst and selling at their best. The baby’s overall health is indicated by a beating heart on the right side of the screen. The goal is to optimize your profit and make more than you started with plus the cost of the entry fee. The stock ticker will flash various events in the baby’s life from “covered in gleple poop” to “learned what reading is” (their value goes down after this event).&nbsp;</p><p>On top of simply buying stock, you can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)?ref=aftermath.site"><u>short</u></a> a baby if you are confident their life will get measurably worse in the near future. However, this can backfire tremendously and potentially bankrupt you should you be wrong and they get a promotion or find love. If a baby dies in the span of the short, the short is voided. And though you can choose one of four potential babies every day, side bets can be placed on each of them for potential events, life span and overall value.</p><figure><figcaption><span>"BURNED IN JAIL CELL." Credit: Strange Scaffold</span></figcaption></figure><p>The campaign features nine distinct characters and scenarios representing different traders. The plot of each character adds a significant mechanical tweak to each trading period, with four distinct outcomes to each scenario: failure, bronze, silver or gold. For example, trader Holmit Miskie is a disgraced junior financial planner at Holmit &amp; Spawns whose elderly clientele wishes to get in on the new baby trade, a market his bosses are not confident in and thus are setting him up for failure. He is a sad sack who looks like the alien equivalent of Jack Lemmon in <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em>, and mechanically he is not allowed to take side bets. Nuria Voll is a retail trader who puts their rent and everything they have to get into the lucrative baby trading market. Mechanically, she is scammed every day by the lease on her “HiValue Guaranteed trade license” and enters the market just as the entire thing goes to shit in what’s known as “The Great Flip.” Mechanically, the market gets twice as expensive and half as profitable halfway through her run. Rep. Hoddle is a legislator who regulates the market, and thus is not allowed to interact with it, save through an intermediary named Willy “No Hands” Shig. Mechanically, this legal loophole of an unscrupulous proxy adds a significant delay to every purchase and sale, making it harder to trade on volatility.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Wenbill is one of the most vile creatures in all of video games. Credit: Strange Scaffold</span></figcaption></figure><p>In addition to this, there are seven different planets you can trade on, each of which have wildly different market tendencies for the babies on them. For example, Google Gibby is a “war world,” where half of the planet is permanently in conflict to benefit the arms industry. This constant state of war means that baby investments tend to trend steady upwards before the baby’s life turns reliably horrible, often for war-based reasons. Cantor Vantis, meanwhile, is a tropical reality tv show planet where galactic children are sent to compete on the show “Get Big or Die Trying,” and which can lead to sudden fortunes before sudden, comically </p><figure><figcaption><span>"Legally, not a dog." Credit: Strange Scaffold</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Real Housewives</em>-themed deaths. Though the potential for wealth is high, you could lose everything if they die in a celebrity mishap while you’re holding the bag.</p><p>Assisting in your buying and selling are advisors, who can lend insight into the lives of each baby for a fee with varying degrees of accuracy. Details range from the average price of the baby, the value of the baby at age 30, the floor price of the baby, random events in the baby’s life, the longest duration of its positive upswing, and so on. Advisors are key to making money. For example, if you know the average price of a baby is about $3,000, and the baby has been trading below that for several decades, you know that it will have to swing upward above $3,000 for a specific period of time for the overall amount to average out. Occasionally, the knowledge of the advisors will sometimes intersect with the side bets, allowing you to make smarter calls on which baby will pay out aside from the general odds given by the bookies.</p><figure><figcaption><span>What if ancient Greece was also Disney Land.</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</em> is exhilarating, absurd and compelling in the same ruinous way that day trading or speculative investment is. Like <a href="https://aftermath.site/qup-esports-universal-paperclips/"><em><u>Q-UP</u></em></a>, it is a game that takes the mechanical form of the thing it is lampooning, successfully having its cake and eating it too. It is the ideal game for someone like Northernlion to stream, and him screaming like a r/WallStreetBets guy is an incredible bit of comedy. It is not a game that overstays its welcome, and it leaves you wanting more to play (an endless mode would be nice, but maybe that defeats the purpose).&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qn7c7fg31xw?start=127&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="I'm actually a mod on r/WallStreetDads (Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator)"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>He really does sell it well.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><em>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</em> is also a game that could not be more germane to the moment. The last six years have been maddening if you believe in anything resembling financial regulation. Gambling is functionally legal from your phone in most of the country, the market has never been less rational, insider trading is happening nakedly on a historic scale and the entire economy is held together by bubble gum, petty scams and investments that mathematically could never pay out. Every day you wake up, and every day you think “this will be the day that the bottom falls out,” and that sensation of freefalling you felt in 2008, if you were old enough to remember it, forms like a lead ball in your stomach.</p><p>This is not to say that there was some golden era in which the markets were ever ethical–the average 401k or pension quietly finances pure evil–but there was a degree of plausible deniability diffused in the market. Private equity, crypto, and the AI bubble have made those realities increasingly harder to ignore, and now everything is gambling to some degree. And now prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket let you bet on the outcomes of everything <a href="https://www.404media.co/unauthorized-edit-to-ukraines-frontline-maps-point-to-polymarkets-war-betting/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>including war</u></a> with little to no oversight. There’s literally a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzXFURkcCt4&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>grotesque Kalshi ad</u></a> with roughly the premise as this game made with enthusiastic generative AI slop aliens and zero self awareness. Given how supremely warped the world we live in is, how much worse is it, really, to short a baby?</p>
