            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/715220/ziff-davis-creators-guild-cnet-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> layoffs at parent company Ziff Davis</a> last week, the IGN Creators Guild has announced eight layoffs at IGN today, comprising 12% of the site’s bargaining unit. Today’s cuts are the latest in what’s becoming a regular occurrence at the company, and come despite what the union <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ignunion.bsky.social/post/3lvm4rhup5k2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calls</a> “several quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue increases.”&nbsp;</p><p>Several affected IGN staffers have announced their layoffs on social media, including senior features editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lawoftd.bsky.social/post/3lvm53wqnck27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt Kim</a>, video editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oswinstark.bsky.social/post/3lvm4tif6ms2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chelsea Reed Miller</a>, entertainment reviews editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erikadams.bsky.social/post/3lvm7esktjs2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Erik Adams</a>, and gaming editorial events manager <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/robmanuel.bsky.social/post/3lvm6nbmhys2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Manuel</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In a statement, the IGN Creators Guild noted that the move comes not just after recent layoffs that affected sites like CNET, Mashable, and Lifehacker, but “just months after our multibillion-dollar parent company, Ziff Davis, instituted a company-wide <a href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-gamesindustrybiz-humble-buyouts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buyout</a> that shrunk our unit numbers, with the express intent of avoiding future layoffs. And it comes just a little over one year after three of our members were laid off almost immediately after our union <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-creators-guild-union-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went public</a>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The union cited a “a Ziff Davis-mandate to cut costs” as the reasoning behind the layoffs, despite the fact that “IGN Entertainment has had a tremendously successful year thus far” with events like San Diego ComicCon and Summer Game Fest-related coverage. “Every single person impacted today was involved in and critical to the success of those events,” the union wrote. On social media, Adams <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erikadams.bsky.social/post/3lvm7pvitlk2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> that “the cuts span desks and verticals and departments and areas of expertise, and I say without reservation that they're each A Huge Bummer.”</p><p>The union also highlighted IGN’s acquisition of Gamer Network sites including Eurogamer, RockPaperShotgun, and GamesIndustry.biz last year, which saw prompt <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a> and then further departures in the time since. “The company has not responded to the union's questions about whether its budget for future acquisitions is being reconsidered as a cost-saving measure alongside these other apparently necessary personnel cuts,” the union wrote.</p><p>In April, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/656044/ziff-davis-sues-openai-ign-cnet-pcmag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ziff Davis sued OpenAI</a> for copyright infringement, and the union noted that “IGN Entertainment is choosing to eliminate the individuals who ensure IGN remains competitive as generative AI threatens our reach. We have been told that… work that leverages our staff's deep knowledge of gaming, tech, and entertainment are all essential to combating AI summarization and regurgitation of our work. Management has responded by cutting several individuals who do that exact work.”</p><p>Senior reporter and co-chair of the IGN Creators Guild Rebekah Valentine told Aftermath:</p><blockquote><p>Thanks to an interim agreement our bargaining team negotiated earlier this year, we were able to get our members significantly better severance than was offered by the company in the past, including an extra 30 days on top of their owed amount due to the company failing to notify them of the layoffs in advance. They also received at least two months of company-paid COBRA, and will be placed on a recall list for six months in case their job title comes open again during that time. Unions work.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>“While IGN Entertainment management may not value us, we value one another and the incredible work we can do together,” the union wrote. “Behind the articles, videos, social posts, playlists, and maps of IGN are human beings, not just numbers on a spreadsheet to be pushed around when some number at the top isn't big enough. Without us, there is no IGN.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve"><h3>Gabe Newell Bought A Yacht Company</h3></a><p>Valve's head honcho is now in the big boat business</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-chris-plante-sandwich-post-games"><h3>You Have To Hear Chris Plante’s Sandwich Story</h3></a><p>"It’s somehow getting on us, but we’re so happy that we’re not gonna die"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-covid-lockdown-hideo-kojima"><h3>Death Stranding 2 Is A Joyful, Absurd Response To COVID</h3></a><p>Goofy, lighthearted, constantly mugging: Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an exercise in spectacle, a rumination on lockdown, and one of the most human games Kojima has made in years</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/harry-potter-jk-rowling-cge-codenames-board-game"><h3>Board Game Company Fucks Around (Announcing A New Harry Potter Game), Finds Out (When Fans Revolt And Media Announce Boycotts)</h3></a><p>'It’s a product to sell to people who prioritise their nostalgia for children’s fantasy over the culture their trans friends and family live in'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-ziff-davis]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span>WWE/Aftermath</span><span>|</span><span><p>[reverberating fart noise]</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>WWE has never felt more out of touch. In its Netflix documentary <em>WWE Unreal</em>, which was intended to give a hammed-up look inside the company, WWE’s head honcho Paul “Triple H” Levesque, talked about meeting and subverting fans’ expectations like he was a modern-day Machiavelli. The toothless series only really succeeded in demonstrating how disconnected the company is from reality, especially coming after the John Cena heel-turn disaster.</p><p>A heel turn in wrestling is when a good guy wrestler becomes a bad guy wrestler. Wrestlers do it all the time, signaling a paradigm shift in their gimmicks and their relationship with the audience. In all of Cena’s two decades with WWE he has never turned heel. WWE never turned Cena heel when his “Super Cena” persona, which had squash match victories against younger talent, turned him into a pseudo-bad-guy for fans who wanted to see another wrestler get a shot at the top of the mountain. Sure, he’s broken the fourth wall joking about turning heel, but for decades, wrestling’s Superman never wavered.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bray Wyatt tells the story of how John Cena helped create The Fiend | WWE ON FOX" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ljMgmMvkKZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The closest thing the WWE universe got to seeing a Cena heel turn was when the <a href="https://kotaku.com/wwe-bray-wyatt-died-the-fiend-wyatt-family-cause-death-1850774254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">late-Bray Wyatt</a> had a cinematic match with him, where he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFnX1xj-sss&amp;pp=ygUUY2VuYSBicmF5IHd5YXR0IHd3ZSA%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">psychologically broke down Cena’s facade in a nightmare sequence</a>, jabbing at his insecurities as the company’s main guy. With Cena announcing his <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/john-cena-announces-wwe-retirement-in-2025-wrestlemania-41-will-be-his-last-wrestlemania" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retirement tour from wrestling last year</a>, fans were resigned to the fact that the unwritten rule of wrestling—John Cena will never turn heel—would remain.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="John Cena Details Plans For His Heel Turn In 2012" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yabyTd2cTgQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Until, at the close of Elimination Chamber back in March, it finally happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FULL SEGMENT: John Cena SELLS OUT and ruthlessly assaults Cody Rhodes: Elimination Chamber 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mS8W6NY6QjQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Cena’s heel turn was a shocking moment in wrestling, and rife with diminishing returns. Despite big marquee matches against new company man Cody Rhodes, Cena running it back with longtime rivals Randy Orton and CM Punk, and an awkward little one-off with Cena super-fan R-Truth, heel Cena was abysmal. His matches, save for his match against CM Punk, ended in uninspired, cheating finishes without much wrestling work to compensate for their deflating endings. Adding to the stench of failure: <a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2025/6/27/24457179/cm-punk-saudi-arabia-apology-miz-tweet-blood-money-wwe-night-of-champions-cena" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cena vs CM Punk happened in Saudi Arabia</a>.</p><p>Cena’s gift of gab couldn’t save him from turning the ship around. Rather than give an inspired reason for turning evil, Cena did the thing most “just put the fries in the bag, bro” heels do: blame the fans.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FULL SEGMENT: John Cena TRASHES the WWE Universe until Cody Rhodes fires back: Raw, March 17, 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExQYm6gintE?start=1004&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>His promos became repetitive, vapid, and whiny. They lacked the heat, positive or negative, to make him feel like a big deal. They ended up more like an awkward segment that fans were forced to watch out of nostalgia, or on the off-chance he’d somehow manage to surprise them. Like rubbernecking at a 21-car pile-up, a happy ending never came.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a stunt with added pressure because it was marketed alongside Cena’s retirement from wrestling. This farewell tour was further soured by appearances by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, known for vanity projects and <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/dwayne-johnson-dc-exit-black-adam-superman-failed-plan-1235478867/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meddling in all things involving a creative, collaborative process</a>, and rapper <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25165999-rock-talks-travis-scotts-involvement-john-cenas-heel-turn-possible-wwe-match" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis Scott’s pivotal involvement in Cena’s monumental heel turn</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FULL SEGMENT: The real John Cena returned in face-off with Cody Rhodes: SmackDown, Aug. 1, 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1r2r37vaA0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>WWE wound up reversing course for SummerSlam. Suddenly Cena turned face two days before his SummerSlam rematch with the new-blood face of the company, Cody Rhodes. In an impassioned dual promo-off, Cena turned off his dour, milquetoast, “the fans are fickle and no one cared about me succeeding” charisma vacuum shtick he’d been perpetuating throughout his disastrous heel run and returned to his high-energy, crowd-gesticulating self, saying he’d give Cody “the real John Cena” in his rematch. And that he did. They had arguably Cena’s best modern-day bout since his face-off against AJ Styles, with all the pageantry and physically impressive and emotionally resonant ring work in a long while.&nbsp;</p><p>But of course, as extra baggage to WWE’s shitty booking with Cena’s farewell tour, SummerSlam couldn’t just end with Cena waving goodbye to fans after. Following Cena’s loss and the torch passing to Rhodes, WWE fans were greeted with a bizarre shock return by Brock Lesnar, a wrestler rumored to have been on <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/wrestling/wwe/daniel-cormier-claims-brock-lesnar-on-wwe-tko-banned-list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company’s banned list</a> after being listed in active litigation in disgraced former CEO <a href="https://kotaku.com/wwe-vince-mcmahon-stephanie-mcmahon-nick-khan-john-laur-1849079202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vince McMahon</a>’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6105612/2025/02/01/brock-lesnar-wwe-lawsuit-vince-mcmahon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sex trafficking lawsuit</a> by former employee Janel Grant.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wwe-appoints-vince-mcmahons-daughter-as-interim-ceo-amid-probe-11655467082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a>, the lawsuit accused McMahon of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/vince-mcmahon-accused-of-sex-trafficking-by-wwe-staffer-he-paid-to-keep-quiet-0b19b21c?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhFLTjUtLvg_2Y0CuoIDeTcx701_qzkT_b92lYWtJ1Bv9KAhn5vAArDkAghb0Q%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68901ff3&amp;gaa_sig=w_Wg8RAUGXE0P_TGdbpJ5ke6NgtfxaKU4XWctlfDlAQtEyOeY5Pa7cHwfwIRpU_ulsvZh4cELFi--c9KdXz76w%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sex trafficking and pressuring Grant to have sex with other men at WWE</a>. During this media shitstorm, McMahon bowed out of the company in 2022 after an investigation of an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wwe-appoints-vince-mcmahons-daughter-as-interim-ceo-amid-probe-11655467082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged affair and hush money payout with numerous WWE employees</a>, totalling at <a href="https://kotaku.com/vince-mcmahon-wwe-investigation-sex-affair-hush-money-1849157420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$12 million</a>. Bizarrely, he returned to the company to oversee WWE’s transition into a Saudi Arabia-owned sports entertainment company, <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/wwe-ufc-deal-closes-tko-group-1235719908/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TKO</a>, alongside UFC, and subsequently <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/vince-mcmahon-wwe-board-members-return-1235480703/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired some WWE board members</a>. Vince was then ousted (kind of) from the company once more, selling some of his shares in TKO.&nbsp;</p><p>All this added a special stink to the entire affair: Cena’s farewell tour, his heel turn, his sudden face turn all paled in comparison to bringing a man implicated in an active sex trafficking trial back into the fold of the company.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="'Thank You For This Honor': Wrestler Triple H Praises Trump After Being Named To Council On Sports" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D75Mftn9izQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In a SummerSlam post-show segment, Levesque praised himself and the impressive work he and his writers do. He described how they juggle the ongoing WWE storylines and explained how their latest twist in the never-ending wrestling saga, and Cena's final act, came about. He characterized the decision as something Cena wanted to do before retiring. Instead of taking all the credit, Levesque said Lesnar’s return was fulfilling Cena’s wishlist of opponents to face before leaving, stating, “It’s him writing the last chapter in his book.”&nbsp;</p><p>“My reaction was exactly what I thought it was going to be; if there had been a roof on this place, it wouldn’t be there anymore. The dynamic in the room changes when The Beast is here. Seeing Brock Lesnar come back…anything you thought was happening sort of all goes out the window because the factor of Brock now just changes that dynamic so incredibly,” Levesque said while interrupted by fans chanting “We want Brock.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Incredible to have him back,” Levesque said.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="SummerSlam Sunday Post-Show: August 3, 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NlSGvD1h_CM?start=3571&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That Levesque and Cena had such a tone-deaf attitude isn’t surprising, given how willfully ignorant they’ve been about the elephant in the room—McMahon’s fall from grace and WWE’s cozying up to the president (and <a href="https://www.wwe.com/superstars/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE Hall of Famer</a>) Trump. Recently, <a href="https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/john-cena-i-love-vince-i-m-not-downplaying-allegations-any-kind-when-i-love-somebody-i-love-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cena reiterated his unwavering love for McMahon</a> despite his alleged crimes. Similarly, <a href="https://wrestletalk.com/news/triple-h-wwe-vince-mcmahon-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Levesque has dodged questions about McMahon</a>—leaving <a href="https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/cody-rhodes-comments-vince-mcmahon-netflix-documentary-and-janel-grant-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rhodes to vaguely fill in</a>. What Levesque (and WWE by extension) hasn’t been shy about is their support for Trump, calling him “<a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2025/8/2/24479499/triple-h-says-vince-mcmahon-sex-abuse-allegations-separate-wwe-creative-calls-donald-trump-genius" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most intuitive people</a>” he’s ever met. Additionally, in a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/roman-reignss-quest-to-be-wwes-next-great-crossover-star" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a> interview, Roman Reigns, cousin of The Rock and another key wrestler in the company, expressed his support for Trump despite being a registered Democrat.</p><p>“I support our president. Trump is one of those guys where he’s got a vast history and a huge background,” Reigns told Vanity Fair (whatever that means). “He’s been in entertainment. He’s been in big business, politics. At this point, I’m supporting a bright future for our country. Positive and competent leadership. For us to be what we’re supposed to be—to be a world leader and carry that respect and do what a world power like us should be doing."</p><p>WWE has also noticeably stopped celebrating holidays like <a href="https://whatculture.com/wwe/wwe-just-ignored-black-history-month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black History Month</a> and Pride Month, <a href="https://www.f4wonline.com/profiles/wwe-releases-2025-superstars-fired/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">while</a> laying off many wrestlers, including <a href="https://www.pride.com/wwe-sonya-devilles-contract-not-renewed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many of its openly queer talent.</a> Meanwhile, their programming has increasingly aligned with UFC and resembles a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/gallery/president-trump-attends-ufc-316/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glorified Republican National Convention</a> by adopting MAGA themes. For example, a white wrestler named Chad Gable adopts a luchador gimmick called “<a href="https://www.wwe.com/superstars/el-grande-americano" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grande Americano</a>”—a nod to <a href="https://www.bodyslam.net/2022/12/11/hulk-hogan-discusses-his-mr-america-gimmick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogan’s disguised “Mr. America” gimmick</a>. One of the most baffling aspects of this gimmick is the use of <a href="https://cultaholic.com/posts/wwe-criticised-for-allegedly-using-ai-to-create-el-grande-americano-raw-video-package" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI in his entrance video</a> ($8 billion company, by the way) and his claim to hail from “<a href="https://wrestletalk.com/news/wwe-el-grande-americano-character-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Gulf of America</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, things are worse than they’ve ever been on the WWE side of the squared circle. And the latest development in Cena’s retirement tour booking is, unfortunately, yet another poor mark on an already tumultuous journey of trying to send off the company’s it-guy.</p><p>Although heel Cena vowed that he’d “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOeOYrhZkDU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruin professional wrestling</a>,” it never actually happened in a conscious, kayfabe way. Regardless, WWE has undoubtedly tarnished this man’s legacy by making his farewell tour one of the worst series of booking spectacles in wrestling, and he deserves better.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-ziff-davis"><h3>IGN Lays Off 8 Staff, 12% Of Union</h3></a><p>The layoffs follow wider cuts at Ziff Davis, buyouts, and layoffs and departures at acquired sites</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve"><h3>Gabe Newell Bought A Yacht Company</h3></a><p>Valve's head honcho is now in the big boat business</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-chris-plante-sandwich-post-games"><h3>You Have To Hear Chris Plante’s Sandwich Story</h3></a><p>"It’s somehow getting on us, but we’re so happy that we’re not gonna die"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-covid-lockdown-hideo-kojima"><h3>Death Stranding 2 Is A Joyful, Absurd Response To COVID</h3></a><p>Goofy, lighthearted, constantly mugging: Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an exercise in spectacle, a rumination on lockdown, and one of the most human games Kojima has made in years</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/harry-potter-jk-rowling-cge-codenames-board-game"><h3>Board Game Company Fucks Around (Announcing A New Harry Potter Game), Finds Out (When Fans Revolt And Media Announce Boycotts)</h3></a><p>'It’s a product to sell to people who prioritise their nostalgia for children’s fantasy over the culture their trans friends and family live in'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/john-cena-heel-turn-summerslam-wwe-wrestling]]></content:encoded>

The sea-loving founder of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/valves-reported-profit-per-head-from-steam-commissions-is-out-there-and-at-usd3-5-million-per-employee-it-makes-apple-and-facebook-look-like-a-lemonade-stand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most insanely profitable companies ever</a> recently described himself as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/gabe-newells-daily-routine-is-get-up-work-go-scuba-diving-says-hes-been-retired-for-a-long-time-but-works-7-days-a-week-the-things-i-get-to-do-every-day-are-super-awesome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">effectively retired</a> despite still working all the time and noted that scuba diving is part of his daily routine. He also owns <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-luxury-yachts.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an armada of yachts</a> worth roughly $1 billion. And so, to put as fine a point on it as humanly possible, he recently bought a yacht company.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/boat-pro/news/oceanco-yacht-builder-sold-to-gabe-newell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boat International</a>, a publication whose name I cannot help but laugh at, reports that Newell purchased <a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/new-chapter-gabe-newell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oceano</a>, one of the world’s leading builders of custom superyachts. In an accompanying press release, Oceano assured its ultra-wealthy clientele that despite a new captain taking the wheel, it’s going to keep building incredibly large boats.</p><p>“Gabe Newell is not entering this world as a financier or a strategist, but as a hands-on visionary who respects the sea, the craft, and above all, the people who make it possible,” Oceano <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/a-new-chapter-for-oceanco-new-shareholder-gabe-newell-302517592.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>. “He wants Oceanco to continue on what it already does best: placing people first. This is not about buying a yacht company. It's about plugging into a team and exploring what kind of future they can create when nothing holds them back.”</p><p>This is important, because rich people fucking love big boats. As the rich have gotten richer over the course of the past few decades, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/09/superyachts-and-bragging-rights-why-the-super-rich-love-their-floating-homes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yacht collecting has become a pastime</a> for those who believe themselves both inheritors of the Earth and also entirely bereft of responsibility to its environment or people. In part, it’s a simple matter of social status: What better way to flaunt your wealth to both your peers and the local peasants than a towering sea city from which you can descend at will, like God delivering an edict? What could feel better, if you’re a wealth-drunk sociopath whose brain is shrinking by the day, than hearing that your friend built an 80-meter yacht and replying “Well fuck you, mine is gonna be 85 meters”?&nbsp;</p><p>But of course, rich people wouldn’t be <em>spending </em>sums from their ill-gotten dragon hoards unless there was some kind of society-immiserating loophole for them to exploit. As <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-rich-people-buy-yachts-jets-taking-loans-against-them-2022-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider explains</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Borrowing against yachts or jets at the point of purchase — or shortly after — means customers can put up little to no cash to close the deals. Depending on the desirability of the asset, banks extend loans from half to nearly 100% of its value. Borrowers can either draw on another line of credit, pledge more collateral, or use cash to cover the rest of the purchase. For rich individuals whose assets are tied up in stock, real estate, and other assets subject to capital gains taxes, the move is a no-brainer. In California, for instance,&nbsp;capital gains taxes can total nearly 40%, whereas interest rates are near historic lows.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>In other words, rich people aren’t spending much on these <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/11/megayachts-environment-carbon-emissions-ban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planet-sickening</a> bathtub toys, but money is changing hands nonetheless. The big boat business is booming, and Gabe Newell – a big boat connoisseur – has decided to gamble some of his untold billions on what is, in all likelihood, a pretty safe bet.&nbsp;</p><p>But hey, at least good guy Gabe is chill about AI, right? <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/gabe-newell-says-young-people-need-to-use-ai-tools-to-get-off-to-the-races-rather-than-reading-articles-on-variety-to-try-to-understand-what-its-impact-is-going-to-be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ah, well.
