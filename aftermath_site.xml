      <p><a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-relaunch-announcement/" rel="noreferrer">We love our new website, and the platform it's hosted on</a>, but as anyone who has moved house will know, no move goes without a hitch. And one of the things we know has annoyed some long-time readers about our new account system is the way that it doesn't have a password option, and only lets you sign in via email.</p><p>Our Ghost buddies at 404 Media <a href="https://www.404media.co/we-dont-want-your-password-3/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">have written at length about the positives of this approach</a>--mostly that we're never storing a password, which is a security risk--but that doesn't mean it still can't frustrate people who are in one browser tab or app to read the site, and then have to move to a different one to rummage through their inbox just to sign in and then come back again.</p><p>To that end, we can announce today that while we're still using the email system (we have to, it's the only way Ghost works!), our logins will now send 'Inbox Links', which means signing in will show you a popup that, when clicked, will automatically take you to the email that's got your login button in it.</p><p>Here's an example in action:</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://storage.ghost.io/c/30/f5/30f5b1bb-84ee-4c26-b446-fb9a5e512994/content/media/2026/02/inbox_links_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">
