            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Layoffs have started (again) at Microsoft, with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-laying-off-about-9000-employees-in-latest-round-of-cuts.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC </a>reporting that the company will lay off around 9000 people. Many of those cuts are expected to hit Xbox, as first reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a> reported this morning that <em>Candy Crush</em> maker King, based in Barcelona, is losing 10% of its staff, or around 200 people. Bloomberg also reported cuts to other European ZeniMax offices. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a> reports that Bethesda, including its London office, will be affected. US cuts are expected; a memo to gaming staff from Phil Spencer published by IGN says that “the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by [Microsoft] team leaders in the coming days.”</p><p>As information about those affected spreads across the company, several in-development projects have reportedly been cancelled, including Rare's <em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everwild</a></em> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyifsdrz22o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an MMORPG</a> from ZeniMax Online Studios.</p><p>Spencer writes in his memo, “To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.”</p><p>Spencer goes on, in classic tone-deaf executive style, to praise Xbox for having “more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger.” He writes</p><blockquote><p>We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>You’d be forgiven for being confused that Microsoft sees the need for <em>more</em> layoffs, given the company’s decision to lay off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659401/microsoft-layoffs-three-percent-workforce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 6000 people in May</a>. And you might wonder how the company could see the need for more gaming-specific layoffs, given the multiple rounds of layoffs Xbox has seen over the last few years. In <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-1900-people-at-activision-blizzard-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 2024</a>, Xbox cut around 2000 people primarily at <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision Blizzard</a>, following the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of the company in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2023</a>. In <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May</a> of that year, Microsoft closed four Bethesda studios in Arkane Austin, Alpha Dog Studios, Tango Gameworks, and Roundhouse Games. The company laid off an additional 650 people in <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft has seen an explosion of unions at the company in the wake of all this. <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QA workers at Zenimax reached a contract agreement in May</a> after nearly two years of bargaining. Workers at Bethesda unionized in<a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-union-unionize-fallout-elder-scrolls-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> July 2024</a>, quickly followed by <a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workers at <em>World of Warcraft</em></a>, and&nbsp; <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-online-studios-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zenimax Online Studios</a> unionized in December of that year. These unions have been able to form due to a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labor neutrality agreement</a> Microsoft signed with the Communications Workers of America in 2022, though that hasn’t stopped the company from <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dragging its heels</a> at the bargaining table. Still, the unions are one way Microsoft employees are fighting back against the company’s frequent, brutal cuts.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a breaking story and will be updated.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-shower-handles"><h3>An In-Depth Examination Of Death Stranding 2’s Shower Handles</h3></a><p>Death Stranding 1 &amp; 2 both feature beautiful mechanical design.
