            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Skate</em> was a video game first released back in 2007 that wasn't particularly interested in the waning days of "skate culture", in so much as it had once existed through the lens of the Vans Warped Tour, Jackass and <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em>. It was just a game about you, a skateboard and a public space.</p><p>Which meant it never achieved the same cultural (or commercial) success of the aforementioned Tony Hawk series, but it never wanted to. If Activision's games were about licensed music and weird costumes and fanciful stages, playing like a combo-obsessed fighting game, <em>Skate</em> was the opposite. It was all about the <em>skating</em>; it gave players a control scheme that felt like a simulation, was immensely satisfying to master and was rewarded with cult status as a result.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="skate.

It didn't need any more sequels, or remasters, or remakes, because despite its age it was still perfect, a video game truly representative of its time and place. But the brand carries weight, even after all these years, and publisher Electronic Arts exists these days solely to extract value from the things it owns. So in 2025 we have an all-new <em>Skate </em>game to play, and let me tell you, it fucking <em>sucks</em>.</p><p>The game is a marketplace shakedown in search of an audience. It's the Hello Fellow Kids meme stretched over 8.18GB of hard drive space. Its writing sounds like something penned by a marketing intern after four cans of Monster, its premise--that an AI is following you around telling you when you've unlocked a new tanktop in the skate store--closer to <a href="https://aftermath.site/meta-display-ai-rayban-glasses-ai-fail-demo-lmao-look-at-this-huge-dipshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something Mark Zuckerberg would demo on a stage</a> than anything you'd associate with skateboarding.</p><p>Like just tonally, in terms of letting this run in front of you, it's physically painful to sit through, in a way I haven't experienced since <a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k23-2k-review-kotaku-mycareer-impressions-myteam-1849528793" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the last time I subjected myself to an <em>NBA 2K</em> career mode</a>. Everyone you meet in this game feels like a theater kid improvising as a serial Linkedin poster. The stages have the sanitised energy of an Olympics breakdancing venue based on a <em>Fortnite </em>map.</p><p>I hate everything about it! This game is deeply unpleasant to simply be around, and so the stuff it does do well--it's got blooper potential, the overall controls are similar to the originals and there are some interesting open-world stages where you can pull off some incredible stunts--don't matter. I will not talk about it here and will never explore any of that stuff because I would rather lick the paint off my door than see another lootbox screen or hear a robot tell me to collect my DaKs prize package. </p><figure><figcaption>If you're asking yourself why EA bothered bringing Skate back as a free-to-play game, this is why</figcaption></figure><p>You do not need to play this, you do not need to subject yourself to this, you're better than this! If you need to skate around doing tricks there are plenty of <em>Skate</em>-inspired clones, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-au/games/store/skate-2007/C3QWNCV55VLL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the original is available for Xbox</a> or, if you're on PC, you know, you could just <em>find a way</em> to play it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-charlie-kirk-recreations"><h3>Why Major Events Like Charlie Kirk’s Death End Up On Roblox</h3></a><p>'It’s impossible to know who’s doing it for the lulls and the clicks and who’s doing it because they’re radicalizing'</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ea-skate-review-impressions]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gaming, at its core, is just a series of puzzles: some <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-save-room-attache-case-puzzle-inventory-1848875111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meditative</a>, some <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/533198/split-fiction-review-pc-ps5-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maddening</a>. <a href="https://neal.fun/not-a-robot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>I'm Not A Robot</em> </a>splits the difference, turning the mundane act of proving your humanity into a spiraling test of pattern recognition that quickly escalates from a simple checkbox task into esoteric brain teasers that feel less like website security and more like psychological warfare.&nbsp;</p><p>Created by <a href="https://neal.fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neal Agarwal</a>, <em>I'm Not A Robot</em> is a free-to-play riff on the CAPTCHA format, where players are tasked with completing randomized puzzles that include typing distorted text, clicking on traffic signs, spotting Waldo in a mural, or playing Simon Says on a soundboard. Streamers, ever the masochists, have turned it into a speedrunning meta to flex their cognitive prowess in front of their thousands of viewers.&nbsp;</p><p>But I am no streamer. I’m a casual gamer with bills to pay and sleep to chase. So I played <em>I'm Not A Robot</em> the way any normal person should: not testing speed, but my mental fortitude. I kept playing, advancing past each level until I either “won” or gave up. Spoiler alert: the latter came first. Yet, somewhere during the funky image text and pattern test to vibe check my humanity, I learned a few things about myself, namely, that I am a fallible human being and not nearly as good at logic puzzles as I’d hoped.&nbsp;</p><p>Glass half full, here’s a quick rundown of some positive things I learned about myself before we get to my unmaking.&nbsp;</p><p>Numerous puzzles where I was tasked with driving a car into a parking space had me discover that the tips I remembered from a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@autoclara/video/7217442900559269163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok video</a> about parking translated perfectly to pulling off a parallel parking job, even through the directional keys on my keyboard. Having a touchable laptop screen also came in handy with drawing a perfect circle with my fingers on the screen. My eyes aren’t a slouch either, leading me to breeze past a puzzle where I was asked to single out which green square wasn’t like the others. Another challenge that surprised me was a test to accumulate and dump enough stocks, which I guess I can attribute to half paying attention to the brain-numbing parts of HBO’s <em>Industry</em>. Other challenges that stumped me in the early going simply boiled down to me reading instructions too quickly and missing the “not” part of its tasks or the “only” part of a specific row—a human error, making me not a robot.&nbsp;</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>But the cracks in my gamer facade began to show. The first logic test that stumped me was a sliding tile puzzle asking me to assemble a stop sign; these always stumped me for a bit before fiddling with them and coming up with my own logic. What I wasn’t expecting was a CAPTCHA knowledge check for <em>Minecraft</em>, asking me to make a diamond pickaxe. Reader, I’ve only played the game once in high school, so I was out of my depth. This took a while, something I’m not proud to admit as a games journalist. In so doing, I discovered that left and right clicks do different things in <em>Minecraft</em> with relation to sorting and splitting up inventory, which helped me stumble upon what I’m sure every five-year-old with an iPad already knew about how many sticks and diamonds a diamond pickaxe makes. Et viola, I forged myself a diamond pickaxe. <em>I'm Not A Robot </em>proved to be a slow boiling frog challenge at this point, but one where the count supporting that I am not a robot was still going strong.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I'm in danger. <span></span><span>Neal.Fun</span></figcaption></figure><p>But by level 34, I hit a wall—a math puzzle. In it, <em>I'm Not A Robot </em>tasked me with selecting all nine squares of algebra-ass equations <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9NkW8MoJ6g&amp;pp=ygUeaSdtIGJhY2sgaW4gdGhlIGJ1aWxkaW5nIGFnYWlu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I haven’t seen since high school</a> and ordering them from least to greatest. Both the angel and devil on my shoulder noped out on this one. So, out of desperation, I pulled out a tactic any cornered gamer would desperately deploy in this situation: I started guessing. Clicking at random like a scrub who penciled in C on an SAT because “I haven’t selected that in a while,” I prayed that brute forcing my way through the math puzzle would carry me through. Obviously, the infinity symbol would be the last choice (I’m not that dense). Still failed. And with that, my journey to prove I wasn’t a robot came to an end.&nbsp;</p><h2>However</h2><p>I’d reckon my inability to solve such a fucked up math question while blinking away sleep proved exactly what this whole sisyphean charade sought to answer: I am still human. I am not a robot. So jokes on you, Agarwal. You didn’t best me, my friend. I won by the human act of quitting while I was ahead and throwing the double bird to a gaggle of math equations.&nbsp;</p><p><em>I'm Not A Robot</em> didn’t just test my logic skills, it also challenged my resolve. Along the way, the game presented some clever and inventive puzzles to break up its stumpers. My favorite were out-of-the-box CAPTCHA puzzles (one literally) where I herded ducks back into their square grid or played whack-a-mole. While I didn’t beat it, I was reminded that being human can mean failing creatively, overlooking a crucial detail in instructions, and telling math problems to fuck off forever. The last of which might be the most CAPTCHA-proof trait of all.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Correction 9/22/25, 4:30pm:&nbsp;</strong>A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the title of the game.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-skate-review-impressions"><h3>No Thank You</h3></a><p>'I would rather lick the paint off my door than see another lootbox screen'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-charlie-kirk-recreations"><h3>Why Major Events Like Charlie Kirk’s Death End Up On Roblox</h3></a><p>'It’s impossible to know who’s doing it for the lulls and the clicks and who’s doing it because they’re radicalizing'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/i-am-not-a-robot-captcha-puzzle-game]]></content:encoded>
