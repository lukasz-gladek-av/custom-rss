            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A big topic of discussion today has<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=175622801&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=31imqw&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> been the news from Stephen Totilo's Game File that Ubisoft cancelled an <em>Assassin's Creed</em> project</a> that was supposed to have been set during<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the Reconstruction Era following the Civil War</a>.</p><p>Reaction has been mixed! Many are mourning the loss of a game that would have been very <em>of this moment</em>, and given millions of people the chance to sneak around and then brutally murder some racists. And I can see this timeline, shimmering mirage-like in the distance, where the company behind a series centred on an Arab character in a post-9/11 world and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_Freedom_Cry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a whole expansion based on a freed slave</a> would have done that time and those events some small amount of justice.</p><p>I am not one of those people, because it is 2025, and this is a different time and a very different company. Totilo's <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=175622801&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=31imqw&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report mentions two key reasons for the project's cancellation</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Three sources told Game File that word filtered through the company last July that management in Paris had stopped development of the game for two reasons: 1) online backlash that spring to the reveal of Yasuke, a historically-inspired Black samurai, as a protagonist in the company’s then-upcoming Assassin’s Creed Shadows; and 2) concern that the political climate in the United States was becoming increasingly tense.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The top brass at the Ubisoft of 2025 are bumbling cowards, who in their inability to grasp the moment,<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> face the future</a> or<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-controversies-are-for-babies-and-racists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> stand behind the creatives responsible for actually making their games</a> have enabled<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-yasuke-apology-sucks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the very worst people</a> on the internet, and are now having to<a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-ceo-charlie-guillemot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sell off the family jewels to keep the lights on</a>.</p><p>While we'd all love to be playing more video games where you punch and murder monsters--<a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Indiana Jones</em> was a great reminder of the market's needs</a>--would you trust <em>these </em>people to release that kind of blockbuster video game in <em>this </em>political climate? I sure as shit wouldn't! After everything that happened trying to sell a game where you<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-racism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> play as a woman and a black guy in Japan</a>, can you imagine how Ubisoft leadership would handle the management and messaging for a game where a black Assassin roamed the South shanking Klansmen?</p><p>As cool as the pitch is, I'm not surprised at news like this. I'm surprised it got far enough off the drawing board at today's Ubisoft to be able to be cancelled in the first place.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange"><h3>Baby Steps’ Manbreaker Did Not Break Me</h3></a><p>Baby Steps' Manbreaker is an optional, brutal challenge that is as much a test of your humility as it is your skill.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-patch-notes-impaled-swordfishes"><h3>Good Patch Notes</h3></a><p>"The trash chute now ignores impaled swordfishes"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-kenji-iwaisawa-director-interview"><h3>100 Meters Director On Capturing The Art And Agony Of Track And Field Through Rotoscope Animation</h3></a><p>Kenji Iwaisawa hopes his film adaptation will be “the first of its kind” to bring the quiet intensity of track to the big screen</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending"><h3>Hades 2’s Story Doesn’t Change The Status Quo</h3></a><p>Melinoë's journey is more about acceptance than change</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-mori-calliope-vtuber-opening-anime-crunchyroll"><h3>VTuber Mori Calliope’s Anime Dream Came Full Circle In Creating Gachiakuta’s New Theme Song</h3></a><p>Mori Colliope's longtime love for Gachiakuta’s manga and her close bond with creator Kei Urana helped shape its explosive new song “Let’s Just Crash”</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-reconstruction-era-klansmen-cancelled-kkk]]></content:encoded>
