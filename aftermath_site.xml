      <p>Multiple developers from Wildlight, maker of the online shooter <em>Highguard</em>, have posted on Linkedin today that they've been laid off, just two weeks after the game's release.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427501095955914752/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Sound designers</u></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427496511334277121/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>gameplay engineers</u></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427497173774225409/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>tech artists</u></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427500304054693890/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>UI designers</u></a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427480816940892161/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>level designers</u></a> are among those affected. While some have only shared their own personal status, two have said in posts that the layoffs impact "most of the team".</p><p>A statement issued by Wildlight says that "a number of our team members" have been let go, while a "core group of developers" works to keep "innovating on and supporting the game". </p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.</p><p>We're proud of the team, talent, and the product we've created together. We're also grateful…</p></div>— Wildlight Entertainment (@WildlightEnt) <a href="https://twitter.com/WildlightEnt/status/2021745168387596450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">February 12, 2026</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>If indeed "most" of the team has been laid off, so soon after release, that doesn't bode well for the future of a game that, despite some weird and very 2026 challenges, by all accounts seemed totally fine.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/highguard-release-steam-pc-concord-youtube-shadow-drop/"><div><p>Highguard Is Yet Another Symptom – And Victim – Of A Rapidly Decaying Internet</p><p>In an online ecosystem ruled by cynics, clip farmers, and ragebaiters (and built by those who seek to profit off them), Highguard never stood a chance of having a normal launch</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure><p>This news hits the same week as<a href="https://aftermath.site/2xko-riot-release-console-layoffs/"> <u>news another game (Riot's <em>2XKO</em>) laid off developers just days after release</u></a>, seemingly because of unrealistic expectations from studio leadership. The situation with Wildlight is different, though; the company had self-published <em>Highguard</em>, meaning whatever led to these layoffs, it wasn’t some publisher or giant company demanding numbers go up.&nbsp;</p><p>A free-to-play PVP shooter, <em>Highguard </em>had a strong launch--around <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/?ref=aftermath.site#max"><u>100,000</u></a> people were playing on Steam on its first day--but couldn't sustain those numbers, in ways that...look, you know what, why am I even talking about those figures, writers always do that when talking about layoffs like this, is there even much point trying to dissect the numbers of a game that took <em>years </em>to make, but where ‘most’ of the team gets laid off just two weeks after it came out? Loads of people are now reportedly out of a job, and whatever reasons people can offer or accept for it, none of it seems sane or sustainable.&nbsp;</p>
