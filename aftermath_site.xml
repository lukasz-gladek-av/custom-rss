</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>As someone who has spent an embarrassing amount of money on clothes over the years, and as a result delved fairly deeply into some weird online communities surrounding them, I would like to use this website to mount a spirited defence of a fashion style I have long been very into, but which has lately fallen on some hard times. It's known as techwear.</p><p>Thanks to dropshippers, their social media ads, algorithms and just the outright misappropriation of the label over the years, many of you who have heard the word "techwear" as a passer-by probably associate it with a type of clothing that can best be described as landing somewhere on the design spectrum between Mall Ninja and a Tetsuya Nomura Character. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/8nmha7/is_anyone_else_into_techwear_fashion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Something like this Reddit thread</a>:</p><figure><figcaption>This ain't it</figcaption></figure><p>Think cargo pants with 17 pointless straps hanging off them, sci-fi face masks that look physically impossible to wear, jackets covered in big kanji characters. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=0b79686cda84ea15&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU1030AU1030&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIKT_mcy481Uule0HTkclsK_8dBHQg:1737093511795&amp;q=techwear&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J03RPjGV0MznOJ6Likin94pT_oR1DTSof42bOBxoTNxGMwEeUq17XDDUMegSIEO3KFroRcVZLfatAKBzHB2GC9DT8lE2xPXAjr-j38xxSTkMPHMlB-oQCnrLCflDrY1so-WFd_yuZCQztuM9KT0nCzigcsiQkoxVYxZIkz1iLkRqpOfohQ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi699jNifyKAxW4zjgGHac9JpoQtKgLegQIEhAB&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1271&amp;dpr=1.5#vhid=iy68AYf5F_ymKM&amp;vssid=mosaic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google "techwear" right now and the image results will give you page after page</a> of bad <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> cosplay, loads of kids dressing like they've been conscripted into a war against the machines.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="HOW TO DRESS #TECHWEAR" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g58kCABKy_I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But that's not techwear. Or at least it's not techwear as it was originally pioneered and intended. Techwear is, at its core, something much simpler. The most common definition--it doesn't have a wikipedia <em>or </em>dictionary entry!--tends to be something like<a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Techwear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> this Aesthetics Wiki post</a>, which says the trend "mostly grew out of a shared obsession with the craft and innovation of functional, durable, all-weather clothing".</p><p>Think clothes that look good, but are also packed with technology and innovative design expressed everywhere from materials to fabrics, which are often waterproof and/or windproof. Techwear normally also has design features like multiple pockets and cuts (like gusseted crotches) that allow for comfortable movement. In practical terms, techwear is supposed to be clothing that you can wear <em>anywhere</em>, in almost any conditions, from a rainy walk in the countryside to a train platform in the middle of winter to an office to a party.</p><p>Sounds great, right, or at least useful? That's how I got into it! Well, that's not strictly true: I first got into techwear when, having been a streetwear guy for most of my adult life,<a href="https://www.designboom.com/design/the-2014-nikelab-acg-collection-17-12-2014/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in 2014 I saw the announcement for a new line called Nikelab ACG</a>, which blended Nikelab (Nike's premium fashion clothing) with ACG (the company's traditional label for rugged, outdoor gear). I was instantly in love with the whole thing. The futuristic look, the practicality, all of it.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Nikelab ACG's 2014 debut brought techwear into the mainstream, and debuted pieces like this 2-in-1 system jacket that is still sought after today</span><span></span><span>Nike</span></figcaption></figure><p>I quickly learned why it was so good: it was a collaboration between Nike and Errolson Hugh, the co-founder of techwear pioneers Acronym, a label as famous for its cutting-edge fashion (and iconic pieces like<a href="https://www.grailed.com/drycleanonly/acronym-j1a-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the J1A jacket</a> and<a href="https://acrnm.com/P10-E_FW2122#a-image_12622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> P-10 pants</a>) as its exorbitant prices, which routinely run over $1000 for a single item. This Nikelab ACG stuff promised to be (relatively) more affordable, and over the next decade--with Acronym and other pricier techwear stuff out of reach--I collected as many pieces from the collection as I could. And while the aesthetics may have got me in the door, the practicality of having jackets with such useful pockets and trousers that had the pragmatism of cargo pants without the stigma kept me around.</p><p>Acronym isn't alone in the techwear space in charging lofty prices; other notable labels like<a href="https://enfinleve.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Enfin Leve</a>,<a href="https://arcteryx.com.au/collections/veilance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Veilance</a> and<a href="https://www.adidas.com.au/y_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Y3</a> are similarly priced, making them inaccessible to most people. That's why I went after the Nikelab ACG stuff so hard, and is also why I've spent much of the last decade lurking around online communities finding cheaper (and sometimes <em>much </em>cheaper) alternatives.</p><figure><figcaption><span>I picked up this ridiculously versatile Nikelab ACG trench around six years ago now, and I think it looks as good today as it did back in 2018</span><span></span><span>Nike</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of which there are loads. The scene might be somewhat famous for being expensive--all that tech and workmanship and, let's be real, exclusivity comes at a price--but you don't need to spend $1200 on a pair of cargo pants to get in on the action. There's plenty of technical crossover with other brands that will let you make use of loads of features and look good at a fraction of the price. Uniqlo has a ton of stuff that is surprisingly technical, for instance--<a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/au/en/products/E464024-000?colorCode=COL09&amp;sizeCode=SMA002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Blocktech Parka is almost a techwear cliche</a>, as is anything with the company's AIRism tech, up to and including the essential oversized tee.</p><p>A particular lower-priced favourite of some of us at Aftermath is<a href="https://www.orbitgear.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Indonesian label Orbitgear</a>, who are making stuff by hand from their studio in Jakarta and offering loads of amazing gear at much more affordable prices. Both myself and Chris Person have Orbitgear bags, and I just bought a <em>very </em>nice pair of shorts for $100 where a similar pair made by Acronym (albeit with slightly nicer fabric, of course) would have run me well over $600.</p><p>Making techwear even more versatile (and sometimes more affordable) is the way you can break it down into subgenres, or examine associated trends that sit pretty close to it on the venn diagram of fashion.<a href="https://www.grailed.com/drycleanonly/what-is-gorpcore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Gorpcore, a relatively current streetwear trend of dressing like you're about to go climb a mountain even though you're at the mall</a>, cuts very close to techwear because it often shares many of the same priorities, like space-age fabrics and climate versatility. Flagship gorpcore brands like Nike ACG, Salomon and Arcteryx are popular in the techwear scene.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Veilance is one of the few brands in the space with specific women's collections</span><span></span><span>Veilance</span></figcaption></figure><p>See also 'Grayman", a techwear subgenre that is particularly focused on visual simplicity and formality. Recognising that general techwear stuff like Acronym and Enfin Leve can sometimes go a little too hard on pockets and the tactical look, Grayman emphasises a cleaner look. <a href="https://www.tchwr.com/2019/11/22/low-key-high-tech-perfecting-the-grayman-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can find some examples here</a>, and while labels like Veilance feature heavily, once again you can find a lot of much cheaper alternatives at Uniqlo (basically any office clothing with "stretch" in the name).</p><p>Even activewear can take part. Lululemon stock a ton of technical clothing, especially their menswear section, which features stuff like<a href="https://www.lululemon.com.au/en-au/c/men/bottoms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> stretch pants for the office</a> and business shirts that feel and move more like soccer jerseys. I've also become a big fan of Australian cycling apparel brand MAAP, not because I'm a serious cyclist,<a href="https://maap.cc/collections/off-bike-man" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> but because their off-bike stuff has a great technical slant</a>, with lots of nice cuts, materials and practical benefits.</p><p>Techwear's appeal and versatility even goes beyond the real world. Errolson Hugh designed Adam Jensen's jacket in <em>Deus Ex</em>, for example,<a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/death-stranding-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> while also doing so much work on Kojima Productions' <em>Death Stranding</em> that he makes an appearance in the game</a> (and is reprising all this for the upcoming sequel). Ukrainian techwear label Riot Division worked on jacket design for <em>Ghostwire Tokyo</em>, and if you're a fan of <em>Mirror's Edge</em> and its sequel they're leaning <em>very </em>hard on the style.</p><figure><blockquote><p>...when we did clothing for Deus Ex and Death Stranding, we actually ended up designing the clothes as if they were real. We used the exact same process as we would for something we would actually manufacture. It just translates super easily.</p><cite>Errolson Hugh, <a href="https://bdgastore.com/blogs/blogdega/in-conversation-with-errolson-hugh">Bodega</a></cite></blockquote></figure><p>I love these clothes. I love the knowledge that I can put something on in the morning and know I'll be able to wear it wherever I go that day and whatever the weather. I love the fact that so many of the most famous brands and their pieces are almost timeless, meaning I can buy something in 2015 and it still looks incredible in 2025 (which is especially useful when you spend $400 on pants, you want to get some use out of them!).</p><p>I think it sucks that the term “techwear” has gotten so lost in the wash; not only does most of the stuff being labelled or known colloquially as "techwear" these days actually<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/what-is-warcore-streetwear-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> belong to a style known as "warcore"</a>, but because most of it is fast fashion junk that has no technical benefit whatsoever, as it's missing everything from waterproofing to breathable fabrics. The whole point of the word is that it's supposed to be technical!</p><p>Things have gotten so bad that I'm almost embarrassed to say I'm into techwear when I'm among people who don't know what it actually is. An example: we had a Kotaku meeting a few years back where I said I liked it out loud, and people <em>laughed at me</em> because they were picturing me, a man in my 40s, wearing a pair of pants with straps hanging between the crotch and waving a lightsaber around. To be fair that <em>is</em> very funny, but also wholly inaccurate, hence this spirited defence!</p><p>I'm not saying you need to dress like this, or even try it out. I just wanted to use my website to set a little record straight, say that it's nice to own nice clothes that do lots of things at once, and that I should be able to talk about that without people thinking I'm an extra in<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Ends_with_You" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>The World Ends With You</em></a>.</p><p>Though if you <em>do </em>want to learn more about it, or even just see some cool examples of the style in action in the real world and not as a stereotype,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/neogrotesk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Sam Sundberg has a <em>great </em>Instagram account</a>, as does<a href="https://www.instagram.com/bluekros/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> bluekros</a>, and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC-X1H9W7II" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Antwon's YouTube channel is also invaluable</a>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Hideo Kojima modelling a very technical Arconym jacket released in 2024 as a collab with Death Stranding 2</span><span></span><span>Acronym</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-hamlet-review"><h3>Grand Theft Hamlet Is A Funny, Touching Take On Shakespeare</h3></a><p>‘We’re putting on a play inside a game, but the game is a kind of play, because we’re playing’</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/our-thoughts-and-theories-on-severances-second-season<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new season of <em>Severance</em> is finally upon us! Gita, Chris and Riley sat down to talk through the season premiere, which is enigmatic as ever.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Chris! Riley! Last week, after a three year wait, the second season of the Apple TV show <em>Severance </em>finally premiered. I had been trying to keep my expectations low given the long, long wait, but I'm pretty excited about how this episode turned out, and the twist and turns it sets up for the next season. Let's talk about it today!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Sure! I had a good time.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Same! I didn't realize quite how long it had been since Season 1 ended; it actually coincided with the end of my free Apple TV subscription, but I was like "Oh, I'll just keep it going for more <em>Severance</em>." Whoops!</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Hahaha—that's how they get you, huh?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> With this and <em>Squid Game</em> I had to look up what happened previously because it had been so long.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Yeah, with both I had to keep pausing to Google what was going on lol.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I didn't have that hard of a time but as I was watching the premiere, I did start to realize that there were a lot of events I had simply forgotten about. The season finale from three years ago ended on such an intense cliffhanger that I was chomping at the bit for resolution this whole time. But there's actually a lot about the Lumon corporation and the severed workers there that we don't know about yet, and that cliffhanger didn't get resolved at all.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah I just forgot big details of the show, that doesn’t take away from it but I forgot the specifics of what had happened and it’s compounded by the ambiguity of what they’re being told happened.</p><p>I think in the case of both this show and <em>Squid Game</em> there was an understandable desire to get it right but if you don’t have that already in the chamber the break is rough.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I appreciated the mystery that opens the season in light of all that-- it would have been an easy choice to give us (and the characters) answers and move on into "what now?" but instead we still have the "what happened?" to untangle.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Severance — Season 2 Official Trailer | Apple TV+" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_UXKlYvLGJY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Gita:</strong> In the world of Severance, some employees at the Lumon corporation undergo a surgery that bifurcates their memories so they basically don't remember what went on at work. This entire episode delved into the lives of the "innies," people who only exist on the company floor. It was honestly kind of disorienting, because we really have no idea what information to trust or not. The bosses hold all the cards.</p><p>It's basically like a science fiction version of Marx's theory of alienation.</p><p>In an effort to untangle the "what happened?" I have to ask. The innies have been told it's been five months since the previous season. Do you believe that? I definitely do not.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I don't think I do either.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Well what they’re being told is that they enacted meaningful change and they had a big parade for them and now everything is fixed because there are more snacks.</p><p>It’s done in a very fun way multiple times in the episode, but the entire time you’re supposed to doubt it.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah, for instance, if you look at the (very cool) claymation video they're shown about their actions after last season, they're told they have "new perks" as a result of their actions. One of them is a hall pass—but if there's a hall pass, then that means the bosses are taking more control over their movements in the building.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I love when they get to flex their production chops like that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> That video ruled to me, a guy watching the show, but also seemed so ridiculous— did Lumon think the innies would really be swayed by it?</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I think the new character, Ms. Huang, is the key to understanding that, Riley. Their new manager is a literal child.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Severance/Apple TV+</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think I know who she is supposed to be but it would be a spoiler if I’m right.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>What is the deal with her omg?!?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Big child.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I also think I know who she is..... let's talk theories in a minute.</p><p>What's so enjoyable about this show is that it gives you that <em>Lost</em>-juice. It is very easy to theorize about shit on this show because everything is really esoteric.</p><p>They have a good balance between revealing new information and having that information leading to new mysteries to uncover.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Haha, the creators have literally reassured fans that <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/severance-recap-season-2-episode-1-why-helly-lies-1236276867/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it will not go the way of Lost</a>.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I like that they initially try to get Mark into a new team before he freaks out. Bob Balaban was there! Love that guy.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> And Alia Shawkat!!!!! I was so happy to see her.</p><figure><figcaption>Severance/Apple TV+</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> The show is really good at utilizing character actors which is the way to my heart. Loved seeing Zach Cherry and John Turturro again</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> When I saw Zach Cherry I wanted to cry. I missed him. But seeing John Turturro.......... he's a real actor, man. I'm still so heartbroken about Burt.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I think there's still hope! You never know!</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Holding a candle for the elder yaoi…. Did you hear that Christopher Walken gets DVDs of the series mailed to him because he doesn't stream?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> King shit.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Given the nature of the show, it's really hard to talk about all its mysteries and unanswered questions without spoiling things. If you don't want to be spoiled on the specifics of the episode, please stop reading and don't @ us about it.</p><p><strong>SPOILERS</strong></p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Okay, I am pretty sure that macrodata refinement is about taming the four tempers of the mind to create perfect workers, and Mark's wife is their test subject.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Interesting.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>The very last shot of the episode is seen through Mark S.'s computer, showing Ms. Casey. All this time, they've been sorting numbers based on feelings. Last season, Ms. Casey was sent back to the "testing floor." That's all gotta be related somehow.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think Miss Huang is their kid.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah I think you're right too!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That would also explain her being big. Like she’s a refinement of that experiment.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Hhhm, I hadn't thought about that, I could see it.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That or none of this is strictly the real world. But a dream sequence feels a little cheap.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Part of me doesn't want some kind of answers or reveal; I think that messy space full of questions is the most compelling. It's like in <em>The Leftovers</em>—obviously you want to know why the Sudden Departure happened, but it's so much cooler to watch people live with it and never have that answered. I don't want some, like, final showdown with the Eagans or something where all our questions are answered.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>I too hope that we don't get too many answers—there's a jazz-like looseness with this show's connection to reality that I enjoy. Plus, I think bringing it too close to reality or truth would make the show's obvious references to the alienating aspects of labor less... good.</p><p>Like this season opens up with an acknowledgement that even critiques of capital reinforce capital, Mark Fisher style. But the closer this show gets to making its points more specifically the more uncomfortable I am with it literally being an Apple TV+ show, you know what I mean?</p><figure><figcaption>Severance/Apple TV+</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Yeah I had the same feeling. That’s always going to be the limit of a tv show and the show is internally acknowledging it about itself but about capitalism writ large. The company is able to use the narrative of their rebellion to strengthen itself and Apple is able to use the success of a prestige show about alienation to cement Apple TV+.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Seeing balloons with Mark S.'s face on it on the Apple homepage gave me the ick.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I don’t think it’s impossible to say something in that space but the closest you get is like <em>Sorry To Bother You</em>.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah, it's very hard! I think this show is threading the needle in a way that's different from how, say, <em>Andor</em>, did. It's more... lyrical. Its approach is more French New Wave. And the sheer joy of watching such incredible filmmaking just puts me in a mood to be moved, emotionally, to allow this show to change me.</p><p>The opening sequence where Mark is running through the hallways of the Lumon severed floor made me like, mad at how bad a lot of television looks these days. A lot of the time, they don't even move the damn camera!</p><p>Chris: I didn’t love the compositing in that but I loved them trying. It’s a really hard shot to get right.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> They overused the "whoosh" sound effect when the camera made those big swings. But it was a swing, a bold way to open the show.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah! It sets the tone very well.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Yeah, it's a really good-looking show, I'll give it that.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Before we finish up this conversation I wanted to talk about the other main appeal of this show: old man yaoi. Last season, Irv fell in love on the severed floor with another severed worker, Burt, played by Christopher Walken. We last left the character banging on Burt's door, calling out his name. When we see him again for the first time this season, he's banging on the elevator door crying out for Burt, still. Our boy Irv is not doing well!</p><figure><figcaption>Severance/Apple TV+</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I was really rooting for them! Now I'm torn between, I still want them to get together, but also if Burt is happy out in the real world, who is Irv (or us, the audience) to mess with that?</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Is there a way for their innies and their outies to get what they want?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Is Burt married to a woman or a man?</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> A man, IIRC.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Ah ok, I thought it was ambiguous and enjoyed the concept of your innie being gay but you being straight.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to meet his partner or maybe I don’t. Maybe I just gotta let it go.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Most of the innies have this competing tension between what they want and what their outies want. Helly R., for instance, is actually an executive at the Lumon Corporation. As Helly, she has a burgeoning romance with Mark S., but Mark's outtie is still devastated over the loss of his wife.</p><p>It feels like the innies and outies are distinct people from each other, but they're also the same person. So who wins, in that scenario? Who's desires take precedence?</p><figure><figcaption>Severance/Apple TV+</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I guess what happens if you merge those people?</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Helly lying to everyone—I assume!---is such a good twist. Like, did Lumon get to her? Is she worried the other innies will be mad when they find out who she really is?</p><p>Maybe that phrasing is wrong—who is she really haha?</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> My personal take is that it's Helena posing as Helly. She's a corporate spy trying to sow division!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Oh that’s nasty</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> It's what corporate would do, though!</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I also had this thought!</p><p>Like I said above, it's hard to know how capable corporate thinks the innies are.
