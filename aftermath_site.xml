            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ending<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few weeks back<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-valhalla-origins-odyssey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I wrote some very positive things about <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>, and so it should be of little surprise given the series’ contentious, recent past that I have since found that I am an idiot, and now have to write some less positive things as well.</p><p>Why am I an idiot? Because I should have seen this coming. Here’s a quote from <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-odyssey-really-blew-its-ending-1830170997" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article I wrote complaining about <em>AC Odyssey</em>’s ending all the way back in November 2018</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>As </em>Odyssey<em> dragged itself towards its final few story missions, though, I noticed the pacing was off. Having spent dozens of hours spinning its wheels, everything seems to ramp up out of nowhere, then end abruptly with much of the story and its mysteries—especially the fate of the Cult—left unresolved. I was very disappointed.</em></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Here’s me, again, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-is-too-damn-long-1846138833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talking about how <em>Valhalla</em>’s ending sucked in January 2021</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Ultimately, </em>Valhalla<em>’s length added a little despair to my final thoughts on the game. The bloat created grind, which diluted the whole experience, and often felt like it was keeping my attention solely through brute force and checklists. It left me parting with a game I LOVED on less than lovely terms, which was a damn shame.</em></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>And here’s me remembering all of that <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-valhalla-origins-odyssey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>earlier this month</em></a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Their problems aren't that they suck, but that they were just too big. Too long. </em>Odyssey<em> and </em>Valhalla<em> especially vastly overstayed their welcome with drawn-out (sometimes multiple) storylines and DLC, meaning a lot of people parted with those games on poor terms. Those negative views have perhaps coloured both game's legacy in ways unfair to their core experience.</em></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Despite that mountain of evidence I had naively thought, having as much fun as I’d been having with <em>Shadows </em>up to that point, that it surely wouldn’t repeat the same mistakes its predecessors had made. That Ubisoft, with nearly a decade of experience and feedback that its open-world games were too damn long, would have taken steps to do something, anything, to address that.</p><p>Nope! <em>Shadows </em>absolutely botches its landing, and just like its predecessors. It botches it so badly that it’s soured my feelings on the entire game.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s what happens as you approach the end of <em>Shadows</em>, which is much the same as happened in <em>Valhalla </em>and <em>Odyssey </em>before it: Over the course of <em>dozens </em>of hours of fantastic video game, a few different storylines begin to emerge. In <em>Shadows’ </em>case, there’s the main saga, which involves a shadowy cabal of mask-wearing villains and their evil deeds, but there are also branching, more intimate tales, telling the personal stories of our two heroes, Naoe and Yasuke.</p><p>You would think, given the way each supporting story elegantly branches off and is intertwined with the main one, that <em>Shadows</em> would also find a way to tie them all back together again at the end. They do not. What happens in <em>Shadows</em> is that you finish the main story with a limp cutscene, and are then returned to the game to tie up your loose ends. Which, with the main storyline now done, also lack any kind of real impact or satisfaction. Indeed all three storylines don’t just end poorly, they don’t feel like they end at <em>all</em>, the credits somehow managing to roll 2-3 missions before you’d think they would have and, thanks to the game’s incessant grind for levels and repetitive tasks, 10-20 hours later than they should have.</p><p>After 70-80 hours of gameplay, during which emotional stories are told and you’re drawn deep into your character’s journey, to have it all end so abruptly is a HUGE disappointment. I wanted to see these guys get revenge–indeed, how each of them deals with the concept is a <em>huge </em>part of the narrative and your choices–and while Yasuke gets a little, Naoe’s backstory has barely begun before it’s abruptly shuttered.</p><p>What’s maddening here is that this clearly isn’t a strictly narrative decision. The way each storyline pulls up short is a good reminder that this game isn’t done, and that, like <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla</em>, there is more to come <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/shadows/expansion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via at least one expansion</a>. Argh! You can't end the main game with teasers of what's to come, that's bullshit. The decision to cliffhang an 80-hour game has left me in the same position I was left in after the last few games: soured, my good times relegated to the rearview mirror as I file away <em>Shadows</em> on the shitty terms I parted with, not the glee which took up the bulk of my time with it.&nbsp;</p><p>My <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> piece earlier this month was mostly about how, for all Ubisoft’s talk and publicity, <em>Shadows</em> was a lot more similar to the last few games in the series than we’d maybe been expecting. Which was fine for the good stuff, but it’s a real shame to see those similarities extend right through to <em>Shadows</em>’ ending, and it’s something Ubisoft are going to need to address going forwards if they want people to stop parting with these games on such depressing terms.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kowloon-generic-romance"><h3>Kowloon Generic Romance Is The Closest Anime Has Come To A Wong Kar Wai Film</h3></a><p>Longing, nostalgia, and an unconventional sci-fi tale make for a not-so-generic anime romance

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-bethesda-microsoft-bds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a move equal parts surprising and totally expected (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23880264/bethesda-oblivion-dishonored-3-fallout-3-leaked-documents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for literal years</a>), Microsoft shadow-dropped its not-so-secret <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remaster today. Cool, great. Also, it does not need to exist, and you do not need to buy it.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft, Bethesda, and Virtuos’ remaster of <em>Oblivion </em>is perhaps one of the least necessary in history considering the 19-year-old RPG’s still-active modding scene, a hallmark of Bethesda’s lineage that will always put its games at odds with the idea of a remaster. The most visible effort sprouting from this verdant, bloom-lit landscape is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skyblivion.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Skyblivion</em></a>, a fan remake of <em>Oblivion </em>inside <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>. After over a decade in development, <em>Skyblivion </em>is set to release… later this year. In a show of grace, the <em>Skyblivion </em>team <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skyblivion.com/post/3ln3xolvwg22j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a statement</a> a few days before the <em>Oblivion </em>remaster’s official reveal:</p><blockquote><p>We want to emphasize that there is no need for comparisons or a sense of competition between <em>Skyblivion </em>and a potential official remaster. Both projects can exist and thrive together, offering unique experiences for players. <em>Skyblivion </em>is a labor of love, built by a dedicated community for the community, offering a distinct way to revisit <em>Oblivion </em>within the familiar framework of the Creation Engine. Similarly, an official remaster would undoubtedly bring its own set of advancements with the full funding of a development studio. We see this not as a conflict, but as a fantastic opportunity for <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fans to have even more ways to enjoy the classic world of Cyrodiil.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This still raises the question of why Microsoft and Bethesda deemed the remaster necessary, the answer to which is obviously money. And regardless – or precisely because – of how it impacts the companies’ almighty balance sheet, there’s simply not a good reason to buy a shiny, $50 version of this specific game that you probably already own. As we’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written about previously</a>, Microsoft now finds itself in the crosshairs of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement for its glaringly apparent complicity in Israel’s ongoing ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people, especially where its Azure cloud services are concerned.&nbsp;</p><p>"To pressure Microsoft, boycott Microsoft’s consumer products whenever possible (including Microsoft gaming services), demand your institutions divest from Microsoft, and exclude the company from contracts," <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft#why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reads the movement’s page</a> on Microsoft, which it has declared a "priority target."</p><p>As a reporter, I recognize the inevitable complexities that arise when choosing whether to engage with works produced by systems and companies that are exploitative or, in this case, worse. I imagine that I, personally, will be forced to spend more time and energy agonizing over exactly how to cover future Microsoft releases – and I will feel grateful, on those occasions, that I’m working for a publication with the support necessary to stand by its convictions and write about games critically rather than as simple products.</p><p>But beyond that, purely from a consumer’s perspective, this one’s easy! <em>Oblivion </em>is almost two decades old. And in addition to the modding scene I mentioned above, which essentially allows the original game to self-revitalize on a regular basis, this remaster is coming out during a new-release avalanche. In the past month or so alone, we’ve gotten: <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/assassins-creed-shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/schedule-1-game-early-access-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Schedule 1</em></a>, <em>Runescape: Dragonwilds</em>, <em>Promise Mascot Agency</em>, <em>Lost Records: Bloom And Rage</em>,<em> Split Fiction</em>, <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/wanderstop-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wanderstop</em></a>, <em>Atomfall</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/two-point-museum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Two Point Museum</em></a>, and so many others that it’s nearly impossible to keep track.</p><p>None of those scratch the <em>Oblivion </em>itch? Pick up one of the dozens of interesting indies inspired by old-school Bethesda games, like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574240/Dread_Delusion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dread Delusion</em></a>, whose gleefully alien worldbuilding puts recent Bethesda fare to shame. It only has a few thousand Steam reviews. You probably missed it when it came out last year. You probably missed hundreds of good games when they came out last year – and the year before, and the year before.</p><p>Everybody is posting about the <em>Oblivion </em>remaster today, and over 100,000 people are playing it on Steam. But in a couple days – probably when the review embargo lifts on the next big game that’s about to come out, realistic France simulator <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> – they’ll stop. That’s one of the few upsides of living through this era of Peak Media: Whatever your reasons, be they budget or boycott, you can always just skip the thing everybody is talking about. Give it a day or two, and there will inevitably be something else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-zero-company-permadeath-xcom"><h3>Fine, I’ll Play Star Wars XCOM</h3></a><p>It's got permadeath, and that's enough for me</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
