            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here at Aftermath, we only pick winners, as evidenced by our decision to become the first video game website ever (to our knowledge) to <a href="https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-mayor-nyc-adrew-cuomo-eric-adams-minecraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endorse a political candidate</a> in newly minted NYC Democratic mayor-in-waiting Zohran Mamdani. The pick was a no-brainer: He speaks his mind, he wants to make the city cheaper, and he <a href="https://x.com/PanasonicDX4500/status/1937982130178691098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">probably knows who Sephiroth is</a>. But, contrary to popular belief, he’s not our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/new-york-city-might-get-its-first-gamer-mayor-years-before-winning-the-democratic-primary-11-year-old-zohran-mamdani-had-his-heart-set-on-simcity-3000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>first</em></a><em> </em>gamer mayor. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we relay some unfortunate facts.</p><p>This time around, we celebrate Mamdani’s win by bringing on a whopping TWO guests: First, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxrn.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Max Rivlin-Nadler</a> joins us to talk about how <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hell Gate</a> – a fellow worker-owned publication – punched well above its weight during this election, <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/mayoralforum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">organizing a forum</a> that leading Democratic candidates (excluding Andrew Cuomo) showed up to and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFqqr2hmqZc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosting an election night livestream</a> that aired in bars across the city.&nbsp;</p><p>Then former Kotaku writer turned professional <em>Genshin Impact</em> advocate turned laid off person (hire them!) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/six6jiang.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sisi Jiang</a> comes on to share their experience knocking on over 1,000 doors for the Mamdani campaign – part of a wider canvassing effort that resulted in an unprecedented turnout for a leftist candidate. Lastly, using the <a href="https://x.com/souljagoyteller/status/1937816227692597617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scant information available</a>, we attempt to divine what kind of gamer Mamdani is.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can get Mamdani on the show, or at least pester his people until they let us ask him who he mains in <em>Super Smash Bros</em>.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Some people have been making the assertion that Zohran is going to be our gamer mayor, simply because of his age and because he knows what <em>FIFA </em>is. But I have really bad news: Unfortunately, our first gamer mayor – at least, in terms of policy – is Eric Adams, who did actually invest millions into gaming-related initiatives.&nbsp;</p><p>Those include a degree program in game making, regular student <em>Minecraft </em>tournaments that were about combatting climate change, and most recently the NYC Video Game Festival, which took place in May and kicked off the so-called “Summer Of Games,” which encompasses a bunch of events that have happened in previous years, but packages them all together as a New York City initiative. Regrettably, considering his many other sins, Eric Adams has been kinda good on this.</p><p><strong>Sisi:</strong> You know what? This is exactly what gamers deserve. We don’t deserve a good gamer mayor; we deserve Eric Adams, gamer mayor – the same mayor who said random shit like “All my haters are the waiters at my table of success.” That is the most gamer mayor behavior.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> But I don’t think he knows games. If you tried to ask him Mario lore, he’d be like “Well, he’s the king of the Mushroom Kingdom.” He’d know enough culturally to lie about it, but it would all be just slightly off. [You’d have to tell him] “Mario’s not the king of the Mushroom Kingdom. It’s a different guy.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Even just the other day, he <a href="https://aftermath.site/kai-cenat-eric-adams-nyc-fanum-nypd-giveaway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met up with Kai Cenat</a>, one of the most popular streamers on Twitch. When he entered the room, you can hear Eric Adams saying “I just want my video game,” and it’s like, did you think you were gonna get a video game out of meeting with a Twitch streamer? Are you making a joke? The context is not fully there, but it’s a very odd thing for him to say when walking to shake hands with Kai.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’d be funny if he knew who Kefka was, but he doesn’t know who Sephiroth is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-dlc-success-bonus"><h3>Bucking The Industry Trend Of Post-Launch Layoffs, Lies Of P Devs Received $7,500 Bonuses, Switch 2s</h3></a><p>"This bonus payout is both a celebration of that achievement and a significant turning point as the Lies of P franchise progresses to its next stage.”</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/drumeo-youtube-covers"><h3>YouTube Channel Drumeo’s Freestyle Drum Covers Make Me Want To Take My Shirt Off And Yell “Hell Yeah”</h3></a><p>You haven’t lived until you’ve heard this particular cover of Bring Me The Horizon’s “Can You Feel My Heart”

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The video game industry has received a lot of bad news lately: Even at the biggest, most profitable companies, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MDc3Mjc0NiwiZXhwIjoxNzUxMzc3NTQ2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWUQ0VkxEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.iMkVuxzB6m6hT_Rpwa-NQCTCvDapSt1DaRfpnGaqUSw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people are getting laid off</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studios are closing</a>, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/wonder-woman-video-game-canceled-gaming-studios-shut-down-1236146772/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and games are being canceled</a>. A small number of massive games — like <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>, which are both games and platforms — take up a lot of attention. It feels hard for any one new video game to succeed, which is why people were so excited to hear not only about the success of Neowiz and Round8 Studio’s <em>Lies of P</em>, but about the way the company was celebrating that success.</p><p>South Korean outlet The Elec <a href="http://.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37284" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a story last week</a> saying that Neowiz was marking the launch of its <a href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Lies of P</em> DLC <em>Overture</em></a> by giving its employees two weeks of paid time off, Nintendo Switch 2 consoles, and a $7,500 bonus. Round8 Studio head Jason Park confirmed the bonuses to Aftermath, saying that these bonuses are “a special advance payment to celebrate [the] successful launch of the DLC,” but are only one part of the total bonus that employees will receive.&nbsp;</p><p>“The substantial, performance-based incentives will continue to be paid out annually,” Park said. “We base these yearly incentives on our operating profit and distribute them to the development team. We anticipate that early next year, when the 2025 performance incentives are paid, it will be a very exciting and rewarding time for our development team.”</p><p><em>Overture</em> was released on June 6, described by Neowiz as “a dramatic prequel to the acclaimed soulslike action RPG.” Chris Person, <a href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-is-good-overture-annoucement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted <em>Lies of P</em> enjoyer</a>, said in his review of <em>Overture</em> that the DLC is “the best parts of the game executed with confidence.”</p><p>The original game was a success by the typical metrics of sales, with three million copies sold <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/lies-of-p-sales-top-three-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the studio</a>. But Park said that Round8 Studio and Neowiz aren’t necessarily concerned with the sales or revenue of the game as a “primary goal.” Instead, they aim to create games that score above 85 by fans and critics on places like Metacritic or OpenCritic. “We firmly believe that if we focus on crafting games that resonate with and are acclaimed by our fans, sales and revenue will naturally follow,” Park said.&nbsp;</p><p>This was important to how the team approached <em>Overture</em>. “When developing <em>Lies of P: Overture</em>, our focus wasn't on specific sales figures,” Park said. “Instead, we aimed to tell the untold hidden stories from the past for the fans who loved <em>Lies of P</em>, and to provide an enhanced experience that improved upon any aspects that felt lacking in the main game. Ultimately, we believe the development team created a truly satisfying result, and we also achieved our goal critics-wise. This bonus payout is both a celebration of that achievement and a significant turning point as the <em>Lies of P</em> franchise progresses to its next stage.”</p><p>Park acknowledged that the success of <em>Lies of P</em> and the <em>Overture</em> DLC — <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/lies-of-p-overture/critic-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which has an 84 rating on Metacritic</a> and <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/18664/lies-of-p-overture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an 85 rating on OpenCritic</a> — is not the work of “a single director alone.” It’s a team effort, and that’s why the entire team is rewarded in this way.</p><p>“As you know, creating a truly great game isn't possible through the efforts of a single director alone. We believe that a truly excellent game is built through the collective dedication of every developer involved in the project, all striving to make the game experience rich and immersive,” Park said.</p><p>He continued, “Many team members have even said that receiving this kind of support and encouragement from fans was a dream come true for them as developers.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-zohran-mamdani-fifa-sim-city"><h3>Congratulations To Zohran Mamdani, NYC’s (Second) Gamer Mayor</h3></a><p>"Unfortunately, our first gamer mayor – at least, in terms of policy – is Eric Adams"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/drumeo-youtube-covers"><h3>YouTube Channel Drumeo’s Freestyle Drum Covers Make Me Want To Take My Shirt Off And Yell “Hell Yeah”</h3></a><p>You haven’t lived until you’ve heard this particular cover of Bring Me The Horizon’s “Can You Feel My Heart”
