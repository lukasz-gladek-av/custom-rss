            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there's one genre of game I've spent more time playing in the past decade than any other--<a href="https://aftermath.site/order-of-battle-ww2-turn-based-tactics-game-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than MLGAM tactics games</a>, more than<a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sports games</a>, more than quaint little European games about running a bus company--it's 4X. From <em>Civilization </em>to <em>Endless Legend</em> to <em>Stellaris </em>to <em>Humankind</em>, I've spent thousands of hours exploring, expanding, exploiting and exterminating, but as the calendar creeps closer to 2026 I don't know if I've ever felt further from the things I love about them.</p><p>I've written about this before:<a href="https://kotaku.com/civilization-civ-vi-6-review-2023-retrospective-pc-sid-1850242218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in my fading feelings for <em>Civ VI</em></a>, followed by<a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the crushing disappointment of <em>Civ VII</em></a>. How<a href="https://aftermath.site/humankind-re-review-amplitude-impressions-pc-sega-4x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Humankind</em> is now merely OK instead of Not Great</a>. How<a href="https://aftermath.site/millennia-4x-paradox-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> many of the newcomers to the genre have got nearly everything about it wrong</a>. It really feels like something is going increasingly awry at the heart of the genre, and <em>Endless Legend 2</em>--an Early Access game I've been playing for the past week--is no exception.</p><p>To recap: the original was released back in 2014, adding tactical battles and some cool factional and narrative twists to what was even then looking like a genre in need of some fresh air. And it worked! People <em>loved </em>that game,<a href="https://kotaku.com/endless-legend-the-kotaku-review-1655274702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> myself included</a>, and so fans have been hanging out for a <em>very </em>long time to play the sequel, arriving on September 22 in Early Access 11 years later.</p><p>The thing is, a lot has changed in those 11 years. After years of listing to port, <em>Civilization </em>appears to have finally run aground, and in the middle of that decade <em>Endless Legend's</em> developers, Amplitude, released their own wannabe <em>Civ</em>-killer, <em>Humankind</em>, a game that had some very cool ideas but which also robbed the 4X experience of a lot of its personality, and ended up being pretty boring as a result. I think of all <em>Civ VII's</em> missteps, the worst was that it copied the parts of <em>Humankind </em>that least needed copying. Sadly (if not surprisingly, given it’s the same studio!), <em>Endless Legend 2</em> has now done the same thing.</p><p><em>Endless Legend 2</em> is a game that simultaneously looks gorgeous but is also overwhelming. That appears busy but feels meaningless, because so many of your endless (sorry) notifications are for the most mundane pieces of city-building. There's so much going on at all times, but I quickly found myself numb to the drudgery of progression, of endlessly (SORRY) encountering the same people triggering the same dialogue. <em>Humankind </em>had this same problem, in that watching all those units swoosh around on such a beautiful map is meditative, but not <em>interesting</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ENDLESS™ Legend 2 - Reveal Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x5rvxUoYFDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I want to find whoever is responsible for modern 4X's obsession with adjacency bonuses and their resultant megacities and tell them just how disappointed I am. The enormous settlements you have to build in <em>Endless Legend 2</em>--just like those you have to build in <em>Humankind</em>, and <em>Civ VI</em>, and <em>Civ VII</em>--sprawl across half a continent, look ridiculous and even become gameplay concerns later on because, with so much else going on and gently pinging you constantly on the interface, and with 117 units gliding across the screen at all times, you can completely miss the fact they're <em>under attack</em>.</p><p>For all the issues I’ve raised thus far, <em>Endless Legend 2</em> also continues many of the best things about <em>Endless Legend 1</em>, like asymmetrical factions and a very strong insistence on weaving story into the game. The former feels pretty limited right now (only five factions were available in the build I played, meaning you just keep running into the same leaders all the time), and the latter does a much better job of weaving the story into your games, down to turning dialogue options into victory pathway selections, which is a <em>fantastic </em>idea. But again, with the same story repeating each playthrough, and this being the kind of game designed to be played through a <em>lot</em>, it gets tired pretty quickly.</p><p><em>Endless Legend 2</em> also has maybe the single most fascinating 4X twist I've ever seen, in that you start the game on a reasonably normal map--some different types of identifiably Earth-like climate, surrounded by ocean--and then throughout the game these huge storms happen, after which the ocean gets sucked out and the amount of landmass keeps increasing in its place. In theory it's like <em>Civ VII's</em> map getting bigger at the exploration age, but in practice it's much more dramatic, even visually; while the original land area is full of grass and forests, the "new" land is a variety of weird alien undersea stuff. The first time it happened, I gasped. But like so many other attempts at 4X innovation, I'm not sure I'm into it in the longterm, because once the novelty wore off it made the map feel both crowded and indistinct, every game ending up a single chaotic mass of regions all sharing land borders.</p><p>One thing I did like without reservation was the way it continues to get right into the weeds of jacking the game full of fantasy RPG stuff. Your hero units can be levelled up and equipped with loot, but they also just pop up sometimes to have conversations. You can even build them little houses on the map where they can, uh, get married to other characters in the game? Which then prompts even more little dialogue sequences and hero perks? It's wonderful stuff, and really has you investing in the <em>character </em>of your best units.</p><figure></figure><p>Maybe my genre gripes are just a me problem, or at least a generational problem for others who have been playing 4X games for so long. I've been playing Civilization since the first game's release back in 1991; it's now 2025, so it would be totally normal for me to be numb to so much of the genre's bedrock. And yet,<a href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I still find myself drawn to older games built on that very bedrock</a>, and have become increasingly turned off by newer games’ attempts to shift the genre's boundaries.</p><p>This has become a piece about so many other games, not just <em>Endless Legend 2</em>, because so many of these games have done the same thing. The two biggest studios making the two biggest series of 4X games, responsible for nearly all of its best-selling titles of the past decade, are both trying to take the genre to a place that I just...don't like.</p><p>4X games became a thing because they empowered players and let them feel things in a strategy game they'd never felt before. The feeling of being a small tribe, alone in an unknown world, facing the darkness. Of running into rivals who were passionate and erratic and memorable as characters, not just AI trading partners. Of the world you knew so little about feeling <em>vast</em>. And while there was management to be done, so much of the more tedious stuff was kept under the hood.</p><p>Firaxis and Amplitude's more recent games, built with <em>Civ's</em> own board game heritage in mind, have shrunk the borders of that world. Everything feels smaller, less like a planet, more like a game of <em>Catan </em>confined to your dining room table. And the numbers, whose obfuscation was once the point, are now everywhere. These are no longer games about exploring, expanding, exploiting and exterminating. They're about adjacency bonuses.</p><p>Which is fine to a point; the formula has been shaken up because it needed to be, I'm not questioning that. Innovation is good! But I had such high hopes for <em>Endless Legend 2</em>, given how much I loved its predecessor, so I've been bummed to see it fall into the same pothole as so many other big games in this space lately.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't know if things will always be like this, or whether they're just a consequence of the game launching perhaps a little too early into Early Access (I’ve played an early release of this build, which goes on sale on September 22). In 6-12 months’ time, who knows: Amplitude might add more factions and story options to the point where things feel more fleshed out and hang together a bit more elegantly.</p><p>Until then, though, I'm left looking at a game that promised so much, but has slipped on the same ol' banana peels, and also maybe launched a bit too soon. It'll take some time, and work, before I want to spend another whole week with it.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/arma-trans-platoon"><h3>Arma Can Be A Boys Club, But This Trans Women-Only Platoon Aims To Change That</h3></a><p>'It’s a community that is made for the trans community...

            <title><![CDATA[Hey James Gunn: Is Peacemaker Season 2 About A Nazi Alternate Universe?]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/peacemaker-alternate-universe-nazi-gi-robot-james-gunn</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hey-james-gunn-is-peacemaker-season-2-about-a-nazi-alternate-universe.1302093/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there’s one thing that we can all say for sure about director James Gunn’s political beliefs, it’s that he hates Nazis. I wasn’t sure how he was going to incorporate that into the second season of <em>Peacemaker</em>, but viewers are pretty sure he’s found a way.</p><p>As someone who has a very high tolerance for James Gunn’s whole thing—<a href="https://www.troma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Troma Entertainment</a> levels of gore, dumb dirty jokes, extremely chatty characters, endlessly rehashing complicated feelings about your dad—I’ve come to understand that his politics are pretty simple. He doesn’t like that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HETgzbkvwuw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Louis CK&nbsp; jerked off in front of a lot of women</a>, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kebqC4vxxdY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loves animals</a>, and he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYYvhiNLZ-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fucking <em>hates</em> Nazis</a>. In <em>Creature Commandos</em>, a cartoon he wrote after being given the keys to the DC cinematic universe, he dedicated an entire episode to the origins of GI Robot, a robot who was designed with the sole directive of killing Nazis. And kill Nazis he does!</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="GI Robot’s Fate (Coin-Operated Boy) | Creature Commandos" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEZAMa5MqLI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>How does this connect to <em>Peacemaker</em>? Peacemaker, played by John Cena, keeps trying to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/peacemaker-was-a-comic-book-show-in-all-the-right-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make amends for the kind of man he was raised to be</a>. His dad was a white nationalist—and Peacemaker killed him at the end of the last season. However, at the start of this season, Peacemaker found a portal to a seemingly perfect universe where his dad and also his deceased brother Keith are still alive, and the three of them are heralded as heroes. In this universe, Peacemaker might be able to get together with a version of Amelia Harcourt, who wants nothing to do with him in his original universe despite their intense sexual tension and mutual affection for each other. Peacemaker repeatedly calls this universe the “best universe ever,” and so far, it seems like it is—were it not for one detail.</p><p>Any universe where Peacemaker’s dad, an open white supremacist, is heralded as a hero is probably one I, and plenty of other people, would not be welcome in. More than that, I was struck by the way Peacemaker’s brother pronounced the name of the city “Blüdhaven.” Most of the time, characters in the DC Universe pronounce this city’s name as “Bloodhaven,” hilariously. But Keith pronounced “Bluthaven,” which is closer to how it would be pronounced in German, and, well….</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="That's what a nazi would say meme GI Robot" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C3dFP6s9txQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Most telling for me, though, is the absolute lack of people of color. It’s actually chilling once you start to notice it. As Peacemaker ventures out into this alternate universe, I was not able to spot a single Black, Latino, or Asian person, nor any other race other than white. In fact, there doesn’t appear to be any <em>extras</em> who are people of color, something corroborated by an extra who posted to the show’s subreddit.</p><p>“Everyone I remember seeing was at least white-presenting,” a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PeacemakerShow/comments/1ncrj9r/i_was_a_background_actor_in_peacemaker_s2e3_ama/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">background actor wrote</a> on Reddit.&nbsp; “I think the Nazi/white supremacist dimension theories have credibility.”</p><p>There are some other little tells that something is at least off with this universe. Keith doesn’t know who the Kardashians are—perhaps because OJ Simpson never existed, meaning that Robert Kardashian would never have been catapulted to national recognition for representing Simpson at his murder trial. Emilia Harcourt also appears to not know what the phrase “what’s happening?” is a reference to. <em>What’s Happening!! </em>was a sitcom about a Black family from the 1970s, and <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/what-s-happening-star-ernest-thomas-show-s-impact-race-t215884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a landmark in terms of depicting Black families</a> on television. Weirdest of all, the show goes out of its way to <em>not</em> show the audience a hot dog vendor. Like, it feels bizarre to watch the lengths that the show goes to in order to shoot around this hot dog vendor’s body. Is it because many people who own and operate food trucks in real life and in filmed media are often not white? Who’s to say, but it’s <em>fucking strange</em>.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://press.wbd.com/us/image/pm220509042024jm6080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Photograph by Jessica Miglio/HBO Max </a></figcaption></figure><p>This is all the more notable because the rest of <em>Peacemaker</em> is almost self consciously racially diverse. Peacemaker’s best friend is Leota Adebayo, a Black lesbian played by the hilarious Danielle Brooks. This season has added two more characters of color in ARGUS agents Langston Fleury (Tim Meadows) and Sasha Bordeaux (Sol Rodriguez), who also team up with last season’s Judomaster, a Vietnamese character played by Nhut Le. The universe that Peacemaker comes from has its characters of color front and center, impossible to ignore, which makes their absence feel even more conspicuous in the alternate universe.</p><p>Of course, having something be subtly wrong with an alternate universe that appears perfect is just sensible writing for the journey that Peacemaker has gone on in these two seasons of television. Peacemaker has already rejected his father’s teachings once, but he’s still looking for the easy way out in terms of making amends for the harm he has caused. It would be <em>easy</em> to escape to this seemingly perfect universe—but if fan theories are correct, it would mean rejecting the humanity of Leota Adebayo, who has stood by his side and always believed in him, even when he was at his lowest. In Peacemaker’s quest to be a better man, can he reject a world where his happiness would come at the expense of people like Adebayo? It’s a test of character that would demonstrate how far Peacemaker has come from his first appearance in <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, where he declared “I cherish peace with all of my heart. I don't care how many men, women and children I kill to get it.”</p><p><em>Peacemaker</em> fans will learn if their suspicions about this alternate universe are correct tonight, as Adebayo is poised to go there for the first time—we’re all going to find out if this is a white supremacist universe pretty fucking quick. As for me, I’m hoping Gunn can squeeze in another appearance from GI Robot.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/arma-trans-platoon"><h3>Arma Can Be A Boys Club, But This Trans Women-Only Platoon Aims To Change That</h3></a><p>'It’s a community that is made for the trans community...
