            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/avowed-decision-choices-story-im-so-sorry-everybody<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I finished <em>Avowed </em>last night, and despite all the tense battles and carnage and explosive effects and beautiful colours on display during the game's closing hours, I've woken up today unable to stop thinking about...a bunch of choices I had to make in the middle of<a href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-subtitles-lore-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> otherwise pedestrian dialogue sections</a>.</p><p>Obsidian (and <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>) fans in particular will already know where I'm going here, but a lot of people (myself included!) are new to all this, so indulge me: If you play <em>Avowed</em>, and you are approaching the endgame (or any decision that will seemingly have ramifications on what happens later), please have conviction.</p><p><em>Avowed </em>does not shy away from putting tough choices in front of you, but what separates them from many other RPGs is that they're choices that are tough for <em>you</em>. <em>Avowed</em> will show you a town and say, oh no, is this town in trouble? You could do this to try to help, which will kill a bunch of people. Or you could do <em>this</em>, which will kill a different bunch of people. Or <em>this</em>, which could kill nobody, or kill <em>everybody</em>. Who knows! How much do you care about one group over the other, and how will it sit with you if you condemn one to death instead of the other based on their vibes?&nbsp; There is no best decision here, because every decision you make is flawed.</p><figure><figcaption>I was trying to help!</figcaption></figure><p>Whatever you choose, people will die, it will suck, and someone in your party will hate you for it. I spent the last few hours of <em>Avowed </em>with folks openly furious at me, an entire race of people unable to even look me in the eye, and that's <em>after </em>I'd made a decision that saved their entire city. I thought I'd done the right thing! But nope, to them, I was a monster.</p><p>Turns out there's no clean fix for a dying island ravaged by plague and haunted by an imprisoned god. Everything here is terrible, everyone you meet imperfect and for some reason the fate of that terror is continually left up to you to decide in the middle of a conversation.</p><p>I'm not saying the choices here are inconsequential. They're very consequential! They decide the fate of gods, of continents, of cities, of empires! But when every decision you make has a huge impact in <em>some </em>way, the focus is less on you changing the world, which is being changed no matter what you say, and more on how you can live with the changes that you chose.</p><p>Basically, <em>Avowed </em>is not a game for reloaders. There's no way to revisit older decisions to make the "right" choice because there simply isn't one. There's no avoiding casualties; you just have to choose who dies and make peace with that. There are only choices that are right for <em>you</em>.</p><p>That's my favourite thing about <em>Avowed</em>, and also maybe my biggest piece of advice to anyone who is yet to play it: its most consequential narrative "rewards" aren't found in changing the ending or making sure a party member survives, but in presenting a world in chaos to the player as a Rorschach Test, one designed to see that if terrible decisions must be made, it's up to you to reflect on just why you made them.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down"><h3>Fuck WB</h3></a><p>Another all-time great studio sacrificed at the altar of Line Go Up</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-skeleton-notes-funny-writing-bear-egg"><h3>Avowed Has Killer Skeleton Storytelling</h3></a><p>It turns out that dead men do, in fact, tell tales.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It has been said countless times and by people far more eloquent than me, but fuck Warner Bros. Fuck ‘em! Fuck both the company generally and CEO David Zaslav specifically for <a href="https://aftermath.site/coyote-vs-acme-fuck-david-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceling completed projects like <em>Coyote vs Acme</em></a> in the name of a stupid tax write off, fuck ‘em for rendering a mindboggling number of beloved series <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/5/23541449/warner-bros-discovery-gunnar-wiedenfels-hbo-max-2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inaccessible</a> for the purposes of more arcane tax math, and now, fuck the aforementioned parties, current WB Games CEO JB Perrette, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3liznkcrvis2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former WB Games CEO David Haddad</a> for killing off three studios today, including Monolith, creators of <em>No One Lives Forever</em>, <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>, and the until-moments-ago in-development <em>Wonder Woman</em> game.&nbsp;</p><p>Fresh off publishing <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an expose into WB’s heinous mismanagement</a> of its video game properties, Jason Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lizk5skwps2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported today</a> that the company is shutting down Monolith, <em>Multiversus </em>developer Player First Games, and WB Games San Diego. Shortly after, WB confirmed the news in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lizl4fakrs24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a statement</a>.</p><p>“We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises – <em>Harry Potter</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, DC and <em>Game of Thrones</em>,” WB wrote. “After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios – Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them. The development of Monolith's <em>Wonder Woman</em> videogame will not move forward. Our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities. … As difficult as today is, we remain focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond.”</p><p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/529310/warner-bros-games-monolith-productions-multiversus-studio-closure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon reports</a> that in an email to staff, Perrette, the CEO and president of global streaming and games for Warner Bros. Discovery, said that the company hopes to "repurpose our talent where possible," but as evidenced by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cypheroftyr.bsky.social/post/3lizlkbt2tc2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posts from now-former employees</a>, that's far from an across-the-board directive. Perrette went on to talk about "swagger," because these people can never not be nauseatingly embarrassing while also revealing that they do not have souls.</p><p>“We need to and will do better for our fans first and foremost, and also because regaining that credibility is critical to us securing even more investment in Games in the years to come,” Perrette wrote in the email to staff. “Getting our swagger back happens one high quality game release at a time, and our financial credibility gets rebuilt one fiscal quarter at a time – delivering what we said we would deliver, and no big negative surprises.”</p><p>As Stephen Totilo, former boss of both Schreier and everybody at Aftermath, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3lizl7ipdg22l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed out</a> to cap off this incredibly dour crossover episode, Warner Bros Discovery’s quarterly earnings update is in just two days. Odds are this ritual bloodletting is, as ever, about pleasing the shareholders. IP like <em>Harry Potter</em>, perhaps the least imaginative story ever told about literal wizards, and <em>Game of Thrones</em>, a franchise so tapped that I grow tired just thinking about it, will <a href="https://aftermath.site/wb-earnings-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continue until morale improves</a>. The studios involved will not, unless they produce infinite hits forever – unless they cause The Line to stand so erect that it tickles God’s own toesie-woesies.</p><p>I’m sure said shareholders will leap into the air and click their heels when they hear that people have lost their jobs, and a legacy that includes <em>Blood</em>, <em>No One Lives Forever</em>, <em>F.E.A.R.</em>, <em>Condemned: Criminal Origins</em>, and <em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> has been flushed down the toilet. I do not imagine many of them will linger long on the fact that WB <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/warner-bros-finally-secures-patent-for-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patented Monolith’s incredible Nemesis System</a> – which allowed enemies in the <em>Mordor </em>games to develop personal rivalries with the player and even taunt you with the specific ways they dispatched you – and then failed to meaningfully redeploy it, preventing other game developers from iterating on a mechanic that could have defined an era.</p><p>After all, that is not their job. Their job is to serve, and be served by, The Line. Our job is to slurp slop from the boot heel – to bury ourselves in meaningless nostalgia for boy wizards until we’ve forgotten that human beings are part of this process at all.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-decision-choices-story-im-so-sorry-everybody"><h3>Every Decision You Make In Avowed Is Terrible</h3></a><p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-skeleton-notes-funny-writing-bear-egg"><h3>Avowed Has Killer Skeleton Storytelling</h3></a><p>It turns out that dead men do, in fact, tell tales.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
