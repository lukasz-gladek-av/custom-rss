<p>Ubisoft has revealed that Assassin’s Creed Shadows has surpassed Odyssey and Origins’ launch numbers, hitting a 2 million player milestone.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-2-million-players">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Has Surpassed 2 Million Players</h2>



<p>The official Assassin’s Creed account on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1903431554459644198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) has just confirmed that Shadows has crossed the launch numbers of AC Origins and Odyssey, with 2 million players joining their latest adventure in Feudal Japan. The game managed to cross the 1 million players mark <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-crosses-1-million-players-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">within the first day</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ubisoft’s decision to launch Shadows Day One on Steam seems to be going well, too, as the game has already beaten AC Origin’s all-time peak numbers and is now closing in on AC Odyssey. Shadows has hit an all-time peak of 59,941 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">today</a> (at the time of writing), and the number can go higher as it’s the weekend. This number beats Valhalla and Origns all-time peaks of 15,679 and 41,551 and is just a bit shy of beating Odyssey’s 62,069. However, it’s worth noting that none of the other AC games were Day One releases on Steam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was subject to several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delays</a> before it was released on March 20. However, the added time has helped the developers provide the players with a more immersive and polished experience. It’ll be exciting to see how many more players the game attracts over time and whether it becomes the most-played Assassin’s Creed game yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Shadows may have set a record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-endgame-credits-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for its endgame credits</a>. Also, the Japanese government is worried about ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/japan-government-worried-attacks-assassins-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imitation attacks</a>’ based on the game.

<p>Delta Force developers have revealed they are developing a new ‘solo mode’ for the game’s campaign, allowing players who prefer to play alone to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/delta-force-devs-adding-solo-mode-easier-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, Delta Force’s game design director Ricky Liao mentioned a ‘solo mode’ they will introduce soon for Black Hawk Down. The solo mode will be “a more approachable experience for players who prefer playing alone”. At the same time, the developers will maintain “the core tactical elements of the game” to provide a similar experience in the new game mode.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-delta-force-black-hawk-down-solo-mode">Delta Force Black Hawk Down Solo Mode</h2>



<p>The developers will provide different difficulty options for Delta Force Black Hawk Down’s upcoming solo mode, so players don’t need to face off against enemies created for co-op difficulty. However, the campaign will remain challenging no matter what, as the game “isn’t meant to be a fast-paced shooter”. The developers want “players to think critically, strategize, and collaborate effectively with teammates, creating a level of tension and realism that mirrors real military operations.“</p>



<p>Apart from the ‘solo mode,’ the developers also discussed adding balancing changes to make the game seem “more fair.” However, they confirmed that the game will not become easier as “the challenge is intentional.” The developers want players to approach this game tactically “and as a team.” For those wondering, Delta Force’s Black Hawk Down launched to ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-mostly-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mostly negative</a>’ reviews on Steam, as many felt it was too difficult.</p>

<p>Former Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida recently discussed redesigning Crash Bandicoot for Japanese marketing because the character looked ‘scary’.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-was-crash-bandicoot-redesigned-for-japan">How Was Crash Bandicoot Redesigned for Japan?</h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oved6qVecH8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kyle Bosman</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/former-sony-exec-shuhei-yoshida-says-the-playstation-marketing-team-had-to-completely-redesign-crash-bandicoot-in-ps1-commercials-because-he-was-too-ugly-for-the-japanese-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>), Yoshida discussed Crash Bandicoot’s marketing plans for Japan and the hurdles they had to overcome, such as the redesign. Yoshida explained that Crash Bandicoot initially had green eyes and very thick eyebrows, which was “a bit scary”, so the devs were asked to make his eyes brown “like Japanese people” and thin the eyebrows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yoshida elaborated that Crash Bandicoot’s body had to be redesigned, too, as the character was “hairy on the surface,” which was “a bit scary” as it “looked like an animal.” Hence, they asked the Naughty Fog to create a plastic skin for Crash’s Japanese marketing materials, where the character would be “shiny”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The marketing plans for Crash Bandicoot in Japan included a 15-second advertisement where the game’s characters dance to a tune. Yoshida revealed that “Naughty Dog liked” their idea, adding that Crash starts dancing during the opening of Crash Bandicoot 3, and the idea for that came from Japanese marketers.&nbsp;</p>
