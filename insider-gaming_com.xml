<p>2024 has been a genuinely excellent year for video game releases, but most to date have been full price titles that drain your wallet and bank account. I don’t know about you, but even doing this job, I can’t afford every new release. It’s nice to download a new title, play it for tens or hundreds of hours, and not spend a dime. Well, that’s about to become much easier, as three upcoming free-to-play games are coming before the year’s end, and I’m sure they’ll dominate!</p>



<h2 id="h-upcoming-free-to-play-games-coming-before-2024-ends">Upcoming Free-to-Play Games Coming Before 2024 Ends</h2>



<p>Three high-profile free-to-play titles are launching in December, each within a different genre, and they’re all building momentum before release for various reasons. We have <strong>Delta Force</strong>, the upcoming “Battlefield killer,” <strong>Marvel Rivals</strong>, a hero shooter with team-based PvP, and <strong>Path of Exile 2</strong>, the positively monumental ARPG with its iconic passive skill tree and class roster.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: Delta Force</li>



<li><strong>Developer</strong>: Team Jade</li>



<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: December 4</li>



<li><strong>Price</strong>: Free to Play</li>



<li><strong>Genre</strong>: First-Person Shooter</li>
</ul>



<p>The free-to-play first-person shooter from developer Team Jade, which many consider the ultimate “Battlefield killer” (as if we haven’t had a thousand of those), has enjoyed immense success with its multiple beta test periods over the past few months. We here at Insider Gaming spent a lot of time with the <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-delta-force/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Force</a></strong> and even called it the “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Battlefield game played in years</a>.”</p>



<p>It includes countless weapons and weapon customization opportunities, vehicle combat, multiple game modes, a single-player story-driven experience, an extraction game mode, and large-scale infantry combat encounters with sizeable maps that ensure every round feels unique and thrilling.</p>



<h3 id="h-marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: Marvel Rivals</li>



<li><strong>Developer</strong>: NetEase Games</li>



<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: December 5</li>



<li><strong>Price</strong>: Free to Play</li>



<li><strong>Genre</strong>: Hero Shooter</li>
</ul>



<p>While I’m personally exhausted by the hero shooter genre after playing a few rounds of Overwatch six years ago, I know it’s still a popular competitive scene with an entire subset of the gaming community champing at the bit for a hit to release. <strong>Marvel Rivals</strong>, from NetEase Games, may be that hit as a free-to-play third-person shooter that combines the classic arena-style combat of titles like Overwatch and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tests-avoid-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a> with Marvel’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/39-marvel-rivals-characters-found-from-closed-alpha-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roster of heroes and villains</a>.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals features 6v6 arena-based combat with evolving battlefields in which superheroes and supervillains utilize abilities and powers to dominate objectives and the enemy team. You can play as Rocket Raccoon, Hulk, Spider-Man, Thor, and countless others, dealing damage and stomping through the environment in unbeatable action!</p>







<h3 id="h-path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: Path of Exile 2</li>



<li><strong>Developer</strong>: Grinding Gear Games</li>



<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: December 6</li>



<li><strong>Price</strong>: Free to Play</li>



<li><strong>Genre</strong>: Action RPG</li>
</ul>



<p>I genuinely cannot get enough of the ARPG genre. I grew up playing the likes of Champions of Norrath and the original Diablo titles alongside my stepfather, and the love for the grind stuck with me decades later. Now, you’ll often find me in either Diablo IV or Path of Exile, and like many of you, I’m eagerly awaiting the latter’s sequel. Well, it’s time. <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-path-of-exile-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a></strong> launches in Early Access on December 6, featuring an expansive campaign, a six-player co-op, an enhanced passive skill tree, and more class and play style variety than ever before.</p>



<p>With six acts, more than 100 boss fights, over 600 unique enemies, 12 base classes, and 36 Ascendancies, Path of Exile 2 promises to be bigger, better, and more time-consuming than ever before. I welcome the challenge!</p>

<p>According to IO Interactive’s latest announcement, Hitman World of Assassination’s PS VR2 launch has been delayed to March 27, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hitman: World of Assassination was initially scheduled to launch for PS VR2 in December 2024. However, a recent <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/hitman-world-of-assassination-launches-on-ps-vr2-march-27-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> from the developers indicates that they require additional time to enhance the game and ensure every aspect is “refined, immersive, and seamless.” The delay will also allow the developers to incorporate some new features for the PS VR2 version, including active reloading.</p>



<h2 id="h-hitman-woa-s-entire-campaign-is-playable-on-ps-vr2">Hitman WOA’s Entire Campaign is Playable on PS VR2</h2>



<p>PS VR2 players can experience the entire Hitman: World of Assassination (WOA) campaign. This includes free exploration across 20 unique locations such as Dubai, Paris, Miami, and more. Players will also have access to over 100 items and weapons while completing missions, adding depth to their approach in each task.</p>



<h2 id="h-hitman-woa-ps-vr2-features">Hitman WOA PS VR2 Features</h2>



<p>The most requested features for Hitman: World of Assassination on PS VR2 include dual-wielding and complete ambidexterity. The developers have confirmed that these features will be available at launch. Additionally, players can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as managing a guard while holding a weapon or picking up an essential item.</p>



<p>The new active reloading feature enables players to manually eject ammunition, grab a new magazine, and insert it back into their weapon, adding a layer of immersion to gear management. The PS VR2 version of the game offers a brand-new way to experience the franchise. Instead of pressing buttons to trigger events, players must physically mimic actions to complete tasks.</p>



<p>The developers are also taking “a more physics-based approach for disguising, where players can take an outfit using positional control, grabbing, and momentum, significantly enhancing the immersion and realism of the gameplay.”&nbsp;</p>
