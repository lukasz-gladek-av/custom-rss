<p>Video games can take a long time to make. Certain titles receive extensive development time—Hollow Knight: Silksong being an apt case study. Its development became one of myth and legend at one point, but Team Cherry’s carefully created baby is ready to be born into the world.</p>



<p>I played <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-pre-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong at Gamescom 2025</a>. My 15-minute demo gave me instant hope that the sequel is going to live up to the fevered hype. I’ve said before that you will struggle to find an indie sequel with this much popularity and pressure resting on its nimble shoulders.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>‘s development ride has taken a few detours. Let’s revisit history and fill in some blanks for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-has-team-cherry-developed-hollow-knight-silksong-for">How Long Has Team Cherry Developed Hollow Knight: Silksong For?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hopefully, it’s worth the wait. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s estimated that Hollow Knight: Silksong’s development first began in 2018, meaning the game has been in development for seven long years!</strong></p>



<p>This means official work on Silksong began only one year after Hollow Knight was released, and a year before the general public was introduced to Hollow Knight: Silksong altogether.</p>



<p>A fascinating article was released in August 2025 detailing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why Hollow Knight: Silksong took so long to release</a>. Quite simply, Team Cherry was having too much fun crafting the game, experimenting with new ideas, and making sure Silksong was worthy of being a sequel—instead of the DLC it was originally intended as.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-was-hollow-knight-silksong-first-announced">When Was Hollow Knight: Silksong First Announced?</h2>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong was first revealed to the world on Feb. 14, 2019, through its reveal trailer.</strong></p>



<p>You can find the “Hollow Knight: Silksong Reveal Trailer” on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TeamCherry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Team Cherry</a>‘s YouTube channel. The two-minute trailer shows off a decent amount of Silksong, and it seemed like it wouldn’t be <em>that </em>long until we got our hands on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-hollow-knight-silksong-a-sequel-or-prequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel</a>.</p>



<p>Little did we know that it would take over six years until the game launched (and it’s still not technically out yet).</p>



<p>Check out the original reveal trailer below and see if you can spot anything from the Silksong demo or recent trailers and footage.</p>

<hr>



<p>You can throw the words myth and legend into the bin. Silksong is coming. Team Cherry’s effort should be worth the wait, and I’ll be diving into Pharloom the second it launches. I’m genuinely so excited for Silksong, but let me know your thoughts on it through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p>You should also stick around and see if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong is on the Switch or Switch 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-to-play-hollow-knight-before-silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if you need to play Hollow Knight before Silksong</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-nba-2k26-secret-trophies-amp-achievements">All NBA 2K26 Secret Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>



<p><strong>NBA 2K26 only has three secret trophies and achievements to earn, and we’ve got them below – so consider this your final spoiler warning.</strong></p>



<p>The secret trophies and achievements in <a href="https://nba.2k.com/2k26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NBA 2K26</a> are all in the MyTEAM mode, with two related to winning auctions for players, and the other requiring a shutout in a Breakout game.</p>



<p>All the secret objectives are below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">NBA 2K26 Trophy &amp; Achievement Name</th><th data-align="center">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Early Bird</td><td data-align="center">Win an Auction within 5 minutes of it being listed in MyTEAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bid Snipe</td><td data-align="center">Win an Auction with less than 10 seconds remaining in MyTEAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Zer0</td><td data-align="center">Earn a shutout in a Breakout game in MyTEAM</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-many-trophies-amp-achievements-in-nba-2k26">How Many Trophies &amp; Achievements in NBA 2K26?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 49 total achievements in NBA 2K26, totalling 1000 Gamerscore on Xbox, while PlayStation players have an extra trophy to chase down with the coveted Platinum Trophy.</strong></p>



<p>Most are low-scoring and low-rarity, with the majority also being fairly easy to track as they’re often one-and-done objectives. Some require some tracking, like winning with all NBA teams, but on the grand scheme of things, it’s not a bad game to try and 100% complete.</p>

<p>September is a huge month for sports games with several big titles on the horizon, with NBA 2K26 among those poised for launch, and we’ve got the details on whether Game Pass subscribers have access to the game.</p>



<p>Releasing fully on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-release-date-explained-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 5</a>, though it’s available from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 29 for those with early access</a>, NBA 2K26 is the latest entry in the long-running franchise and is always among the most popular games every year.</p>



<p>With September stacked full of big releases, a Game Pass subscription can save you some money, and we’ve got details on whether the service includes NBA 2K26.</p>

<p><strong>No, NBA 2K26 will not be available to play with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on September 5th.</strong></p>



<p>NBA 2K26 is not an Xbox first-party title, which would see it immediately made available through the service. Unlike rivals EA Sports, there’s no free trial period with a Game Pass subscription either.</p>



<p>Although the first wave of titles launching on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a> in September is yet to be announced, NBA 2K26 is a huge release and, if it were to be on the service, we’d have been told by now. On top of this, the Xbox Store page would have a button that states the title would be ‘Coming to Game Pass’ alongside the purchase option.</p>



<p>With no such announcement and no Game Pass badge on the store page, the game will definitely not be on the service at launch.</p>

<p><strong>NBA 2K26 could come to the Xbox Game Pass service in the future, although no official word has confirmed this.</strong></p>



<p>2K has a close relationship with Xbox, with a free-play weekend for Game Pass subscribers for NBA 2K25 last year, while NBA 2K24 had a six-month stint on the service previously. </p>



<p>Other 2K titles, like Borderlands, have also regularly appeared on the Game Pass service, and the cycle of sports games usually sees them move to the service in the final few months of their lifespan before the latest release is dropped.</p>



<p>Therefore, if NBA 2K26 is to come to the service, don’t expect it to occur before 2026, unless a free-play weekend or a similar incentive is announced later in the year.</p>
