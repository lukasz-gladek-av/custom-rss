<p>Square Enix is pulling the plug on future Foamstars season updates, less than a year after the game’s release.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/documents/notice-regarding-foamstars-season-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a>, the studio said that season updates for the game will end on January 17 at the conclusion of the “Party Goes On!” season of the game. With this final season update, the studio is introducing features to “enhance gameplay”.</p>



<p>Those include the ability to customize shots for each character as well as new various enhancement elements.</p>



<p>“All online services will remain available after the “Party Goes One!” season ends,” Square Enix said. “In addition, we plan to hold the Foamstars Cup, a series of in-game events named after each character.</p>



<p>“Furthermore, to ensure that new players can fully enjoy Foamstars, previous Season Passes will be made available again. Players can switch between Season Passes at any time to proceed along the Season Pass track of your choice and obtain items from past seasons. This will make it possible for players to obtain all the items from each season.”</p>



<p>First launched in February 2024 exclusively for PlayStation, Foamstars released to little fanfare. Ultimately, the game went <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/foamstars-free-to-play-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free-to-play in October</a> in order to build its player base.</p>

<p>It’s not every day that gaming actively prevents someone from succumbing to a catastrophic accident, but here we are. On social media, one user recently told the tale of how an Xbox Series S console <strong>may </strong>have saved his life when he was hit by a truck and sent sprawling from his bicycle.</p>



<p>Per the post, the Xbox Series S in his backpack prevented him from striking his head against the curb, and while he didn’t escape unscathed, he believes that if he wasn’t carrying the Series S, <strong>he could have died</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-divine-intervention">Divine Intervention</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Jonzey8828/status/1864267929463988625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Twitter</a>, ‘Brandon J’ explained his story in full:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was on my way home from my local GameStop with the Xbox in my backpack when I was struck by a truck while riding my bicycle. I managed to keep above the trucks steel bumper at first but I eventually was dragged under. I was slammed to the ground and still he kept going so I assumed he didn’t see me. The Xbox in my backpack prevented me from hitting my head or worse, even dying. </p>



<p>I wasn’t gonna get shredded beneath the truck so I used my left leg to attempt to slow the truck. At this point my bike wedged my right leg so I couldn’t move it anywhere. Next thing I know my backpack was only hanging on by my left shoulder and was slammed into the curb along with me afterwards. I look to my left and I feel the full weight of the front end of this truck roll up on my ribs and roll back off. </p>



<p>The truck hit and dragged me 12 feet and soon I was rushed to the hospital with only a single broken bone in my left foot and a few road rashes. I thought the Xbox was a goner but It started up with no hesitation at all and runs games surprisingly well considering what it went through. </p>



<p>If the Xbox wasn’t in my bag at the time a lot more could have happened…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By way of a response, Xbox offered to send Brandon a new Xbox console. The images shown by Brandon reveal a bashed, beaten, and bruised console that amazingly still works just fine. They were uploaded alongside shots of a hoodie bearing signs of some serious road rash.</p>

<p>In the comments under the post on social media, some users started joking that PlayStation could never, and others recommended that GameStop should start listing consoles for sale with crash test ratings. </p>



<p>Many jokes are made about the Xbox Series S, especially those focused on the console’s performance, but at least we can say it’s at least structurally sound.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is out <strong>tomorrow</strong>, and it’s set to introduce a cultural shift in the hero shooter space, challenging the dominant position held by Overwatch 2 and snatching the attention away from Deadlock. Recently, the team at NetEase have been discussing how the game will work, revealing more characters and mechanics, further stoking the hype train.</p>



<p>One tidbit of information about how the game’s battle pass is going to work turned heads more than anything else, though.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-more-fomo">No More FOMO</h2>



<p>Typically, live-service games have seasonal battle passes that expire at the end of a given window, and thereafter, you’re prevented from unlocking any content you’ve missed and you’ll need to move on to the next season.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals is <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20241205/40954_1198123.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">going to challenge that</a> typical behaviour with a new mechanic: timeless battle passes.</p>



<p>When you purchase the ‘Luxury Battle Pass’, which is the paid version of the free battle pass, you’ll unlock the ability to redeem awards in said pass event after the season has ended. If you don’t dedicate enough time to the game to unlock the rewards in one season, they’ll roll over into the next, but you’ll be free to <strong>also </strong>move on to the next season if you desire.</p>



<p>That means that you won’t miss out on unlocking something <strong>far </strong>into the Luxury Battle Pass in Marvel Rivals just because you might not have the time to grind for it.</p>



<p>Not only that, but NetEase has recognised that the first season (or pre-season) of Marvel Rivals is going to be a shorter one, so they’ve reduced the price of the Luxury Battle Pass by 50% at launch.</p>



<p>Other developers have had their ways of addressing this ‘missing out’ issue. For instance, Bethesda Game Studios often offers ‘catch-up’ bundles in the Fallout 76 store, giving users the ability to catch up on missed rewards, but that comes with a hefty cost.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a good tactic that other developers should mirror? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/crimsix-optic-return-five-years/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crimsix-has-returned-to-optic-after-five-years-away.1052505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/crimsix-optic-return-five-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter has returned home, gravitating back to OpTic Gaming after a five-year hiatus. His Call of Duty career ended in 2022, and since then, he has become a successful racecar driver and iRacing creator. Following his departure from OpTic Gaming in 2019, Crimsix floated with a couple of organisations in the Call of Duty League but ultimately retired in September 2022.</p>



<p>In a seven-minute video posted on social media, OpTic welcomed back Crimsix, explaining why it’s such a natural decision to make all these years later.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-where-he-belongs">Back Where He Belongs</h2>



<p>Crimsix is part of the Call of Duty ‘dynasty’ represented by Scump, FormaL, Karma, and of course, the man himself. He’s the winningest Call of Duty player in the business, and his profile and abilities helped to spearhead the growth of the COD esports scene.</p>



<p>In 2022, he officially retired from Call of Duty and spun off into something completely different: racecars. Those who know Porter recognise his love for cars, and in the video posted by OpTic, he revealed that most of his income was spent in some way on cars, whether it be buying, maintaining, or upgrading them.</p>



<p>Speaking in <a href="https://x.com/OpTic/status/1864461424904302688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the video uploaded on Twitter</a>, OpTic’s CEO, Hector ‘HECZ’ Rodriguez said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s back to normal. Throughout the years, we’ve always kept in touch, he’s of my favourite players of all time, what he did for OpTic – it put us in a position to win every time.</p>



<p>I’ll always be appreciative of the time he spent here, so it was only right that when the time came for him to come back, after years of butting heads with FormaL, butting heads with Scump… </p>



<p>Bringing him back as we are is inevitable, he’s part of the family and he’ll always be part of the family.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Crimsix has been streaming plenty of Black Ops 6 during his downtime, and many have stressed that the former pro player still has the thumbs needed to win big, prompting plenty of long-time fans to demand his return to Call of Duty esports.</p>



<p>That’s not going to happen, though – but he does have a place back under the OpTic umbrella, and that’s worth celebrating.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see Crimsix back in OpTic? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-path-of-exile-2-be-free-to-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If Path of Exile 2 is free to play, then not only does it follow in the footsteps of the original ARPG, but it also shows the community’s willingness and trust in supporting the eagerly awaited follow-up. Making PoE 2 free would be a huge decision, so let’s dissect Grinding Gear Games’ strategy.</p>



<p>Free to play has become the norm over the last decade. I remember PS4’s Warframe being free to play, and I couldn’t wrap my head around the decision to make a AAA title free. Now, everyone’s doing it, and it’s because the business model is highly sustainable—<em>sometimes</em>. </p>



<p>Path of Exile 1 was released in 2013, it was free to play, and it worked like a charm. Now, in 2024, it’s sequel time, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-preload-path-of-exile-2-pre-download-guide-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a>‘s free-to-play status is one of the biggest questions.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-path-of-exile-2-be-free-to-play">Will Path of Exile 2 be Free to Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Keep your money to yourself. Credit to Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Path of Exile 2 is free to play</strong>, and like its predecessor, requires no money to play, and its main way of generating income is through <strong>optional microtransactions</strong>.</p>



<p>After years of supporting the first game, the developer decided it was time for a sequel. The acclaim and adulation PoE received meant it was entirely feasible for Grinding Gear Games to make PoE 2 a pay-to-play adventure. </p>



<p>Path of Exile continually gained in popularity after its release, and <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/238960" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Charts</a> shows PoE has barely dipped below 10,000 players a day on Steam since Jan. 2017. The numbers have regularly dipped into the 60K and 70K region—achieving <strong>76,501 concurrent players in Aug. 2024</strong>!</p>



<p>The developer clearly trusts the PoE community, so this is presumably why Path of Exile 2 is once again free to play. If you do intend to support PoE 2, various Supporter Packs are available to buy with the cheapest one offering 300 Points and an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-can-you-play-path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a> Key. </p>



<p>Conversely, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3349430/Path_of_Exile_2__King_of_the_Faridun_Supporter_Pack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">King of the Faridun Supporter Pack</a> includes the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>1000 Points.</li>



<li>A Hideout</li>



<li>A Portal Effect</li>



<li>Early Access to Path of Exile 2</li>



<li>Level-up Effect</li>
