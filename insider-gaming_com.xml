<p>Embark Studios has unveiled the slate of rewards coming later this month when the <strong>second </strong>expedition window opens in ARC Raiders. This is the mechanic that allows players to reset their account, going back to base and starting all over again with a ‘new’ character. It also yields exclusive unlocks, bonuses, and temporary buffs.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, what’s being unlocked the second time around isn’t amazing, which is proving to be a concern for the game’s die-hard fanbase.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-second-expedition-rewards-explained">ARC Raiders Second Expedition Rewards Explained</h2>



<p>On February 25th, the second <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/second-expedition-rewards-and-requirements">ARC Raiders Expedition</a> window will open, running until March 1st, when all Raiders participating in the event <strong>leave Speranza</strong>. The team at Embark Studios has made some major changes to how the Expedition works, based on feedback received from the community in recent weeks.</p>



<p>First, it will now cost way less to acquire the five extra skill points you get for leaving Speranza. Instead of one million credits per skill point, the requirement is now 600,000 credits per skill point. Additionally, if you missed the full allotment of bonus points during the first Expedition, you can now unlock those bonus skill points at a discounted rate of 300,000 credits per skill point.</p>



<p>That means if you did your Expedition last time with <strong>zero </strong>extra skill points, you can get <strong>TEN </strong>bonus points in February, provided you can rack up 4.5 million credits.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>With that being said, here are the other rewards waiting for you as the second Expedition rolls around:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Patchwork Outfit (Evolved)</li>



<li>Scrappy Cosmetics</li>



<li>The Expedition Indicator Icon (Upgraded)</li>



<li>24 extra Stash spaces</li>



<li>Bonus skill points</li>



<li>5 – 10% XP boost</li>



<li>6 – 12% Scrappy materials boost</li>



<li>60 – 70% Repair value increase</li>
</ul>



<p>The latter items are a range because you get <strong>a bigger boost </strong>if you’ve already completed your Expedition in December. If not, you get the <strong>lower </strong>end of the scale. It’ll face a consecutive boost <strong>again </strong>during the third Expedition, which should arrive in April.</p>



<p>Fans are disappointed that we don’t even get a new outfit for the second Expedition, just an ‘evolved’ one.</p>
