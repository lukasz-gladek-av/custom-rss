<p>For the third straight Major in a row, the most illustrious Counter-Strike 2 Major will feature a different active duty map pool. Valve announced today that the remade Train will replace Vertigo in time for the BLAST.tv Austin Major in April 2025.</p>



<p>With the next CS2 Major using this map pool, many are now expecting the in-game Premier pool and other official tournaments to swap in Train in place of Vertigo.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-the-line-for-vertigo">End of The Line for Vertigo</h2>



<p>Train officially returned to Counter-Strike, debuting for the first time in CS2, back in November 2024. The reworked map has been subjected to a complete visual overhaul (including a gorgeous rain effect when outdoors) and several major gameplay changes. Notably, both bombsites are now more open with less train car clutter, the Heaven area looking down on the A site is gone, and the “Popdog” ladder has been expanded to a long spiral staircase. The CS2 community as a whole has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/">eager</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">l</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/">y been waiting</a> for Train to come to CS2 for some time.</p>



<p>While Train’s arrival to the Active Duty map pool was inevitable, Valve has finally confirmed which map it will replace: Vertigo. At the professional level, outside of a couple of top North American teams, Vertigo has been one of the least played maps. According to statistics <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/maps?startDate=2024-01-01&amp;endDate=2024-12-31&amp;matchType=BigEvents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from HLTV</a>, it is the least played map at big events in 2024 other than Overpass, which was removed from the map pool during the year.</p>



<p>The only thing that remains unclear is when Train will officially be implemented in the in-game and other tournament map pools. The 2025 calendar for CS2 is set to officially begin just as week from now with BLAST Spring Bounty 2025. With the changes to the CS2 ecosystem, all big events will affect the global standings that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-confirms-cs2-major-expansion-and-rankings-based-invitations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">determine who is invited to the Major or its closed qualifiers</a>.</p>



<p>Is replacing Vertigo with Train the right move? Join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>AMD’s next generation of graphics cards are here as the company has officially unveiled its first RDNA 4 graphics cards, the Radeon RX 9000 series. The announcement came during the company’s press event at CES 2025.</p>



<p>The two new cards announced on Monday were the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070. </p>



<p>While the cards have been unveiled along with various partners, not much in terms of specs, specific release date, or pricing were revealed. AMD said that more information on RDNA 4 and the new cards will be announced later this quarter. </p>



<p>What was mentioned was that they would be available at some point during Q1 and feature the next-gen FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4). AMD says that the the cards feature a 4nm process, 2nd generation AI accelerators, and 3rd generation ray tracing accelerators. FSR 4 was also developed specifically for RDNA 4 cards, suggesting that older cards won’t have access to the feature.  That wasn’t confirmed, however.</p>



<p>The new cards, when released, will be available from AMD along with a number of partners such as Asrock, Gigabyte, Sapphire, ASUS, and more. In addition to the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070, AMD will be releasing RX 9060 series graphics cards as well. Information on those cards will also be coming at a later date.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-minor-1-bracket-revealed/</link>

<p>Activision has unveiled the bracket for the Call of Duty League’s first ‘Minor’, one of the new tournaments set up to make the CDL 2025 season feel much more dense. The Minor tournaments offer a stopgap between Majors, and while they have a much smaller prize pool, they’ll feature just as much excitement and skill from the players.</p>



<p>Minor tournaments are hosted online and feature a one-shot $20,000 prize for the ultimate victor.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-minor-win-major-effort">Minor Win, Major Effort</h2>



<p>The first CDL Minor will occur between January 10 and 12, and all twelve teams in the CDL are invited to participate. It’s a single-elimination tournament, which means every loss will knock one team out of the running for the $20,000 prize.</p>



<p>Here are the opening matches for the first CDL Minor tournament:</p>



<p><strong>Friday, Jan 10</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Los Angeles Guerillas M8 vs. Minnesota Rokkr</li>



<li>Atlanta FaZe vs. Miami Heretics</li>



<li>Vegas Falcons vs. OpTic Texas</li>



<li>Cloud9 New York vs. Vancouver Surge</li>
</ul>



<p>From there, Boston, Carolina Royal Ravens, Toronto Ultra, and LAT will all wait to see who their opponent will be, having earned a bye earlier in the qualifying rounds.</p>



<p>The action will wrap up on January 12 and the winner of the first-ever CDL Minor will be crowned after becoming $20,000 richer. </p>



<p>On Friday, January 17, the qualification matches for Major I recommence after the festive break. On January 30, the first European Major in CDL history will take place in Madrid, running until February 2. The pattern will continue until COD Champs, which is yet to be officially revealed but should take place in June or July this year.</p>



<p>It’s widely believed that this year’s Call of Duty League Championship will take place in Canada.</p>



<p>It’s an exciting time to be a Call of Duty esports fan. What are you most looking forward to from this season?</p>
