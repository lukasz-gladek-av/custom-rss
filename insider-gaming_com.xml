<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Free Title Update 4 lands on December 16, 2025, introducing a new Elder Dragon, new equipment, features, events, and more. </p>



<p>Capcom had announced a Monster Hunter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-showcase-announced-for-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Showcase</a> earlier this week, which was not only going to take us through the details of title update 4 for MH Wilds, but also new information on MH Stories 3: Twisted Reflection.

There’s new Armor Transcendence as well, allowing hunters to upgrade their HR 100+ armours even further.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Update Fixes Some Out-of-Bounds Map Exploits]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-update-patch-notes/</link>
            <guid>1379389</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has published a new update in ARC Raiders, one that addresses some of the most critical concerns players have about the game. In recent weeks, the patches pushed out by Embark Studios have been appreciated, but they’ve been firefighting some pesky issues that have made some player experiences fairly miserable.</p>



<p>The biggest concern has been around the game’s worst players glitching through walls or using ziplines to get out of the map in places, sometimes making them impervious to damage while being able to take down other players.</p>



<p>This patch addresses some of those issues.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-patch-notes-december-11">ARC Raiders Patch Notes – December 11</h2>



<p>The latest ARC Raiders patch was summarized by Embark Studios <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1999060771125248006">on social media</a>. It’s a small change, but one that might prove to be quite mighty:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Time to restart your client, there’s a new update rolling out! </p>



<ul>
<li><em>Removed zipline out-of-bounds exploit on Stella Montis</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed vaulting bug on Blue Gate</em></li>



<li><em>Corrected material issues affecting bullet/blocking &amp; ARC vision</em></li>



<li><em>Closed gap in Spaceport Launch Tower wall.</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>Patch Cadence Update:</p>



<p>Going forward, updates and store rotations will move to Tuesdays, and will not be on a weekly cadence. With the holidays approaching, the team are taking a much needed break to rest and recover, returning in January with more exciting updates. </p>



<p>We’ll continue to monitor and work on critical issues during this time, but for now… </p>



<p>Get ready for the Cold Snap update next Tuesday, packed with fixes and new content!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans were quick to comment about the other outstanding issues under the post, such as the broken Trophies on PlayStation 5, which are preventing some users from hitting 100% completion of the game. In a title where a completionist attitude is front and centre, this is understandably quite irritating.</p>

<p>A significant drop in Nintendo’s share price on Wednesday wiped billions from the company’s value, amid growing concern over the surging price of components and memory chips.</p>



<p>Nintendo’s share value dropped as much as 4.7 per cent on December 10, with the surging prices and shortages of key components, including memory chips, playing a major role.</p>











<figure><figcaption>Rising. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/nintendo-sheds-14-billion-value-after-chip-squeeze-fears-grow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reports</a> the drop in Nintendo’s share prices is the biggest since May, citing market intelligence firm TrendForce in stating that the price Nintendo has to pay for 12 GB RAM in the Switch 2 has jumped 41 per cent.</p>



<p>In December, Nintendo’s shares have declined in seven of eight trading days, wiping around $14bn of value from the company, and the concern is that it could get worse.</p>



<p>While the Switch 2 has enjoyed an extremely popular launch period, aided by the releases of the likes of Mario Kart: World, the component situation in the market is becoming extremely problematic for Nintendo and other developers.</p>



<p>Nintendo may be forced to adjust prices for the Switch 2 console, with Dell and HP among those to have already warned that price rises could be on the cards in 2026.</p>



<p>With the large storage sizes of some of the biggest games, many players have sought to purchase additional storage for their devices, but the prices of those add-ons are already increasing.</p>



<p>In a market that is extremely sensitive to price increases, as shown by the backlash earlier this year to increases to an Xbox Game Pass subscription, it creates a worrying period for Nintendo and other console-building companies.</p>

<p>That’s not a title you likely thought you’d read today, but it’s true. In a post on social media under a recent Embark Studios message, Elon Musk suggested a major change that could alter the core combat mechanics in ARC Raiders, the electrifying extraction adventure title released on October 30.</p>



<p>Elon Musk is a well-documented gamer who has participated in live streams on his X platform, but earlier this year, he openly admitted to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-cheated-diablo-poe-admit/">‘cheating’ in games</a> like Diablo and Path of Exile.</p>



<p>What does Elon Musk want to change in ARC Raiders?</p>







<h2 id="h-elon-wants-to-hunt-people">Elon Wants to Hunt People</h2>



<p>In his post on social media, Elon Musk, the eccentric entrepreneur and super-billionaire, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Good game. </p>



<p>A way to hunt players who have betrayed you would be 🔥🔥</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This gels with the recent arrival of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-watchlist-set-up-unfriendly-players/">a satirical ‘Speranza Watchlist’</a> that players could use to identify griefers and other abusive players in ARC Raiders. It was powered entirely by fake data, but it was humorous enough to get fans interested for a while about the concept of naming and shaming some of ARC Raiders’ more troublesome users.</p>



<p>Elon’s comment landed under a post from Embark Studios requesting feedback from the community regarding the ARC Raiders map pool. Of the five maps released thus far, a diverse array of opportunities is presented, but the environments available aren’t without their fair share of issues.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📡 Attention Raiders!<br>You’ve explored the world of ARC Raiders, and we want to know what you think of it!<br>We know that YOU, the player, are best placed to offer valuable feedback and suggestions on the game, so we’d like to kick off the conversation by asking for your thoughts… <a href="https://t.co/NssN9zV7E0">pic.twitter.com/NssN9zV7E0</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1998800164090515586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Most notably, fans of the extraction adventure are still complaining about the exploits that allow players to phase through walls on certain maps.</p>



<p>In the past, Elon Musk has spoken about Elden Ring, Mass Effect, Diablo IV, Civilization, and BioShock, amongst others. He’s a self-professed ‘living god of video games’ and has boasted about being a ‘top Quake player’ in his youth, carrying on his love for gaming as an adult and one of the richest people on Earth.</p>







<p>Are you surprised that Elon Musk is a fan of a game where an AI-driven robotic race oppresses humans everywhere? Let us know what you think about this story on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
