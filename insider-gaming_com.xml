<p>The latest Escape from Tarkov patch has brought snow back for the first time in almost a year. The next time you load Escape from Tarkov, you’ll be prompted to install an update, and this is the winter update that brings crunchy, crispy snow back to Norvinsk.</p>



<p>In addition, multiple fixes were issued for some critical bugs plaguing Escape from Tarkov players. Get the full list below.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-most-wonderful-time-of-the-year">The Most Wonderful Time of the Year</h2>



<p>As the festive window approaches, snow has started falling in Escape from Tarkov, blanketing the game in a layer of crisp white that makes almost all outfits useless, strips foliage from every map, and deafens players using loud headsets.</p>



<p>The team at Battlestate Games rolled out the latest patch earlier today, which includes snow, along with a bunch of bug fixes and changes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed the loading wheel icon showing throughout the starting mission;</li>



<li>Fixed the camera lock and character movement lock that occurred when using consumable items before the second cutscene on Terminal</li>



<li>Fixed the inability to complete a specific task in the Batya story chapter in PvE mode</li>



<li>Fixed the lock for weapon operations and looting that occurred after looting a character that got killed while using a stationary weapon</li>



<li>Fixed the abrupt interruption of consumable item animations in certain cases</li>



<li>Fixed the incorrect spawn points for Zryachiy and his guards on Lighthouse</li>



<li>Fixed the audio artifacts when quickly skipping trader dialogue lines</li>



<li>Fixed the item icon display issues when trading while using active filters</li>



<li>Smoothed out the BTR movement</li>



<li>Fixed the incorrect message layout in the Messages tab</li>



<li>Fixed several localization errors</li>



<li>Fixed several visual geometry bugs across all locations</li>



<li>Fixed several interface issues</li>
</ul>



<p>Battlestate Games has been firefighting a little since Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update was released on November 15. The supersized overhaul introduced a string of issues that are slowly being addressed, but it’s often like fighting a hydra. As soon as they patch another bug, two more pop up.</p>



<p>Such is life.</p>
