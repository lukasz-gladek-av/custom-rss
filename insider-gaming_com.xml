            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a reversal of plans, Activision has announced that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won’t allow weapons, operators, or operator skins to carry forward from Black Ops 6. </p>



<p>In a community update posted on Tuesday, Activision says that it has seen the discussion about “the identity of Call of Duty”.</p>



<p><strong>“Some of you have said we’ve drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded,” </strong><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said</a>. <strong>“That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you.”</strong></p>



<p>The publisher continues to say that developers Treyarch and Raven’s “north star” is to bring players a true spiritual successor to Black Ops 2. Because of that comes the decision to remove carry forward options. The publisher says the decision was ultimately made in order make Black Ops 7 <strong>“feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting.”</strong></p>



<p>Now, wanting to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-content-will-no-longer-carry-forward-into-black-ops-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep things authentic</a> to the new game is understandable, but there’s one problem: they’ve kind of said this before.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-this-isn-t-the-first-time">This isn’t the first time</h2>



<p>Ahead of the release of Black Ops 6, Activision <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-order-benefits-game-editions#Content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced that content</a> from Modern Warfare 2 and 3 wouldn’t carry forward to the new game. At the time, they said that it was done to allow players to <strong>“experience the Black Ops universe the way it’s meant to be played.”</strong></p>



<p>Again, it’s understandable. But then, it only took a few months before Black Ops 6 became filled with operators and skins such as Beavis and Butt-head, Jay and Silent Bob, Stan Smith, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and more. All done in the name of, apparently, “keeping that signature Black Ops style.” </p>



<p>To give credit, reports did surface earlier this year that Activision was aware that certain skins <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-skins-make-game-look-stupid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the game “look stupid”</a>. Still, after that report, more skins like the American Dad crossover came out, continuing the trend.</p>



<p>Recently, our Tom Henderson wrote about Call of Duty executives <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not being worried</a> about the competition from EA’s Battlefield 6. Sources told Henderson that many at the top believe Call of Duty is “too big to fail”. While that might be true in a sense, it seems that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaction and interest</a> in Battlefield 6—along with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/this-made-me-pre-order-battlefield-6-fans-react-to-black-ops-7-gameplay-trailer/">the negative reactions</a> to the Black Ops 6 reveal—has changed some thoughts.</p>



<p>You’d like to think that Activision truly has listened to the community regarding the over-the-top nature of some of the operators and skins that have made their way to Call of Duty in recent years. But, then again, if these crossovers are going to continue to print money for Activision and Microsoft, how long until they pick up again with Black Ops 7? History suggests players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BlackOps7Skins-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t have to wait long</a> to find out.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-bloober-wants-to-conquer-the-world-again.1281147/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bloober Team’s journey could easily be the plot of a Hollywood film. Since the release of Layers of Fear in 2016, the Polish studio has experienced a rollercoaster of hits and misses, often delivering titles that were met with mixed reactions from both players and critics.</p>



<p>But everything changed in 2024 with the launch of Silent Hill 2 Remake. Bloober nailed it—reviving one of the most iconic survival horror games with a fresh yet respectful approach. The remake’s success catapulted the studio’s reputation, establishing them as true craftsmen of psychological horror. Naturally, expectations for their next original IP, Cronos: The New Dawn, skyrocketed.</p>



<p>Thanks to an invitation from Bloober Team, I had the chance to play the first 30 minutes of the game during a hands-on demo at Gamescom 2025—and I couldn’t be more impressed.</p>



<h2 id="h-cronos-the-new-dawn-preview-meet-the-traveler">Cronos: The New Dawn Preview – Meet the Traveler</h2>



<p>In Cronos: The New Dawn, you play as the Traveler—a kind of soldier dispatched by an entity known as the Collective to a bleak future. Your mission? Travel back to 1980s Poland and rescue select individuals from a catastrophic event.</p>



<p>The opening moments are intentionally cryptic. Who are the Travelers? What is the Collective’s true role? And what exactly caused the event? The game throws these questions at you, trusting the narrative to unravel them gradually.</p>



<p>During my session, I came across several collectibles that added depth to the world and enriched the immersive storytelling Bloober is known for. Surprisingly, the combat reminded me a lot of <em>Dead Space</em>—in the best way possible.</p>



<p>The Traveler starts off equipped with a pistol capable of two firing modes: a standard shot and a charged blast that deals heavy damage and can interrupt enemy charges.</p>



<p>Ammo is scarce, so melee combat becomes essential. You can punch enemies to create space and escape quickly—especially since their reaction time is fast. One standout mechanic is “fusion”: if a living enemy reaches the corpses of two fallen foes, it can merge with them, becoming faster and more powerful. To prevent this, the Traveler can deploy a flame cylinder that burns bodies on the ground.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Deixar os inimigos se fundirem resulta em grandes problemas</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-intuition-and-isolation">Intuition and Isolation</h2>



<p>I don’t usually play survival horror games, but <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> made me reconsider—largely thanks to its smart level design. Exploration, environmental puzzles, and progression are all intuitive and never frustrating. With a bit of attention, even genre newcomers can navigate the world with ease.</p>



<p>The intuitive design is paired with a haunting sense of isolation. Cold color palettes dominate the environments, reinforcing the feeling of desolation. The world has ended—and chaos is all that remains. Complementing the visuals are eerie sound effects and a retrofuturistic soundtrack that blends synthetic tones with organic instruments.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-can-bloober-do-it-again">Can Bloober Do It Again?</h2>



<p>By the end of the demo, I didn’t want to stop playing. The immersive atmosphere, the unanswered questions, and the brutal, strategic combat left me eager for more. Based on what I played, Cronos: The New Dawn is shaping up to be another major win for Bloober Team.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we won’t need to wait long to see if the final game is great or not. <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> launches on September 5th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/davy-x-jones-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/davy-x-jones-hands-on-preview-a-new-take-on-the-pirate-legend.1281087/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At Gamescom 2025, I had the opportunity to try out Davy X Jones, the latest IP from Polish studio Parasight, thanks to a special invite. Right from the start, it’s clear the team has a passion for reimagining legendary figures from human history—always with their own unique twist.</p>



<p>Their previous title, Blacktail, retold the tale of Yaga (yes, Baba Yaga) through Parasight’s narrative lens. In Davy X Jones, as the name suggests, we step into the boots of the infamous Davy Jones, who’s on a revenge-fueled quest against Blackbeard. After being killed, Davy’s head is separated from his body—creating a bizarre but brilliant duo of protagonists.</p>



<p>This split isn’t just for laughs (though the banter between head and body is genuinely funny); it also plays a key role in gameplay. The head performs specific actions, like devouring orbs that restore health, adding a clever layer to combat and exploration.</p>



<p>Speaking of combat, it channels the frantic energy of the DOOM franchise. Each of Jones’s arms wields a weapon—a bladed hook and a pistol. While the ranged mechanics felt solid, the melee system could use some refinement. At times, hits lacked impact. Thankfully, the game still has time to polish things up, thanks to the early access launch plan.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>One thing that caught me off guard was the difficulty. You need to stay on the move constantly, dodging and parrying enemy projectiles—or you’ll be dead in a few hits. Sadly, the demo didn’t include any scenes with Abby, the whale-ship that serves as the game’s hub and crew management area.</p>



<p>Progression systems weren’t showcased either, so I didn’t get a taste of how character upgrades or gear improvements work. Still, I walked away impressed. Having played Parasight’s previous work, I can confidently say Davy X Jones feels more refined across the board—even in its pre-release state. I’ll definitely be diving into early access when it drops on August 28.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042 is Going Nuts As Fans Wait For Battlefield 6 to Release]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-going-nuts-as-fans-wait-for-battlefield-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-2042-is-going-nuts-as-fans-wait-for-battlefield-6-to-release.1281036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 beta ended far too long ago already, and fans are chomping at the bit for more fast-paced, destructive action. Instead of waiting until October 10 to get their hands on Battlefield 6, hundreds of thousands of players are pouring into Battlefield 2042, sending the game rocketing back up the sales charts almost four years after launch.</p>



<p>Battlefield 2042 was a rocky title from day one, and for a while, it threatened to bring about the ‘end’ of the franchise. It has been a dark few years for Battlefield fans, and while Battlefield 6 is expected to be the savior of the series, Battlefield 2042 is finally getting a long-awaited moment in the sun.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-2042-player-count-soars">Battlefield 2042 Player Count Soars</h2>



<p>Battlefield 2042 recently leapt up the charts on Steam, rocketing to 75,000 peak concurrent players and rivalling other top-tier shooters thanks to a) Battlefield 6 hype, and b) a staggering sale that dropped the game to record-low prices.</p>



<p>It was the highest peak player count Battlefield 2042 had secured on Steam <strong>since launch</strong>, provided you don’t count the free weekend in October 2023 that saw the game land 107,376 concurrent players.</p>



<figure><figcaption>That peak is really something (Source: SteamDB)</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s safe to assume similar numbers are circulating on other platforms, particularly as Battlefield 6 draws ever closer.</p>



<p>In the most recent release of the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a> newsletter, Battlefield 2042’s growth was studied by the team:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Battlefield 2042 <strong>sold almost 500,000 on Steam </strong>last week. While the hype for the imminent Battlefield 6 explains part of this, the real reason for its spike is a HUGE price drop, -95% to $2.99, its cheapest price yet on Steam.</p>



<p>EA often does massive fire sales like this on its legacy titles to give it revenues a boost ahead of its financials. The $1.4 million in Steam revenues from Battlefield alone is nothing to sniff at. Expect more at the end of Q3.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What’s sad is that folks will be pouring into Battlefield 2042, perhaps expecting a similar experience to Battlefield 6, which many would have recently run through when the open beta was live. What they’ll be getting isn’t <strong>bad</strong>, but it’s not a patch on Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Have you jumped into Battlefield 2042 in anticipation of Battlefield 6? Or did you pick it up just because it’s cheap? Either way, let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
