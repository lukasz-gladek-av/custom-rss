<p>IllFonic, the developers behind Friday the 13th: The Game and Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game, have announced that its the latest studio to hold layoffs in 2024.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/IllFonic/status/1864369606988632330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, CEO and co-founder Charles Brungardt said that the layoffs are an acceptance of the “harsh reality” within the games industry.</p>



<p>“Today we had to accept the harsh reality that the state of the industry has impacted us here at IllFonic,” he said. “It is with the heaviest of hearts that cuts to our teams had to be made today as we re-aligned to a refined strategy.”</p>







<p>In addition to developing its own games, Illfonic has provided support development for games like Crysis 3 and Star Citizen. Coincidentally enough, the latter’s developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloud-imperium-games-layoffs-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud Imperium Games recently held</a> its own layoffs.</p>



<p>There was no specific mention of how many people have been let go. According to <a href="https://leadiq.com/c/illfonic/5a1da50f2300005a0097c01e#:~:text=As%20of%20October%202024%2C%20IllFonic,including%20North%20AmericaEuropeAsia." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LeadIQ</a>, Illfonic employed 96 people as of October 2024.</p>



<p>To close his statement, Brungardt requested that those with openings reach out to him in order to help place those who have lost their jobs.</p>



<p>The gaming industry has seen&nbsp;<a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 14,600 confirmed jobs</a>&nbsp;lost across 170+ companies in 2024. Based on Insider Gaming sources, the real number — including unannounced layoffs — totals over 16,000.</p>

<p>PlayStation and Gran Turismo developer Polyphony Digital announced a new GT game out of nowhere for the holiday season. Find out everything we know about My First Gran Turismo—including its release date—and why it’s one of the most unique entries in the franchise.</p>



<p>A fun surprise never goes amiss, and I’d say My First Gran Turismo falls under this category. PlayStation fans have been reveling in the splendor of Gran Turismo 7 since 2022 and its continuous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gran-turismo-7-update-brings-new-cars-and-updated-physics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content updates</a>. The most recent installment offers the most realistic graphics today, an exhaustive selection of vehicles from world-class bangers to piddly starter cars, and enough racing content to keep you busy throughout an entire Le Mans 24-Hour race. </p>



<p>Now, we have My First Gran Turismo, and it is an odd title. I’ll let you in on a secret, there’s a reason Polyphony Digital went with this wording; so let’s lift the suspension and burn some rubber.</p>



<h2 id="h-my-first-gran-turismo-release-date">My First Gran Turismo Release Date</h2>

<p><strong>My First Gran Turismo has a Dec. 6 release date, with the content expected to drop at 12:00 AM local time—subject to change.</strong></p>



<p>The release date and time were confirmed by a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/04/my-first-gran-turismo-launches-on-ps5-and-ps4-december-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sony PlayStation blog</a>. So, unless something happens between now and the launch window, prepare yourself for high-octane action on Dec. 6.</p>

<li>In the search bar, type in “My First Gran Turismo.”</li>



<li>Click on the <strong>My First Gran Turismo</strong> product option.</li>



<li>Press to download the software—if it says “Add to wishlist,” it means the game isn’t ready to download yet.</li>



<li>Once it has been downloaded, you are ready to jump in and try My First Gran Turismo for yourself!</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-is-my-first-gran-turismo-free-to-play">Is My First Gran Turismo free to play?</h2>

<p>No money is required to play, so sit back, download it, and experience the unbridled authenticity of peak, simulated racing.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-my-first-gran-turismo">What is My First Gran Turismo?</h2>



<p><strong>You can describe My First Gran Turismo as a free-to-play demo of Gran Turismo 7</strong> as it features cars, tracks, and races taken directly from the original.</p>



<p>Here are the key details you should know about its contents and what it offers:</p>
