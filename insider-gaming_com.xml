<p>If you’ve pre-ordered STALKER 2 or bought a higher edition, you’ll have learned that you’re able to unlock a series of unique weapons and outfits as you explore the game. However, it’s not immediately available where to find pre-order items in STALKER 2, which can leave you feeling confused.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll help you figure out where to get your pre-order bonus in STALKER 2.</p>



<p>Read on!</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-pre-order-items-in-stalker-2">How To Get Pre-Order Items in STALKER 2</h2>



<p>If you’re trying to figure out where to find your pre-order items in STALKER 2, you’ll need to follow a particular quest that’ll take you all over The Zone.</p>



<p>It’s called Seek, And You Shall Find, and it’s started after you complete ‘A Needle in a Haystack’ in Zalissya, the first major settlement you find in the Lesser Zone. The quest you need will be started once you’ve picked up a flash drive left in your stash by a mysterious individual.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can track down the white, single-storey building and find the PDA jammed between two beds to kickstart the quest.</p>



<p>Once you’ve activated Seek, And You Shall Find, you’ll notice that a string of stash locations have been added to the map on your PDA. If you head to each location, you’ll be rewarded with an exclusive weapon or outfit – these are the pre-order items in STALKER 2.</p>



<p>They’re also what you’ll receive for buying the Ultimate or Deluxe editions of the game.</p>



<p>There’s at least one Journalist Stash in each area of the map, and almost all of them require a little snooping to find. Perhaps you’ll need to find your way around a locked door or up onto a building, but they’re all relatively accessible and with a little common sense, you’ll have them tracked down in no time.</p>



<p>It’s not immediately obvious, but that’s where to get your pre-order bonus in STALKER 2. It takes a little work and a lot of walking, but as you’ll naturally explore The Zone on your travels, you can work passively to tick them off as and when you get near them.</p>



<p>That’s where to find pre-order items in STALKER 2 – happy hunting! Stop by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> if you want to chat about the game.</p>
