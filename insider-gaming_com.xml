<p>A new report has claimed that long-awaited PlayStation 5 version of Starfield will be releasing in April 2026.</p>



<p>That’s according to a new report from <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/398522/potwierdzamy-starfield-na-ps5-premiera-za-rowne-dwa-miesiace.html" type="link" id="https://www.ppe.pl/news/398522/potwierdzamy-starfield-na-ps5-premiera-za-rowne-dwa-miesiace.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PPE</a>, which obtained internal documentation from a video game distributor revealing that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2026-update-rumoured-to-bring-quicker-space-flights-ps5-switch-2-ports-and-more/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2026-update-rumoured-to-bring-quicker-space-flights-ps5-switch-2-ports-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield is scheduled to launch on the PlayStation 5</a> on April 7, 2026.</p>



<p>While not confirmed in the report, it’s likely that the PlayStation 5 release will be a part of the long-awaited ‘Starfield 2.0’ update, which was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2-0-could-be-real-after-all/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2-0-could-be-real-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shown to the press a few months ago</a>.</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that PPE has had a good track record of leaking information related to physical game releases, however yesterday’s Take-Two Interactive call debunked their claims that GTA 6 would avoid physical game releases on launch.</p>



<p>That being said, PPE did provide a screenshot of what appears to be an internal system, showing that Starfield is going to release on April 7.</p>



<p>It isn’t quite clear what the update will bring, but according to rumours, Starfield’s massive update is set to deliver a major overhaul to the game, in addition to its second major expansion, ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terran Armada</a>‘.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear whether the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-next-year/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumoured Switch 2 version</a> of the game will also release at the same time. <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/02/04/exclusive-microsoft-plans-starfield-launch-for-playstation-5/" type="link" id="https://xboxera.com/2024/02/04/exclusive-microsoft-plans-starfield-launch-for-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a> was the first to report on a planned Starfield version for the PlayStation 5 in February 2024.</p>

<p>Memory shortages aren’t going to impact PS5 stock at least until the holiday season of 2026. </p>



<p>The shortages and rising costs of memory have the entire community worried about how these changes will affect prices. AMD has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-reportedly-raising-graphics-card-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already begun raising GPU prices</a>, NVIDIA has discontinued GPUs, and Nintendo stated it will “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-will-carefully-evaluate-switch-2-price-increase-as-memory-costs-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carefully evaluate</a>” the situation. Now, Sony has revealed their strategy for the PS5. </p>







<h2 id="h-ps5-stock-safe-for-holiday-2026-as-sony-secures-required-ram">PS5 Stock Safe For Holiday 2026 as Sony Secures Required RAM</h2>



<p>According to a post by Genki_JPN on <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/2019330491225375186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Sony’s CFO Lin Tao recently discussed the issues related to PS5 stock and memory shortages. Tao announced that the minimum amount of memory needed to maintain PS5 stock levels until the end of the holiday season in 2026 has been secured. She also shared strategies to tackle the RAM shortage.</p>



<p>Tao mentioned that negotiations with suppliers will continue. To minimize the impact of rising RAM costs, they are considering two strategies. First, they will prioritize monetizing their current install base. Second, they plan to further expand their revenue from software and network services.</p>



<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/2019336563264762156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">indicated</a> that PS5 sales are declining in the latter half of its life cycle; however, software revenue from the PlayStation Store has reached a record high, largely due to major third-party franchises and new hit releases.</p>







<p>In other news, memory and storage shortages have also <span>led Valve to&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-revisiting-steam-machine-pricing-due-to-ram-market-volatility/" target="_blank">reassess the pricing of</a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-revisiting-steam-machine-pricing-due-to-ram-market-volatility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the Steam Machine</a>.

            <guid>1426258</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony’s CFO has revealed that Ghost of Yotei’s sales have performed better than those of Tsushima in the same period. </p>



<p>One of the biggest releases for Sony PlayStation this year was Ghost of Yotei, the highly anticipated sequel to Sucker Punch’s 2020 hit, Ghost of Tsushima. Sony had confirmed that the title sold 3.3 million copies in the first month, and the budget was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yoteis-budget-is-very-similar-to-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very similar</a> to the previous title. Now we know that the latest instalment is also performing better. </p>







<h2 id="h-ghost-of-yotei-sold-better-than-tsushima-in-the-same-period">Ghost of Yotei Sold Better than Tsushima in the Same Period</h2>



<p>Sony CFO Lin Tao’s comments on Ghost of Yotei sales were revealed through an <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/2019316878162948307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter) by Genki_JPN. Tao stated that Yotei was a “tentpole title” released in 2025 and “exceeded the sales of the previous title in the same period of time.” Sucker Punch’s latest instalment also contributed “significantly” to the financial results of the latest quarter. </p>



<p>Ghost of Yotei was released on October 2, 2025, for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38">PlayStation 5</a> and PlayStation 5 Pro. We have yet to receive an announcement for a PC version, which could help boost the sales event further. Yotei has been out for a little over 4 months, and its performance during this period has been better than Tsushima’s. No sales figures were revealed. </p>



<p>What else could help boost the sales is a DLC for the title, and the developers have already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-ghost-of-yotei-possible-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned a potential expansion</a>. It just depends on whether they feel players really want to know more about a particular relationship or story element in the game. </p>







<p>In other news, Sucker Punch could work on a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-could-make-new-sly-cooper-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sly Cooper or Infamous</a> game next. Additionally, here are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-best-games-like-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 games</a> like Yotei you can play after finishing it.

            <title><![CDATA[When Will Fortnite Servers Be Back Up? Fortnite February 5 Downtime, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-servers-downtime-february-5/</link>
            <guid>1426201</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite players around the world have been locked out of the game on February 5 as Epic Games deploys the latest update to the title, with players impatiently waiting for the Fortnite servers to be back up.</p>



<p>After a huge South Park collab in January, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> behemoth is entering a new month with a fresh drop of content, keeping the game alive until the next major seasonal change early in March.</p>



<p>For all the details on the Fortnite downtime and everything coming in the February 5 update, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-servers-be-back-up">When Will Fortnite Servers Be Back Up?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New content. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite Servers are down for several hours for the update on February 5, and there is no confirmed time of their return. However, previous updates indicate how long players need to wait.</strong></p>



<p>Server downtime in mid-season updates typically lasts for three to four hours, which means that the Fortnite servers should be back up after the v39.40 update somewhere between 2 AM PT and 2 AM ET.</p>



<p>However, downtime can be longer if issues are discovered or if there is a larger patch to deploy, and social media is the best place to keep track of the server status.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-fortnite-february-5-update">What’s In The Fortnite February 5 Update?</h2>



<p><strong>The biggest addition in the February 5 update in Fortnite is the start of a new Fortnite Festival season, with Chappell Roan as the headline act.</strong></p>



<p>After plenty of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festivals-next-major-collab-may-have-been-found/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks and rumors</a>, her inclusion as the star of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-season-13-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Festival Season 13</a> was revealed by Epic Games, and the new season, of course, means a new Festival Pass to progress through.</p>



<p>In the Battle Royale scene, the South Park collab has now completed, with the Born in Chaos Mini Pass expiring. Unfortunately, if you didn’t complete the pass, those free rewards are now unavailable, though they could return to the Item Shop for purchase in the future.</p>



<p>The Valentine’s Day event is also set to be added, though the dates for its duration are not yet confirmed, and there’s a slew of big collabs coming to the Item Shop, including the second wave of KPop Demon Hunters and two character skins from Marvel Rivals; Magik and Luna Snow.</p>
