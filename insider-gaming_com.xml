<p>If you’ve ever played a Fallout game (since Fallout 3), you’ll know what we mean by ‘VATS’. It’s the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, the handy mechanic that allows users to pause or slow down time, target their enemies more specifically, and wreak accurate havoc mid-battle.</p>



<p>The iconic feature is a staple of the Fallout franchise and has been featured in every game since 2008’s Fallout 3. However, there was a time before the game launched all those years ago that the mechanic was doubted, and it was almost <strong>canned </strong>before it would have had a chance to thrive.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-might-never-have-had-vats">Fallout Might Never Have Had VATS</h2>



<p>In a recent interview, Bethesda Game Studios’ Istvan Pely, who provided lead artistic services across Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, dropped a bombshell. He said that before Fallout 3 came out, the concept of VATS surfaced and was almost scrapped before it made it into the final product.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The studio had to provide that we could pull off a totally different genre, the opposite of fantasy.</p>



<p>We had to work out how your characters abilities would factor into your ability to shoot. Your skills aren’t good, so when you shoot at things, you’re missing – but does that feel good?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then leaned into the topic of VATS:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There was a long period where it was like, ‘Is this even fun? Is this worth doing at all? Is anyone even going to use this?’</p>



<p>Bethesda only just got it working in time to ship the entire game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was revealed in the interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-3s-iconic-vats-system-almost-didnt-make-it-into-the-rpg-in-time-and-bethesda-was-worried-no-one-would-even-want-to-use-it-is-this-even-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EDGE magazine</a> that the biggest issues were camera positioning and avoiding clipping and object disruption when VATS was triggered in-game. It all came together in the end, but it wasn’t without intense effort.</p>



<p>Today, VATS is part and parcel of the Fallout experience. In Fallout 76, the popular MMORPG released in 2018, VATS ‘builds’ are hugely important for players, and there are several advantages to basing your entire character layout on the targeting mechanic.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elder Scrolls Online Gets Paid Battle Pass System 12 Years After Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-online-battle-pass-system-after-launch/</link>
            <guid>1400206</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Elder Scrolls Online players everywhere are digesting the recent news regarding the imminent arrival of the game’s <strong>first paid battle pass systems </strong>in more than <em>a decade</em>. The recent revelation regarding ‘Tamriel Tomes’ follows the developers admitting the popular MMORPG had become stale and too ‘predictable’.</p>



<p>The answer to that is to shake up the delivery of content, cosmetics, unlocks, and exclusive rewards via ‘Tamriel Tomes’. This new battle pass system follows the traditional model of having both a free and paid-for version, and it seems like each is bursting with rewards, but not all players are happy.</p>











<p>In a recent<a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/69141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> super-sized blog post</a>, the team at ZeniMax Online Studios explained the major changes coming to Elder Scrolls Online. The multi-million-user fantasy MMO surfaced in 2014 and has become a cash cow of a product since then, but that concept is about to be broadened by this new battle pass mechanic.</p>



<p>On April 2, 2026, the first Tamriel Tome (read: battle pass) will arrive, dubbed the <strong>Tome of Dawn and Dusk</strong>.</p>



<p>There will be a paid and free version of the Tome, and ZeniMax has promised that plenty of goodies, including free in-game currency, will be unlockable via the <strong>free version</strong>. The premium version of the Tamriel Tome will unlock more exclusive rewards but won’t offer players any advantage beyond better cosmetics.</p>



<p>As you can imagine, you’ll pass through the pages of the Tamriel Tome, unlock rewards as you go, and eventually complete every tier by ticking off in-game events, challenges, and special, seasonal LTMs.</p>



<p>In addition to cosmetics, the Tamriel Tomes grant players:</p>



<ul>
<li>Consumables (research scrolls, gear upgrade kits…)</li>



<li>Currencies (Gold Coast Bazaar Trade Bars, Seals…)</li>



<li>Collectibles (weapon and skill styles, furnishings…)</li>
</ul>



<p>Endeavours and Daily Login Rewards are being <strong>removed </strong>from Elder Scrolls Online in ‘Season Zero’, with most of those rewards being ported into the battle pass system. For those unclear on the topic, the ‘Gold Coast Bazaar Trade Bars’ mentioned above are also new. It’s a type of currency that you can earn and spend in an exclusive Gold Coast Bazaar Store to purchase <strong>only </strong>Tamriel Tomes items.</p>



<p>ZeniMax was quick to outline how ESO Plus members benefit further from the battle pass system. This premium subscription service has run for several years, and it’s not being forgotten with this new feature.</p>



<p>Those with ESO Plus can earn Tome Points at a boosted rate, plus they’ll earn Tome Points and Premium Tome Tokens <strong>for free </strong>based on their membership purchases. With a long enough membership, ESO Plus users can effectively get free Premium Tamriel Tomes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders is ‘Worse Than Call of Duty’ For Cheaters, Streamers Say]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/</link>
            <guid>1400191</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has a nasty issue that’s bubbling in the shadows, and it concerns cheaters finding their place in the game and ruining the fun for legitimate players. It’s not a widespread issue at present, but it’s bad enough that the game’s biggest streamers have voiced their concerns in the last few days.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever run around outside Speranza and found yourself the victim of a dubious death, you’re likely not alone. While Embark Studios has promised to work on these issues in the short-term, the PR damage is being done by streamers slamming the game on social media.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-have-a-cheater-problem">Does ARC Raiders Have a Cheater Problem?</h2>



<p>The recent spate of complaints regarding ARC Raiders’ apparent cheater problem was kicked off in earnest by Nadeshot. He posted something of an essay on social media complaining about the deep-rooted cheater-based plague impacting ARC Raiders, one of his favorite games in recent years.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Nadeshot/status/2007926647295492467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">He wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The egregious amount of cheating genuinely might be worse than peak Call of Duty. I’m not trying to bring negativity to the game because I know this type of dialogue can spread on socials like a disease but I genuinely cannot get through an entire raid without a Steam profile that is level 0 or an account that has multiple game bans and VAC bans on record.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He turned dramatic when he tried to convey his losses to readers:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m at war and I’m getting absolutely pummeled for 8 hours straight every day. Hours and hours of looting, crafting and investment of time and resources wiped out raid after raid, over and over again.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Days later, Shroud surfaced <a href="https://x.com/CDLHater/status/2008378029462925744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a clip</a> and declared that ‘50% of each lobby is cheating’ and asked, ‘What’s the point in playing?’</p>



<p>Embark Studios implemented a feature before launch that allows users to claim back their lost resources when killed by ‘confirmed cheaters’, but it’s a band-aid over a gunshot wound when it happens regularly enough to get under your skin.</p>



<p>Many have commented on social media claiming that, even after hundreds of hours in the game, they’re yet to see a single cheater or suspicious player. It’s a mixed bag right now, and it’s hard to say one way or another, but it’s no big secret that cheating has become an epidemic in recent years.</p>



<p>It was only a matter of time before cheaters found ARC Raiders, especially as there’s money to be made from RMT (real-money trading). On social media, blueprints and rare weapons can sell for a fair amount of cash, and that’s what’s fuelling a lot of the cheating issues in ARC Raiders.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite has officially revealed its collaboration with South Park, featuring a return of the Stick of Truth, unique battlegrounds, and a limited-time Quints playlist. Don’t forget to bring a towel.</p>



<p>Epic Games officially dropped the trailer for the upcoming collaboration with South Park. Scheduled to go live on Friday, January 9, the Born in Chaos Pass will add new skins for Cartman, Kyle, Kenny, Stan, and Butters to the Fortnite shop. Butters’ attire is inspired by his Professor Chaos persona, while Cartman sees a return to his AWESOM-O robot from the classic season 8 episode of the Comedy Central series. Series favorite Towelie will also be appearing as a sidekick.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-stick-of-truth-returns-to-south-park">The Stick of Truth Returns to South Park</h2>



<p>The trailer featured a short animation of the characters all playing Fortnite, but leaving Butters out of the fun. To get some revenge and ensure that the other boys play with him, Butters suits up as Professor Chaos and wields the Stick of Truth, the titular item from the 2014 South Park RPG, to force them to play with them. They are then transformed into the game, and we see gameplay in Cartmanland, a new, limited-time area. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that Quints, a new five-person playlist, will be available as part of the collaboration through February 5.</p>

<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>
