<p>The Starladder Budapest Major is unravelling as we speak, and the third stage is set to kick off <strong>today</strong>. The predictions for the third stage of this $1.25 million Counter-Strike 2 tournament are getting too close to call, but there are some frontrunners. It’s shaping up to be a brutal proving ground for the game’s heaviest hitters, but how might the tournament’s underdogs fare?</p>



<p>This final Swiss Stage will decide the eight playoff contenders, and the earliest signs we have point to the likes of NAVI, FaZe, and Vitality as frontrunners, which many might have predicted, but the likes of Passion UA and 3DMAX still have the potential for an underdog upset.</p>







<h2 id="h-who-will-make-it-to-the-playoffs-in-budapest">Who Will Make It To The Playoffs in Budapest?</h2>



<p>Stage two of the Budapest Major was a pretty dramatic affair. The squads lined up needing three wins to proceed to the third stage, and the likes of NAVI and FaZe Clan both produced perfect records, effortlessly walking into the next phase.</p>



<p>The three ‘underdog’ sides in this event, Team Liquid, Passion UA, and 3DMAX, all produced decisive last-minute wins, eliminating Astralis, M80, and NiP in a sweep that few saw coming.</p>



<p>As we go into the third stage, these are the teams lined up to compete:</p>



<p><strong>Invited</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vitality</li>



<li>G2</li>



<li>Spirit</li>



<li>MOUZ</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Falcons</li>



<li>PaiN</li>



<li>MongolZ</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Stage Two:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>NAVI</li>



<li>FaZe</li>



<li>Liquid</li>



<li>Passion UA</li>



<li>3DMAX</li>



<li>Imperial</li>



<li>B8</li>



<li>Parivision</li>
</ul>



<p>The matches lined up for stage three are already looking tasty, but all eyes will be on Vitality vs FaZe as the pick of the bunch. This is FaZe’s resurgence versus Vitality’s consistency, following a year of incredible results with ZywOo at the helm.</p>



<p>In terms of predictions, it’s easy to see NAVI, FaZe Clan, Vitality, and G2 Esports in the playoffs, with Liquid, UA, and 3DMAX coming in as dark horses.</p>
