            <guid>1431943</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, ARC Raiders received a sizeable update that introduced a new PvE-focused event named <strong>Shared Watch</strong>. The point of Shared Watch is to work together with other raiders to take down ARC threats, and by doing so, you unlock a string of rewards, including a new skin, some cosmetics, and some Raider Tokens.</p>



<p>The trick is, you get <strong>no progress points </strong>(known as ‘Merits’) for this event for killing or maiming <strong>other players</strong>, stripping focus away from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-arc-raiders-pvp-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s PvP loop</a>. It’s ambitious on Embark Studios’ part, but the problem is, ARC Raiders feels way too far gone to be a proving ground for a PvE-led event, and players are quickly discovering that.</p>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-shared-watch-event-in-arc-raiders-all-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shared Watch</a> gives incentives for working as a team, either with friends or with strangers, to take down ARC enemies. For every enemy you damage, destroy, or assist in destroying, you earn Merits that push you along a reward path. That path culminates in a nice, new helmet for your rooster, Scrappy, but there are other items to secure along the way.</p>



<p>However, Shared Watch also pushes the PvE agenda a little further, attempting to encourage users to <strong>work together</strong> and stop slinging lead at one another for five minutes.</p>



<p>Last night, I hopped on ARC Raiders with a friend to participate in Shared Watch, and ten raids later, we’d <strong>not had a single successful extraction</strong>. We were prioritizing Trials, almost all of which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-easily-complete-all-arc-raiders-trials-this-week-february-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are geared this week</a> around fighting ARC enemies, and trying to crack through that reward path.</p>



<p>On every single occassion, we were met with incoming fire from other raiders, despite <strong>rarely </strong>opening fire first. Twice, we were pushed at extraction and shot in the back while trying to get out of the map. On another raid, we fought to take down a Leaper for our Trial, learning that a duo sat in the bushes waiting for us to secure the kill so they could, subsequently, laser us to death.</p>



<p>This is the go-to standard in ARC Raiders now. There are videos and guides online geared towards ‘guaranteed entry’ to PvE-focused lobbies, which involve shooting <strong>no human enemies </strong>for around ten raids, but it’s a loose concept at best. Like the game’s loot model, securing a PvE-focused raid is based on RNG, and it depends entirely on who you’re matched with.</p>



<p>For a PvE-focused event to work in ARC Raiders, and I mean <strong>truly work with a 0% failure rate</strong>, Embark Studios has to build servers (even temporary ones) that have raider damage switched off or altered. By that, I mean you cannot take damage from another raider, period. On these servers, only ARC will be a threat.</p>



<p>To capitalize on that and keep things balanced, I’d be willing to see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">Embark Studios</a> <strong>increase the risk </strong>from ARC on these servers. Make them tougher, more plentiful, more aggressive, whatever it takes. But the balance is, you can’t be gunned down by ARC enemies.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has said time and again that PvE doesn’t work, despite the game’s original operating model being geared towards just that. But as a limited-time event, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a map condition</a>, or even a specific map built <strong>only </strong>for PvE, I think an entire audience would feel validated and well served.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ayaneo-next-2-insane-handheld-beats-laptops/</link>
            <guid>1431934</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you thought that spending $800 to acquire a ROG Xbox Ally X was a stretch, you’ll baulk at the Ayaneo Next 2. This all-new gaming handheld, dubbed ‘dreamlike’ by Ayaneo, carries a price tag of up to <strong>$4,299</strong> if you want to get the most powerful version available. It’s tough to fathom <strong>why</strong>, but when you uncover the tech specs, it starts to make a little sense.</p>



<p>This immensely aspirational device is ambitious, and it’ll probably sell all of about three units in its lifetime, but it’s an indication of just how much effort handheld manufacturers are willing to cram into these devices.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-the-ayaneo-next-2-so-expensive">Why is the Ayaneo Next 2 so Expensive?</h2>



<p>To be fair, the <a href="https://ayaneo.com/article/901" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ayaneo Next 2</a> pricing starts at $1,999, or $1,799 if you pre-order and soak up an early bird discount. That version boasts AMD’s new Ryzen AI Max 385 processor and Radeon 8050S graphics, which come equipped with 32 GB of memory and 1 TB of storage. That’s already enough to trump every other handheld on the market.</p>



<p>But if you ramp up the specification and head for the top-tier version of the Ayaneo Next 2, you’re getting one hell of an upgrade.</p>



<p>For a princely sum of $4,299, or just $3,499 with that pre-order discount, you’ll get the AMD Ryzen Max+ 395 processor, a Radeon 8060S iGPU, an eye-watering 128 GB of memory, and double storage – 2 TB total.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about the makeup of this thing.</p>



<p>The Ayaneo Next 2 has a gorgeous OLED screen measuring just north of 9 inches. across, and a dynamic, adjustable refresh rate of up to 165Hz. It effectively puts other handhelds to shame, as the OLED screen is still rarely seen in the on-the-go gaming space.</p>



<p>There’s a massive on-board battery with a 116Wh capacity, which decimates the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-ally/" id="2725">ROG Xbox Ally X’s</a> 80Wh battery. But that’s because the Ayaneo Next 2 has <strong>so much to power</strong>. We’re talking advanced cooling solutions, RGB elements, two USB-C ports, Hall Effect triggers, TMR joysticks, insane brightness capabilities, and powerful, front-facing speakers.</p>



<p>Ayaneo has gone beyond the standard considerations, including features like trigger locks and even more rear buttons than you’d expect.</p>



<p>When it drops, the Ayaneo Next 2 will have shells available in both ‘Polar Black’ and ‘Aurora White’. It’s worth stressing that it’s not expected to be released until <strong>June 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>Do you think the Ayaneo Next 2 is worth more than $4,000? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/sony-san-diego/" id="2183">Sony San Diego</a> has shared an update on upcoming content for the “Road to The Show” mode in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mlb-the-show-26/" id="3187">MLB The Show 26.</a></p>



<p>This year, Sony is touting more control than ever for players looking to take their custom baseball player to the Hall of Fame. This control includes a new career simulation method, new Perks, and higher stakes in every game.</p>



<figure><p>

Road To The Show in MLB The Show 26" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Yx_Ci_OTfE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<h2>Amateur Years Gameplay Extended</h2>



<p>Of course, no baseball player starts their career in the MLB. As such, not only will you go through the amateur years in MLB The Show 26, but you’ll also have the option to extend them. Your character will be recruited out of high school to one of 11 new colleges, with 19 colleges in total, each offering recruiting packages. The package you choose will influence your skill development, equipment, scouting exposure, and more.</p>



<p>That level of control doesn’t stop at the amateurs, however. Once you’re in the major ranks, you can request trades and talk with coaches about potentially changing positions. You’ll also have more leverage to make big mid-season moves.</p>







<h2 id="h-changes-to-perks-in-mlb-the-show-26">Changes to Perks in MLB The Show 26</h2>



<p>This year, specific requirements unlock Perks for your ballplayer. This means you can pursue the options you believe will benefit you most. Also, a revamped menu simplifies learning and upgrading your player’s Perks.</p>



<h2>Simulate More and Simplify Your Career to Your Liking</h2>



<p>In MLB The Show 26, you can simulate parts of the career mode experience. Your sim options will be driven by your overall rating. Achievements such as hitting streaks will temporarily boost your ballplayer’s overall, improving performance in simulated games.</p>



<p>However, players are also alerted when big moments in their careers are approaching. This will allow you to regain control and stop the simulation experience if you choose.</p>



<p>Check out the full update <a href="https://theshow.com/news/mlb-the-show-26-fielding-feedback-rtts/?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=FieldingFeedbackRTTSBlog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>







<p>MLB The Show 26 is now available to pre-order in the Standard Edition and Digital Deluxe Edition. Those who pre-order the Deluxe Edition can play on March 13; the game releases to the general public on March 17. </p>



<p>There’s also a 10% discount on the Digital Deluxe Edition if you have purchased any previous digital edition of the game.</p>

            <guid>1431739</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With the second season of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> set to launch, the game’s communications team has shared a list of updates players can look forward to.</p>



<p>While new maps and challenges are already known to be coming to Battlefield 6<a href="https://x.com/battlefieldcomm/status/2021313449754755403?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">, major updates are also on the way,</a> bringing quality-of-life improvements, faster progression, and more.</p>



<p>One such change includes faster Battle Pass progression. The team notes that this season will be more rewarding and that Battle Pass Tokens earned from Career XP have been recalculated, allowing players to progress faster through regular gameplay and weekly challenges.</p>



<p>Additionally, in-game movement has been improved. The team behind Battlefield 6 now says it feels more predictable and readable during fast-paced action changes, including acceleration curves, smoother vaulting, and smoother ladder transitions. The team has also made fixes that reduce visual inconsistencies and unexpected behavior.</p>







<h2 id="h-updates-coming-to-redsec">Updates Coming to REDSEC</h2>



<p>REDSEC is Battlefield 6’s Battle Royale mode. This community update notes that there will be more rewarding progression in the mode, as Career and weapon XP earn rates have been increased. Hopefully, baseball helps progression feel more balanced between the regular gameplay experience and Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Also, they are increasing overall armor availability in REDSEC. Plus, they’re introducing a cooldown on Vehicle Keycards as a mission reward after players acquire one. This is intended to help balance tank access in Battle Royale mode.</p>
