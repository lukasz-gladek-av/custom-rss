<p>Shopify Rebellion and Moist Esports, the esports organization owned by content creator stars Charles “Cr1TiKaL” White Jr. and Ludwig “Ludwig” Ahgren, have fully merged under the Shopify banner. Both Cr1TiKaL and Ludwig are now co-owners of Shopify Rebellion.</p>



<p>The two organizations have partnered together in recent years, but now move forward together as one.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shopify-rebellion-and-moist-esports-fully-join-forces">Shopify Rebellion and Moist Esports Fully Join Forces</h2>



<p>In addition to Cr1TiKaL and Ludwig joining Rebellion as co-owners, the organization will use some of Moist Esports’ branding (including the droplet mascots) and absorb the esports divisions competing under the Moist banner. All the Moist divisions will compete as Shopify Rebellion moving forward.</p>







<p>Moist Esports was founded by Cr1TiKaL in 2021, with the YouTube star jumping into the expansive fighting game community (FGC) first before entering Rocket League and Apex Legends a year later. Ludwig joined Moist as a co-owner in 2023, spear-heading the organization’s entry into VALORANT. Later that year, Ludwig announced that Moist and Shopify would partner together to run a VALORANT NA Challengers roster, which competed under the name MxS.</p>



<p>Both Cr1TiKaL and Ludwig have been very forthcoming and public about the costs of running an esports organization. Back in 2021, Cr1TiKaL told his audience plainly that he was running Moist Esports at a loss. When the organization entered VALORANT, Ludwig said that entering the scene cost roughly <a href="https://dotesports.com/valorant/news/ludwig-spends-half-a-million-dollars-to-pick-up-na-valorant-challengers-roster-for-moist-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“$500,000 of Charlie’s money.”</a></p>



<p>With Moist and Shopify Rebellion now merged, the Rebels now field several different esports rosters. “Coming together allows us to field more and stronger teams, invest deeper for fans, and provide more to our players,” <a href="https://x.com/ShopifyRebels/status/1880287780817056025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote Shopify Rebellion founder</a>, Jeremy Steeves. Shopify Rebellion fields the following esports rosters:</p>



<ul>
<li>Two VALORANT teams (including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-game-changers-vct-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the two-time defending Game Changers champions</a>)</li>



<li>A League of Legends roster in the newly rebranded LoL Americas conference (formerly in the LCS)</li>



<li>An Apex Legends roster</li>



<li>A Halo roster in the HCS</li>



<li>A Rainbow Six Siege roster (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-in-rainbow-six-soniqs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed just this past December</a>)</li>



<li>A Dota 2 roster</li>



<li>Four StarCraft II players</li>



<li>A Rocket League roster</li>



<li>Several Smash and Street Fighter 6 players</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/six-invitational-2025-groups-confirmed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-reveals-six-invitational-2025-groups-ahead-of-february-event.1085457/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/six-invitational-2025-groups-confirmed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Between the 3rd and the 16th of February, the Six Invitational 2025 will unravel in Boston. This historic tournament is one of the biggest single events in the esports ecosystem, boasting a $3 million prize pool shared between 20 competing teams.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft took to social media to reveal the full suite of Six Invitational 2025 groups, uncovering four rosters each made up of five teams apiece. Judging from the lineup that has been revealed, we’re already set to see some stellar matches at the Six Invitational 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-line-them-up">Line Them Up</h2>



<p>Here are the Six Invitational 2025 groups per the recent release from Ubisoft:</p>



<p><strong>Group A</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>M80</li>



<li>Team JOEL</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>Unwanted</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group B</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>CAG Osaka</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Shopify Rebellion</li>



<li>Team Secret</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group C</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>DarkZero</li>



<li>PSG Talon</li>



<li>RazaH Company Academy</li>



<li>Team BDS</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group D</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Oxygen Esports</li>



<li>SCARZ</li>



<li>Spacestation Gaming</li>



<li>Virtus.pro</li>



<li>w7m Esports</li>
</ul>



<p>By far the most exciting group at the Six Invitational is Group B, featuring the talents of FaZe Clan and FURIA. At the last Six Invitational in Sao Paolo, these two rosters went head-to-head in the grand final, which turned out to be the most popular esports event in Rainbow Six Siege history.</p>



<p>That’s already a fixture to watch out for.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, all eyes will be on Team BDS, sitting in Group C alongside challengers like DarkZero, Team Falcons, and PSG Talon. It was BDS that scooped a solid performance last year, netting the Esports World Cup trophy and finishing in second place at back-to-back BLAST Major tournaments. It’s easy to see how Team BDS could go all the way in Boston.</p>



<p>Following the group stage, the teams will be seeded into the Six Invitational 2025 playoff stage. From there, it’s a fight through the double-elimination bracket to the grand final, with the lion’s share of the $3 million prize pool waiting for the victor.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-rts-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/respawn-entertainment%E2%80%99s-star-wars-rts-game-will-be-revealed-in-april-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1085352/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-rts-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new claim has said that Respawn Entertainment’s Star Wars RTS Game will be revealed between April 18-20.</p>



<p>That’s according to X (Formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1880275605310333092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@bogorad222</a>, who said that the public announcement and trailer would be released during the Star Wars Celebration in Japan, which takes place April 18-20, 2025.</p>



<p>While mainly known for obtaining information via LinkedIn searching, bogorad222 provided Insider Gaming with sufficient evidence that the claims were genuine from one source.</p>



<p>Announced in January 2022, Respawn Entertainment’s Star Wars RTS is being developed alongside Bit Reactor, led by games industry veteran Greg Foerstch. <span>Respawn will produce the new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;strategy game, </span>while Bit Reactor will lead the development of the title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are huge fans of Star Wars here at Respawn and we’re thrilled to work with Lucasfilm Games on new titles that we have wanted to make for years,” said Zampella. “If you want to make great Star Wars games, you should come join us on our journey.” <a></a></p>



<p>At the time of writing, EA has not given any other updates on the project, so at least time-wise, an update or announcement is likely to happen later this year.</p>



<p>In February 2024, EA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-respawn-game-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled Respawn Entertainment’s first-person Mandalorian game</a>, which would see players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-mandalorian-game-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take control of a bounty hunter</a> in a linear-level experience. </p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is adding The Thing and the Human Torch to make its almighty roster even more super. It completes the Fantastic Four set and brings some of Marvel’s most famous and feared friends together at last. </p>



<p>It’s rare nowadays to see a service title do little wrong and remain popular. Marvel Rivals is doing this and is flourishing further with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a>. The first official season brought many changes, including the addition of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-is-dropping-a-fantastic-4-trailer-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantastic Four</a> as new heroes.</p>



<p>However, only Mister Fantastic and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-bots-are-being-sniffed-out-by-invisible-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Invisible Woman</a> are available. The Thing and Johnny Storm (Human Torch) are inbound, let’s get an ETA on their debut.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-are-the-thing-amp-human-torch-coming-to-marvel-rivals">When Are The Thing &amp; Human Torch Coming to Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ve done well so far. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NetEase hasn’t given a date for Thing &amp; Human Torch’s arrival, but using logic and game director Guangyun Chen’s own words, we expect the duo to arrive on Friday, February 21.</strong></p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a>, Guangyun Chen confirmed Marvel Rivals is getting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-heroes-every-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two new heroes every three months</a>. Season 1 is a bit different, and he was asked about the regularity of new heroes joining. He says each new season lasts three months (12 weeks), and “for each half of the season, we will introduce a new hero” which is roughly six weeks apart.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 launched on January 10. If we fast forward six weeks from this date, it takes us nicely to February 21. There is a chance their arrival might be <strong>one week later though</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the “Marvel Rivals Season 1 Begins Dev Vision Vol. 03” video on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals YouTube channel</a>, Season 1’s two halves are “<strong>lasting six or seven weeks.</strong>“</p>



<p><strong>Timestamp—1:36</strong>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>If it is seven weeks, The Thing and Human Torch arrive on <strong>February 28</strong> instead. We’ll keep checking the Marvel Rivals socials closer to the time to see when NetEase is launching the heroes.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals – Leaks &amp; Info</a> X page, we’ve had a sneak of the Human Torch’s upcoming abilities.
