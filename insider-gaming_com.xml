<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>

<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Six Invitational has finally wrapped in Paris, and FaZe Clan stands victorious. The organization is the <strong>first </strong>in Rainbow Six esports history to win back-to-back Six Invitational tournaments, marking a spot in the history books.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan beat Team Secret in the grand final in Paris, defeating the <strong>fan-favorite side</strong>, to lift the hammer and secure the $1 million prize. It was no big <em>secret </em>that the crowd was firmly against FaZe Clan in Paris, especially given the presence of Team Secret’s French competitor, Mowwwgli, who has failed to win on home turf.</p>







<h2 id="h-faze-clan-has-won-this-year-s-six-invitational">FaZe Clan Has Won This Year’s Six Invitational</h2>



<p>FaZe Clan has lifted the hammer in Paris in front of a roaring crowd, for better or worse. Today’s excitement was kicked off by Ubisoft unveiling this year’s Rainbow Six roadmap, and it blew the roof off the stadium.</p>



<p>From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solid-snake-rainbow-six-siege-revealed/" id="176941">Solid Snake as an Operator</a> to Ranked 3.0, and from a new social hub to four stacked seasons this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-year-11-roadmap-revealed/" id="176923">Year 11 is <strong>heavy</strong></a><strong> </strong>for Rainbow Six Siege fans.</p>



<p>As with almost every other year, the schedule began with a glorious Six Invitational, which is regarded as one of the most valuable esports tournaments in the business. It’s a multi-million-dollar event backed by Ubisoft, and this year, it went to Paris. It was recently revealed that <strong>next year’s event </strong>will be heading to Brazil.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan, which claimed the prize last year in Boston, had a brilliant tournament through and through. From a top finish in the group stage with just one close loss to a storm through the upper bracket in the playoffs, FaZe Clan refused to relent.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the grand final, FaZe pushed out Fluxo W7M, Wildcard, and Team Falcons, all before meeting Team Secret in the ultimate showdown. Team Secret also had serious momentum, having gone on a wild lower-bracket sprint and eliminating some heavy players to make it into the final series.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan was relentless, hitting Team Secret with an insane 3-1 finish. The first series on Consulate wrapped with a 7-4, while Bank saw FaZe yield a 7-2 scoreline. Team Secret came back miraculously on the final map, Fortress, pushing the game into OT, earning the team a slight respite.</p>



<p>It wasn’t enough to clutch up the final map, though, leaving FaZe Clan to secure another map win in OT on Border.</p>



<p>Last year, Team Secret won at the Esports World Cup, while FaZe Clan dropped out hard in 10th place. It’s safe to say that FaZe redeemed itself in Paris by winning back-to-back Six Invitational tournaments.</p>

<p>Edmund McMillen is one of the creators of the new cat-breeding roguelike game called Mewgenics. So far, the game has been released only on PC, where it holds a “very positive” review score based on over 10,000 reviews.</p>



<p>Recently, McMillen responded to a Twitter question about when players can expect a console release. In response, he said it’s currently being worked on, but they don’t yet know when it will be completed. However, it may be in development for all systems.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-mewgenics-is-a-smash-success">Mewgenics Is A Smash Success</h2>



<p>Mewgenics, in its first week on the market, is currently sitting at 89 on Metacritic with an overall user score of 8.1. The game currently has over 115,000 concurrent players on Steam, breaking its previous record of over 102,000 set earlier this morning. Edmund McMillen has been pleasantly surprised by the success.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game features a voice cast of several long-time internet personalities. Among those are Ethan and Hila Klein from h3h3 and iDubbbz. McMillen recently responded to criticisms of the casting choices, explaining why he stands by them and how long the process took.

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Nintendo Switch 2 </a>Virtual Boy accessories support VR-enabled Nintendo Switch games.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Virtual Boy is coming to Nintendo Switch Online’s Nintendo Classics catalog on February 17. To play Virtual Boy games, Nintendo is releasing two headset accessories. One headset will be a full-size Virtual Boy mock-up. The other is a cardboard version.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-new-virtual-boy-accessory-works-with-existing-switch-titles">Nintendo’s New Virtual Boy Accessory Works With Existing Switch Titles</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/confirmed-switchs-virtual-boy-headset-can-play-vr-supported-switch-games-including-breath-of-the-wild-and-mario-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to Video Games Chronicle,</a> these accessories will work not only with Virtual Boy games but also with existing Nintendo Switch games that support VR. Nintendo, as part of its Labo lineup, allowed players to build their own cardboard VR headset.</p>



<p>To experiment with VR, they added specific game modes for four titles: Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Super Mario Odyssey, and Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker. It’s also noted that the Switch 2 edition of Breath of the Wild retains the VR option</p>



<p>Per VGC, the main Nintendo Virtual Boy accessory, designed for stationary use, includes the classic red Virtual Boy filter over the lenses, but players can remove it to play Switch VR games in full color. The cardboard accessory is actually a wearable headset.</p>







<p>Check out the full list of Virtual Boy games coming to the Nintendo Switch Online on launch <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/virtual-boy-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online-in-february/">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideki Sato, the designer of all major Sega consoles, passed away at the age of 77 on February 13.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Beep2021/status/2022662105904877996?s=20">The Japanese outlet Beep21 </a>reported his passing on its social media channels. He is widely regarded as the “Father of Sega Hardware.” He served as director of Sega’s Research and Development department during the heyday of the console war between Sega and Nintendo.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="ja" dir="ltr"><p>セガハードの父として知られる<br>佐藤秀樹氏が昨日ご逝去されました。</p><p>日本のゲーム史<br>そして世界中のセガファンを魅了された<br>本当に偉大な方でした。</p><p>あの時代のワクワクと挑戦心は、<br>未来永劫、永遠に多くのファンの<br>記憶に残っていくことと思います。<br>心よりご冥福をお祈りいたします。</p><p>Beep21</p></div>— Beep21 (@Beep2021) <a href="https://twitter.com/Beep2021/status/2022662105904877996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<h2 id="h-hideki-sato-s-reflections-on-sega-genesis-design">Hideki Sato’s Reflections on Sega Genesis Design</h2>



<p>Speaking about the launch of the Sega Genesis, known as the Mega Drive outside of America, Sato told <a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu </a>in a Sega retrospective that there was a belief that customers would appreciate video games in the same way they had with music. As such, they chose to make it look like an audio device.</p>



<p>“Since the Mega Drive was a machine that you put in front of your TV, our concept was to make it look like an audio player. So we painted the body black and put the “16BIT” lettering in a gold print. That gold printing, by the way, was very expensive. (laughs) But we really wanted to play up the fact that this was the very first 16-bit home console,” he said.</p>







<h2 id="h-sato-wanted-wireless-controllers-for-the-sega-dreamcast">Sato Wanted Wireless Controllers for the Sega Dreamcast</h2>



<p>The Sega Dreamcast was Sega’s final hardware release. When discussing the platform, he noted some of his wishes for the console. He noted that he wanted a more cube-shaped design, similar to the Nintendo GameCube, but he really wanted wireless controllers.</p>



<p>“Personally, I wanted a more cube-shaped design like the Nintendo Gamecube, but we ultimately ended up with what you see today. One thing I truly wanted was wireless controllers. Those long cords are annoying. Next time, it will be wireless for sure! (laughs)”</p>



<p>That was a generation ahead, as wireless gameplay would not become the pack-in standard until the PS3 and Xbox 360 generation. A true innovator.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming sends its condolences to the family and friends of Hideki Sato.</p>

<p>Stellar Blade could be coming to more platforms in the near future.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/stellar-blade/" id="1204">Stellar Blade</a> was originally a PlayStation exclusive in 2024. It was later ported to PC. Developer <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;code=ir_eng&amp;idx=316&amp;category=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SHIFT UP Corporation</a> is now touting the game’s success in its recent Q3 earnings report. They are also looking ahead to the Future of the Stellar Blade IP.</p>



<p>In the latest quarter, the game continued to sell copies steadily. In particular, the PC port saw strong sales, and its very positive Steam rating was highlighted in the report.</p>







<h2>Stellar Blade Could See Releases on New Platforms</h2>



<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/shift-up/" id="1687">SHIFT UP Corporation</a> expects the game’s popularity and overall brand to continue to grow. Additionally, they plan to make the game accessible to even more players. </p>



<p>To do that, they plan to run promotional sales across both platforms and are even considering expanding to platforms beyond PlayStation and PC.</p>



<p>“To further enhance brand recognition and boost sales, we plan to carry out various promotional activities and are considering additional platform expansions to make Stellar Blade accessible to more players,” it’s noted.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-era-of-console-exclusives-continues-to-fade-away">The Era of Console Exclusives Continues to Fade Away</h2>



<p>Not only is PlayStation porting some of its popular exclusives to PC, but Microsoft continues to push the idea that “Everything is an Xbox.”</p>



<p>As such, major Microsoft releases, such as Halo, are now being ported to PlayStation. The strategy will continue, as the forthcoming Fable title will also be available on PlayStation. <span>Learn more about Xbox games on PlayS</span>tation&nbsp;at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-studios-head-admits-inconsistency-in-multiplatform-release-strategy/" id="171816">this link.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New information concerning the internal hardware expectations of the next Sony PlayStation has surfaced.</p>



<p>Do not expect the next Sony PlayStation console to use only AMD’s upcoming RDNA 5 GPU. During a recent discussion on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-xbox-magnus-rdna-5-finalized.1693408/page-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NeoGAF forum</a>, reliable tech leaker KeplerL2 noted that the PS5’s internals are a hybrid of RDNA1 and ray tracing, and that the “PS6 isn’t full RDNA 5 either.”</p>







<h2 id="h-further-hardware-expectations-for-the-next-gen-sony-ps6">Further Hardware Expectations for the Next-Gen Sony PS6</h2>



<p>In another recent post, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-specs-playstation-handheld-impressive-memory/">Kepler claimed</a> that the PlayStation 6 could have up to 30 GB of GDDR7 memory. The often-discussed next-gen Sony handheld could also feature up to 24 GB of LPDDR5X memory. If that is the case, it would be on par with the recently released ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>The rumored handheld is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-handheld-console-will-be-dockable-its-claimed/">expected to be dockable. </a>It’s also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-portable-can-definitely-run-ps5-games-leaker-clarifies/">expected to run PS5 titles</a>. Still, it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/">not expected to be as powerful</a> as the current PlayStation 5 console.</p>



<p>However, don’t expect to see the next set of PlayStation consoles on the market <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/">until at least 2027.</a></p>







<p>Speaking of next-generation hardware expectations, AMD recently said that it was preparing to support a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-says-next-xbox-console-may-launch-next-year/" id="173908">2027 launch for the next Xbox console.</a> However, Microsoft has since said it is not committing to a hard launch date for its next hardware lineup.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-year-11-roadmap-revealed/</link>
            <guid>1436707</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has unveiled the full Rainbow Six Year 11 roadmap during the Six Invitational in Paris. On one of the grandest stages in the esports landscape, Ubisoft uncovered the next year of Rainbow Six Siege content, and things are looking great.</p>



<p>The breakdown started with a new trailer that revealed the death of Phobos. From there, the team talked about Ranked 3.0, balancing changes that will update how players enjoy the game (looking first at entry and roaming, and the new cadence with seasonal updates.</p>



<p>Check out everything you need to know below.</p>







<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-siege-year-11-roadmap-is-more-siege-more-often">Rainbow Six Siege Year 11 Roadmap is ‘More Siege, More Often’</h2>



<p>The running theme of Rainbow Six Siege’s Year 11 roadmap is, according to Ubisoft, ‘more Siege, more often’.</p>



<p>That all begins with a hefty array of new seasons coming to the game over the next 12 months. For some reason, the team started by detailing <strong>season four</strong>, dropping at the end of the year.</p>



<p>This update will be all about <strong>teamplay</strong>, and to accommodate better collaboration, a new <strong>social hub </strong>will be implemented. A new ‘testing grounds’ playlist will also drop in season four, with Ubisoft monitoring feedback and seeing what needs to change before Year 12 kicks off.</p>



<p>Towards the end of Year 11, a new strategic option is coming to the test area in the form of <strong>half reinforcements</strong>:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In Y11S4, the Hostage mechanic is also going to get a major rework. Additionally, The Grand Larceny, a limited-time event not seen for almost <strong>six years</strong>, is coming back.</p>



<p>Players will be able to prove their expertise with specific Operators in Y11S4, too, leaning on Operator Mastery tiers. As the team said, this gives your time with these characters ‘more meaning’.</p>



<p>Y11S3, which will drop <strong>before season four</strong> (obviously), introduces a new Defender with a brilliant counter for shield users, codename: <strong>Firework</strong>. The small teaser we got for the unnamed character revealed a gadget that can punch clean through shields.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In Y11S2, the in-game esports tab is getting a huge update, allowing fans of the competitive scene to better connect with and follow their favourite competitors.</p>



<p>This season will also welcome a new Rainbow Six Siege map, pulled straight from Rainbow Six Vegas – <strong>Calypso Casino</strong>. It’s a ‘tribute to the amazing Vegas games from Rainbow’s past,’ said Alex Kaparzis, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-creative-director-stepping-down/" id="173856">former Creative Director of the game</a>.</p>



<p>Y11S2 will also yield a remaster for Dokkaebi, giving her a ‘more personal and targeted approach’ as well as a new primary weapon to broaden her arsenal. It was stressed that the weapon won’t be locked behind a battle pass but will be available to all users when it drops.</p>



<p>But what about what comes in the first season of Year 11?</p>



<h2 id="h-year-11-season-1-welcomes-a-recognisable-face">Year 11 Season 1 Welcomes a Recognisable Face</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solid-snake-rainbow-six-siege-revealed/">Y11S1 welcomes Solid Snake</a>, the protagonist of the <strong>older </strong>Metal Gear Solid games. He’ll be joining Zero as a new Operator, and he’s coming on board with a standalone story to set him up nicely in the universe.</p>



<p>The first season of Year 11 is themed almost entirely around Metal Gear. There’s a new event named [REDACTED] that brings MGS-themed skins and a limited-time 4v4 mode, a string of cosmetics coming in the battle pass, and, of course, Solid Snake himself.</p>



<p>He’s coming in as a one-health, three-speed Operator with unique voice lines, a new gadget, and a sweet loadout.</p>



<p>The first season, Operation Silent Hunt, launches on March 3rd. It’s set to welcome modernized maps, a 1v1 arcade mode, and a huge balancing overhaul, amongst other things.</p>



<p>For your information and perusal, here’s the full Rainbow Six Siege Year 11 roadmap:</p>
