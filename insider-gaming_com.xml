<p>N7 Day 2024, the annual celebration of the Mass Effect franchise, is just days away. And while fans are usually excited about any potential announcements from BioWare, the studio is warning people to keep their expectations low this year.</p>



<p>“We hope everyone is enjoying their time in Dragon Age: The Veilguard,” the studio wrote on <a href="https://x.com/bioware/status/1853552873138720920">social media</a>. “It’s only a few days until N7 Day and this year will be quieter because of launch. Be sure to check back then for a little fun, though!”</p>







<p>N7 Day 2024 will be the 13th held by the studio. It began in 2012 and is named based on the N7 designation held by Commander Shepard.</p>



<p>As far as the future of Mass Effect, the next game in the franchise is currently in development at BioWare. The game is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mass-effect-5-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly being worked on</a> by “trilogy vets”. It’s unknown, however, where development sits and when a release date could come. If you need a Mass Effect fix in the mean time, a board game based on the franchise was recently released.</p>



<p>What do you think will be revealed, if anything, at N7 Day 2024? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

<p>According to the latest announcement by Binding of Isaac creator <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Edmund McMillen</a>, the title will receive a full online co-op mode, including completion markers for its 10th-anniversary update. The online co-op mode is scheduled to arrive on November 18, 2024. The game will also receive a ‘considerable balance update’, which will look towards buffing items the community has found to be “lacklustre/bad”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binding of Isaac is celebrating its 10th anniversary with a massive 50% discount on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and discounts on all DLCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Edmund McMillen and Nicalis, Inc. developed Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, which was released in 2014. It is an action RPG shooter with a heavy focus on rogue-like elements. Players follow Isaac’s journey as he battles gangs of deranged enemies, lost brothers and sisters, fears, and eventually his mother.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game features shooter gameplay in randomly generated environments. As Isaac, players will find mysterious treasures that provide the character with superhuman abilities and other skills to conquer more difficult enemies and explore unreachable areas. Rebirth is a remake of the original title with a new game engine, all-new hand-drawn pixel-style artwork, highly polished visual effects, an all-new soundtrack and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is out and it’s been a <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17037/dragon-age-the-veilguard">well received game overall</a>. It’s launch 10 years after the last mainline Dragon Age game has had people wondering if the original games could get the remaster treatment. </p>



<p>While Creative Director John Epler would like it to happen, he doesn’t see it likely. In an interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a> around the game’s launch, Epler was asked about seeing the first three games remastered in some way. </p>



<p>“I think I’m one of about maybe 20 people left at BioWare who’s actually used Eclipse,” Epler told the outlet. “It’s something that’s not going to be as easy as Mass Effect, but we do love the original games. Never say never, I guess that’s what it comes down to.”</p>



<p>While he does say “never say never”, the technology of the original games could prove a sticking point. The first two Dragon Age games from 2009 and 2011 were built with the custom Eclipse engine. The third game, Dragon Age: Inquisition ultimately moved to the Frostbite Engine, making it more likely for a remaster than the others. </p>



<p>Rolling Stone mentioned the Mass Effect games getting remastered. Those games were built on Unreal Engine, making it an easier task to bring forward with newer technology.</p>



<p>If it were to happen, it would almost be a certainty that the first two games would have to be built from scratch in Frostbite, or a different engine.</p>



<p>Do you think the original Dragon Age games get remastered? Let us know below, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>If you spend any amount of time online, specifically on X (formerly Twitter), then you know Elon Musk enjoys the sound of his own voice. More specifically, the look of his opinions in text format, as the man tweets constantly. It’s downright amazing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how he has time for anything else besides posting online</a>. Still, in his spare time, he’s quickly risen through the ranks to become a top 20 Diablo 4 player—one of only two in the United States. It’s absolutely shocking and entirely true.</p>



<p>It’s well known that Elon Musk plays video games. It wasn’t long ago that players online tore apart his Elden Ring build, after all, but he appears to favor RPGs with grind involved. In Diablo 4, he’s previously complained about how overpowered Barbarians are, and as a Barb main, please cry about it, Elon. Oh, but he plays a Barbarian primarily. Go figure!</p>



<p>During his appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast, Musk kickstarted the conversation by bragging about becoming one of the top 20 Diablo 4 players in the world. He’s one of only two Americans currently on the list, with the other topping the leaderboards in the number one spot. Currently, Musk sits in 19th.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Now, this ranking revolves around Pit runs. He’s achieved the 19th best timed run through Pit 150, which is an absolutely challenging grind and, honestly, a little impressive.</p>



<p>Instead of playing his usual Barbarian, Musk ranked with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-reveals-new-spiritborn-class/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Spiritborn class</a>, part of the Vessel of Hatred expansion. Furthermore, he’s running a Quill build.</p>



<p>Alongside Diablo 4 and Elden Ring, Musk is also a long-time fan of Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>Do you think Musk managed to hit the leaderboards in Diablo 4 legitimately or not? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

<p>On the topic of Elon Musk, did you know he’s considered <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-stream-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most successful streamers ever</a>? He broke records in a single hour!</p>
