<p>A new report reveals that Netflix considered acquiring Electronic Arts, Disney, and Fox, but none of those deals came to fruition. </p>



<p>Netflix is the new big dog in town, ever since it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the company would acquire Warner Bros. for $82.7 billion in 2026, likely giving it access to studios like NetherRealm, Rocksteady, TT Games, and Avalanche. New details reveal they have considered buying other major companies, including EA and Disney. </p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-debated-pursuing-ea-disney-and-fox">Netflix ‘Debated Pursuing’ EA, Disney, and Fox</h2>



<p>A new Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-07/netflix-co-ceo-ted-sarandos-wooed-trump-personally-ahead-of-warner-bid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> about Netflix CEO wooing Trump ahead of Warner Bros.’ bid says the company considered acquisitions of EA, Disney, and Fox. It first talks about how Netflix is an “unlikely bidder”, as co-founder and chairman, Reed Hastings, avoids major deals to build things “from scratch”. The company’s management “debated pursuing just about every major asset put up for sale, including&nbsp;Electronic Arts Inc.&nbsp;and&nbsp;Fox.” They also considered acquiring Disney at one point. </p>



<p>However, the “executives could never coalesce behind a deal.” Additionally, the execs didn’t want to “hurt their stock price by overpaying for an asset that traded at a much lower multiple.” Netflix’s co-CEO Greg Peters also stated, ahead of the acquisition of Warner Bros., that “One should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers, they don’t have an amazing track record,” which led people to think Netflix was not interested in the deal. </p>

<p>The Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 release date carries on Epic’s new mission to let everyone relive the early years by experiencing older content again from top to bottom. Key content for Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 has been revealed, showing you what you can look forward to for several weeks.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 celebrates the battle royale’s Christmas period from SEVEN years ago. The game has changed dramatically over the last seven years, and while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-dark-voyager-quest-rewards-chapter-7-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</a> begins the next significant milestone in the game’s history, it’s time for a Holiday throwback.</p>



<p>OG Chapter 1 Season 7 brings back some banging skins and some beloved POIs and weapons.</p>

<figure><figcaption>See any you recognize? Credit to Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 releases on December 11, exactly two weeks out from Christmas Day!</strong></p>



<p>It’s time to put in some real work. Alongside Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 is OG Chapter 1 Season 7. It’s a testament to Epic to keep so many areas of the game in operation at once. But the nostalgic return to bygone Fortnite eras has been a huge dub in the community.</p>



<p>The OG Chapter 1 Season 7’s tagline was “You Better Watch Out,” and Insider Gaming will tell you why.</p>

<p><strong>Alongside returning Xmas-themed POIs and a new OG Battle Pass, you can look forward to the Boom Box, Stink Bombs, a Scoped Revolver, and much more in Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick summary of every item outed by Epic Games ahead of Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Balloons</li>



<li>Boom Box</li>



<li>Dual Pistols</li>



<li>Glider Redeploy</li>



<li>Infinity Blade (In-Season)</li>



<li>New Battle Pass</li>



<li>New POIs
<ul>
<li>Polar Peak</li>



<li>Happy Hamlet</li>



<li>Frosty Flights</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Scoped AR</li>



<li>Scoped Revolver</li>



<li>Stink Bombs</li>



<li>Suppressed Sniper Rifle</li>



<li>X-4 Stormwing</li>
</ul>



<p>Chapter 7’s storyline was a fairly new narrative more in keeping with the theme of Christmas. You too can experience this all for yourself when Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 drops a few days from now.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/first-player-escape-tarkov-streamer-item/</link>
            <guid>1376179</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tigz, who was documented last week as being the first person in the world to successfully escape from Tarkov, has been awarded a unique streamer item by Battlestate Games. These items are used to represent the respect that Battlestate Games has for the content creators who pour their lives into pulling Escape from Tarkov into the limelight time and again.</p>



<p>There are dozens of streamer items in the game, but the latest one belongs to Tigz, and it’s a tongue-in-cheek reference to the failed runs that prevented him from getting out of Tarkov without too many issues.</p>



<h2 id="h-tigz-has-a-streamer-item">Tigz Has a Streamer Item</h2>



<p>Tigz has a unique streamer item that’s reminiscent of his time spent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/">escaping through Terminal</a>, the final map in Battlestate Games’ tough extraction shooter. In his first attempt, which was watched by tens of thousands of people, Tigz fell short of the ending after failing to find a splint to patch an injury that ultimately led to his death.</p>



<p>That forced him to try again, numerous times.</p>



<p>To honor and recognize that moment, Battlestate Games created a unique <strong>splint </strong>for Tigz’s streamer item – <strong>Tigzresq</strong>. It’s a <strong>67-inch </strong>splint in a red and black design that may or may not be practical. <span>Streamer items&nbsp;<strong>are rarely</strong></span><strong> </strong>practical, but if any will have an honest, in-game use, it’s the Tigzresq.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another streamer item with a practical use is Gingy’s keychain, which does what you’d imagine and holds keys. There’s also WillerZ’s wallet, the RatCola, sprats, and a jar of mayo, amongst other things.</p>



<p>Whenever someone becomes big for streaming Escape from Tarkov, their streamer item is never too far behind. Fans of TheBurntPeanut, who recently won awards at The Streamer Awards, are clamouring for a unique item in Escape from Tarkov, given the amount of time the VTuber (sorry, PTuber) has spent in the game in recent years.</p>



<p>If you had a streamer item in Escape from Tarkov, what would it be? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Saros rating has appeared in Taiwan for the title’s standard and deluxe editions, suggesting pre-orders are imminent. </p>



<p>Housemarque’s Saros is one of the most anticipated titles of 2026 and also the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-is-the-next-game-from-housemarque/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next PlayStation exclusive</a> from the studio after Returnal. We have already seen some gameplay and have a release date for Saros as well; all players are waiting for now is for pre-orders to open. </p>







<h2 id="h-saros-rating-appears-in-taiwan">Saros Rating Appears in Taiwan</h2>



<p>Spotted by Gematsu on <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1997915897218961521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Saros’s standard and digital deluxe editions have been rated in Taiwan. Both versions have been rated ‘PG-15’ and contain violence and shooting according to the rating. Many players think that with the game’s rating surfacing now, a pre-order announcement could arrive soon; however, there is no official word from the developers. Interestingly, the rating has appeared very close to The Game Awards 2025, so could we expect an announcement there? Also, could Saros be the game behind the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-mystery-statue-new-mexico-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mysterious statue</a>?</p>



<p>For those unaware, Saros is an upcoming sci-fi adventure that has players taking on the role of Arjun Devraj, a Soltari enforcer who will stop at nothing to pursue answers on the shape-shifting world of Carcosa. The title features a constantly evolving world, and you will need to find permanent resources to ensure it yields for you. It also features a high-tech arsenal of weapons, which has players dodging, shielding, and parrying enemy attacks in a “fluid, flow-state-inducing dance.”</p>







<p>In other news, check out Saros’s latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-gameplay-release-trailer-state-of-play-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer</a>, revealed during September’s State of Play event.

            <title><![CDATA[Paramount Reveals Hostile Offer for Warner Bros Worth $18 Billion More]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/</link>
            <guid>1376131</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Last week, Netflix revealed an $82.7 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery and carve out a monumental corner of the media streaming empire. Now, Paramount has clapped back with a hostile bid, slamming Netflix and claiming that it had offered an ‘inferior proposal’ for WBD.</p>



<p>Paramount’s representatives have promised a tender offer of $30 per share, compared to Netflix’s $27.75 offer. It’s also a bid to avoid splitting up Warner Bros. Discovery, which is what the Netflix acquisition would do. If Paramount is successful, it’ll acquire WBD in its entirety.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-paramount-or-netflix-buy-warner-bros-discovery">Will Paramount or Netflix Buy Warner Bros. Discovery?</h2>



<p>In a post from <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/paramount-launches-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-1236444601/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, it was confirmed that Paramount had filed a hostile proposal in the wake of Netflix’s revelation in the WBD arena. In a statement, David Ellison, the CEO of Paramount, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company.</p>



<p>Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion. We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process. </p>



<p>We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Hollywood Reporter anticipates a lengthy process to follow, with Paramount and Netflix lobbying and counter-lobbying for the acquisition rights of Warner Bros. Discovery. </p>



<p>In a strange twist, it was later revealed that Paramount published a website dubbed ‘StrongerHollywood’, aimed at rubbing Netflix the wrong way and proving that Paramount’s offer is much more worthwhile for the wider industry.</p>



<p>Whichever media titan is successful, they’ll gain ownership of Warner Bros.’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/">gaming studios</a>, including the likes of Avalanche, NetherRealm, Rocksteady, and TT Games, as well as the WB Games branches.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A fascinating interview with Assassin’s Creed game director Simon Lemay-Comtois has revealed that the team is eager to learn from past mistakes and oversights for future Assassin’s Creed games, such as a lack of parkour focus.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-x-attack-on-titan-crossover-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> was a financial and critical success. It may not go down as peak AC, but it’s a solid return to form. Shadows, in particular, and its post-launch content are looking to bring back a classic gameplay tradition, and have spoken about the use of dual-player mechanics in additional releases down the line.</p>







<h2 id="h-future-assassin-s-creed-games-will-learn-from-mistakes">Future Assassin’s Creed Games Will Learn From Mistakes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not the end of two-player narratives. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>An Insider Gaming exclusive revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-further-details-on-the-assassins-creed-roadmap-and-what-games-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">further details on the Assassin’s Creed Roadmap and what games to expect</a>. There is clearly a long road ahead for the franchise, and Shadows was the latest mainline release.</p>







<p>Shadows game director Simon Lemay-Comtois told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/we-are-hard-to-beat-9-months-since-assassins-creed-shadows-its-associate-director-looks-back-on-what-makes-this-rpg-the-best-in-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that the current release and future AC games should focus on one gameplay mechanic that’s been missing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Pay more attention to parkour in future games as its own pillar. We’re trying to rectify that in post-launch with Shadows and push that narrative internally to say, parkour matters. Let’s really push parkour forward.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Old-school AC fans will remember scaling towns and cities across Italy, whereas recent games have placed less emphasis on verticality in favor of grander open-world design and combat.</p>



<p>There’s still an inherent desire for the basics of Assassin’s Creed roots. Speaking of which, another newer addition (opposing convention) in the last few years has been the incorporation of dual-player stories.</p>



<p>Lemay-Comtois has indicated that the system won’t be going away if it makes sense for the project:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Dual protagonists can be divisive along very strange lines, right? It’s not just a ‘well, I prefer a war, therefore I prefer Yasuke.’ Some people just don’t like one character over the other, and they don’t like to spend time with one. It was true with Evie and Jacob, but with Naoe and Yasuke it’s more divisive. And we knew this. We knew going into it, but I think it can split our fan base a little too.</p>



<p>I think the learning for us is that, yes, we could do more dual-protagonist games in the future –&nbsp;<em>if&nbsp;</em>we have a good reason to do it narratively and for the setting.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We know that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a> won’t be using two-player mechanics, and parkour will be very much part of its DNA.
