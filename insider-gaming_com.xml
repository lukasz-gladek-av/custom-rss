<p>Wraith Ops, a developing first-person shooter from Grassrootz Games and publisher Team 17, has just launched a demo <strong>exclusively </strong>on Steam. The shooter, which is ‘all about gunplay and gameplay first’, has launched the new demo as part of Steam Next Fest, the event that pays tribute to upcoming, developing games across a range of genres.</p>



<p>While the demo is pretty short, it gives a glimpse of what Wraith Ops promises: pure, unadulterated gun-toting action. As the game’s blurb states, there are no immersion-breaking cosmetics, no gacha mechanics, and no ‘silly killstreaks’, all of which are said in a jab at games like Call of Duty.</p>







<h2 id="h-wraith-ops-isn-t-the-next-call-of-duty">Wraith Ops Isn’t The Next Call of Duty</h2>



<p>To say that Wraith Ops is anything like Call of Duty would earn you a scolding from the game’s developer. It’s stressed everywhere on the Steam page and the game’s social channels that it exists as the antithesis of Activision’s first-person shooter franchise, despite bearing similarities.</p>



<p>But then, how different can a first-person shooter truly be from what’s already on the market?</p>



<p>Steam Next Fest has welcomed a small demo for Wraith Ops, which includes a mode called Arena, a 6v6, one-life mode, made playable across three maps: Airfield, Mall, and Submarine. Since the Gamescom demo went live in August 2025, Grassrootz Games has implemented <strong>876 </strong>bug fixes and tweaks, ready for the rollout of this new demo.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Wraith Ops has been neck-deep in the development pipeline for a <strong>very </strong>long time. The game’s social channels <span>launched in 2019, and its&nbsp;<strong>original demo</strong>, under the name ‘Project Wraith’, was listed on Steam as far back as</span> August 2021.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a store listing, FromSoftware’s The Duskbloods could release as early as March 27, 2026. </p>



<p>The Duskbloods is FromSoftware’s exclusive title for the Nintendo Switch 2, which is set to release in 2026. We have received a lot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-details-on-the-duskbloods-revealed-in-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">information</a> about the game since it was announced, and the only thing left now is the release date. It seems one of the retailers might have been informed about the date early. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-duskbloods-listing-points-at-march-2026-release">The Duskbloods Listing Points at March 2026 Release</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2026/02/18/duskbloods-listing-appears-today-on-australian-eshop-and-finnish-retailer-starts-listing-27th-march-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MyNintendoNews</a>, there are two things that point towards The Duskblood’s release date. First, the Finnish online store <a href="https://en.konsolinet.fi/product/36809/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Konsolinet</a> listed the release date as March 27, 2026. The website has been updated, and the date now reads December 31, 2026. Players are wondering whether this is the actual release date or just a placeholder from the website. </p>



<p>The next hint is not for the release date, but probably an announcement of it. The Duskbloods listing now <span>appears on the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000098072" target="_blank">Australian Nintendo eShop</a>;</span> it doesn’t seem to have a release date yet, still showing planned 2026, but a listing appearing may mean&nbsp;an announcement could be around the corner. </p>



<p>The last official update we received for the game was just a few days ago during Kadokawa’s earnings results (FromSoftware’s parent company). It was revealed that both The Duskbloods and Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition are slated to release for the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026. </p>

Additionally, Group SNE is adapting Elden Ring Nightreign into a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/an-elden-ring-nightreign-ttrpg-is-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tabletop RPG</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[League of Legends is Getting Team-Based Voice Chat]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-voice-chat/</link>
            <guid>1440253</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the longest time, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/league-of-legends/" id="335">League of Legends</a> players have found themselves a little restricted when it comes to in-game voice chat. It’s admittedly not everyone’s cup of tea, but voice chat in League has, until now, been restricted to players in a <strong>premade party</strong>. It’s a system that has always operated directly through the game’s client, but it hasn’t ever been perfect.</p>



<p>It was recently discovered that Riot Games plans to blow that concept out of the water, finally adding global team chat that allows you to communicate with people outside your premade group.</p>











<p>It was recently discovered in the Public Beta for League of Legends that a setting is coming up that will allow users to ‘Enable Team Voice Chat’ when they join a lobby. Further to that revelation, dataminers have uncovered references to a full-fledged global voice chat system in League of Legends.</p>



<p>From what we know, it looks like you’ll have two inputs, bindable to whatever input you want. One button will allow you to PTT to talk to your <strong>party</strong>, while the other will allow you to speak to your wider team, even those who weren’t in your premade lobby and joined after the fact, or to fill the lobby.</p>



<p>League of Legends is, unfortunately, one of the most toxic games in the business, and that’s where the issues start to surface in the voice chat stakes. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/riot-games/" id="350">Riot Games</a> does have pretty good moderation mechanics, but opening up a global chat function might invite more chaos than they might like.</p>







<p>Are you looking forward to global, team-based voice chat in League of Legends? Let us know over on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>1440250</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Huggy Wuggy and Kissy Missy are more than just incredibly popular plushies, as they’re central to the plot of Poppy Playtime. Now that Chapter 5 is here, their stories have been continued, though there’s a fair share of ambiguity involved.</p>



<p>Whilst Kissy Missy remains as loyal as ever, Huggy Wuggy continues to be a menace as you work your way through the factory. However, when they’re finally reunited, there’s one question on everyone’s mind: Did Huggy Wuggy or Kissy Missy die?</p>







<p>It goes without saying that <strong>huge spoilers for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime Chapter 5</a> lie ahead</strong>, so only read on if you’re desperate for the answer. </p>

<figure><figcaption>He’s fine… right? Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s unclear whether Huggy Wuggy dies at the end of Poppy Playtime Chapter 5, with the answer being purposefully left ambiguous by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mob-entertainment/" id="3160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mob Entertainment</a>. </strong></p>



<p>After another tense chase, Kissy Missy steps in to save the protagonist, reuniting with Huggy Wuggy at last. The moment doesn’t last long, however, as the Prototype suddenly impales him with its needle-like hand and tosses him aside.</p>

</ul>



<p>Even then, Huggy Wuggy is still visibly moving, lifting his head to look at the Prototype as it prepares another strike. Before anything more happens, the player is forced to flee, and that’s the last time he’s seen. Given his importance to the story, it seems unlikely the developers would kill him off-screen, suggesting he may still be alive—but what about Kissy Missy?</p>

<figure><figcaption>They don’t look fine… Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kissy Missy also falls victim to the Prototype shortly afterwards, suffering a similar impalement, though her fate is also unclear in Poppy Playtime Chapter 5.</strong></p>



<p>She’s last seen lying face down after the attack, which strongly suggests she could be dead. Still, there’s a small hint that she might have survived.</p>

Poppy Playtime Chapter 6, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>After rescuing you, Giblet explains that Poppy has been taken by the Prototype and admits he doesn’t know what happened to Kissy Missy. The fact that her fate is mentioned but not confirmed keeps things uncertain, leaving the door open for her return.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>God of War Ragnarok’s Kratos actor has shared some new details on the upcoming Trilogy Remake. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Sony’s PlayStation State of Play event brought two new announcements for God of War fans: the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmation</a> of the original Trilogy Remake and a shadow drop for the 2D prequel title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sons of Sparta</a>. Now, new information about the trilogy remake has been revealed. </p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-to-include-new-technology-and-fighting-system">God of War Trilogy Remake to Include New Technology and Fighting System </h2>



<p>Spotted in a video posted by RebsGaming on <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024350952476856596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), YouTuber Fuzhpuzy had the opportunity to meet Kratos actor, Christopher Judge, and ask him about the God of War Trilogy Remake. The YouTuber first asks whether Judge will be part of the remake, to which the actor replies, ‘No,’ and adds that it will include TC Carson, the original voice actor for Kratos from the Greek trilogy. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">YouTuber Fuzhpuzy asked God of War voice actor Christopher Judge if he’s in the upcoming GoW Remakes. He said:<br>•Kratos will be voiced by TC Carson in the remakes, Christopher won’t be in it. <br>•Remakes will have new technology, fighting system, and content. <br>•New GoW from Santa… <a href="https://t.co/bCSiIUiJEv">pic.twitter.com/bCSiIUiJEv</a></p>— Rebs Gaming (@Mr_Rebs_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024350952476856596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Judge elaborated that God of War Trilogy Remake is not a reboot and will feature “new technology” and a “new fighting system”. No details were revealed on what this new system would include or how it would change the previous one. Previously, we had only received confirmation that the trilogy remake is in development and were told it would be a long time before we received another update. The announcement also came through TC Carson, who confirmed that he will be voicing Kratos in the remake. </p>







<p>In other news, Christopher Judge has also stated that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-actor-says-new-santa-monica-announcement-will-arrive-late-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Santa Monica announcement</a> is coming late summer.

<p>The actor who played Kratos in God of War 2018 has revealed some details about the trilogy remake and the next Santa Monica announcement. </p>



<p>God of War has been in the news a lot recently, and that’s all thanks to PlayStation’s latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play event</a>, which dropped not but two announcements. There were already reports that Santa Monica was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/santa-monica-developing-more-than-just-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing another title</a> alongside the God of War Trilogy Remake, and now we have some more concrete information. </p>











<p>Spotted by RebsGaming on <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024350952476856596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), YouTuber Fuzhpuzy is seen talking to God of War 2018’s Kratos actor, Christopher Judge, at some fan expo. During their conversation, Judge talks about TC Carson playing Kratos in the trilogy remake before talking about what’s next. Judge states, “You’ll be hearing about what we’re doing probably late summer,” which hints at another announcement from Santa Monica. The video is currently unavailable on the YouTuber’s channel. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">YouTuber Fuzhpuzy asked God of War voice actor Christopher Judge if he’s in the upcoming GoW Remakes. He said:<br>•Kratos will be voiced by TC Carson in the remakes, Christopher won’t be in it. <br>•Remakes will have new technology, fighting system, and content. <br>•New GoW from Santa… <a href="https://t.co/bCSiIUiJEv">pic.twitter.com/bCSiIUiJEv</a></p>— Rebs Gaming (@Mr_Rebs_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024350952476856596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>This is not the first time we have heard about Santa Monica’s other game. In addition to the previous report, insider <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2024186170955944085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NateTheHate</a> has also stated that he has heard the Cory Barlog game will be “shown this year and then released in 2027”. However, one thing is unclear: whether this is the God of War Egypt game or some other IP altogether. Players will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure. </p>







<p>In other news, God of War: Sons of Sparta is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-is-the-worst-rated-game-in-the-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worst-rated game in the series</a>. Additionally, the 2018 title and Ragnarok have <span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-2018-and-ragnarok-have-generated-over-1-4-billion-in-combined-sales/" target="_blank">generated over $1 billion in sales combined</a></span>.

<p>Fortnite is seemingly going to collab with one of the most popular live-action series out there, Game of Thrones. </p>



<p>Collabs are something Fortnite is known for, and the developers have been cooking up some really cool ones lately. Some of the biggest ones we have seen lately are with The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Simpsons</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Park</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-to-feature-quentin-tarantinos-dream-kill-bill-chapter-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kill Bill</a>, Back to the Future, and more. Now, it seems that Epic might have even more in store for us. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-game-of-thrones-is-in-development">Fortnite x Game of Thrones is in Development</h2>



<p>The news about the Game of Thrones and Fortnite collab comes from AdiraFNInfo on <a href="https://x.com/AdiraFNInfo/status/2024434171444101235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) and has been corroborated by reliable leaker, <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/2024434380031017202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>. The collaboration is expected to arrive “soon,” but the contents and scope of this crossover were not revealed. </p>



<p>Game of Thrones is a fantasy drama series by HBO, an adaptation of George R. R. Martin’s novel. It received widespread critical acclaim and spawned spinoffs such as House of the Dragon, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, and more. </p>



<p>Some of the most popular characters from the series include Jon Snow (played by Kit Harrington), Arya Stark (played by Maisie Williams), Daenerys Targaryen (played by Emilia Clarke), Tyrion Lannister (played by Peter Dinklage), and more.
