            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill 2 Remake Coming To Xbox]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bloober Team’s epic Silent Hill 2 remake smashed it out of the park on PS5 and PC. The title was a console exclusive for the PS5, but a new ESRB rating has revealed that the Silent Hill 2 remake is coming to Xbox Series X|S consoles.</p>



<p>It seems the Silent Hill 2 remake was potentially on a timed exclusivity agreement. This is the feeling as the horror remake has been rated by the ESRB for the “Xbox Series.” There’s still no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-switch-2-xbox-rumor-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch port</a> in the open, but the game’s console presence is about to become wider and more terrifying.</p>



<h2 id="h-esrb-rates-silent-hill-2-for-xbox-series-x-s">ESRB Rates Silent Hill 2 For Xbox Series X|S</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Happy Halloween! Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Poor James Sunderland, he has to relive his own personal trauma all over again on Xbox. On the plus side, it’s a nice Halloween treat for Xbox players who’ve upgraded to modern-gen hardware.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40337/silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ESRB</a> website was updated on October 31 (of all dates) to show Silent Hill 2 being certified. The key difference this time is that it’s for “Xbox Series” platforms, and the news comes nearly a year after the PS5 and PC launches.</p>



<p>From what we can tell, nothing’s changed on the rating summary front. It’s still the same Mature 17+ rating, and features the same depraved content, the same gruesome and gory gameplay, and the same “Enemies with body parts sewn together.”</p>



<p>It doesn’t clarify when Silent Hill 2’s remake is coming to Xbox. We’ll have to wait for an official announcement in the future—maybe closer to The Game Awards?</p>



<p>For now, if you’re on Xbox and you haven’t played the second game’s exquisite remake, we advise you to get the sick bags on standby and have a nice supply of light bulbs at the ready, as playing this in the dark will mentally put you in Silent Hill while you’re trying to sleep!</p>



<p>Have you played the Silent Hill 2 remake? What do Xbox players have to look forward to?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sword of Justice is gearing up for a big global launch after achieving huge success in China, and we’ve got all the platform details for the game ahead of release.</p>



<p>The MMORPG offers an in-depth story to enjoy, alongside PvP access and in-depth NPCs powered by AI, and is looking to build on its success in China, where it achieved over four million players in its first month.</p>



<p>If you want to know what platforms you can play Sword of Justice on, we’ve got all the important details.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-sword-of-justice-on-playstation-5">Is Sword of Justice on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No console yet. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Sword of Justice is not available on PlayStation 5 and is exclusive to PC and mobile devices.</strong></p>



<p>Sword of Justice was initially released in China on PC and mobile devices, and the doors are now opening to the rest of the world. However, console players will not be able to jump into the adventure as there is no upcoming PlayStation 5 release or any news about a port.</p>



<p>Given MMO games are much more popular on PC than they are on console, this shouldn’t be too surprising.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-sword-of-justice-on-xbox-series-x-s">Is Sword of Justice on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Sword of Justice is not available on Xbox Series X|S as it is a title exclusive to PC and mobile devices.</strong></p>



<p>Initially released in China on those platforms, Sword of Justice is now launching for the rest of the world, but the door remains shut for those on console, including Xbox Series X|S, as there is no details on any release on the platform.</p>



<p>While that could change in future, it’s unlikely to be on the immediate agenda.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-sword-of-justice-come-to-ps5-or-xbox-series-x-s">Will Sword of Justice Come to PS5 or Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Sword of Justice could release on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S in the future, but this is not guaranteed, and any release will likely be a long way off.</strong></p>



<p>Opening the doors to the rest of the world in Sword of Justice is a big step and will require ongoing support to sustain the player base and ensure there are no major server issues. Perfecting the experience will be top of the agenda.</p>



<p>Whether the door opens to a console release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later down the line remains to be seen but, in truth, there isn’t too much of a need for the title to make the move, as it should achieve huge success on its current platform.</p>



<p>Games like Wuthering Waves have shown you don’t need to release on console, with PC and mobile both offering more than enough access to players.</p>

<p>Offering over 100 hours of single-player story-driven content, with the outcome changing with your playstyle, a big lure of the game is AI-driven NPCs, expanding the dialogue options you will receive.</p>



<p>As ever, though, the exact time you can jump in depends on your location in the world, but we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-sword-of-justice-start-time">Do We Know The Sword of Justice Start Time?</h2>

<p>Fortnite announced that Sidekicks are coming next season, with the first drop in the upcoming Battle Pass followed by new additions to the Item Shop, but it appears they will have a heavy price.</p>



<p>Peels the banana dog will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-announces-return-of-companions-with-new-sidekicks-arriving-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured in The Simpsons-themed Battle Pass</a> from November 1, with subsequent releases including Lil’ Raptor, Spike, Flopsticks, Cuddle Team Jr, and Bonesy in the Item Shop from November 7.</p>



<p>Ahead of that launch, leakers have uncovered the prices for those in the Item Shop, and the hefty price point is causing a stir in the community.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1984097137723109799/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaked by ShiinaBR</a>, the prices for Sidekick in the Item Shop will range from 1,200 V-Bucks to 1,500 V-Bucks, the same price range that collab skins have in the shop.</p>



<p>Flopsticks, for example, is priced at 1,500 V-Bucks, a higher price than the 1,200 V-Bucks it costs for the original outfit, and the same price as the new Alien Xenomorph skin that released today.</p>



<p>The prices for the Sidekicks have attracted more controversy amid customization rules, which make some choices, like the color of a dog, permanent, and the same Sidekick will need to be purchased again to choose a different appearance. Styles, meanwhile, include clothing and similar items, which can be adjusted.</p>



<p>While Sidekicks could be included in the Battle Pass regularly moving forward, there is no guarantee this will happen, as the release of Kicks last year has been oriented around them being purchasable in the Item Shop and not as an earnable reward.</p>



<p>Prices could still be adjusted before release too, though usually leaks of this nature are accurate when it comes to upcoming releases.</p>
