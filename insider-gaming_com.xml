<p>Ella Purnell, one of the faces of the Fallout TV show that debuted on Prime this year, is soaking up source material in anticipation of the show’s second season. Purnell, who plays Lucy MacLean, fronted the Emmy Award-winning show when the first season was released in April, working alongside Walton Goggins and Aaron Moten to bring the post-apocalyptic universe to life.</p>



<p>In a string of posts on social media, Purnell revealed that she’s been instructed to play Fallout: New Vegas to ‘prep for a certain job I may or may not be on soon’.</p>

<p>Fallout premiered in April 2024 to an overwhelmingly positive reception, emerging as one of Prime’s biggest launches ever. It proved to be a boon for the entire franchise, as player counts soared across everything from Fallout 4 to the online title, Fallout 76. It was a resurgence of sorts for the series, and for a while, Fallout mania was running wild.</p>



<p>On Bluesky, Ella Purnell posted that she’s playing Fallout: New Vegas – on Xbox – in preparation for filming the show’s second season, which was due to start in November but may have been delayed, if Purnell’s post is anything to go by.</p>

<p>Purnell responded to some fan requests to head north through Quarry Junction after starting the game, realising several hours later how much of a mistake that was. New Vegas veterans will understand why that’s such a problem.</p>



<p>This morning, Purnell posted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Obviously time isn’t on my side to absorb all the source material in time. I will still absorb the game until I’m called to the wasteland.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fallout: New Vegas is considered the best game in the series by many, and we <strong>know </strong>that it’s the setting for the second season per the closing moments of the show’s first season.</p>
