<p>Game developers are responsible for creating a game that is playable by the most players. However, this duty doesn’t end when the number of platforms on which the game is released increases. One priority of game development is accessibility, which means making the game more accessible for all types of players by creating unique tools that allow everyone to experience it. Today, we will discuss Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Accessibility Features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth now has the highest all-time player peak on Steam compared to all single-player games from the series. </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sets-highest-steam-peak-for-series-single-player-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has amassed over 40,000 players on Steam, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2909400/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. This record is more than double the prequel, as Final Fantasy 7 Remake still sits at a peak of around 14,000. Final Fantasy 16 also lags behind, with the game’s peak ending at over 27,000 players. The only game with a higher player count is Final Fantasy 14, sitting at 95,000 players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reviews for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Steam have also been favourable. Out of all the reviews, 77.4% are positive, and 22.6% are negative; overall, reviews for the PC port have been ‘mostly positive’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Surprisingly, even though Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is the second game of the FF VII remake trilogy, it has still managed to pull in more concurrent players than the previous instalment. The sequel follows the journey of Cloud, Tifa, and the gang as they start exploring the planet on Chocobos after escaping from Midgar. They are chasing the fallen hero, Sephiroth; however, he will not make the journey easy for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, developers have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-developers-have-already-written-part-3s-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already finished writing the story</a> for Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3. Additionally, Part 3 will not be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-release-on-a-wide-range-of-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive to PlayStation 6</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shaodws-censored/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows%E2%80%99-graphic-content-will-be-censored-in-japan.1092564/</guid>

<p>The announcement came from Ubisoft, who said that some graphical content will be censored in Japan in order to comply with the Japanese rating board CERO.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1882611785775174070/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement</a> posted to X (formerly Twitter), and translated via <a href="https://www.deepl.com/en/translator/l/ja/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">deepl</a>, Ubisoft Japan said, “In order to comply with the regulations of the reviewing authorities, the Japanese version of “Assassin’s Creed Shadows” (CERO:Z) will differ in some of the game’s expressions.</p>



<p>“The game settings have been changed so that the player cannot amputate the head and limbs of enemies at any time during play. The expression of the cut surface of the body has been changed,” it continued.</p>



<p>Ubisoft’s decision comes following the Japanese rating board CERO’s ‘Z’ rating, which although means that the game cannot be sold to anyone over 18, CERO still determined that the game was too violent to be sold in Japan. Ubisoft’s change means that the game can now be sold in Japan, but still have the CERO Z rating.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time that Japan has imposed such strict rules on games either. In 2023, CERO banned the Dead Space Remake due to violence and also banned The Callisto Protocol in 2022. On the other hand, Stellar Blade passed with a CERO D rating, meaning the game  is not suitable for those under the game of 17. </p>



<p>Following two delays, Assassin’s Creed Shadows officially launches March 20, 2025 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X and PC.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ubisoft’s decision to censor the game in Japan? Do you agree with CERO’s rating on the game? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
