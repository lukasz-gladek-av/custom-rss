<p>PlayStation recently revealed that it provided extensive support during development to Game Science, a developer of Black Myth Wukong, among others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/black-myth-wukong-received-tons-of-support-from-sonys-content-ventures-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingBolt</a>, a <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/leadership-spotlight-a-conversation-with-phil-rosenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new interview</a> with Phil Rosenberg, SVP of Global Partner Development and Relations at Sony Interactive Entertainment, revealed details about third-party games receiving support from PlayStation. Rosenberg first stated that the Content Ventures team at Sony is excellent at identifying new franchises and bringing them on. They have discovered games like Stray, Genshin Impact, Black Myth Wukong, Stellar Blade, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rosenberg added that there’s “nobody better in the world” than Christian Svensson and Shawne Benson at finding these hidden gems and “nurturing up-and-coming companies” that are usually very difficult to find. Moreover, the third-party account management team and the partner development team at Sony provide “tons of support” to games like Black Myth Wukong, Stray, and more, as they are often the first points of contact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were rumours earlier last year that Black Myth Wukong had not been released on Xbox due to an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-has-exclusivity-deal-with-playstation-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exclusivity deal</a> with Sony. Also, a Microsoft representative later added that the delay was not due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-isnt-delayed-due-to-xbox-platform-limitations-microsoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platform limitations</a>. However, early this year, the CEO and founder of Game Science confirmed that the Xbox port for Black Myth Wukong didn’t arrive due to<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-xbox-delay-caused-by-series-s-issues-ceo-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> optimisation issues on the Series S</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a Black Myth Wukong knockoff has appeared on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-knock-off-appears-on-nintendo-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo’s Store</a>. Also, check out the CEO’s views on Wukong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-science-ceo-reveals-his-views-on-black-myth-wukong-not-winning-goty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not winning GOTY</a>.

<p>In a new press release by Capcom, it has been announced that Monster Hunter Wilds has passed 10 million units sold in its first month of release.</p>



<p>The press release also reconfirmed that the first free title update will be released later this week and that the second update for the game will be released in the summer. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds impressive sales numbers puts it on pace to easier match Monster Hunter World, which went on to sell 22 million units since its release.</p>



<p>But it’s success wasn’t without its issues. On release, Monster Hunter Wilds surpassed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.3 million concurrent players</a>, but was criticised for its lack of PC optimisation. </p>



<p>“This game is absolutely amazing – but has the worst optimisation I’ve ever seen,” said one Steam user.</p>



<p>That being said, Monster Hunter Wilds continues to be a success for Capcom and the games multiple updates since release has addressed a lot of issues pertaining to PC optimisation.</p>



<p>As for where the success will end remains to be seen, but Wilds’ next target will likely to be to try and overtake Monster Hunter Wilds place to become the best-selling Monster Hunter game in the series.</p>



<p>Do you think Monster Hunter Wilds has enough lets to hit 22 million units sold? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>
