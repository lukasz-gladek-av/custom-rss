<p>It’s been an usual couple of months for Wildlight Entertainment’s Highguard, mostly in part to the constant abuse the game has recieved for its lack of marketing since its The Game Awards announcement.</p>



<p>But now, we know why.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-was-meant-to-be-a-shadowdrop">It was Meant to be a Shadowdrop</h2>



<p>During a behind-the-scenes presentation with press and creators, Vice President of Product and Publishing Jason Torfin and Lead Designer Mohammed Alavi sat down with attendees of the event to answer questions. </p>



<p>As expected, one of the main questions was around the games marketing, or should we say lack thereof, and that’ss because the game was always intended to follow a similar release to Apex Legends; a shadowdrop. However, sometime in 2025, The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley put a spanner in the works because he was stoked for the game and wanted to reveal it.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-highguard-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – Complete Highguard Trophy L</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-highguard-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/">ist—How To Get All Achievements &amp; Trophies<br></a></strong><br>Speaking at the event (thanks <a href="https://xboxera.com/2026/01/26/highguard-was-meant-to-be-a-shadowdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a>) on the original plans, Tofin said, “I think the fact that we’re independent and that we’re smart with how we run our business and build our team means that we have those luxuries. We’re not beholden to shareholders or any sort of other corporate shenanigans, and it allows us to have that sort of confidence. And from the get-go, you can’t bank on commercial success right out of the gate. If you do that, you’re probably going to fail most of the time.”</p>







<p>“And that’s why we were going to shadow drop.” he said “Let the game speak for itself. It was always the plan. And then, you know, Geoff came in the past year and he played the game. I mean, he really liked it and he was stoked. And we had an opportunity and we decided, okay, we can make a trailer that would be in our shadow-drop. And so the one we put there [at The Game Awards] was the one that would be the first thing you saw in the shadow-drop, followed by twenty-five minutes of other context. And unfortunately, that trailer wasn’t meant to be the thing to ‘educate’.” </p>

</p></figure>



<p>So, there you have it. Highguard’s marketing wasn’t bad persay, it just changed on a whim and kind of shot themselves in the foot for a couple of months.</p>



<p>It explains why past rumours said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard wasn’t a paid placement</a>, despite it being the show’s last trailer (something traditionally reserved for the absolute best stuff). It simply was because Geoff Keighley liked it… Case closed!</p>



<p>Whether it means the game is good or not is another story… I guess only time will tell!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A medieval massacre awaits in Half Sword. The innovative physics game wants you to maim, and blood will be the price of glory. In terms of Half Sword’s actual price and how much it costs, that’s where this guide enters the fight.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming described Half Sword as ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hilarious-medieval-combat-early-access-half-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most hilarious medieval combat sim</a>.’ If you’ve not seen it yet, you need to. Thousands of you have already begun your crusade to lop off limbs and put down your enemies like dirty dogs, courtesy of the free demo.</p>



<p>Eventually, Half Sword will be available to buy, and this is where you need to know its cost and price tag.</p>







<h2 id="h-half-sword-price-explained">Half Sword Price, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I challenge you to a duel. Credit to Half Sword Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s been confirmed through the Half Sword Discord that the combat game will be under $30 when it launches in early access, with a discount at launch.</strong></p>



<p>There isn’t a more concrete price tag at the moment, but the faq section in the Half Sword Discord has clarified some price details:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Price is still TBA. It will be less then $30 and the first two weeks of EA will feature a discount.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>You’ve got a brief window to get early access for a more bank account-friendly price. The Half Sword Discord is extremely active with thousands of players, and the development team provides updates regularly. There’s every chance there will be a full price tag update before launch; if not, everyone will find out together on release day.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-half-sword-have-microtransactions">Does Half Sword Have Microtransactions?</h2>



<p><strong>You might be pleased to hear that Half Sword will feature no microtransactions of any kind.</strong></p>



<p>Diverting back to the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1043854763189600337/1272470349245579396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">faq</a>, when addressing the question of “Will there be microtransactions?” it has a simple and blunt, one-word answer: “No.”</p>



<p>There might be some free extra content released after launch, or maybe fuller expansions (it is only early access, though), but it’s confirmed there will be no microtransactions.</p>



<p>Half Sword easily looks like one of the most promising and fun games of 2026. The concept looks brutal, and the price tag isn’t going to give your wallet a headache. Will you be going all in on Half Sword early access?
