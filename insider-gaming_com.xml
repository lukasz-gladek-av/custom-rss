<p>We’ve finally learned about Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s first DLC—Mega Dimension. It adds new Mega Evolutions and missions, but we’ve also learned that your Pokémon can go above Level 100—a series first.</p>



<p>For decades, the rule on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-first-year-revenue-estimates-hit-1-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> has been simple: Once your Mon reaches Level 100, it has pretty much reached the peak of its powers. Yes, it will be extraordinarily strong and unbeatable, and one of them can pretty much sit on the Elite Four single-handedly, but Level 101 is out of the question.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-go-over-the-level-100-pokemon-cap-in-mega-dimension-dlc">You Can Go Over The Level 100 Pokémon Cap In Mega Dimension DLC</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Level 162?? Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you look at the screenshot above, you can see the new Mega Baxcalibur and its mind-blowing <strong>Lv. 162 status</strong>. So, not only are we breaching Level 100 for the first time, we’re completely jumping the shark.</p>



<p>As shown by the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A DLC trailer for Mega Dimensions</a>, Pokémon can finally breach the max level cap.</p>



<p>An official <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Discover-Hyperspace-Lumiose-and-New-Mega-Evolutions-in-Pokemon-Legends#:~:text=Venturing%20into%20Hyperspace%20Lumiose,strange%20events%20befalling%20Lumiose%20City" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a> explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In&nbsp;Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension,&nbsp;Trainers will revisit Lumiose as spatial distortions begin to form around the city. Donut chef Ansha and her companion, the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa, will guide players as they explore the mysterious dimension known as Hyperspace Lumiose. This not-quite Lumiose City is home to newly discovered Mega-Evolved Pokémon and other Pokémon not usually found in Lumiose, <strong>some of which can exceed the normal limit of Lv. 100 with hyperspace levels.</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This seems like a gimmick feature exclusive to the Mega Dimension DLC. We’re not 100% how the mechanic works, but it’s likely these will only be temporary level boosts, and your Pokémon won’t be able to stay above Level 100 for the entire game.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6’s lead producer has revealed how bots work in the game. </p>



<p>Bots in Battlefield 6 have been a subject of conversation since the open beta days, with some players annoyed about the frequency of bots and others happy to have some non-sweaty lobbies. The title also added a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-casual-mode-added-with-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Breakthrough mode</a> recently, which adds 32 bots in each match. Now the developers have revealed how BF6 bots actually work. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-bots-only-appear-for-these-reasons">Battlefield 6 Bots ‘Only’ Appear for These Reasons</h2>



<p>The lead producer for Battlefield 6, David Sirland, revealed what criteria need to be met for bots to enter and leave lobbies. Sirland’s latest post on <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986036167209357732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) was a lengthy thread intended to clarify the confusion surrounding bots in BF6. The lead producer revealed that bots will enter regular playlists “only under these conditions: players kickstart a lobby for a playlist, and the pre-round takes longer than X minutes (I believe 3 minutes)”. When that happens, bots will enter to “fill the server to the necessary limit.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bots enter the game on regular playlists ONLY under these conditions: <br>– players kickstart a lobby for a playlist, and the pre-round takes longer than X minutes (I believe 3 minutes)<br>At that point, the bots fill the server to the necessary limit to start the game</p>— David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1986036167209357732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Sirland adds that there should be 24 players per side, he believes, for “CQ for ex”. This allows players to battle against bots instead of waiting in line. While they are playing, “other players in the same region matchmaking on that same playlist – will join this server (as it has you on it).” Whenever a new player joins the lobby, a bot will leave, and when the lobby is filled with 24 players, it will no longer be seeded with bots. The rest of the slots are left for other players as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-alternative-for-bots-in-battlefield-6-is-waiting-possibly-forever">The Alternative for Bots in Battlefield 6 is Waiting “Possibly Forever” </h2>



<p>If the developers do not use this Battlefield 6 bots system, the other alternative is “full on waiting (possibly forever)” to play on your preferred playlists in regions with low populations to fill a server. Moreover, players need to stay with the bots for the server to fill with regular players.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The alternative to doing this, would be full on waiting (possibly forever) to play on the playlist of your choice in regions with low population. <br>but to fill a server (the first in the region) – you need to stay with the bots. <br>if you keep leaving because: 1: you see bots</p>— David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1986036848511398177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Sirland concluded, stating that they can and will “can and will test longer wait limits for the seed bots to kick in” for Battlefield 6. Lastly, there are also “onboarding bots” which are used in specific game modes for new players. However, these are different from seeded bots as they “stick around and populate a big chunk of the total players on each team.”</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6’s most frustrating challenges <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-frustrating-challenges-fixed-or-reduced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been fixed or greatly reduced</a>. Additionally, the game has reportedly sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million copies across all platforms</a>.
