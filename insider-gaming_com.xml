<p>Earlier this year, Neil Newbon revealed the Pixel Pack, a stunning representation of some of the finest talent in gaming. The goal of the Pixel Pack is to better represent actors in games, oppose the arduous rise of AI voice replication, and provide a stalwart figure of inspiration to a community that’s facing many difficulties.</p>



<p>At the BAFTA Games Awards in London, I chatted with Neil Newbon about the Pixel Pack and what’s next for the group, learning more about the impact AI is having on skilled actors and developers everywhere.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>

<h2 id="h-the-problem-is-awareness">‘The Problem is Awareness’</h2>



<p>Neil Newbon couldn’t tell me too much about what the Pixel Pack had in the pipeline, but I picked up a nice mission statement for the group:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re deciding how we can use and galvanise the goodwill that we’ve got at the moment and also how to better represent and try to champion actors. A big part of it is really just about the conversation to not use AI to supplement performers, but also on the fact that game actors are <strong>actors</strong>, we’re not just voice actors, and we’re doing as good work as films and television, theatre… </p>



<p>Actually, just to make people aware that some of these incredible, talented people should continue to work. </p>



<p>There’s a lot of talk about AI performers, it’s honestly boring as hell, nobody really wants to use them. I have spoken to many people in the industry, developers as well.</p>



<p>The problem is awareness of this, it’s making people aware that these actors are doing such incredible, sometimes very challenging experiences, in a good way… But they deserve to be honoured.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of the chief goals of the Pixel Pack is to show that ‘anybody from any background can enter into games,’ and to accomplish that, the group is made up of a wide variety of professionals, from motion capture artists to voice actors, and from creature performers to performance capture experts.</p>







<p>Neil continued, and our discussion turned more earnestly towards the use of AI for replication and replacement: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think the point is making awareness of it and saying it’s absolutely not cool, that is a big part of the fight, because ultimately, it comes down to the consumer of the games, the player of the games. Are they going to be as satifsifed with really substandard performances, because I personally think that narrative is the same as gameplay now. </p>



<p>Back in the day, the gameplay was the thing, narrative was sort of shoved in there a little bit, not always but a lot of the time. Now, I think that people have the appetite for great narrative as well as great gameplay, but I think that’s a big part of defending against misuse of AI, because people just don’t want it, ultimately. </p>



<p>Some of the people I’ve spoken to, <strong>nobody is interested in playing a game that’s made by AI</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The lack of the human element is always key in these debates. There are certain things that AI can’t replicate, such as the natural imperfection of humanity, which Neil said can often lead to ‘happy accidents’ in a creative environment. In his words, ‘You can’t reproduce that, you can’t create that through software – you just <strong>can’t</strong>.’</p>



<p>The Pixel Pack will undoubtedly be making its collective voice heard very soon as these topics continue to thrive in the wider gaming industry.</p>

    <div>
        
<p>According to a LinkedIn profile, it seems Warner Bros Games has been working on an unannounced IP slated to launch in 2025.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1909871298517360983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Timur222</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/hot-on-the-heels-of-its-open-world-wonder-woman-game-cancelation-warner-bros-games-is-apparently-working-on-a-new-unannounced-ip-thats-set-to-launch-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Brandon Maraia’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonmaraia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn profile</a> shows him as the Game Design Lead at Warner Bros Games since 2023. Under the ‘Experience’ section of his profile, Maraia states that he has been working as the Manager of Game Design “for a new unannounced IP game” for Warner Bros Games that is “launching in 2025.”</p>



<p>It is hard to tell which unannounced IP Warner Bros Games might be working on, especially after they recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-warner-bros-games-cancels-wonder-woman-shuts-down-multiple-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed multiple studios</a>. In February this year, it was revealed that Monolith Studios, the developers behind the cancelled Shadow of Mordor series and the cancelled Wonder Woman game, were being shut down. Along with Monolith, Player First Games, the developer of the now discontinued title Multiversus, and WB Sand Diego were shut down.</p>



<p>Warner Bros Games recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-canceled-by-warner-bros/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled a highly anticipated DLC</a> for one of their established franchises. It was revealed last month that Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition and DLC were cancelled as part of the “ongoing restructure at the entertainment company’s video game unit.” Also, there were concerns about whether the “amount of content was substantial enough to justify the price.”</p>



<p>Which unannounced IP do you think Warner Bros Games might be working on to release in 2025? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

    <div>
        
<p>This Wednesday morning started with a nice surprise for PlayStation fans. Well, at least for some of them.</p>



<p>As highlighted by the X profile <strong><a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN">Genki_JPN</a></strong> (via <a href="https://x.com/chi_m02/status/1909784608733884842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">chi_m02</a>), the company has initiated the distribution of animated backgrounds to a select group of users. These backgrounds are associated with various intellectual properties fans cherish, including Demon’s Souls, Days Gone, Ghost of Yotei, Astro Bot, and others.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that these backgrounds are related to the Welcome Page of the dashboard. They do not appear to be full themes like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-classic-themes-are-leaving-but-they-might-return-soon/">classic ones</a> released to celebrate the company’s 25th anniversary.</p>



<p>This feature has been a highly requested addition by PlayStation 5 owners, and indications suggest that PlayStation has finally heeded the desires of its fanbase by enabling the customization, despite some limitations, of the console’s background display.</p>



<p>The situation is a bit weird due to the lack of any official announcement from Sony at the company’s social profiles. Because of this, it remains unconfirmed whether this functionality is currently in a testing phase or if it is a feature that will be made available to all users throughout the course of this week.</p>



<p>What do you think about Sony releasing Animated PlayStation 5 Backgrounds for the welcome page? Tell us in the comments and join the discussion on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">forum</a>!</p>
