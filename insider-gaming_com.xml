<p>It has been claimed that a Fortnite collaboration is coming with <strong>South Park</strong>, the animated show that has been running since the late 1990s. On social media, a claim emerged alongside a source, with the uploader suggesting that someone <strong>at Paramount </strong>corroborated the leak.</p>



<p>Fans quickly busied themselves imagining how it would work, given that South Park characters are fairly diminutive in stature and stand all of about a few feet tall.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-south-park-coming-to-fortnite">Is South Park Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://xcancel.com/SamLeakss/status/1982196155606786464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SamLeakss claimed</a> that South Park is coming to Fortnite in a crossover event.</p>



<p>Far from being the most unlikely thing in the world, players have accepted that this is gospel and have started assembling theories to explain how the collab would work. One user quickly shared an outfit that <strong>might just work</strong>:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Others suggested that Epic Games would be throwing Cartman into a Mech Suit, while others demanded the arrival of Mr. Hanky as a Back Bling item. Those familiar with the South Park universe pointed out that ‘anime versions’ of the characters could be used, but that’s perhaps a little too niche to be a commercial success.</p>



<p>We know nothing beyond the original claim, unfortunately.</p>



<p>In recent Fortnite news, it was revealed that the developers of the Roblox game ‘Steal a Brainrot’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steal-a-brainrot-developers-sue-fortnite-copycat/">are trying to sue</a> Fortnite UGC developers who have allegedly ripped off their creation. This is being taken pretty seriously, as Steal a Brainrot has become one of the most popular Roblox games in record time in recent months.</p>



<p>Also, <strong>The Simpsons </strong>are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-springfield-map-coming-crossover/">coming to Fortnite</a> with a themed map.</p>



<p>Do you want to see any particular South Park characters surface in this collaboration with Fortnite? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A recent YouTube video has revealed 40 minutes of gameplay from Wreckreation, the open-world sandbox racer. Eagle-eyed gamers spotted the upload and have been poring over the gameplay, which shows a halfway-decent racer with destruction elements and arcade-like racing mechanics.</p>



<p>Wreckreation is set to drop on October 28, and I’m hoping for a solid day-one patch, as there are more than a few bugs in the gameplay video uploaded by ‘Flotutu’ on YouTube.</p>



<h2 id="h-burnout-in-the-big-2025">Burnout in the Big 2025</h2>



<p>We’ve not seen a new Burnout game for more than 15 years, which feels pretty harrowing. Once upon a time, Burnout offered a high-octane, energetic racing experience punctuated with visceral crashes and takedown systems.</p>



<p>Wreckreation comes <strong>from the creators </strong>of the Burnout series, and it’s an all-new adventure set in a massive open-world map with sandbox mechanics. The game is designed to be pretty open-ended, offering multiplayer gameplay, stacks of customization, and some construction features that allow you to flex your imagination.</p>



<p>Here’s the video featuring the 40 minutes of Wreckreation gameplay that was uploaded recently:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="WRECKREATION🚓 v1.1 Gameplay Découverte FR en 4K sur PS5 🎮 Le Burnout où TU construis tout ! 🏗️" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/taEd4HPhN_w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>As the gameplay unravels, prospective fans will spot a few bugs involving the game’s physics and destruction-based elements. At one point, the player crashes into a truck and glitches inside it, clipping like crazy until the game forces a cutscene.</p>



<p>It’s relatively safe to assume that a day-one patch will drop on October 28 alongside the launch of the game to address some of these lingering issues. That’s the problem with playing a game early; it’s often not representative of the final product.</p>



<p>It looks good enough, though. It’s mostly unlicensed and focuses more on high-speed, arcade action than realism, but that’s what people <strong>want </strong>from former Burnout developers.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll be investing in Wreckreaction? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-redsec-duos-squads-launch-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-battle-royale-redsec-will-have-duos-and-squads-at-launch-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1335040/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 RedSec Battle Royale will only be available in Duos and Squads at launch, one insider claims. Once known as Firestorm, we reported that it has changed its name to RedSec and will be shadow dropping on October 28th.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, another story has emerged that may confirm a pretty interesting addition to the mode. While nothing is yet confirmed, the leaker in question has leaked many details about the upcoming mode, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6s-new-battle-royale-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the name</a> and mode itself.</p>



<h2 id="h-duos-and-squads-are-only-team-options-for-battlefield-6-redsec-claims-insider">Duos and Squads Are Only Team Options for Battlefield 6 RedSec, Claims Insider</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 BF6 BR LAUNCH PLAYLIST 🚨</p><p>EXCLUSIVE: Duos (2) and Squads (4) is currently planned to be the ONLY team sizes available at launch for the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale / RedSec.</p><p>So with 100 player count max thats a total of 25 teams of 4 or 50 teams of 2 in every match of RedSec <a href="https://t.co/Uy2D7vlCUh">pic.twitter.com/Uy2D7vlCUh</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1982171308839276707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post from <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1982171308839276707?t=p0lnGa3QMgZbPQs634JShw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ModernWarzone</a>, which we reported on yesterday for the name RedSec, they claim that Battlefield 6’s battle royale mode will only be available in Duos and Squads. That means only groups of two and groups of four will be the only formations playable. Fortunately, the insider claims it will only be for launch, so future builds may expand that number. As they point out, the 100 player count could be made of 50 teams of two and/or 25 teams of four.</p>



<p>With 100 players, it’s sure to be quite the spectacle. The popularity of EA’s military shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has only grown</a> since its release earlier in October. While the surprise shadow drop isn’t going to be exactly how they may have planned it, it’s no doubt going to hit big. Other titles like Fortnite and Call of Duty have done the genre, so it’s natural that Battlefield is going there. Still, it may be a bit disappointing for some who wish to go in by themselves or with a group of five or more.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-steam-player-count-spike-pve-mode-2025/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new mode for Marvel Rivals has caused a major player spike on Steam, its highest in a while.</p>



<p>Released in December 2024, the free-to-play multiplayer superhero shooter has been going steady. With the release of Season 4, which added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-showcases-daredevils-duelist-moves-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daredevil</a> and Angela, the game has seen a decent, stable player base. While not as high as when its first season dropped, touting a 644,269 player count, it still ranks as one of the most popular games on Steam. In any case, earlier this week, the numbers rose quite a bit, heading into numbers only seen for the beginning of a season. Well, a new mode, one fans have been asking for for quite a while, has been added.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-pve-marvel-zombies-mode-almost-doubles-marvel-rivals-usual-player-count">New PvE Marvel Zombies Mode Almost Doubles Marvel Rivals’ Usual Player Count</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/#1w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, earlier this week, Marvel Rivals kept at a usual 75k-80k player count, decreasing from the start of Season 4.5 with Daredevil. However, on October 23rd, the game spiked into the high 120k, almost double what it was the previous day. It continued into yesterday and today. The reason? The addition of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-pve-zombies-mode-arrives-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Zombies PvE mode</a> lets players fight against AI enemies. Based on the comic and new animated series, the limited-time Halloween-based mode brings it to life with droves of zombies and perilous fights with friends. </p>



<p>A quick look at Reddit supports the rise quite well, as many fans have praised the mode a ton. Some, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rivals/comments/1oeqvfe/holy_fucking_shit_is_the_marvel_zombies_game_mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Living-Ad102</a>, want it to be a permanent addition to the game. Given that PvE has been asked for since the game’s release, the massive spike isn’t too surprising. If anything, it’s clear that NetEase may want to do more of these events. Either way, if you want in on the fun, best to do it before mid-November while Marvel Zombies lasts. </p>



<p>Have you played the Marvel Zombies mode in Marvel Rivals yet? If so, how is it? Would you like to see PvE added permanently to the base game? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-october-26-868/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-868-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-sunday-october-26.1334977/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a sleepy Sunday, but it’s also time to wrap up your week with another round of NYT Connections hints and solutions. Today’s puzzle will be easy for some, including <strong>boxing fans</strong>, but I’ve still provided the best hints around so that you can get things finished as fast as possible, then get on with the rest of your weekend.</p>



<p>Read on to get the full scope of today’s NYT Connections hints.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-26">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 26)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #868:</p>



<ul>
<li>BEE</li>



<li>BUTTERFLY</li>



<li>FLOAT</li>



<li>STING</li>



<li>BRASS</li>



<li>PERCUSSION</li>



<li>STRING</li>



<li>WIND</li>



<li>BEAUTY</li>



<li>POPULARITY</li>



<li>STARING</li>



<li>TALENT</li>



<li>DOGGY</li>



<li>DROPLET</li>



<li>KITCHENETTE</li>



<li>STARLING</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think orchestra sections! These are categories of musical instruments</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These all describe creatures or actions associated with light movement or flight</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These words relate to qualities often judged or admired in people or performances</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>This group plays with diminutives or cozy-sounding words</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 26.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-26-868">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 26 (#868)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BRASS, PERCUSSION, STRING, WIND</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BEE, BUTTERFLY, FLOAT, STING</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BEAUTY, POPULARITY, STARING, TALENT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – DOGGY, DROPLET, KITCHENETTE, STARLING</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
