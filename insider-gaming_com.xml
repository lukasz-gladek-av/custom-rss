<p>The function behind the mysterious “C” button on the new Nintendo Switch 2 has been revealed, adding a new built-in chat feature that should feal very familiar to Discord users. Players have been speculating on what the C button could be in the weeks leading up to today’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-will-feature-gamechat-its-own-built-in-version-of-discord">Nintendo Switch 2 Will Feature GameChat, Its Own Built-In Version of Discord</h2>



<p>Hitting the “C” button will open the new GameChat program, which includes several features you’d see in third-party chat programs like Discord. Players will be able to chat with one another in a call, share their screens, and appear on video (with the new external Switch 2 camera). This feature was the first primary new feature shown during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will also include a built-in microphone, that Nintendo claims will be able to pick up your voice “clearly from a distance” even if there’s noise around you. GameChat will work in both handheld mode and while in a stand. It’s clear though that the Switch 2 is limited in how well it can display shared streams from other players, as the trailer shown at the Direct showed them having a very low frame rate.</p>



<p>A Nintendo Switch Online membership will be required to use GameChat, however, it will be available without a membership for a limited “open-access” period. Any Switch 2 user will be able to use GameChat without a Nintendo Switch Online membership until March 31, 2026.</p>



<p>Is GameChat what you were hoping for out of the Ninendo Switch 2’s “C” button? Let us know which in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo has announced during the Nintendo Direct that the Switch 2 will support up to 120 FPS, HDR, and 4K.</p>



<p>The announcement also revealed that the Nintendo Switch 2 will have a 1080p screen.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that not all games on the Nintendo Switch 2 will be at 120 FPS, as a small disclaimer at the bottom of the segment specifically said, “120fps only available in compatible games”.</p>



<p>Announced at the Direct was also the first Nintendo Switch 2 game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>, which you can learn more about here.</p>

<p>Nintendo has officially announced Mario Kart World for the Nintendo Switch 2. After being teased during the console’s initial reveal, we have confirmation it’s skidding onto the Switch 2 as a debut launch title.</p>



<p>The long-awaited reveal came during the company’s Nintendo Direct Switch 2 unveiling event on April 2. Mario Kart World, AKA Mario Kart 9, is the follow-up to 2014’s Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U. The game was also rereleased on the original Nintendo Switch in 2017 as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Since then, it has grown to receive dozens of new tracks and many new characters for players.</p>



<p>But it’s time for a pit stop as we’re ready to go full throttle in Mario Kart World.</p>

<p>Mario Kart World will support races with up to 24 players, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-9-could-feature-new-24-player-races/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirming what many believed</a> after the original tease in January, and introduces new dynamic levels and even rail grinding!</p>



<p>We’ve only seen a handful of Mario Kart World footage, but I can already tell you we’re going to lose hundreds of hours to Mario-theme circuits all over again!</p>
