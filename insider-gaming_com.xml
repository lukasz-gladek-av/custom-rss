<p>Matt Booty, the new Xbox Chief Content Officer, says there is no AI directive coming from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/microsoft/" id="189">Microsoft </a>and clarifies Xbox’s stance on the technology.</p>



<p>On Friday, February 20, 2026, a major shake-up occurred at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/microsoft-games/" id="1707">Microsoft Gaming</a>. Phil Spencer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-sarah-bond-resigns/" id="178338">retired</a>, and Sarah Bond, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sarah-bond-shares-memo-to-her-team-following-departure-at-xbox/" id="178381">previously the president of Xbox</a>, resigned. In their place, Asha Sharma was named the new CEO of Microsoft Gaming, and Matt Booty was named the new CCO. Both share the title of EVP.</p>



<h2 id="h-matt-booty-says-no-ai-directive-from-microsoft">Matt Booty Says No AI Directive from Microsoft</h2>



<p>Asha Sharma previously headed Microsoft’s CoreAI division. As a result, there have been many questions about the future of AI implementation in Xbox games. Now, Matt Booty is speaking out to clarify that there is no directive from Microsoft’s higher-ups to send her development in AI.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with Windows Central’s Jez Corden</a>, Booty said there was no plan to enforce some kind of AI mandate. Still, he noted that developers are free to use whatever tools they want. Also, he clarified the vision for AI within Xbox: to be additive and supportive of developers.</p>



<p>“We’ve got no pressure from Microsoft; there are no directives on AI coming down. Our teams are free to use any technologies that might be beneficial, whether it’s helping write code or check for bugs — things more in the production pipeline. At the end of the day, as Asha said, we’re committed to art made by people,” he said, while also reaffirming Sharma’s feelings that Xbox won’t flood their ecosystem with “slop.”</p>







<p>Asha Sharma has previously stated that she has no tolerance for “bad AI.” Click <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-has-no-tolerance-for-bad-ai/">here </a>to learn more about her perspective on the technology.

            <guid>1445821</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Unlike other extraction shooters on the block, Marathon offers a unique class system in the form of Runner Shells. These biosynthetic shells are designed to help you survive the harsh environments of Tau Ceti, and there’s a ton of variety already on offer.</p>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> will launch with six unique Runner Shells, each with its own Primary and Tactical abilities, as well as a handful of Traits to make each one feel distinct. Whether you prefer to hang back and survey the battlefield or storm right in and lead the charge, there’s most certainly a Runner Shell for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-destroyer-shell-abilities-in-marathon">All Destroyer Shell Abilities In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Absolute unit. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Destroyer Shell is the most tank-like of the classes, offering a balance between manoeuvrability and dealing/soaking damage.</strong></p>



<p>The abilities for the Destroyer Shell are: </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Type</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Name</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Primary</td><td data-align="center">Search &amp; Destroy</td><td data-align="center">Activates shoulder-mounted missile pod that fires heat-seeking missiles.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Tactical</td><td data-align="center">Riot Barricade</td><td data-align="center">Activates a front-facing energy shield that blocks damage</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Thruster</td><td data-align="center">Allows for quick lateral dashes for quick evasive manoeuvres</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Tactical Sprint</td><td data-align="center">Additional sprint type that’s faster than usual, though it generates more heat</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>A Destroyer wants to get into combat as quickly as possible with its Thrusters and Tactical Sprint, and stay there with help from the Riot Barricade. Once you’ve got your enemies pinned, hit them with the Search &amp; Destroy missiles to finish them off. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-assassin-shell-abilities-in-marathon">All Assassin Shell Abilities In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Strike in the shadows—or smoke. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As the name might suggest, the Assassin Shell is a stealthy Runner class that utilises invisibility and smoke effectively to both evade detection and dominate combat.</strong></p>



<p>The abilities for the Assassin Shell are:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Type</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Name</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Primary</td><td data-align="center">Smoke Screen</td><td data-align="center">Throw a disc that emits smoke clouds ahead of it, impairing the vision for those inside it</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Tactical</td><td data-align="center">Active Camo</td><td data-align="center">Allows you to become temporarily invisible. Moving faster makes you the more visible, with certain actions like firing your gun or taking damage briefly making you visible</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Shadow Dive</td><td data-align="center">Negates fall damage from any height, whilst also deploying a smokescreen on impact</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Shroud</td><td data-align="center">Every time you enter a smoke cloud, you’ll become invisible, with it persisting for a few additional seconds</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Think of the Assassin Shell as the perfect backline disrupter. Utilise your Active Camo and stalk your enemies until you see the perfect time to strike. It looks like it’ll be the perfect flanking Shell, especially in a coordinated team.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-recon-shell-abilities-in-marathon">All Recon Shell Abilities In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Intel is key. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Recon Shell is perfect for those who prefer to assess things from afar, with abilities largely focusing on information gathering and hunting down enemies.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-outlines-plans-to-counter-cheaters-in-marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-outlines-plans-to-counter-cheaters-in-marathon/">Bungie Outlines Plans To Counter Cheaters In Marathon</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The abilities for the Recon Shell are:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Type</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Name</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Primary</td><td data-align="center">Echo Pulse</td><td data-align="center">Sonar Pulse that reveals nearby enemy locations, including invisible ones</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Tactical</td><td data-align="center">Tracker Drone</td><td data-align="center">A spider-like drone that chases enemies and explodes, dealing small amounts of fire damage whilst overheating their Shells, resulting in massively limited movement</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Awareness</td><td data-align="center">You’ll be alerted once an enemy player pings you, and finishing an enemy player will ping their teammates</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Stalker Protocol</td><td data-align="center">Once an enemy’s shield has been broken, a trail of footprints will be left behind them for you to stalk</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Nothing is getting by a Recon Shell, and they seem to be the perfect foil to the Assassin. If you’re looking to set up an ambush, use the Echo Pulse to find enemies and send out your Tracker Drone to blow them up and lock them in place. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-vandal-shell-abilities-in-marathon">All Vandal Shell Abilities In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Quick on your feet. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>By far the most dextrous of the line-up, the Vandal shell has abilities that revolve around improved mobility.</strong></p>



<p>The abilities for the Vandal Shell are:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Type</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Name</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Primary</td><td data-align="center">Amplify</td><td data-align="center">Temporarily gain increased movement speed, improved weapon handling, and reduced heat generation from abilities</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Tactical</td><td data-align="center">Disruptor</td><td data-align="center">Energy projectile that deals damage and knocks back enemies. Charge it up to increase the radius and damage</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Microjets</td><td data-align="center">Double jump that generates extra heat</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Power Slide</td><td data-align="center">Extended slide that generates extra heat</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>If you like to be quick on your toes, then Vandal is the shell for you. Although you’ll have to manage your heat build-up, the chaos you can cause with the rapid movements and Disruptor blast is hard to ignore.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-thief-shell-abilities-in-marathon">All Thief Shell Abilities In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fill your pockets. Image by Bungie. </figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Self-described as the ‘loot goblin’ by Bungie, the Thief Shell excels at finding the best gear that Marathon has to offer.</strong></p>



<p>The abilities for the Thief Shell are: </p>







<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Type</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Name</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Primary</td><td data-align="center">Pickpocket Drone</td><td data-align="center">Manually controlled flying drone that uses a whip to steal loot from enemy players, as well as the surroundings</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Tactical</td><td data-align="center">Grapple</td><td data-align="center">Dart that reels you towards it, wherever you fire it</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">X-Ray Visor</td><td data-align="center">See loot containers through walls, as well as enemies within line-of-sight</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center"><strong><em>Unknown</em></strong></td><td data-align="center">The name for the ability currently remains unknown, but the Thief will gain benefits based on how full their backpack is</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The Thief is easily the best looter in Marathon, though it can also double slightly as a Recon player if the Drone is used correctly. Scout out your surroundings, find where the best gear is, and buff yourself once it’s all safe in your backpack.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-triage-shell-abilities-in-marathon">All Triage Shell Abilities In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Medic! Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Every team needs a medic, and the Triage Shell is just that, offering multiple ways to support your team whilst holding down the front line.</strong></p>



<p>The abilities for the Triage Shell are:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Type</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Name</th><th data-align="center">Runner Shell Ability Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Primary</td><td data-align="center">Capacitive Gauntlets</td><td data-align="center">Shocking tendrils that zap enemies and revive teammates from afar</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Tactical</td><td data-align="center">Med-Drone</td><td data-align="center">Airborne drone that hovers near allies to provide health and shields</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Battery Overcharge</td><td data-align="center">Temporarily gain improved weapon performance whilst battery weapons are able to EMP enemies when their shields are broken</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Trait</td><td data-align="center">Shareware</td><td data-align="center">Teammates with Med-Drones healing them also gain the benefits from your consumables</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>You’d be remiss to go on a run without a Triage in your team, as the numerous buffs and support they offer are second to none. Not only can they share their consumables with you, thanks to the Med-Drone, but on the off chance you go down, they can get you back into the fight quicker than anybody.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rook-frame-abilities-in-marathon">All Rook Frame Abilities In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>On your lonesome. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Rook is a unique class in Marathon, as it doesn’t offer a range of abilities like the Shells do; instead, it’s more focused on scavenging ongoing matches. </strong></p>



<p>The Rook Frame puts some limitations on the matchmaking when it’s selected. Firstly, you can’t play as part of a team when choosing Rook, and secondly, you’ll be placed into ongoing matches, though other players won’t be notified of your arrival.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marathon-on-xbox-game-pass/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marathon-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Marathon On Xbox Game Pass?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>As if that wasn’t bleak enough, it seems that you’ll only have access to one ability, which masks your presence from the UESC enemies. You will have access to a starting kit, at least, so you’ll be able to defend yourself, but if you’re choosing Rook, your priority will be to scavenge some gear and extract quickly.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders players have started spotting UFOs in the sky after the latest Shrouded Sky update. </p>



<p>The latest Shrouded Sky update for ARC Raiders went live yesterday, introducing a new map condition, ARC enemies, buffs &amp; nerfs, and much more. However, some items were not mentioned in the latest patch notes, and fans of extraterrestrial entities would love the new addition. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-players-spot-ufos-flying-in-the-sky">ARC Raiders Players Spot UFOs Flying in the Sky</h2>



<p>A new post on the r/ArcRaiders <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdgkdw/what_in_tarnation_is_that/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> discusses the appearance of UFOs in the game. The post shows a video of a player maneuvering through a building while the Hurricane map condition is on. There’s suddenly a loud noise of something flying in the sky, and when they look up, there are two clusters of blue lights that are floating past him, with what looks like a massive ship that is hidden by the cloud cover. </p>



<p>There is ongoing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rea7g9/new_giant_ufo_arc_boss_but_more_zoomed_and_slowmo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">speculation</a> that Embark Studios might be hinting at a new giant enemy for ARC Raiders, possibly a boss, through the appearance of UFOs. Some players have attempted to reach the highest points on the map to get a better view of this flying object, but they haven’t had any success. Meanwhile, others continue to speculate about what all this could mean.</p>



<p>In other news, Embark Studios has made a major change to ARC Raiders Feats, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-embark-studios-pvp-feats-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removing PvP-focused feats</a> and pushing closer to a PvE vibe. Additionally, here’s a comprehensive guide on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-weather-monitor-system-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weather Monitor System Project</a>, explaining the requirements and rewards. </p>

<p>The new Xbox CEO is committed to the company’s return and believes it starts with the console and hardware, with new announcements arriving soon. </p>



<p>If you were living under a rock, you might not have heard that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-sarah-bond-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phil Spencer has retired and Sarah Bond has resigned</a> from Xbox, with a new leadership in place. The new CEO is already the talk of the town, with players recently discussing their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asha-sharma-explains-10k-gamerscore-on-new-xbox-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamerscore and Gamertag</a>. Now, in a new interview, the CEO has revealed what the return of Xbox means for them. </p>

<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, new Xbox CEO Asha Sharma explained what the ‘Return of Xbox’ statement meant. Sharma explained that players have invested thousands of dollars in time and money, and it’s important for her to understand and protect that. Sharma is committed to the return of Xbox, and that starts with console and hardware, and players should be hearing about that “soon” as they have some “announcements coming up.” </p>



<p>Sharma added that they will also look after players who aren’t on their console or hardware and want to deliver great games to them, too. <span>Matt Booty, the new CCO, also added to this, stating the studio system is “fully built around being first-party.</span> We’re not built just to be a publisher. We’re committed to being a first-party games publisher in partnership with our first-party platform team,” he explained. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“Xbox players have thousands of dollars invested, in money and time too — it’s incredibly important for me to understand that and protect that,”&nbsp;</em>Sharma said.<em>&nbsp;“I am committed to ‘returning to Xbox,’ and that starts with console, that starts with hardware. You will hear more about that soon, we’ll have some announcements coming up. You will see us collectively investing here. We also know that there are a lot of players who aren’t on console or our hardware, and I want to deliver great games to them too. I need to learn more about what that can look like, what decisions were made, what we need to do going forward, and I want a little bit of time and space to do that.”</em></p>
