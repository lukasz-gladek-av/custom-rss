<p>Naughty Dog is forcing the developers working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet to work overtime. This, according to a new report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier.</p>



<p>In a story published on Thursday afternoon, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjA4NTY0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NjkwNDQxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0hDRFNLR0lGUEUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.jGluGdyZVa1EEBKJKLlY2aRo0tCwewmOk2TBd_9y2Iw&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schreier states</a> that the studio behind games like The Last of Us and Uncharted has <strong>“been pushing its staff to work long hours to get ready for an upcoming review of the demo by its parent company.”</strong></p>







<p>It’s said that requests began in October for staff to work at least eight extra hours per week with it being logged via spreadsheet. This was done to make up for time lost due to missed deadlines.</p>



<p><strong>“The employees were instructed not to work more than 60 hours a week,” </strong>Schreier writes. <strong>“Staff were also told to return to the office five days a week for this period, up from three previously, sending some employees scrambling to find alternative care arrangements for children and pets.”</strong></p>



<p>Those who spoke to Schreier under the condition of anonymity are worried that, if there’s already mandatory overtime over 18 months away from release, it might get worse in the coming months. As of writing, Intergalactic is scheduled to release in mid-2027. </p>



<p>Sony and Naughty Dog also declined to comment on the claims.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Coalition has given a brief but promising update on Gears of War: E-Day, which it claims is its ‘most ambitious’ title. While no release date has been announced for the prequel, it seems fans will have much to look forward to in 2026.</p>



<p>The Gears of War series, also known as Gears, has been going strong since 2006, almost 20 years ago. Following a ragtag group of soldiers, you’ll shoot (and chainsaw) your way through the parasitic Locust. With five titles, including a few spin-offs, the third-person shooter has become a staple for Xbox. While no sequel to 2019’s Gears 5 has been revealed, a prequel starring Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago, called Gears of War: E-Day, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-official-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced in 2024</a>. A 2026 launch is still on the books and, now, the team has provided some new comments on the anticipated title.</p>







<h2 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day-to-play-like-gears-but-play-like-new-says-developers">Gears of War: E-Day to “Play Like Gears, But Play Like New”, Says Developers</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/18/xbox-bethesda-blizzard-activision-king-2025-games-thank-you/#gow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">year-end article from Xbox</a>, many of the teams of 2025’s biggest games, like The Outer Worlds 2 and South of Midnight, discussed them and what they are looking forward to in 2026. One of the interviewees was Mike Crump, Studio Head at The Coalition for Gears of War: Reloaded. Asked about what the studio is looking forward to the most in 2026, Crump said the following:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Next year marks the 20th anniversary of Gears of War, and we can’t think of a bigger way to celebrate than with the release of&nbsp;Gears of War: E-Day</strong>,” states Clump in the interview. “<strong>This is our most ambitious game yet, entirely built from scratch in Unreal Engine 5 to feel like Gears and play like new. This is a return to our roots as Marcus &amp; Dom face the Locust for the first time ever. It’s the best place to jump into the Gears universe and we can’t wait to share more next year.</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As mentioned before, Gears of War: E-Day is planning to release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-release-window-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime</a> in 2026. No gameplay or additional trailers have been released since 2024. Still, the team at The Coalition and People Can Fly seem adamant the game will live up to expectations. Seeing as Gears 5 was an ambitious title in the series, E-Day may be what fans have been waiting for.</p>

</ul>
