<p>Number one ranked chess player and five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen is reportedly close to joining esports organization Team Liquid. The signing of the consensus best chess player in the world would align with the upcoming debut of chess at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<h2 id="h-magnus-carlsen-in-advanced-negotiations-with-liquid">Magnus Carlsen in “Advanced Negotiations” with Liquid</h2>



<p>Per <a href="https://www.sheepesports.com/en/articles/sources-magnus-carlsen-in-advanced-negotiations-with-team-liquid/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report</a> from Sheep Esports reporter Alejandro “anonimotum” Gomis, Magnus Carlsen is likely to sign a deal with Liquid. Gomis notes in their report that with chess debuting at the Esports World Cup in 2025, Liquid is likely seeking to expand its winnings potential. In the inaugural EWC in 2024, Liquid finished second in the club championship race behind Falcons, taking home $4 million in addition to the prizes won from individual competitions.</p>



<p>To even those only slightly familiar with chess, Carlsen is known as one of the greatest players of all-time, if not the greatest. He’s held the International Chess Federation’s number one ranking since July 2011. He became the first player to hold the Chess, Rapid, and Blitz world championships at the same time in 2014, and then accomplished that feat again two more times. Carlsen most recently made the news after withdrawing from the Rapid and Blitz world championships, after being warned and fined for wearing jeans. He did end up competing in the Blitz tournament after the dress code was loosened, but again sparked controversy after successfully proposing to share the championship after a deadlocked tie with Ian Nepomniachtchi.</p>



<p>Chess isn’t the only game making its debut at the Esports World Cup in the event’s second year. Just yesterday, the EWC announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-esports-world-cup-riot-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT would join</a> Riot Games titles League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-world-cup-2025-games/">at the 2025 tournament</a>.</p>



<p>Is this the biggest name outside of esports to sign with an organization? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>A hacker has found a security flaw in Marvel Rivals, one of the most popular multiplayer games currently available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A report from <a href="https://shalzuth.com/Blog/IFoundAGameExploit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shalzuth’s blog</a>, spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/528355/article/can-marvel-rivals-hackers-take-over-your-pc-or-playstation-5-remotely-hacker-finds-a-security-exploit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, discusses the Marvel Rivals security exploit, which lets hackers access the player’s PC and PS5. The report states that developers use “remote code execution for their hotfix patching system.” However, when the codes are executed, the “game doesn’t verify” whether the command comes from the real server. Moreover, it provides “admin privileges for the sake of anti-cheat,” making it easier for the hacker to take over the device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those wondering about RCE or remote code execution, this is a common way for hackers to run malicious code on a player’s device if they are on an unsecured network without the victim noticing. Shalzuth also posted a video of exploiting this Marvel Rivals security flaw on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSXoH1xYIcE&amp;t=2s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gaming laptop</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDxUaIvVxmY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> by injecting malicious scripts while on the same Wi-Fi. He has also contacted NetEase through various channels to inform them about the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Security flaws in the gaming industry aren’t uncommon, especially with games like Marvel Rivals, which focus on online gameplay. However, the fact that a hacker can quickly take over a player’s device with the help of the game is a cause for concern, mainly when the title attracts close to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">200-300,000 players every day</a> on Steam alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-cancels-mid-season-rank-reset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled mid-season rank resets</a> after recent backlash. Also, the game has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-section-disney-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a section on Disney Plus</a>. What are your thoughts on the Marvel Rivals security flaw?

<p>Split Fiction is the spiritual successor to It Takes Two, and people are hyped. Hazelight Studios has cracked the co-op formula, and Split Fiction’s release can’t come soon enough for those seeking a tandem adventure.</p>



<p>I constantly advocate gaming needing more co-op games. The genre isn’t as dead as people think it is has plenty of titles supporting local and online co-op. You need to check the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest co-op games coming in 2025</a> to see this. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> is likely to be the standard-bearer for the genre moving forward.</p>



<p>Director Josef Fares looks to keep the art of co-op alive and further the genre wherever possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-release-date">Split Fiction Release Date</h2>

<p><strong>Hazelight Studios is launching Split Fiction on March 6.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a> hosted an incredible ceremony celebrating all things gaming. Amongst the awards were a large volume of game announcements and trailers. Hazelight Studios director Josef Fares announced the much-anticipated follow-up to It Takes Two—<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<p>It doesn’t have any Early Access or ways to sample the action early. You and I have to wait patiently until March 6 to see what new ideas and innovations come up.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-platforms">Split Fiction Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>It’s a pure next-gen launch for Split Fiction debuting on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>I’m shocked Split Fiction is skipping last-gen formats, to be honest. It Takes Two launched on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC at launch—offering a Switch port one year later.</p>



<p>Whereas Split Fiction is sticking to the most recent generation, and that’s it. I’d argue a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-nintendo-switch-2-direct-reveal-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> release could happen in the future. Nintendo’s newest console is rumored to be a lot more powerful, so don’t be surprised if the Switch 2 eventually gives Split Fiction a new lease of life.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-editions-amp-price">Split Fiction Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>Split Fiction has an established recommended retail price of $49.99 or £39.99 for the Standard Editon—the only version of Split Fiction.</strong></p>



<p>Physical and digital editions of Split Fiction exist. An interesting note is the Standard Edition is the <strong>only way to play Split Fiction</strong>. There is no Deluxe Edition, Unbelievable Mega Ultra Deluxe Edition, or a Collector’s Edition. This is good news for players unwilling or unable to splash out on constant expensive upgrades.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’ve a huge fan of Hazelight Studios from the A Way Out days. How much are you looking forward to Split Fiction? Does EA have another bonafide success on its hands?</p>



<p>Check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction gameplay</a> to wet your whistle in the meantime.</p>
