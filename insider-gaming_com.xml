<p>On the way to Room 46, you’re likely to come across the Billiard Room. No, we’re not stopping for a quick game as we need to head into here so we can complete the ever-changing Darts puzzle, which offers free bonuses if you can complete it.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-creator-praises-blue-prince-as-one-of-the-best-games-hes-ever-played/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Prince</a> is a game where I cherish the first few hours. Eventually, you come across the same rooms and items, and it becomes familiar. The initial wonderment comes from the beauty of exploration. You draft new rooms, see what they do and what they hold, and you find curiosities such as the Billiard Room.</p>



<p>Inside awaits a devious little puzzle. If you’re having trouble with it, don’t worry, I did at first. But once you understand its cunningness, it’s easily solvable.</p>

<figure><figcaption>The maths don’t seem to add up. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p><strong>We need to use the mathematical properties of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division to select the correct numbers on the dart board and beat the puzzle.</strong></p>



<p>In theory, with enough time and patience, you can solve the puzzle with a process of elimination. But it’s more fun and satisfying to work everything out for ourselves—<strong>and it would take hours!</strong></p>



<p>You need to complete several stages of increasingly more difficult calculations and understand the colors to beat <a href="https://www.blueprincegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blue Prince</a>‘s Dartboard test in the Billiard Room.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-dartboard-colors-mean-in-blue-prince">What do Dartboard Colors Mean in Blue Prince?</h2>



<p>Below is a handy chart showing what each color means and how they influence the puzzle. You are likely to see one to complete the puzzle.</p>



<p>I haven’t seen any other colors during my playtime, but developer Dogubomb could always add more, or the late-game may feature further complications.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Segment Color</th><th data-align="center">What it Means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Light Blue</td><td data-align="center">Addition</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Yellow</td><td data-align="center">Subtraction</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pink</td><td data-align="center">Multiplication</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Purple</td><td data-align="center">Division</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-dartboard-puzzle-example-in-blue-prince">Dartboard Puzzle Example in Blue Prince</h2>



<p><strong>The puzzle, in my experience, has the same number of steps, and the equations become more difficult. Use the numbers on the inside of the board first and make your way to the outside of the board. Your answer should never be above 20.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s an example of how to complete the puzzle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Interact with the dartboard to start the puzzle.</li>



<li>The first step is likely to be a single blue number—<strong>the answer is the highlighted number</strong>.</li>



<li>So, if 14 is highlighted blue, the answer is <strong>14</strong> to start.</li>



<li>Next, 6 could be highlighted in yellow, with 14 still blue.</li>



<li>14 minus 6 equals <strong>8</strong>, so press this number.</li>



<li>8 could be in blue next, with the number 2 highlighted in pink.</li>



<li>If we take 8 and multiply it by 2, we get <strong>16</strong>.</li>



<li>Say the number 18 is in blue and 3 is purple now, we divide 18 by 3 to get <strong>6</strong>.</li>



<li>For the next step, 20 is blue, 10 is yellow, 2 is pink, and 4 is purple.</li>



<li>This means 20 minus 10 equals 10. Then 10 multiplied by 2 equals 20 again, and then 20 divided by 4 equals <strong>5</strong>!</li>
</ol>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is set to release on PlayStation 5 (PS5) on April 17, and with it comes enhancements for the game on the PS5 Pro.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/11/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-comes-to-ps5-on-april-17-with-ps5-pro-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Bethesda went into details on what players with the high-end console will get when they load up the game.</p>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will have native 4K resolution on the system along with advanced ray tracing features. The goal of the optimizations, per Bethesda, is to ensure players “achieve higher and more consistent frame rates”.</p>



<p>“Playing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at a native 4K resolution really is the best way to appreciate the level of detail the team at MachineGames has poured into every corner of the world,” production director John Jennings said via the post. “You could spend hours just walking around the different environments admiring every little thing, from each artifact in Marshall College’s impressive collection to the verdant beauty of Sukhothai’s jungles.”</p>



<h2 id="h-other-ps5-features-for-indiana-jones">Other PS5 Features For Indiana Jones</h2>



<p>Aside from the PS5 Pro enhancements, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5 will utilize the DualSense controller’s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. The controller’s light bar will also give players visual feedback into Indy’s current status.</p>



<p>“For example, when you enter combat, the LED light around the touchpad will turn yellow, or pulse yellow if the NPCs are searching for you,” Bethesda’s Anne Lewis writes. “If your health gets low, the light will pulse red until you heal up. Using a consumable to restore health like food or a bandage will turn the light green for a few seconds.”</p>



<p>Other features on the console include SSD optimization, 60 frames per second, 3D audio, HD rumble, and more.</p>

<p>Over 2 million citizens have explored Atomfall’s dangerous biomes, foraging for meat, drinking beer, and bonking druids on the head with cricket bats. The RPG is shaping up to be one of Rebellion’s greatest achievements—if not the greatest—and the developer has a ton of fun facts about the two million Atomfall players who’ve played the game.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-rebellion-most-successful-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall is Rebellion’s most successful launch ever</a>. This is a remarkable stat when you consider the company is probably best known for Sniper Elite. Nevertheless, the attempt to make a British-based RPG set around a nuclear disaster has paid dividends. </p>



<p>Players have spent the first few weeks exploring the land and raising hell. Once you’ve raised enough hell, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-skethermoor-radio-tower-in-atomfall-keycard-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlocked Radio Towers</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-upgrade-weapons-in-atomfall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgraded enough weapons</a>, you need to kick back with a pasty and some tea.</p>



<h2 id="h-rebellion-reveals-incredible-atomfall-launch-stats">Rebellion Reveals Incredible Atomfall Launch Stats</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This guy has probably been killed many times over. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Citizens of Wyndham (that tannoy announcement lives rent-free in my head) have been having their fill. According to an <a href="https://x.com/AtomfallGame/status/1910679392696611192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">April 11 Rebellion post</a>, over <strong>2 million players have set foot in alternate-history Cumbria</strong>.</p>



<p>During their time, they’ve found nearly <strong>13 million Caches</strong> using the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-metal-detector-in-atomfall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Detector</a>, <strong>killed six million enemies with classic Cricket Bat</strong>, ordered over a <strong>quarter of a million pints of beer</strong>, and scoffed <strong>14 million tins of meat</strong>—and counting.</p>



<div><article><p><span>📢 CITIZENS OF WYNDHAM,
You’ve all been working so hard in our community, we’ve pinned up some interesting facts about your contribution, flourishing under PROTOCOL ⚛️ </span></p></article></div>



<p>With Atomfall being free on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-atomfall-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a>, these player numbers seem certain to rise. We gave the RPG a glowing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-review-rebellion-curveball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming review</a>, and I honestly hope Rebellion decides to venture down a future path not necessarily filled with Sniper Rifle glare and Nazis.</p>
