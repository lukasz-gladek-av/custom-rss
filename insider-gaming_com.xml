<p>Everyone knows that Borderlands is a series famed for insane gun-toting action and explosive sequences. That has become increasingly true with each successive iteration, and 2019’s Borderlands 3, the most recent numbered release in the series, boasted ’87 bazillion guns.’</p>



<p>The number has been refined going into Borderlands 4 by the game’s art director, Adam May. He has claimed that this highly anticipated title will include <strong>30 billion possible guns</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impossible-numbers">Impossible Numbers</h2>



<p>Borderlands becomes increasingly insane with each new release, but <strong>Borderlands 4 </strong>is heading to new heights with a new band of Vault Hunters, a seamless open world, and <strong>30 billion guns</strong>.</p>



<p>In a new super-sized interview piece <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/borderlands-randy-pitchford-interview-borderlands-4?s=09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Epic Games</a>, the Gearbox team uncovered various elements of Borderlands 4. The game’s art director, Adam May, stated that there are more guns than you’d ever believe possible.</p>



<p>This is achievable through procedural generation and by having a staggering base array of weapons right off the bat. From the various categories to the different ‘manufacturers’ iconic to Borderlands, and from the fire modes to the attachments, it’s easy to see how the list can quickly grow.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing how it works.</p>



<p>If you get a rifle and that rifle has one attachment different in the next iteration, that’s two weapons. If it then has a different elemental effect, that’s three. Let’s say you find another with a slightly different scope. That’s four weapons, and you’re still nowhere close to the variable potential of that <strong>one </strong>firearm; that’s how Borderlands 4 can tote these types of numbers.</p>



<p>May explained what goes into the creation of Borderlands 4’s weapons from an artistic perspective:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Players have some recognition when they’re picking up a certain manufacturer’s weapon and have a rough idea of how it’s going to function.</p>



<p>It’s a back-and-forth with the design team and art team, making sure that visually things line up with how they’re supposed to work mechanically. If you want a real fast shooting weapon, you shoot for sleeker, more angular, more aggressive-looking shapes. If it’s shooting giant rockets every time, you want something that’s bigger and rounder and more bulbous.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Borderlands 4 will be released on September 12. Do you intend to give it a try and flick through some of those 30 billion guns? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been more than 15 years since League of Legends hit the market, fast becoming the number one MOBA and the world’s leading competitive game. It might seem bizarre to some, but after all this time, Riot Games is preparing to introduce a new WASD-based control scheme, after more than a decade and a half of using a point-and-click operating model.</p>



<p>This news was dropped in a recent update from Riot Games that included information about the future of the game. It was pointed out that this WASD control scheme will be introduced first in <strong>testing</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-these-years-later">All These Years Later</h2>



<p>In a recent 13-minute video shared to discuss the most imminent and important updates to League of Legends, Riot Games lifted the lid on a dramatic test that’ll allow players to use WASD to directly control their Champions for the first time.</p>



<p>The team said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve found that a lot of new or returning players struggling with League’s controls early on. Click to move just isn’t the sort of control scheme they’re used to and it puts a lot of people off, including many that we believe would otherwise really love the game.</p>



<p>So, we’re introducing WASD as an alternate control scheme to help get new players to the fun parts of League faster and with less friction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was revealed that WASD for League of Legends has been under development ‘for a while’. It’s all about allowing first-time players to have a more intuitive journey as they try to break into one of the more complex games on the market.</p>



<p>Riot Games endeavours to make both ‘point-and-click’ and WASD movement schemes fully functional across all game modes, including Ranked.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>For ‘the next few patches’, WASD will be introduced to PBE (Public Beta Environment), and it will evolve based on player feedback before drifting to other game modes across the full version of the game.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll prefer to use WASD in League of Legends? Let me know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another union is forming at Blizzard as developers from the company’s story and franchise development (SFD) team have voted in favor of union representation. Announced via the Communication Workers of America (CWA) website, the vote came “either by signing a union authorization card or indicating that they wanted union representation via an online portal.”</p>



<p>All workers will be members of CWA Local 9510 in Orange County, California with Microsoft already recognizing their union.</p>



<p>The union <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzards-story-and-franchise-development-workers-form-latest-video-game-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will cover those who work</a> on Blizzard’s in-house cinematics, animation, and narrative team who create game trailers, promotional videos, in-game cutscenes, and other narrative content for Blizzard franchises. It becomes the first group of its kind to form a union in the North American game industry.</p>



<p><strong>“After more than a decade working at Blizzard, I’ve seen all the highs and lows. For years, Blizzard has been a place where people could build their careers and stay for decades, but that stability’s been fading,”</strong>&nbsp;Bucky Fisk, a principal editor and member of the organizing committee, said via release.&nbsp;<strong>“With a union, we’re able to preserve what makes this place special, secure real transparency in how decisions are made, and make sure policies are applied fairly to everyone.”</strong></p>



<p>The new union joins the <strong>“nearly 3,000 workers at Microsoft-owned studios who have organized with CWA to build better standards across the video game industry.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“These workers are setting the standard for animation, cinematics, and storytelling across the video game industry, creating the breathtaking cutscenes, trailers, and other narrative content that fans have come to love across all Blizzard franchises. We are excited to have them join our union family,”&nbsp;</strong>CWA Local 9510 president Jason Justice said.</p>



<p>As of publishing, neither Activision-Blizzard nor Microsoft have made an official comment on the union.</p>

<p>Resident Evil fans get ready because the next look at Resident Evil Requiem will be coming during Gamescom Opening Night Live.</p>



<p>First claimed by regular Resident Evil leaker <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955312103188992041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dusk Golem</a>, there will be a “new showing” of the game during the show with a media embargo with more details on August 20.</p>



<p><strong>“[Then] it’ll be at Tokyo Game Show next month, too,”</strong> he said.</p>



<p>The Gamescom Opening Night Live appearance was then <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1955252938232021272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed by Geoff Keighley</a>.</p>



<p>Aside from the appearance at Gamescom, Dusk Golem also gave a bit more details on what players can expect from the game. Specifically, the role that Leon will have.</p>



<p><strong>“As far as I know, part of RE9’s whole “Long Awaited Endings &amp; New Beginnings” stuff is supposed be Leon’s last major role in the timeline (sure he’ll still pop up in CG movies &amp; earlier timeline stuff), so you got that to look forward to with Resident Evil Requiem then,”</strong> <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955309595418890576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said.</a></p>



<p>Gamescom Opening Night Live takes place on <strong>August 19 at 11am PT / 2pm ET / 7pm BST / 8pm CEST</strong>. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of everything Gamescom LIVE from Cologne, Germany.</p>



<p>During his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-returns-to-survival-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-off preview of the game</a> back in June, Insider Gaming’s Albert Perkins said that, <strong>“I could feel my shoulders tensing up as she peeked around the corner of each room and made her way down the dark, narrow hallway. And I mean – DARK to the point that the darkness nearly swallowed her into the abyss. Capcom does survival horror right, and this game will do its job of scaring the hell out of you early and often, I guarantee it.”</strong></p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is scheduled to release on February 27, 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p>



<p>What do you think the story holds in Resident Evil Requiem for Leon, and what are you hoping to see at Opening Night Live from the game? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>The next Minecraft Live date has been revealed, and it seems to have happened a bit earlier than planned. </p>



<p>In an FAQ section on the studio’s Spanish website, Mojang has confirmed that the next Minecraft Live event will take place on September 22 at 1pm ET.  As for publishing, the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/es-es/live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spanish site remains</a> but the English version of the site still lists March’s date.</p>



<p>It had been indexed on Google for a short time, as well, but that was removed.</p>



<p>The last Minecraft Live event took place back on March 22. That showcase featured a look at the Minecraft Movie ahead of its launch, game drops, a look at the game’s Vibrant Visuals update, and more. You can catch up on all that via the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-live-2025-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official recap</a>. </p>



<p>Neither Microsoft nor Mojang have confirmed the next Minecraft Live date. However, with it appearing on official websites, it appears to be only a matter of time before it’s made official.</p>



<p>What are you hoping to see announced at the next Minecraft Live in September? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>
