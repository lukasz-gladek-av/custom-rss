<p>The features for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> have officially been revealed, and with that comes the first batch of screenshots for the game. </p>



<p>The screenshots give players a look at new and updated character models, arenas, match types, and more. </p>







<p>WWE 2K26 launches on March 13 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. The series is officially leaving the last-gen Xbox One and PlayStation 4 behind after over a decade.</p>



<p>This year’s game features CM Punk as the game’s main cover athlete and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" id="169985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feature wrestler in the game’s Showcase Mode</a>. Other improvements include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" id="170273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four new and returning match types</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-nintendo-switch-2-features/" id="173149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2-specific features</a>, and a number of updates to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-features-major-updates-to-fan-favorite-game-modes/" id="173163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan-favorite game modes</a>. </p>



<p><strong>“Run the show your way in WWE 2K26, featuring 400+ WWE Superstars and Legends,” </strong>the game’s description reads. <strong>“Light up the ring with all-new match types, relive CM Punk’s greatest moments, and explore the secrets of The Island.”</strong></p>



<p>Speaking of the Island, the mode is officially coming to PC for the first time after skipping the platform in WWE 2K25.</p>



<p>As mentioned, WWE 2K26 launches on March 13. Those who preorder the higher-tiered editions of the game, however, get access to the game a week early on March 6.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> is updating some of the most popular game modes in major ways.</p>



<p>It’s WWE Royal Rumble weekend, and that means that there is a major push regarding marketing for the upcoming WWE 2K26 video game. <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/wrestling/wwe/cm-punk-liv-morgan-bron-breakker-talk-wwe-2k26-as-new-game-info-released">New information from The Takedown on SI </a>confirms several updates coming to the game modes. </p>



<p>In addition to confirming several updates previously reported by Insider Gaming, new details give plenty for longtime fans of WWE video games to be excited about, as it pertains to customization, replay value, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-universe-mode-gets-a-draft-and-more">WWE Universe Mode Gets a Draft and More</h2>



<p>Universe Mode has been a focal point of WWE video games since 2010. Sandbox mode in WWE games lets players be the promoter they’ve always wanted to be, setting up cards, creating rivalries, managing injuries, and more.</p>



<p>This year, WWE 2K26 not only adds a Draft to Universe Mode to increase realism, but also introduces a new Universe Creation Wizard, additional promo types to add more drama to your rivalries, a “Watch Show” mode for those that like pure sim experiences, and more.</p>



<p>MyGM Mode, which acts as a more short-term brand management sim, is also getting some improvements. There will be support for more match types than ever, including intergender and eight-man matches, more shows per season, and new management challenges.</p>



<p>MyRISE, the game’s version of MyPLAYER from NBA 2K, also features major improvements, including the ability to continue their career mode beyond completing the campaign. This year’s campaign will also feature new decision-based storylines in which your choice to keep your customized WWE Superstar as a babyface or a heel will affect the story.</p>



<p>The Island mode will also come to PC for the first time ever.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-creation-suite-options-spark-new-life-in-wwe-2k26">New Creation Suite Options Spark New Life in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>In addition to all of those updates, there are major improvements to the Creation Suite. For the first time, there will be 200 Create-A-Superstar save slots. This is double the existing amount and provides plenty of options not only to create your own stars but also to download popular stars from other promotions. Additionally, Community Creations now supports 2,000 images, advanced body/face morphing, and two-tone hair blending for maximized Superstar and arena customization.</p>



<p>The game is scheduled to release to the general public on March 13, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-pricing-revealed-for-all-editions/">if you pre-order a premium edition</a>, you can get Early Access.

            <title><![CDATA[New Tarkov Competitor ‘Road to Vostok’ Gets Release Date and New Trailer]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/road-to-vostok-early-access-date-trailer/</link>
            <guid>1421290</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Road to Vostok, a highly anticipated first-person survival shooter from a lone developer, is hitting early access in April. This news follows years of development that have yielded multiple demos, scores of evolutions, and the emergence of one of the most exciting games in the hardcore shooter space.</p>



<p>Fans of games like Escape from Tarkov will be enthused by Road to Vostok. While it’s not an extraction shooter, it boasts a very similar aesthetic and core concepts, and it’s set in a ‘post-apocalyptic border zone between Finland and Russia.’</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-road-to-vostok-coming-out">When is Road to Vostok Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Road to Vostok, being developed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/road-to-vostok/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by a one-man Finnish team</a>, is the culmination of years of work. Before putting his head down and creating this all-new survival game, Antti Leinonen served in the armed forces and taught visual game design. His efforts have come to life in Road to Vostok, a single-player survival title with hardcore mechanics.</p>



<p>The game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1963610/Road_to_Vostok/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blurb on Steam</a>, where you can wishlist the game in anticipation of its early access release, tells you all you need to know:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Road to Vostok is a hardcore single-player survival game set in a post-apocalyptic border zone between Finland and Russia. Survive, loot, plan and prepare to cross the border into Vostok, a permadeath zone where one mistake can end it all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Antti uploaded a new trailer for Road to Vostok earlier today, confirming that the game will hit early access on <strong>April 7, 2026</strong>. It will be priced at €14.99, including a 25% discount that starts at launch and runs for two weeks, at which point it will become €19.99.</p>



<p>We’ve been covering Road to Vostok for years, and our impressions of the demos this solo developer has produced have always been stellar. It’s sure to be a hit with fans of games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-review-ultimate-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape from Tarkov</a>, which you can more or less gauge by the game’s new trailer:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Road to Vostok has first-person shooter mechanics aplenty, but it also has a hideout system, multiple maps, in-game traders, dynamic events that unfold as the game’s lifecycle evolves, and a looter-shooter gameplay loop, all of which are applicable to Tarkov fans everywhere.</p>



<p>There’s weapon and character customization, weather systems, a day-night cycle, and survival mechanics that involve elements like eating and drinking, as well as inventory and health management.</p>



<p>If you’re eager to explore Road to Vostok when it launches, you won’t have long to wait, as it comes out on April 7th in early access. For now, there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/road-to-vostok-public-demo-2-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a demo on Steam</a> that you can explore right now. Until now, more than <strong>one million people </strong>have downloaded the demo, and 600,000 have followed up with a Steam wishlist.</p>
