<p>Balatro’s best Seeds allow you to experience the exhilarating moments of high-scoring hands more frequently. They are broken, overpowered Seeds with the potential to rack up ridiculous scores. Plus, you can conquer the later stages of Balatro’s insanely tough Endurance Mode with the right setup.</p>



<p>I find the first Blind to be the calm before the storm. It’s you, a default stack of 52 equally distributed cards (depending on your chosen deck), and a small points total to hit. You can throw out a couple of Flushes, one-shot the Blind with a Straight, or begin with a Royal Flush. Then, the Shop throws one random assortment of goodies after another at you. This is how a conventional run of Balatro is.</p>



<p>In a Seeded run, everything is different, so let’s delve into the awesomeness of a Seeded run and why they’re so fun in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-of-2024-best-new-indie-games-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best indie game of 2024</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-a-seeded-run-in-balatro">What is a Seeded Run in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>A Seeded Run allows you to replicate a previously played game of Balatro by following the exact moves as the Seeded run’s initial playthrough.</strong></p>



<p>Why would you do this I hear you ask? Because it’s <em>fun</em>, and certain runs are filed under “Seen only to be believed.” Meaning, the set of Jokers and circumstances during a run were almost miraculous. Excessive Chip tallies, outrageous Multipliers, and enough fire beneath the points values to melt the North Pole in seconds.</p>



<p>Your entire run is predetermined if you follow the steps of the player who registered the initial run. Doing this is difficult if you don’t have the precise steps though. You are bound to deviate, but a dreamy run lies dormant if you play your cards right.</p>

<p><strong>Enter a correct Seed Code on Balatro’s “Enter Seed” screen and press to begin the game.</strong></p>



<p>It’s simple to do, and I’ve broken down the process with an easy step-by-step guide below:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to Balatro’s home screen.</li>



<li>Click <strong>Play</strong>.</li>



<li>Select <strong>New Run</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on the <strong>Seeded Run</strong> circle next to “Play.”</li>



<li>If it now has a Red Tick, click <strong>Enter Seed</strong>.</li>



<li>Correctly enter a Seed—such as the nine I gave you above.</li>



<li>Hit <strong>Play </strong>to begin.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>(Originally covered October 2023)</strong></p>



<p>It’s one of the longest-standing points of debate in the history of the franchise. In Fallout, who launched the first nuke? There have been many theories that surfaced over the years, but owing to the nature of the war and how it all unfolded in the Fallout universe, a definitive answer was never provided to who shot first in Fallout.</p>



<p>Now, the co-creator of Fallout – Tim Cain – has made it clear during an interview who was responsible for kick-starting The Great War by firing off those first missiles.</p>



<p>So, who dropped the bombs first in Fallout? Let’s find out what Tim said.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-and-the-first-nuke-launched-in-fallout-was-by">And The First Nuke Launched in Fallout Was By…</h2>



<p>Fallout’s lore is incredibly dense and probably more extensive than almost any game that exists today. There is a twenty-five-year history wrapped up in the franchise that spans several main releases, each of which has served to expand the game’s lore immeasurably. From factions to locations and key events to inventions, the backstory to Fallout is nothing short of monumental. </p>



<p>And now, one of the biggest mysteries of the Fallout universe has been settled.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17EqWDn7gyc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview</a>, Tim Cain spoke about all things Fallout, and for a brief moment, he touched upon the very origins of The Great War. He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The reason we got nuked is: bio-weapons were illegal and somehow China found out we were doing FEV. And they were like, ‘You have to stop it.’ And we went, ‘Okay’. But all we did is move it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the Fallout world, the FEV is the Forced Evolutionary Virus, a concoction that was once supposed to be a medical marvel but ultimately resulted in the creation of horrifically mutated creatures. </p>



<p>That’s the confirmation from the horse’s mouth – the creator himself. It was China that shot first in the Fallout universe because America was creating bio-weapons and refused to stop when asked even when geopolitical tensions were as rocky as they could have ever been.</p>



<p>Can we put that to bed now? Who dropped the first bombs in Fallout? It was <strong>China</strong>.</p>



<p>But should I mention that the Fallout TV show, which premiered in April 2024, seems to be headed down a contradictory path, suggesting that it was Vault-Tec that fired first? That’s yet to be confirmed, but it was <strong>heavily </strong>alluded to in the show’s first season.</p>



<p>What do you think?</p>
