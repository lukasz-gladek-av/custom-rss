<p>Atlanta FaZe is shaping up to be the most dominant team in Call of Duty esports after decimating all comers this weekend at Major II. The Call of Duty League was FaZe’s plaything these last few days, and a 4-0 sweep in the grand final against Vancouver Surge proved that without any doubt.</p>



<p>This is FaZe’s third LAN win back-to-back, counting the Esports World Cup in Riyadh. The team is in monumental form and has achieved a feat that hasn’t been seen since 2016, plus they’re on a 13 LAN map win streak to boot.</p>



<p>Incredible.</p>

<h2 id="h-faze-up">FaZe Up</h2>



<p>This Major II tournament was light work for Atlanta FaZe. I referred to it as ‘Sweep City Central’ because almost every match was a 3-0 result, except for a few, and only one match went to a game five. Atlanta FaZe enjoyed the lion’s share, walking all over Minnesota Rokkr, Cloud9, and Vancouver Surge <strong>twice</strong>.</p>



<p>Everyone thought an underdog win would happen, given that Toronto Ultra had gone on one of the most impressive lower bracket runs in COD esports history. Ultra produced a perfect record in the form of a 12-map streak before meeting Vancouver Surge and succumbing in the elimination finals.</p>



<p>FaZe’s sweep in the ultimate stage was nothing short of monumental. The flow state that we know the team is capable of was achieved and Vancouver Surge – even with the late addition of Neptune – just couldn’t respond. Except for the round of Control, every map was a wash, with FaZe barely giving Surge space to breathe.</p>



<p>Cellium secured the record for the highest finals KD in CDL history at 1.72, and Drazah earned himself another chip and yet another reason to stand above the haters with their classic chant.</p>



<p>This was a phenomenal Major, and now we look to Major III, which will take place in Florida between April 24 – 27.</p>

<p>Several builds of unreleased games have been uploaded to an undisclosed datamining discord server, including Riot Games’ 2XKO.</p>



<p>So far, Insider Gaming has been able to verify that early builds of the following games have been uploaded to the server:</p>



<ul>
<li>Killing Floor 3 </li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/riot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games</a>‘ 2XKO</li>



<li>PLAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback</li>



<li>Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders </li>



<li>An early build of Delta Force Hawk Ops</li>
</ul>



<p>According to one source that’s in the server, uploads of the games builds are primarily used for datamining purposes, but some games with less protection will likely get leaked online. Either way, it looks like all of these games will have new bits of information leaked about them in the near future.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on where all of the builds originated, but according to other sources, 2XKO, PLAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback, and ARC Raiders have all recently been in a wider pool of playtesting.</p>



<p>Should any of the games leak, we will keep you updated.</p>
