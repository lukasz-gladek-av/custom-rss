<p>At The Game Awards in Los Angeles, CDPR revealed The Witcher 4 with a lengthy CGI trailer, rewarding the fans who have waited almost a decade to see what’s next for the monster-slaying series.</p>



<p>At the heart of the trailer sat Ciri, Geralt of Rivia’s ward and the protagonist of the upcoming title. In an interview, CD Projekt Red explained why Ciri is leading this single-player title, stressing that, ‘It was always about her.’</p>

<h2 id="h-an-amazing-layered-character">‘An Amazing, Layered Character’</h2>



<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-developer-cd-projekt-explains-why-it-went-with-ciri-over-continuing-with-geralt-as-protagonist?utm_source=threads,twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, The Witcher 4’s executive producer, Małgorzata Mitręga, explained why Ciri is heading up The Witcher 4, one of the most ambitious games that CDPR has ever made:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was always about her, starting from Saga when you read it in the books. She’s an amazing, layered character. And of course, as a protagonist we said goodbye to Geralt previously. So this is a continuation. I guess for all of us it’s like she was meant to be. That was always her.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The director of The Witcher 4, Sebastian Kalemba, expanded on that:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>She’s actually about to become the Witcher. </p>



<p>She’s about to actually form her own codex, but on her own terms. The way she actually deals with the monsters, the way she deals with quests, the adventures, it’s her own unique way. And also I think that she gives more room to be able to tell different stories here and there. </p>



<p>Of course, we want to give the opportunity for the player to explore more nuance because this is what we do. But she deserves that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was confirmed that she was always intended to be the protagonist of The Witcher 4. In Blood and Wine, The Witcher 3’s final expansion, Geralt of Rivia effectively retired, so for the true fans of the franchise, Ciri’s arrival as the next game’s main character makes complete sense.</p>



<p>The team at CDPR revealed that Ciri’s story was settled for The Witcher 4 almost ten years ago.</p>

<p>Dying Light: The Beast received a new gameplay trailer at The Game Awards 2024. No concrete date has been announced, just a window for the summer of 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The game serves as a spin-off from Techland’s popular zombie franchise. Check out the synopsis:</p>



<p>“<em>After 13 years of enduring experiments, you escape and hunt down your captors to seek retribution, only to discover there’s far more at stake. While the region is not as populated as it once was, there are still people and factions here, as well as plenty of horrors. Some will ask for your help, others will want to kill you. And that’s not to mention the mysterious creature that’s turned the woods into its personal hunting grounds.</em>“</p>



<p>The adventure stars Kyle Crane, an individual who saved several people when the virus spread across the world. However, after several years in captivity and undergoing various experiments, Kyle’s DNA has completely fused with zombie DNA, allowing him to transform into a beast. That’s where the game’s subtitle comes from.</p>



<p>The game is structured with an open world and we’ll have various types of landscapes such as forests, industrial complexes and small villages. It will be possible to play alone or in co-op for up to 4 people and, yes, the mechanics of day and night will be present.</p>

<p>A new game in the Onimusha franchise has been announced. The latest title in the saga, the remaster of Onimusha: Warlords, was released in October 2018. The new title is called Onimusha: Way of the Sword. The game seems to have soulslikes mechanics.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The announcement took the gaming community by surprise, after all, it was believed that the franchise would never return. However, relatively recent indications pointed to the contrary.</p>



<p>A few years ago, Capcom was the victim of a hacker attack that ended up leaking several of its projects. Among them, a new Onimusha had been mentioned. In addition, the publisher licensed the franchise for Netflix to make an anime.</p>



<p>Few details about the game have been released so far. All we know is that it is being made on the RE Engine and will be released on consoles and PC in 2026.</p>

<p>Arrowhead has announced — and released — a brand new major update for Helldivers 2 known as Omens of Tyranny.</p>



<p>“The time has come, Helldivers. The War has changed,” the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">description reads</a>. “These are dark times for freedom-loving citizens everywhere. Our galaxy grows cold from the embrace of old enemies returning and darkens with the threat of new horrors emerging.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In Omens of Tyranny, a new faction called The Illuminate “returns” to challenge the Helldivers.</p>



<p>“They are advanced, highly intelligent beings wielding powerful technology that appears to average citizens like a kind of dark magic,” Arrowhead said. “The Illuminate have emerged seemingly out of nowhere. Even though we don’t know the true origin of the invasion, we have no choice now but to suppress three factions in the Galactic War.”</p>



<p>In addition to the new faction, new areas to fight are being added to the game along with a new vehicle known as the Fast Recon Vehicle (FRV). The entire squad can travel in the FRV together, making sure no one is left behind as they spread democracy.</p>

<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku has published a first look at Project Century, a new and developing title. It’s an action-packed game set in Japan in 1915, and the trailer showcases intense, visceral combat and a stunning world. It’s an early introduction to what is only one of the studio’s upcoming projects.</p>



<p>Check out the trailer below.</p>

<p>Not much is known about Project Century, but the first glimpse we’ve had of the developing title looks stellar:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Most recently, Ryu Ga Gotoku was responsible for the delivery of the Like a Dragon series and standalone games like Lost Judgment. It looks like Project Century follows very much in that vein.</p>
