<p>After years in the making, Battlefield 6 is here, and reviews are about to start coming in as the embargo on the game gets set to lift. Insider Gaming has learned when those with the game can start giving their thoughts on what they played, and showcase more gameplay from the upcoming release.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-battlefield-6-review-embargo">When Is The Battlefield 6 Review Embargo?</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/CGMagonline/status/1975992766296473618" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">multiple outlets</a> with early access to the game, the <strong>Battlefield 6 review embargo lifts at 11 am EST/8 am PST on Thursday, October 9</strong>. That means players will start seeing impressions go up around then and in the coming days and weeks</p>



<p>Expect articles and videos on gameplay, modes, features, visuals, audio, and, yes, the campaign to all start showing up around the same time. </p>



<h2 id="h-will-insider-gaming-have-a-review">Will Insider Gaming Have A Review?</h2>



<p>While Insider Gaming won‚Äôt have a review up for embargo, there will be plenty of coverage of the game from guides to general impressions. For thoughts on the game from Mike, Grant, Tom, and Albert, make sure to check out Insider Gaming Weekly, every Thursday at 4 pm ET <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over on YouTube</a>. That‚Äôs if Tom can be pulled away from playing it to record a show.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-review-score-predictions">Battlefield 6 Review Score Predictions</h2>



<p>The last game in the franchise, Battlefield 2042, wasn‚Äôt an overly well-received game from critics and fans. The game has a 68 on Metacritic and received ‚Äúgenerally unfavorable reviews‚Äù from players on the platform. Fast-forward to today, and Battlefield 6 is one of the most-hyped games from EA in some time. After the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">success of the open betas</a> during the summer, it makes sense to think that the game could be generally well-received. </p>



<p>Both Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 1 are tied for the highest Metacritic score in franchise history with an 88. Will Battlefield 6 come close to it? It‚Äôs possible, but reviews will have to be blown away by not only the game‚Äôs multiplayer offerings but also how the campaign plays out.</p>

<p>A new indie studio formed from former ZeniMax employees, with leads from Elder Scrolls Online and Project Blackbird, has been revealed. </p>



<p>Zenimax Online Studios, formed in 2007, had a massive following thanks, in part, to The Elder Scrolls Online. The MMORPG has continued to bring in new players daily, selling almost $2 billion in sales since 2014. Unfortunately, due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-zenimax-online-mmorpg-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest Microsoft layoffs</a>, over 300 employees from the company were let go. This includes some who worked on a yet-to-be-revealed new IP called Project Blackbird, which Xbox cancelled. However, it seems some of the laid-off crew have come together to form a new, employee-owned indie studio.</p>



<h2 id="h-sackbird-studios-officially-announced-run-by-former-zenimax-online-leads">Sackbird Studios Officially Announced, Run by Former ZeniMax Online Leads</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hello, World. üëã<br>Today we‚Äôre proud to announce Sackbird Studios ‚Äî an independent game studio based in Baltimore, Maryland, built by friends who‚Äôve spent years designing worlds, systems, and stories for players everywhere.<a href="https://t.co/1jmlgteUM2">https://t.co/1jmlgteUM2</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/indiedev?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#indiedev</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/videogames?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#videogames</a></p>‚Äî sackbirdstudios (@sackbirdstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/sackbirdstudios/status/1975945947017564556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/news/studio-takes-flight" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the new studio‚Äôs blog</a>, former leads at ZeniMax Online Studios have formed Sackbird Studios. The crew consists of 10 former employees of the Bethesda-owned studio. Many of them worked on The Elder Scrolls Online and the cancelled Project Blackbird. Furthermore, it is entirely employee-owned and has already been funded for multiple years. In a statement, Sackbird Studios COO David Worley said,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúAfter years in AAA, we wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets,‚Äù states Worley. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another statement, this time from CEO Lee Ridout, states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people,‚Äù said Ridout. ‚ÄúWhen I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft‚Äîand our team‚Äîwas to create a studio where creative independence isn‚Äôt negotiable.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the moment, the team is not ready to share its first title, but promises that it will launch on PC and consoles. While the team is grateful for the time they spent at ZeniMax Online Studios, it seems they aren‚Äôt pulling any stops to ensure its work gets out of the door. It‚Äôll be excited to see what Sackbird Studios creates, especially if it takes from the cancelled Project Blackbird.</p>
