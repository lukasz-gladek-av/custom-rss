            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/not-another-last-of-us-game-druckmann-ambiguous-suggest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent interview with Variety, Neil Druckmann suggested that The Last of Us might be over and done with. He said, ‘Don’t bet on there being more Last of Us.’ It’s a rather ambiguous statement, as it’s not immediately clear if he’s saying there are no more Last of Us games coming <strong>now</strong> or if The Last of Us Part III will be the final game in the series.</p>



<p>In April, the second season of the award-winning HBO series will drop, more than two years after the first season arrived.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-this-could-be-it">‘This Could Be It’</h2>



<p>The Last of Us was released in 2013 and has since been remastered and re-released no fewer than 743 times across multiple platforms and generations. In 2020, the follow-up title – aptly named The Last of Us Part II – was released. It was a controversial title in many ways, but it was still a masterpiece of a game that turned heads worldwide.</p>



<p>On April 3, Part II’s newest iteration, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, will be released on PC.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent segment with Variety</a>, Neil Druckmann talked about the second season of the Emmy Award-winning show. He sat down with Craig Mazin, with whom he has pioneered the creation of one of the best live-action adaptations in gaming history.</p>



<p>In one section, Druckmann answers the question about the existence of The Last of Us Part III, which has been rumoured on and off but never confirmed. When asked about the possibility of the game surfacing, he said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was waiting for this question.</p>



<p>I guess the only thing I would say is don’t bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us’. This could be it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s ever so slightly ambiguous. It could mean that there’s nothing more planned after a third game, or it could mean that we’re stuck with a two-game series that’ll never again see the light of day.</p>



<p>In December 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-officially-cancelled/">an online multiplayer game</a> set in The Last of Us’ universe was cancelled, but in 2024, the studio ‘teased’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-teases-new-chapter-for-the-last-of-us/">a new chapter</a> in the franchise. That was before Naughty Dog appeared at The Game Awards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/">to reveal Intergalactic</a>, an all-new IP that came completely out of left field.</p>



<p>Do you think The Last of Us should end on Part II? It’s no big secret that the team plans to drag out the television series and cover the second game across <strong>two </strong>seasons, so we’ve got Last of Us content in the pipeline for a while, but would you rather play it than watch it?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-%E2%80%9Ceffectively-closed%E2%80%9D.1126164/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Until Dawn Remake developer Ballistic Moon is “effectively closed”. That’s according to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that after the layoffs that were publicly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ballistic-moon-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in September 2024</a> took place, roughly 40 employees or so were let go. The remaining staff was kept to offer post-launch support and development on Until Dawn after its October release. In December 2024, however, the company quietly laid off that staff as well, resulting in around 20 more developers losing their job.</p>



<p>Sources say that only the studio’s founders remain and “possibly” a handful of employees “at most”. There are no employees in public relations, marketing, or development left.</p>



<p>“People are sharing bugs they’ve found in the game to make the team aware but there is no one working on patch support for the game anymore,” one source said. “The studio has effectively closed now.”</p>



<p>As far as what happened, those who spoke on the condition of anonymity made it clear that the owners attempted to keep things at Ballistic Moon moving forward. Many said that the owners were actively looking for funding and pitching projects, but couldn’t secure funding or a new publisher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked about Sony publishing another game or future updates to Until Dawn Remake for the studio, one source said it was discussed but never came to fruition.</p>



<p>“Sony said after the game they might greenlight more funding for updates, but looks like they didn’t,” the source said.</p>



<p>Regarding working at the studio, most who spoke said that it was a generally good place to work. Many spoke highly of their teams and the work being done. What they didn’t like, though, were instances of unpaid overtime. One former employee equated it to “weeks” of unpaid work and that the internal announcement of redundancies came after the team had worked overtime.</p>



<p>“Nice reward for our hard work,” they said.</p>



<p>Ballistic Moon’s leadership has yet to put out an official statement on the status of the studio and whether or not it has been or will be closed. In technical terms, it’s remains active in name. Should a publisher sign on or funding come from elsewhere, the studio could start the hiring process again to bring in developers and other staff. Right now, however, there is no work being done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has attempted multiple times to get in contact with Ballistic Moon’s co-founders and owners as well as Sony regarding the claims of additional funding for the studio, but no responses have been received. Should any come after the publishing of this story, it will be added in an update.</p>

<p>A new leak has revealed that Minecraft: Spicewood is seemingly the sequel to Minecraft Dungeons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The leak arrives from X0X_LEAK on <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1897050276374425705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, who has stated that the upcoming Minecraft Dungeons sequel is being referred to internally as “Project Spicewood” and has “been in development for at least 2 years.” The post also reveals more details about the upcoming spinoff title, including the main areas and POIs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to X0X_LEAK, Minecraft has a set of new areas and POIs for the Dungeons sequel; we now know the 3 locations and their places of interest. First up is Honeycomb Fields, which features locations such as Undermill, Farm, Island, Lake, Fields, and Forest. Next is the Desert, which includes a Cliff, Fortress, Mountain, Village and Icelagoon. Last up is Forest, which will introduce a Deep Dark entrance, an Outpost Entrance, a Witchzone, and a Shady Forest Town.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yotei-release-period%E2%80%94when-is-ghost-of-tsushima-2-coming-out-confirmed-platforms.1126116/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-ghost-of-tsushima-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Sucker Punch has been tight-lipped about Ghost of Yotei so far, but we’re keeping an eye on the Ghost of Tsushima 2 sequel. The stealthy standalone follow-up has a few details out in the public already, and it’s looking promising.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a> was a fun surprise announcement during the Sept. 24, 2024, Sony State of Play. Ghost of Tsushima cemented Sucker Punch as a stalwart of a studio following years of success with Sly Cooper and inFamous. Now, it’s back with Ghost of Yotei, and a certain Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-shadows-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> is making Ghost of Yotei more intriguing by the day.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the latest Ghost of Yotei reveals and announcements.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-out">Do we Know When Ghost of Yotei is Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Expect Ghost of Yotei to be just as impactful. Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Ghost of Yotei doesn’t have a release date yet, but its initial reveal trailer claimed a 2025 release is on the cards for the open-world game.</strong></p>



<p>The first trailer was stunning, it was captivating, and it shockingly had a release period. After nearly three minutes of eye-opening action and drama, Ghost of Yotei’s Announce Trailer had a simple message: “2025.”</p>



<p>As of writing, we’ve not heard too much about Ghost of Yotei since. The calendar year is stacked with new games, but Sony’s catalog of hardware-selling goliaths is probably a bit more barren than most would have thought. A delay or a development hiccup could scupper Ghost of Yotei’s 2025 release date, and we’ll update this guide if this is the case.</p>



<p>Also, I’d wager Sucker Punch wants breathing space between Ghost of Yotei and Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Shadows. There are a lot of similarities between both titles, so waiting until Shadows releases is the prudent play.</p>



<p>You can check out the full announcement trailer below—thanks to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation YouTube account</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-ghost-of-yotei-platforms">All Ghost of Yotei Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Ghost of Yotei is currently only scheduled to release on PlayStation 5.</strong></p>



<p>There isn’t a PlayStation 4 port scheduled—which makes sense given the supposed scale of the title—but an eyebrow or two might be raised at a lack of a PC launch. Ghost of Tsushima eventually released on PC a few years after its initial debut.</p>



<p>With Sony’s continued philosophy to bring its exclusives to PC after a while, it’s likely Ghost of Yotei will follow in the footsteps of its predecessor and release on PC later on.</p>



<hr>



<p>More Ghost of Yotei information is sure to drop as 2025 progresses. Could the Ghost of Tsushima successor end up being PlayStation’s star attraction this year? Or does Sony need to deliver more exclusive news? </p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Jersey Betting Bill Could Permit Esports Players to Wager on Themselves]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/esports-betting-players-bet-on-themselves-new-jersey/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-jersey-betting-bill-could-permit-esports-players-to-wager-on-themselves.1126110/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/esports-betting-players-bet-on-themselves-new-jersey/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been discovered that a newly proposed bill in the state of New Jersey could allow esports competitors to <strong>wager on themselves and their teams</strong> if successfully implemented. This bill would be integrated alongside new ‘esports-specific skins’ that would permit licensees to offer odds on esports betting markets in the state.</p>



<p>This news comes almost six years after the state’s first legal esports wager was placed at the Borgata Casino in Atlantic City. In 2021, the state opened its doors to esports betting as part of the legal sports betting portfolio in the region, but things are still developing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-half-the-industry">Half the Industry</h2>



<p>In the most recent edition <a href="https://sharpr.substack.com/p/stake-strikes-viral-gold-with-drake?open=false#%C2%A7nj-bill-will-introduce-esports-specific-skins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of the Sharpr newsletter</a>, it was revealed that New Jersey lawmakers are working on a unique bill that would introduce something quite bizarre. If successfully passed, esports competitors (of legal betting age) could bet on (or against…) themselves or their teams.</p>



<p>It’s hard to see how that <strong>couldn’t </strong>go wrong – it’s a recipe for disaster, surely.</p>



<p>In the report from Sharpr, it was claimed that the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement will have the power to authorise venues holding esports events to accept exclusive wagers on the <strong>outcome </strong>of said events.</p>



<p>The primary sponsor of the bill, William Moen, explained that this is a step to ‘capitalise on an emerging industry.’</p>



<p>It’s a relatively well-known fact that esports betting makes up around 50% of the industry’s overall revenue – a substantial sum. Behind esports betting sits merchandising, ticket sales, sponsorships, and broadcast rights, but the esports industry is still not entirely profitable.</p>



<p>Last September, at ESI Lisbon, an expert panel featuring representatives from GRID, Kambi Abios, and BETER expressed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/growth-of-esports-betting/">billions are being made in wagers</a> and that the esports betting market is no longer ’emerging’, as Moen puts it.</p>



<p>This latest bill proposed in New Jersey seems like a wrong turn, but the state has been at the forefront of esports betting for a while, so there must be some method to the madness.</p>



<p>Admittedly, it’s not the first time something like this has existed. In the past, some sites have offered players the ability to place wagers on themselves in certain games, charging them with completing challenges to receive a payout. That’s entirely different to betting on yourself as a pro esports player in a competitive environment, though.</p>



<p>Have you ever placed a bet on an esports match? Let us know in the comments what the outcome was.</p>
