<p>The Marvel Rivals esports scene is still in its very early days, but the early results have been very positive. The fledgling scene is attracting numerous organizations, strong viewership numbers (thanks to co-streaming), and some exciting rivalries.</p>



<p>The first competitive tournaments have featured plenty of highlights and trash talking, and there’s nowhere to go but up for Marvel Rivals esports.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-esports-is-heating-up-quickly">Marvel Rivals Esports is Heating Up Quickly</h2>



<p>After a month of action across the world, the Marvel Rivals Invitational series has ended, crowning five champions across each of the main regions. Arguably the most interest in Marvel Rivals esports has been in North America, which has attracted the most viewership and the most interest from established organizations.</p>



<p>Excluding the streamer-focused events like Creator Cup and Twitch Rivals, the Marvel Rivals event with the highest viewership peak was the NA Invitational that just concluded yesterday. The event <a href="https://escharts.com/tournaments/mr/marvel-rivals-invitational-north-america-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached 71,099 concurrent viewers at its peak</a>, according to Esports Charts. This number was aided by co-streamers like Shroud, who has become so interested in Marvel Rivals that he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-marvel-rivals-esports-roster-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded a team that competed in the event: Shroud-X</a>. But the event included a trove of larger organizations with dedicated fanbases: Sentinels, Envy, FlyQuest, and 100 Thieves.</p>



<p>100 Thieves have been dominating the competition in North America. Since the squad formerly known as Mutants signed with Nadeshot’s brand, they haven’t lost a single match, thanks in part to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/one-of-marvel-rivals-best-pro-tank-players-plays-on-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the few Vanguard players playing (and winning) on controller</a>. The rivalry between Sentinels and 100 Thieves in VALORANT has carried over to Marvel Rivals, complete with the<a href="https://x.com/MRivalsEsports/status/1903651194196676821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> expected amount of social media back-and-forth</a>. The trash talk is at the perfect level: not too far to be deemed personal or inappropriate, but above the basic level of normal banter.</p>



<p>There’s still plenty of room for Marvel Rivals to grow, but NetEase has committed to investing in the game itself for “10 years and beyond.” And with seasonal tournaments baked into the game’s competitive mode itself, that implies that esports will be a priority for years to come.</p>
