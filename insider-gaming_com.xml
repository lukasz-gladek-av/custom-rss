<p>When you play Battlefield 6 online, you expect to face the wrath of human players. There’s been a lot of discussion about whether or not bots exist in Battlefield 6’s main online multiplayer modes, and we’ve got all the answers and more.</p>



<p>Barely a month into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-redsec-dlc-trophy-list-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>‘s launch, and the word bot has been used to death. It literally means nothing anymore; it’s been said or typed that much. A bot is an AI-controlled character, and you usually find them in training modes, single-player campaigns, and they’re seldom seen in online multiplayer. Which is why it’s more curious that Battlefield 6 players think BF 6 has a bot infestation.</p>



<p>There was a clear and obvious answer to this question for a long time, and then Battlefield Studios made it even easier.</p>

<p><strong>Battlefield 6 does feature bots in its online multiplayer component, not just the campaign.</strong></p>



<p>It’s official, Battlefield 6 has bots. They were already appearing in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Portal</a>, and in multiplayer from the game’s launch (more on this later), but EA and Battlefield Studios made this mainstream information on November 1 with the addition of the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-casual-mode-added-with-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Breakthrough</a> playlist option.</p>



<p>Here’s what the Battlefield Comms page said about it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We understand that sometimes you want to jump into Battlefield but without the intensity of a full PvP lobby. To create a more relaxed way to play while still earning progression and completing challenges, we’re introducing Casual Breakthrough and this new mode is now live in the main menu under the Multiplayer tab.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Casual makes it so that the majority of the lobby is AI bots—with a sprinkling of human players. This is to give users a more relaxed environment without the worry of human sweats ruining their evening. Bots are very easily identifiable as they won’t move authentically.</p>

<p>Their movement patterns are more robotic and stiff. They also tend to stand on the spot and shoot, and you won’t find them jumping and sliding about everywhere in a bid to kill you with motion sickness. If you choose Casual Breakthrough, you’re guaranteed to come up against bots, but let’s find out why you’re coming up against them outside of this mode.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-are-bots-appearing-in-battlefield-6-matchmaking">Why Are Bots Appearing In Battlefield 6 Matchmaking?</h2>



<p><strong>Bots can be used to populate any Battlefield 6 server if the matchmaking system is struggling to fill the lobby.</strong></p>



<p>This has been an ongoing issue since day one: Lobbies being filled up with extra bots to make up the numbers. Battlefield 6 has a more than healthy player count, and will continue to do so for months, maybe years. The game is popular, everyone is enjoying the return to form, and it’s bizarre that bots can appear so regularly.</p>



<p>I’ve encountered my share of bots during later EU hours, and it’s been reported that “Outside peak hours, most lobbies are filled with bots in non-EU/US regions,” according to Reddit.</p>



<p>Multiple regions are reporting that they encounter bots outside of the peak windows, too. Adding bots is simply the most effective way to ensure lobbies are filled with players and there’s no team disparity—especially chaotic 64-player Conquest games, for example.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Worryingly, EA nor Battlefield Studios (as of writing) has yet to address the problem. The closest they’ve come to acknowledging bots is the Casual Breakthrough announcement, and that’s it. Given that a big goal for Battlefield 6 was complete player communication, we’re hoping for some feedback or acknowledgement sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>How frequently are you encountering bots in non-Casual Breakthrough matches? Is it harming your enjoyment of the game?
