<p>The year has come to an end, and if you own a Switch or Switch 2, it is time to look back at all the best games that were released for Nintendo Switch Online in 2025. Nintendo Switch Online is a little different from Game Pass and PS Plus. Instead of providing huge game libraries or Day One releases, NSO provides players with new Classic Games from previous Nintendo platforms each month.</p>



<p>With the base Nintendo Switch Online membership, players get online play, cloud saves, and access to NES, SNES, and Game Boy titles. If players choose the Expansion Pack, they get access to Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, SEGA Genesis, and Nintendo GameCube games. Players also get access to paid DLC for some games, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Insider Gaming has learned that the ongoing price increases in RAM due to the rise in AI could delay the next generation of console releases.</p>







<p>We first mentioned the rumor during our Insider Gaming Weekly episode on December 19th, where we mentioned that we had heard that there are already ongoing talks at the high levels on what the RAM availability could mean for the next generation.</p>

<iframe title="No One Is Buying Video Game Consoles - Insider Gaming Weekly" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1nCctuh3N2g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>From what we’ve heard, the industry as a whole is concerned about RAM availability (as they should be) and what that is going to mean for mass-producing consoles at a competitive price point. Not only for the next generation, but it could also mean that yet more price increases for current generation consoles will hit us in 2026.</p>



<p>RAM modules have increased in price by several hundred percent in the past few months due to the demand for AI, and with the pursuit of AI seemingly not going away anytime soon, RAM availability could continue to be a bottleneck. Or at the very least, the RAM shortage will mean that prices will continue to hike.</p>



<p>It leaves console producers in a very tricky spot moving forward, and while consoles have traditionally been subsidised to a certain extent in the past, it seems like RAM availability and price increases will mean that the next-generation of consoles, which were already believed to be much higher in price than previous generations, could be extortionate.</p>



<p>From what we understand, the situation has led console manufacturers to debate whether the next generation of consoles should be delayed from their intended 2027-2028 release window, with the hope that RAM manufacturers will be able to build out their infrastructure to produce more RAM, therebyallowing prices to drop.</p>







<p>Regardless of what happens, though, it seems that the next couple of years could see the current generation of consoles increase in price further. </p>



<p>What do you think of the ongoing RAM price increases? Let us know on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

<p>When people look back on 2025, they’ll likely find a year that will go down as one of the best for games of the last decade or more. From surprising success stories like Peak and Blue Prince to major AAA blockbusters like Death Stranding 2: On The Beach and Pokémon Legends: Z-A, there was something for everyone this year. But only one game could claim the title of the Insider Gaming community’s 2025 Game of the Year.</p>



<p>After a two-week voting period in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>, the readers voted Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as the Game of the Year.</p>







<p>Released on April 24, 2025, Clair Obscur’s visuals along with the story centered around mortality resonated with players around the world. The game has received near universal acclaim from many, and even walked away with other Game of the Year awards from various events.</p>



<p>The voice acting is some of the best there’s been in years, and even the music can compete with the likes of major motion pictures and games with near billion-dollar budgets. It’s honestly hard to find much to critic about the game, which is why it one with such a large amount of the votes. </p>







<h2 id="h-other-games-received-votes-too">Other Games Received Votes, Too</h2>



<p>While other votes for games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-insider-gaming-community-best-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Multiplayer</a> and Indie Game of the Year were close, Game of the Year was one of the more lopsided. Clair Obscur received 27.8% of the votes while the second-place game, ARC Raiders, earned 14.8%. Rounding out the Top 5 were Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (13.9%), Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (12.2%), and Ghost of Yotei (8.7%).</p>



<p>Other games receiving votes were Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Dying Light: The Beast, Split Fiction, Donkey Kong Bananza, Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>
