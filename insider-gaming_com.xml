<p>The year isn’t over yet and there are plenty of great games still set to be released before it ends. In this article, we’re bringing you the 10 most promising games of December 2024. The last month of the year can hold some good surprises and, so you don’t have to pick through them one by one, I’ve put them all in this list.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-most-promising-games-of-december-2024">10 Most Promising Games Of December 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-infinity-nikki-december-5">Infinity Nikki – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PS5, PC, Android, iOS</em></p>

<iframe title="Infinity Nikki - Gameplay Overview Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zP7dLsL1b6M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Developed by Infold Games, Infinity Nikki is an open-world game that follows a gacha structure similar to Genshin Impact.</p>



<p>One of the game’s main differentiators is its dress mechanic, which profoundly alters the gameplay. Some dresses allow Nikki to float, others reduce her size, others allow her to slide and so on.</p>



<p>Unlike games such as Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves, Infinity Nikki focuses on platforming and relaxing activities such as fishing, looking after animals and collecting insects.</p>



<h3 id="h-ufl-december-5">UFL – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PS5, Xbox Series</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="UFL™ Insider #7" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4YFxD21q2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Popularly referred to as the “Fifa Killer”, UFL is a free soccer game that was conceived with a difficult mission: to stand up to EA Sports FC and eFootball.</p>

</ul>



<p>It’s not easy being the “new kid on the block” in a genre dominated by two forces. Despite the obstacles, the team is motivated to make the game succeed, attracting the attention and investment of personalities such as CR7.</p>



<h3 id="h-fantasian-neo-dimension-december-5">Fantasian Neo Dimension – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series</em></p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Fantasian Neo Dimension is a JRPG led by Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu, two names that practically solidified the genre around the world.</p>



<p>For those who don’t know, Hironobu Sakaguchi is considered the father of the Final Fantasy franchise. In the story, we follow the protagonist Leo on an inter-dimensional adventure to save the Earth from Mechteria, a mechanical infection that steals the emotions and lives of humans.</p>



<h3 id="h-delta-force-december-5">Delta Force – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PC</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>On December 5, Delta Force will receive what the studio considers to be a global open beta for everyone. However, as progress will be maintained, we can consider this to be a PC release.</p>

<p>The console versions will arrive in early 2025. The game is being very well received by the community, featuring both PvE modes, such as the campaign that reimagines the same Black Hawk Down campaign from 2003, and PvP modes such as Havoc Warfare, where 32-player matches take place.</p>



<h3 id="h-marvel-rivals-december-6">Marvel Rivals – December 6</h3>

<p>At first, the game will only be released on Xbox Series and PC. The PS5 version will arrive months later, in April.</p>



<h4 id="h-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-rita-s-rewind-december-10">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind – December 10 </h4>

</p></figure>



<p>Time for nostalgia! There’s nothing more vintage than MMPR: Rita’s Rewind. The game tells the origin story that made the eyes of several generations light up.</p>



<p>The brawler was developed by Digital Eclipse, the team responsible for the excellent TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection.</p>



<p>In the game, you’ll be able to face various enemies and classic bosses from the franchise, such as General Goldar, and all with the possibility of playing in local co-op or online with friends.

</p></figure>



<p>After many years of requests from the community, Legacy of Kain is returning. The two Soul Reaver games will be remastered, bringing improvements in texture, resolution, audio and gameplay.</p>



<p>It’s the perfect opportunity to reminisce about these classics, or, if you’ve never played them, to have that first contact with two games that marked an entire generation and feature many brilliant mechanics.</p>



<h4 id="h-the-spirit-of-the-samurai-december-12">The Spirit of the Samurai – December 12</h4>

</p></figure>



<p>Developed by Digital Mind Games, The Spirit of the Samurai is a 2D action game made in stop motion. Yes, you didn’t get it wrong.</p>



<p>The artistic style chosen by the studio gives the game a great air of originality. The story follows Takeshi, a samurai who must stop an Oni who commands an army of the undead.</p>



<p>The game is heavily inspired by Japanese folklore, featuring a rich lore of the country’s mythology. In addition to Takeshi, at certain points you control Kodama, a brave spirit and Chisai, a warrior cat.</p>

<p>It has been announced that a Squid Game x Call of Duty Black Ops 6 collaboration will be coming in January.</p>



<p>The collaboration was announced on the official X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1863599034759295124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty account</a>, where the account said, “An invite you can’t ignore. Netflix Squid Game comes to Call of Duty this January.”</p>



<p>Squid Game Season 2 premieres on Netflix on December 26, 2024, and the third and final season will be available sometime in 2025. Netflix predicted that by October 2021, Squid Game generated approximately $900 million US in value for the company, with the series only costing $21.4 million to produce.</p>



<p>Call of Duty’s announcement that the collaboration will come in January suggests that it’s likely to drop in the mid-season update for Black Ops 6 Season 1, which is often referred to as the “reloaded” update, which typically comes with new multiplayer maps and game modes. </p>



<p>It’s unclear what exactly the Squid Game and Call of Duty collaboration could entail, but it’s likely to involve new weapons and character skins. Alternatively, Call of Duty and Netflix could do something a little more special with the collaboration this time around, possibly a new party-type game mode.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/virtus-pro-eliminated-shanghai-major-amouranth-team/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/virtus-pro-eliminated-from-shanghai-major-by-amouranth%E2%80%99s-esports-team.1049766/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/virtus-pro-eliminated-shanghai-major-amouranth-team/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Virtus.pro was just forcefully ejected from the Shanghai Major by Wildcard, the esports organisation co-owned by Amouranth. In a crushing defeat, Virtus.pro failed to gain traction against the underdog side that is also facing elimination. </p>



<p>It was a particularly sour loss for Virtus.pro, given that the team is made up of champion-grade players but failed to secure a meaningful win during the opening stage of the Shanghai Major.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-poor-show">Poor Show</h2>



<p>Virtus.pro will be heading home with just $10,000 in winnings, which won’t go a long way towards covering the costs of getting to Shanghai in the first place. It was a struggle from start to finish for Virtus.pro, with the team managing to secure just one win – and that was against Rare Atom, a bottom-table Chinese side with short legs in the game.</p>



<p>Rare Atom’s biggest claim to fame in this event is that the team sent Fnatic packing. The European organisation lost against Wildcard, Cloud9, and finally Rare Item, failing to secure a single point before being ejected from the tournament.</p>



<p>Virus.pro is the latest team to leave the competition in Shanghai, and the team is facing some ridicule on social media because the ultimate loss came at the hands of Wildcard, a team co-owned by Amouranth, the scandalous, controversial content creator. In June, Amouranth secured a significant ownership stake in the North American organisation.</p>



<p>The remaining matches in the opening stage of the Shanghai Major will wrap tomorrow, and then from December 5, the elimination stage will unravel. This round features some of the biggest names in CS2 esports, and it will end with just eight teams making it into the playoff stage, fighting for the $500,000 grand prize.</p>
