<p>More often than not, the management and simulation genre proves massive and complex. On PC, there are countless hotkeys to consider, and to the everyday player, it can feel overwhelming to remember every key combination necessary to quick-build or remove pathing sections. Hopefully, we can help. Here are a few of the most important hotkeys in Planet Coaster 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-important-planet-coaster-2-hotkeys-to-remember">Important Planet Coaster 2 Hotkeys To Remember</h2>



<p>I spent too long ignoring hotkeys and shortcuts in games in favor of simply clicking, and the day I started using hotkeys, I never returned. They make life easier. You can access nearly any menu or mechanic in the game without moving your hand from the keyboard. Of course, remembering every hotkey and shortcut command is initially challenging, but there’s no shame in keeping a guide like this one up on your phone or a second screen. </p>



<p>Here are a few Planet Coaster 2 hotkeys worth remembering:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>CTRL + Z</strong> — Undo</li>



<li><strong>CTRL + Y</strong> — Redo</li>



<li><strong>L</strong> — Light</li>



<li><strong>ALT</strong> — Radial Menu</li>



<li><strong>Right CTRL + Right SHIFT + G</strong> — Hide UI</li>



<li><strong>Z</strong> — Rotate 90 Degrees</li>



<li><strong>Hold Z</strong> — Rotate</li>



<li><strong>X</strong> — Advanced Move</li>



<li><strong>M</strong> — Move</li>



<li><strong>F</strong> — Snap Object to Wall Center</li>



<li><strong>P</strong> — Toggle Angle Snap</li>



<li><strong>CTRL + D</strong> — Duplicate Object</li>



<li><strong>R</strong> — Edit Building</li>



<li><strong>I</strong> — Multi Select</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there are many more hotkeys and shortcuts in Planet Coaster 2, and you can find all of them within the settings menu, but I find you’ll use these more frequently than any other. It’s worth keeping this guide open for quick reference.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, November 10, 16 teams will start competing in the second phase of the BLAST R6 Major Montreal tournament, a $750,000 event that wraps up on November 17 in Canada. The full bracket was revealed recently by Ubisoft, showcasing a series of tantalising matches ahead.</p>



<p>Phase 2 begins with a replication of the Esports World Cup grand finals – that’s representative of the stock of these matches.</p>

<h2 id="h-blast-r6-major-montreal-bracket-locked-in">BLAST R6 Major Montreal Bracket Locked In</h2>



<p>The BLAST R6 Major Montreal is one of the last major esports events of the year, and it’s the last big Rainbow Six tournament before February’s Six Invitational. It stands to reason that there’s plenty to play for, least of all being a fat stack of qualification points for Ubisoft’s premiere Rainbow Six tournament, which is taking place in Boston.</p>



<p>The stacked bracket was just revealed by Ubisoft:</p>

<p>This impressive line-up of matches features some intense clashes, least of all being the face-off between Team BDS and w7m Esports. Mere weeks ago, these teams collided in the grand final of the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, so there’s plenty to prove there.</p>



<p>We could also see something of a redemption story between Liquid and G2 – at the last BLAST R6 event in the United Kingdom, Liquid sent G2 into the elimination bracket, and ultimately, out of the competition. </p>



<p>Between November 15 and 17, the third phase of the tournament will begin, with eight teams having made their way through from the second phase. This is where the deciding matches will take place, with a best-of-five grand final being reserved to crown the victor.</p>



<p>Who do you have winning the entire tournament?</p>
