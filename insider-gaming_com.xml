<p>BLEED Esports’ leadership team has come under fire once again for reportedly failing to pay players and staff. It has been claimed that for more than a year, the organisation has been lying to <strong>all of their players</strong> across multiple games, withholding salaries, and refusing to pay out tournament winnings.</p>



<p>In a straw-that-broke-the-camel’s-back move, the BLEED Esports Rainbow Six roster has pulled away from the organisation following a month of negotiation and communications with Ubisoft, and the players are now on an exposé mission.</p>

<h2 id="h-if-it-bleeds">If It BLEEDs</h2>



<p>The situation with BLEED Esports reached a tipping point when Patrick ‘MentalistC’ Fan, the R6 squad’s IGL, took to social media to slam BLEED’s leadership:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For the past year, BLEED has been lying to all of their players (Valorant, CS2, R6, OW, MLBB, Dota 2…) about payments, failing to pay salaries, making false promises, and withholding prize pools. They only ever provided us payslips with no proof of actual funds, a tactic they used to fool other organisations into thinking that they paid the buyouts of players.</p>



<p>For the past month, we have been consistently and clearly communicating with Ubisoft, pleading our case. We have clearly communicated with Ubisoft that:</p>



<p>BLEED has been ghosting us, having zero intention to cure their contract breach.</p>



<p>BLEED has been full of lies and false promises, and their words cannot be trusted.</p>



<p>As of the writing of this letter, our contract breach notice to BLEED has taken effect. We can now terminate our contracts with BLEED. We are awaiting Ubisoft’s final decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>MentalistC’s Twitter bio now marks him as a player for ‘NOTPAID R6S’, but moving forward, the roster will play under the name ‘BLED’. </p>



<p>He was backed up by other players, such as Taylor ‘Terdsta’ Ching, who claimed BLEED owed him a whopping $35,000. He insisted that he would be unable to pay his bills or even feed himself if it wasn’t for other avenues of income, like streaming.</p>



<p>In the wake of his scandal, seven members of BLEED (including a coach and an analyst) have vacated their Rainbow Six positions. One Counter-Strike coach claimed that BLEED has racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt in the CS world. This allegation came from Aleksandar ‘kassad’ Trifunovic, who claimed that <a href="https://x.com/kassad/status/1856281399617106130" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BLEED’s CEO is actively ghosting</a> the situation and is fully aware of what’s happening.</p>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://escorenews.com/en/r6/news/63631-bleed-r6-players-depart-the-organization-they-only-ever-provided-us-payslips-with-no-proof-of-actual-funds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EscoreNews</a> for the references.</em></p>



<p>The CEO, Mervyn Goh, has been scrutinised by fans and critics for the longest time. The bad press surrounding Goh is often insurmountable. In 2022, he allegedly beat a woman at a nightclub, and in 2023, it was claimed that the Singaporean government struck BLEED Esports from the registry.</p>



<p>If you <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/R6ProLeague/comments/1g297l4/a_deeper_dive_into_the_allegations_about_mervyn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dive deeper into the topic</a>, you start to uncover references to ‘Mervyn Goh En Wei’ being embroiled in a vast array of legal issues.</p>



<p>Presently, nobody has been able to reach the CEO for a statement.</p>



<p>What do you think about this situation? If you’ve got anything to share, feel free to make a note in the comments.</p>
