<p>Call of Duty: Warzone surfaced in 2020 as a free-to-play battle royale of epic proportions. Within just a few days, it had secured tens of millions of players worldwide, and it became known as one of the best games in the genre. Unfortunately, the game didn’t stand up well to the test of time, and after a couple of years, too many bad decisions were made, and players started rapidly abandoning the title.</p>



<p>Given that times have changed and players are still moving on, is Warzone being shut down? Activision won’t support a ‘dying game’ forever, but is Warzone going to be discontinued?</p>



<p>Join me as we find out the answer to that question.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-warzone-dying">Is Warzone Dying?</h2>



<p>In 2025, a prominent Call of Duty leaker revealed that the revival of Verdansk – due to take place in April 2025 – is the last-ditch effort for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/">Activision to bring players back to Warzone</a>.</p>



<p>It was mentioned that if Verdansk isn’t a success and players aren’t retained, then <strong>Warzone will be shut down before Call of Duty 2026 arrives</strong>.</p>



<p>This comes as Warzone struggles under the weight of network issues, a plague of cheaters, and lacklustre updates that haven’t given the community a sense of hope for the future of the iconic battle royale.</p>



<p>The esports scene for Warzone is wavering; streamers are abandoning the game for other battle royales, and players worldwide are losing faith in the platform at large.</p>



<p>When you ask if Warzone is dying, you can just look at the streaming figures for the game:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit: TwitchTracker.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Warzone’s performance on streaming platforms like Twitch is at an all-time low. The peaks we’re seeing now are lower than ever before, which is a telling indicator that the game is dying.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-warzone-being-discontinued">Is Warzone Being Discontinued?</h2>



<p>Presently, Warzone isn’t being discontinued, but there’s a very real possibility that it will be within the next year or so.</p>



<p>If the leaks are to be believed, Verdansk is the last shot developers have at making Call of Duty: Warzone an ongoing success. It’s an attempt to revive the player base and bring millions of users back onto the platform. If it fails, Warzone could be shut down by the end of 2026.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been said if Warzone Mobile will be shut down, though. This speculation is in reference to the ‘main’ version of Warzone on console and PC.</p>



<p>What will you do if Warzone is shut down? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hideki Kamiya Still Wants To Develop Scalebound with Xbox]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hideki-kamiya-scalebound-develop-xbox/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideki-kamiya-still-wants-to-develop-scalebound-with-xbox.1124466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hideki-kamiya-scalebound-develop-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent post on social media, Hideki Kamiya, who founded CLOVERS Inc. after leaving PlatinumGames in 2023, revealed that he’d still love to make Scalebound. The ill-fated RPG was cancelled in 2017 after years of discussions and rumours, but it seems that the Japanese gaming legend hasn’t forgotten about it – to the point that he still wants to make it.</p>



<p>Scalebound was in development at PlatinumGames for around four years before it was ultimately cancelled, and Kamiya was the game’s director. This isn’t the first time that the industry icon has pleaded for Xbox to pick the project up again, though.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shot-down">Shot Down</h2>



<p>PlatinumGames is famous for the creation of titles like Niear and Bayonetta, but Scalebound would have been a more ambitious game on a different level entirely. In Scalebound, players would have explored a world populated by dragons – and dragonriders. It was announced in 2014 with a trailer dropping at E3 (which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/e3-is-officially-over/">has since died a death</a>), and prospective fans were excited.</p>



<p>The year before Scalebound was revealed, Microsoft penned a deal with Platinum, assuming control of Scalebound in exchange for pumping cash into the coffers to build it. It was shaped around a third-person action-RPG model, and it looked good enough on the surface, but it was ultimately cancelled by Microsoft in 2017.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SCALEBOUND Gameplay Trailer (E3 2016)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dgxcs_5cztw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It was cited that the game’s stoppage was caused by issues with the Unreal Engine, ‘an inability to live up to player expectations’, and a lack of experience at the studio creating some of the game’s core elements.</p>



<p>But along came Hideki Kamiya, almost a decade after that cancellation, saying he still wants to make Scalebound:</p>











<p>His cry of ‘Let’s do it, Phil!’ came following a post from CLOVERS Inc. on Twitter. This post revealed that the team at CLOVERS was banded around Kamiya’s desk, reminiscing about Scalebound while watching videos of the game on YouTube. In the snippet, he said, ‘I’d love to make it again someday.’</p>



<p>In 2023, it was suggested in a discussion on a podcast that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/scalebound-revival/">a revival of Scalebound</a> <strong>could </strong>be on the way, but we’ve heard nothing since.</p>



<p>Based on everything we know about Scalebound, would you like to see it made and finally released? Let us know in the comments what you think.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-map-location/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast%E2%80%99s-map-location-is-hidden-in-the-game%E2%80%99s-first-trailer-and-techland-said-nobody-has-found-it.1124460/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-map-location/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is set to be released in the summer, opening up another chapter in the decade-old open-world zombie game. As one of the most prolific games in the genre, Dying Light has enjoyed ten years in the spotlight, and that streak of success is set to persist with the arrival of the standalone game, The Beast.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Dying Light’s franchise director, Tymon Smektała, revealed that there’s a secret tucked away in the first trailer for Dying Light: The Beast, and he believes nobody has found it yet.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-easter-eggs">Easter Eggs</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://thethumbwars.com/dying-light-the-beasts-interview-exclusive-director-talks-missed-trailer-details-banned-games-and-lore-answers-10-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with The Thumb Wars</a>, Tymon Smektała suggested that the ‘general location’ of Castor Woods, the in-game map, is hidden somewhere in an easter egg in the game’s first trailer. He said it’s a ‘barely visible’ piece of text that’s written in a dialect that would ‘hint’ at where Castor Woods is located.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer, in case you want to go egg hunting:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c50gFkG91jc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Where is Castor Woods set?</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve been through the trailer frame-by-frame, and I can’t see any unique dialect that would indicate where Castor Woods is set.</p>



<p>There are plenty of English language signs and storefronts, and everything from warning notices on generators to the emergency number on the back of police vehicles suggests we’re looking at another European adventure. The architecture is hard to pin down, though.</p>



<p>Harran, which was the centrepoint for the first game, was a fictional Middle Eastern city based on Istanbul, Mumbai, and Wroclaw. In Dying Light 2, players explore Villedor, another fictional location that’s an ‘amalgam’ of multiple European cities, including Germany, Belgium, and Poland.</p>



<p>I’m inclined to believe that Dying Light: The Beast is also set in Europe, but I can’t scale it down.</p>



<p>Perhaps you can do better – let me know in the comments if you’ve solved the easter egg.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/</link>

<p>It has been claimed by a prominent Call of Duty leaker that Warzone 3 won’t happen alongside Call of Duty 2026 if Verdansk’s revival fails to retain enough players. That includes either those currently playing or those returning for the map’s revival next month.</p>



<p>Warzone has been in a sorry spot for a while, and Verdansk’s imminent return is expected to move mountains, but for how long?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-the-road">End of the Road?</h2>



<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1896672391457349981">TheGhostOfHope wrote</a> a few exclusive details about Modern Warfare IV – otherwise dubbed ‘COD 2026’.</p>



<p>Amongst <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other details</a>, he claimed that Warzone 3 won’t be implemented alongside next year’s Call of Duty title if Verdansk fails to perform when it’s brought back alongside the Season 03 update. Earlier today, Activision revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/">Season 03 is delayed</a> to April 3 in Black Ops 6 and Warzone to allow more time to finesse the update.</p>



<p>In March 2020, Call of Duty: Warzone was released to an overwhelmingly positive reception, with tens of millions of gamers worldwide pouring their hearts and souls into the battle royale. It changed the face of Call of Duty, creating an entirely new ecosystem that stood at the top of the genre for quite some time.</p>



<p>Things have changed since then, though.</p>



<p>Warzone has been on the rocks for a while, but Activision is hoping that Fornite OG-style event can bring back millions of players. It was claimed recently – also by TheGhostOfHope – that Verdansk will return as it was in 2020, which is sure to be a blast from the past for many players.</p>



<p>Do you think Verdansk is enough to save Warzone, or will the map’s imminent failure prove to be the final nail in the coffin for Call of Duty: Warzone?</p>



<p>Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-2026-is-being-developed-for-the-next-generation-xbox-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1124229/</guid>

<p>It’s been claimed that Call of Duty 2026, which is assumed to be another Modern Warfare title is in development for the next generation Xbox.</p>



<p>That’s according to reputable Call of Duty leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope</a>, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to break the news after it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 of Black Ops 6 would be delayed until April</a>. </p>



<p>According to Hope, the 2026 title is not being development for past generation consoles (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-in-development-for-last-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlike Call of Duty 2025</a>) and is being developed for the next generation of Xbox. If true, this could be our first real hint that the next-gen Xbox could release around Fall 2026.</p>



<p>Also pointed out by Hope is that apparently if Verdansk does not bring players back to Call of Duty: Warzone, a third game in the free-to-play Battle Royale will not release.</p>



<p>Officially, Activision nor Microsoft have released any information on Call of Duty 2026, or even Call of Duty 2025 at this moment in time. But according to our sources, the next game in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty franchise is a Black Ops 2 seque</a>l headed once again by Treyarch Games following rough internal decisions that saw Sledgehammer Games wanting to develop their own fully-fledged Call of Duty title for 2027.</p>



<p>As always, take such rumors with a grain of salt, but Call of Duty 2026 being in development for the next-generation Xbox console is an interesting tidbit of information, if true.</p>



<p>What do you think of the next generation of Xbox potentially releasing in 2026? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/call-of-duty-2025-in-development-for-last-gen-consoles.1711/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Forums.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Activision has just announced the delay of the start of Season 03 of Call of Duty, which is set to herald the return of Verdansk in Warzone. Originally, the second season was set to end on March 20, but it’ll now be more than two weeks <strong>after that date </strong>that season three arrives.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the team at Activision teased an announcement coming on Warzone’s fifth anniversary, which falls on March 10.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-delayed-but-not-for-long">Delayed, But Not For Long</h2>



<p>Call of Duty’s Season 03 update will now arrive on April 3, but before we get there, the teams at Activision are preparing to make some major announcements. In 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-map-verdansk-return-2024/">Insider Gaming exclusively revealed</a> that Verdansk would be returning to Call of Duty: Warzone, and in a couple of weeks, that will be made a reality.</p>



<p>For the first time since 2021, players will be dropping in on Verdansk, which retains the original map layout gamers experienced way back in March 2020.</p>



<p>Recently, Activision also revealed the impending arrival of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-verdansk-collection-stores/">Verdansk Collection</a>, a new merch line set to hit the Call of Duty shop on March 10.</p>



<p>Here’s the social media post that announced the delay:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Season 03 is a big moment for Call of Duty: Warzone and Black Ops 6, and we’re taking the time to deliver a great experience starting on April 3. 

More to come following Call of Duty: Warzone’s 5th anniversary next week…</span></p></article></div>







<p>Fans of the franchise are critically aware that this has to be delivered <strong>just right</strong>, so they’re welcoming the delay with open arms. If the revival of Verdansk isn’t anything short of perfect, Activision will have a revolution on their hands. Warzone has been in the pits for the longest time, and even the game’s most prolific creators are losing interest.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to jumping back into Verdansk when it (likely) arrives with the new season on April 3? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> or in the comments.</p>
