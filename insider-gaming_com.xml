            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new AI-driven research project from Ubisoft, called Teammates, has been revealed. The news comes after the company’s earnings call earlier today, which bolstered <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-hits-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong numbers for Assassin’s Creed: Mirage</a>.</p>







<p>AI in video games isn’t anything new, though the way it’s being used is. In the past, AI would play the role of NPCs, doing commands by code and filling the screen. Now, the process can replace art design, voice acting, and even entire games. Still, it does further exacerbates the lack of human touch to a project, which is never a good thing. Now, it seems Ubisoft is keen on getting in on the AI bubble with a new research project, aptly called Teammates.</p>



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-s-teammates-uses-an-ai-voice-assistant-self-programmable-npcs">Ubisoft’s Teammates Uses an AI Voice Assistant, Self-Programmable NPCs</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Today we’re unveiling Teammates, an AI-driven research project exploring how new tech can deepen the player experience.</p><p>More than just talk, this brand-new experiment adds depth to gameplay by going beyond AI chatbots and turning NPCs into real teammates. Find out more:… <a href="https://t.co/SyISwjJ5af">pic.twitter.com/SyISwjJ5af</a></p></div>— Ubisoft (@Ubisoft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1991930899252810021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3mWlITIuWuu0MoVuR6o8ps/ubisoft-reveals-teammates-an-ai-experiment-to-change-the-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a>, as well as Twitter/X, Ubisoft shared a look at the AI-driven Teammates. While we don’t know how it’ll play, we do get some insight into the project. Framed as an FPS, Teammates has you and two AI NPCs go to an enemy base and save five members of your resistance. To aid you, you’ll have Jaspar, an AI voice assistant who provides tips on gameplay, story, and can tamper with settings with a simple voice command. </p>



<p>The blog goes a bit into detail on the gameplay and your AI NPCs, Pablo and Sofia. Via voice commands, you can tell them where to go, who to shoot, and build the narrative. Teammates’ Narrative Director, Virginie Mosser, spoke on the NPCs in the blog, saying,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>We hope players will feel like they’re shaping the story themselves, not just following it,</strong>” states Mosser. “<strong>When I talk to [my AI squad mate] Sofia, she reacts to what I tell her and it changes my experience. For me, this is a real breakthrough and allows players to experience the story in their own way.</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As of now, there are no plans to do anything with the public just yet. An explainer video is set to come soon, but no date as to when. Playtests did happen earlier this year and more will come soon. The team stresses throughout the piece that human creativity and ingenuity is at the heart of Teammates. Whether or not that statement is accurate does tip a bit to the side given the abundant usage of AI and chatbots. </p>



<p>Interestingly enough, Insider Gaming did release a story on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-multiplayer-shooter-project-scout-rumor-2025/">Project Scout</a>, an in-the-works multiplayer shooter at Ubisoft. From the looks of the screenshots and UI, Teammates could be the basis for the leaked title. Should Project Scout come to be, perhaps you’ll be fighting alongside programmable AI and not your friends.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and Battlefield 6 clash was always going to be a fun narrative at the end of 2025. The player count for both games could determine their long-term success, and tell us which game is ‘winning.’</p>



<p>There’s a point to be made that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-names-battlefield-6-best-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> was going to have the edge with it being the first new release in several years. Then again, Call of Duty is a never-ending behemoth that continues to conquer the gaming world. The Black Ops 7 hype wasn’t great, but again, it’s Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Let’s break down their player count stats and see how each game is faring.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-people-are-playing-battlefield-6">How Many People Are Playing Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big battle. Credit to EA and Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 is currently averaging 150,000 to 200,000 players daily, almost two months after its launch.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, Battlefield 6 hit a peak of <strong>747,440</strong> players (according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>) early on. This is when the hype for the game was otherworldly. Games always drop off as time goes on, but retaining well over 150K players daily is impressive.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s 24-hour peak—on November 21—was <strong>215,985</strong>, showing how much the community is still invested in the shooter. Also, if you didn’t know, SteamDB is considered the leading metric for player counts on PC, and there’s no software to accurately track console data.</p>



<p>With Season 1 launching, following up the RedSec addition, there’s plenty for Battlefield 6 players to enjoy and look forward to. The game will likely get another huge player bump around Christmas as many are inevitably gifted the FPS for the holiday season.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-breaks-franchise-sales-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 has broken franchise sales records</a>, and positive player count numbers will probably carry on.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-people-are-playing-black-ops-7">How Many People Are Playing Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s much harder to track Black Ops 7’s player count data, but we know for a fact that it’s not averaging more than roughly 70,000 players daily, and this figure is likely far fewer.</strong></p>



<p>Individual CoD games are not tracked on SteamDB. Instead, it tracks ‘Call of Duty,’ and multiple CoD titles fall under this banner. This means that even though Steam shows a daily figure for Call of Duty, this is adding up several games: Black Ops 7, Black Ops 6, Modern Warfare 3, etc.</p>



<p>On November 14—Black Ops 7’s launch—SteamDB reported a 24-hour peak of <strong>84,319</strong>. Don’t forget that this stat counts other recent Call of Duty games as well. Meaning the Black Ops 7 player count was probably closer to 70K or 60K at launch—maybe lower! </p>



<p>One week after launch, its 24-hour peak was already down to <strong>72,886</strong> players. Like Battlefield 6, the player count could easily rise over Christmas, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Season 1</a> hasn’t launched yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-people-playing-battlefield-6-or-black-ops-7-more">Are People Playing Battlefield 6 Or Black Ops 7 More?</h2>



<p><strong>Right now, people are declaratively playing Battlefield 6 more than Black Ops 7.</strong></p>



<p>Using the data above, you can see that even with seven weeks extra on the clock, Battlefield likely has between two and four times the player base Black Ops 7 does on Steam. Figures could be different on PlayStation and Xbox, but with reports that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sales-are-down-50-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Sales Are Down 50% In Europe</a>, the story might be a similar one.</p>



<p>Are you playing Black Ops 7 or Battlefield 6? Could this be a wake-up call for Activision? The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> is where you can let the world know your thoughts.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sales-are-down-50-in-europe/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-are-down-50-in-europe.1361107/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It appears that the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 hasn’t been one to write home about for Microsoft and Activision. According to a new report from The Game Business, Black Ops 7 sales numbers are down compared to both Battlefield 6 and last year’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>In data <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">provided to the outlet</a> by GSD, Black Ops 7 sales—both physical and digital—are down 63% compared to Battlefield 6. Obviously, it’s important to note that Battlefield 6 isn’t available on any subscription service, meaning that people need to buy the game if they want to play. So, while the sales numbers for Battlefield 6 are higher, it’s still probably that the overall player count for Call of Duty is actually higher.</p>







<h2 id="h-sales-are-down-compared-to-last-year">Sales Are Down Compared To Last Year</h2>



<p>Where things get a little dicey is when you look at the comparison to last year’s release, Black Ops 6. According to the report, physical and digital sales are down over 50% compared to last year. Again, many can, and will, point the game being available on Xbox Game Pass for Ultimate and PC subscribers. But so was Black Ops 6. </p>



<p>Despite all the numbers being down, Black Ops 7 was still the best-selling game in terms of units and revenue in Europe for the week ending November 16 (its launch week). Battlefield 6, it’s main competition right now, came in fourth in both units sold and overall revenue.</p>







<p>At the end of the day, it’s not like Call of Duty is a dwindling franchise as it’s still generating revenue for its developers and publishers. Still, it’s interesting to see how far sales have fallen and if it’s simply a case of more people playing on Xbox Game Pass, or is there a real drop off in actual interest in the 22-year-old franchise.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Twitch Added To Australia’s Social Media Ban]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-australia-social-media-ban/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-added-to-australia%E2%80%99s-social-media-ban.1361050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Twitch is now the latest platform to be added to Australia’s upcoming social media ban. Just weeks after it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/australia-to-ban-kick-and-reddit-for-children-under-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that Kick</a> would be added, news has come out from Australian media about its main rival being put on the list as well.</p>



<p>First reported by the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-21/twitch-included-in-under-16s-social-media-ban/106036398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)</a>, Twitch’s addition comes less than three weeks before the ban is set to go into effect. For those unfamiliar, the Australian government is enacting legislation that will ban anyone under the age of 16 from having accounts on a number of social media platforms. </p>







<p>Those platforms include TikTok, Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram, Threads, Facebook, YouTube, Kick, and, now, Twitch.</p>



<p><strong>“eSafety has informed Twitch it is considered an age-restricted social media platform required to take reasonable steps to prevent under 16s from having accounts, in accordance with Australia’s Social Media Minimum Age legislation,”</strong> a <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/newsroom/media-releases/twitch-assessed-as-age-restricted-social-media-platform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement on Australia’s eSafety website reads</a>.<strong> “Following Twitch’s own self-assessment, eSafety assessed Twitch as meeting the criteria for ‘age-restricted social media platform’, because it has the sole or significant purpose of online social interaction with features designed to encourage user interaction, including through livestreaming content.”</strong></p>



<p>Starting December 10, Twitch will block the signups from those under 16 and will start deactivating the accounts of current users who aren’t old enough.</p>



<p>According to the office of Australian Communications Minister Anika Wells, there aren’t any more evaluations planned before December 10. That means that the platforms listed above will be the ones that must comply with the new order. That said, this ban is “dynamic”, and that more can be added, or removed, if it need be.</p>







<p>“Our historic law simply aims to provide Australian children with a reprieve from the persuasive pull of platforms,” a spokesperson told ABC. “We are not chasing perfection, we are chasing a meaningful difference in the lives of young Australians.”</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on the growing social media ban for those under 16 in Australia? Should the government really get involved like this, or should the platforms a kid uses be regulated by their parents and guardians?
