<p>During the Call of Duty League Major I finals in Dallas, Treyarch took to the stage to present the future of Ranked Play in Black Ops 7. Next week, the more competitive ecosystem will be introduced to Black Ops 7, allowing players to flex their skills, unlock exclusive rewards, and climb the ranks.</p>



<p>However, in a brief interview, Treyarch explained that changes coming to Black Ops 7’s Ranked Play platform mean that the higher the rank you are, the <strong>harder time you will have</strong>, for multiple reasons.</p>







<h2 id="h-ranked-play-restrictions-on-higher-levels">Ranked Play Restrictions on Higher Levels</h2>



<p>Treyarch appeared in Dallas, Texas, during the CDL Major I grand final to dish the dirt on Black Ops 7’s season two update, scheduled to drop next week. The conversation turned to the imminent arrival of Ranked Play and the <strong>changes </strong>that have been made to the competitive ecosystem.</p>



<p>First, it was confirmed that placement matches are being overhauled. The system will start calculating your opening rank from your first placement match, and after you’ve won <strong>three matches</strong>, you’ll be assigned an amount of SR and a starting rank that <strong>doesn’t </strong>put you at the lowest level out of the gate.</p>



<p>It was then explained that, as you climb the ranks, things get harder. If you make it into the top 250, the most prestigious annals of the Ranked Play platform, you’ll face immense losses when you fail to win your matches. You’ll drop harsher in terms of SR than you would at lower levels, keeping things much more competitive.</p>



<p>Also, you <strong>will not </strong>be able to queue with more than <strong>two </strong>Crimson-or-above-ranked players in one party. This is another limitation imposed to keep things more balanced.</p>



<p>Treyarch also confirmed that new ‘Ranked Play Series’ circuits will start up as season two unfolds. This fresh system will stand at the <strong>end </strong>of the season, allowing users to directly compete against those who finished ‘close to them’ in the Ranked Play space for more rewards and ‘the ultimate bragging rights.’</p>

            <guid>1422310</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/adhoc-studio/" id="2968">AdHoc </a>says they’re working closely with Nintendo to find a pathway forward after a censored version of Dispatch was released on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Dispatch is a superhero interactive fiction video game in which your choices determine how the story unfolds. The game was released in the latter half of 2025 on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. The game was instantly met with critical acclaim and fanfare.</p>



<p>Dispatch eventually made its way to Nintendo Switch 2, but instead of allowing some adult language and content to be censored, the decision was made for you, and the game is permanently censored on the Nintendo Switch.</p>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-response-and-adhoc-s-current-stance">Nintendo’s Response and AdHoc’s Current Stance</h2>



<p>AdHoc initially responded to the backlash by explaining that different platforms have different submission criteria. They also stated that they worked with Nintendo to ensure the content met release criteria and assured players that the core narrative of the gameplay experience remained unchanged.</p>



<p>Nintendo then released a statement confirming that while they inform Partners when a submitted game does not meet their platform’s guidelines, they do not make changes to partners’ content.</p>







<p>AdHoc most recently stated in a <a href="https://discord.com/invite/adhocstudio">Discord </a>message that, like most players, they assumed they could access uncensored mature content on Nintendo Switch because games like The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are also available on the platform. </p>



<p>However, they’re continuing to work with Nintendo on a path forward. Still, they advise players to expect and update their addresses; at least some of the censored content will take weeks due to development time and the console submission process.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“People have a right to be pissed. Lots of lessons learned here. Thanks for sticking with us. More soon.”</p>
</blockquote>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021.

            <title><![CDATA[First Trailer Released for ‘COR3’, An Upcoming Sci-Fi Shooter From Tarkov’s Developer]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cor3-first-trailer-revealed-shooter-tarkov/</link>
            <guid>1422163</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>COR3CORP has released a first-look trailer for COR3, a mysterious sci-fi FPS that has <strong>some kind of tie </strong>to Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov. For more than a decade, Nikita Buyanov has been the head of the studio at Battlestate, spearheading the creation of Escape from Tarkov, arguably the most impactful extraction shooter ever made.</p>



<p>Despite being little more than a minute long, the first trailer for COR3 tells us plenty. It’s a first-person, sci-fi apocalypse title set on Mars. Or at least, that’s what we can glean from the minuscule look at the trailer, which you can see below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-cor3-and-why-is-it-exciting">What is COR3 and Why is it Exciting?</h2>



<p>COR3 is the first project <strong>not associated with Escape from Tarkov </strong>that Nikita Buyanov has touted for many years. In the run-up to the trailer being dropped, weeks of teasers, cryptic posts, and puzzling websites surfaced across social media.</p>



<p>Interested users were presented <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-dev-new-game-revealed-february-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with an interactive website</a> that offered lore and a bit of backstory behind COR3, which is what we <strong>assume to be </strong>the game’s title. That’s still unclear.</p>



<p>The website presented a post-apocalyptic environment, putting players in the shoes of an investigator with a few pieces of rudimentary equipment at their disposal, probing systems to solve minor, gamified puzzles. It’s steeped in mystery, and even though the first trailer has been released, <strong>nobody knows what on Earth (or Mars) they’re looking at</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for your perusal:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PRJRPNT_BLUEMARS_FO" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X9kqyqswsL8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>We’re calling it COR3 because that’s the only title we’ve been given thus far. But the name of the video is PRJRPNT_BLUEMARS_FO, which could be a nod to a potential title. Project Repent: Blue Mars?</p>



<p>It’s impossible to say at this point, as we have almost nothing to go on. It’s now time for internet sleuths to start probing the trailer for some sign of what comes next, as the site that was hosting the countdown to the trailer dropping now shows… Well, <strong>the trailer</strong>.</p>



<p>As the short video opens, we see a first-person perspective, quite reminiscent of Escape from Tarkov in how the character moves and interacts with their weapon, manufactured by ‘Kalash Corp’, and then the camera peels back from ‘Mariner City’ in a ruined state and scales back across Mars.</p>



<p>We go into the clouds, and then eventually into the cosmos, past a space elevator and beyond ruined ships, into the midst of cosmonauts adrift in the great beyond. It’s not ‘astronauts’ here, as the outfits the ill-fated space adventurers are wearing are unmistakably Russian in origin, emblazoned with a red star.</p>
