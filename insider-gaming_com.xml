<p>There’s still a future for Mortal Kombat 1. In a <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1881825221369528644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">multi-post thread</a> on Twitter on Tuesday evening, Mortal Kombat created Ed Boon talked about the state of the game while quickly mentioning future DLC plans for Mortal Kombat 1.</p>



<p>First thing’s first, Boon announced that Mortal Kombat 1 has sold more than 5 million copies since its September 2023 launch. On top of that, the game continues to remain in the top 15 games on PlayStation 5 in terms of weekly active users.</p>



<p>Boon also mentioned the release of the game’s Conan the Barbarian DLC that launched on January 21 as the game’s 11th DLC fighter. A 12th fighter, the T-1000 Terminator, will be the next addition to the game’s roster.</p>



<p>As far as future fighters go, there has been a lot of rumors surrounding DLC wrapping up for the game after the lackluster sales of Kombat Pack 2 and the Khaos Reigns expansion. While Boon didn’t mention another Kombat Pack or story expansion specifically, he did say that there was more to come for players.</p>



<p>“With Conan getting into player’s hands, we are excited to keep trucking forward with future DLC,” he posted. </p>



<p>The end of Mortal Kombat 1 DLC began thanks to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known franchise leaker</a>. According to their claims, says that plans for Kombat Pack 3 and a second story was cancelled at NetherRealm studios. He did say, however, that it was possible for “a kameo or two” to be added to the game after Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 due to the work that had already been done. </p>



<p>NetherRealm hasn’t fully addressed those claims.</p>



<p>What do you think of more future Mortal Kombat 1 DLC being a hinted at? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages’ release date has been leaked and will launch on May 15, 2025.</p>



<p>That’s according to an article released by Gamekult (article since removed), who’s seemingly released embargoed information ahead of the Xbox developer Direct.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that select media will be seeing previews of DOOM: The Dark Ages ahead of the official presentation.</p>



<p>The Xbox Developer Direct is scheduled to place on January 23rd, making the 23rd a somewhat hectic day in the world of gaming as Assassin’s Creed Shadows previews will also drop on the game day.</p>



<p>As already revealed by Xbox, three games; DOOM: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, and Expedition 33 are set to have “in-depth” showcases, while Xbox has also teased a fourth game, which we released the scuttlebutt of what the game is in the latest Insider Gaming Newsletter (sign up below).</p>



<p>As well as the four game announcements, a few other surprises will be announced during the event or in the coming days, Insider Gaming understands.</p>



<p>“You are the DOOM Slayer, the legendary demon-killing warrior and the super weapon in this never-before-seen dark and sinister medieval war against Hell,” the official DOOM: The Dark Ages description reads.</p>



<p>What do you think of DOOM: The Dark Ages releasing in May? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlestate Reviews Tarkov Feedback and Promises to Resolve ‘Key Challenges’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlestate-games-tarkov-feedback-changes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlestate-reviews-tarkov-feedback-and-promises-to-resolve-%E2%80%98key-challenges%E2%80%99.1088178/</guid>

<p>Recently, the team at Battlestate Games rolled out a survey designed to poll Escape from Tarkov players on a variety of topics. In the last few weeks since the most recent wipe hit the game, players worldwide have been suffering under the weight of performance issues, network problems, bugs, and of course, vast swathes of cheaters plaguing the game.</p>



<p>The BSG team revealed that details and results from the most recent survey will be shared online in due course, but for now, they’ve pledged to ‘actively work to resolve’ the key challenges everyone is facing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-promises">Big Promises</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1881773608764092783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on social media</a>, Battlestate Games explained that ‘several technical updates’ are set to hit Escape from Tarkov in the ‘near future’, correcting problems such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Issues causing FPS drops and stuttering in various locations</li>



<li>Issues that caused complete sound loss during raids</li>



<li>Instances where sound was not correctly played indoors</li>



<li>Fixes for issues when loading into a raid as a Scav</li>



<li>Issues where players couldn’t interact with the Lightkeeper due to incorrect spawn points for the Zryachiy and his guards</li>



<li>All causes of invisible bot spawns in raids</li>



<li>Visual adjustments aimed at correcting fog effects on various locations</li>



<li>Issues with item availability and in-game trader quests</li>



<li>Issues where players would receive empty crafts in the “Cultist Circle” module of the Hideout</li>



<li>Client freezing when posting an offer on the flea market for an item found via the “Linked Search” function</li>



<li>Adding a graphics settings parameter: “Disable frame limit in-game when Nvidia Reflex is turned off”</li>



<li>Incorrect functionality of the Cyclone “Shahin” 3.7x thermal scope.</li>
</ul>



<p>Fans were quick to jump on the post and suggest further changes and quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<p>Among the suggestions sat topics like new spawn locations and loot routes on certain maps, more intricate mechanics in the Hideout, and adding more features to PvE that <strong>are not </strong>included in the ‘offline’ mode.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov remains the most popular extraction shooter in the world, even if it is suffering with more than a few issues at present. As always, the cycle will continue – players will start dropping off now to enjoy other games, but by the time the next wipe arrives, they’ll be gearing up to come back.</p>

<p>Skins in CS2, as you know, can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sell-cs2-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fetch a pretty penny on the high side</a>, but what about cheap skins in CS2? A virtual economy worth billions is the result of the introduction of tradeable skins to Counter-Strike over a decade ago, highlighted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-expensive-counter-strike-skins-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the rarest and most lucrative weapon skins</a>. </p>



<p>Some of the rarest skins ever opened from a case have sold for thousands of dollars, but not everyone has the money to throw around so lavishly. Rather than spend money on those skins, or on case-opening keys, some players just want to have a complete inventory without breaking the bank.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-best-cheap-cs2-skins">Best Cheap CS2 Skins</h2>



<p>Rather than list cheap skins for every single weapon, we’re going to focus on a few options for what are considered the primary weapons: the main rifles and default pistols for the T-side and CT-side, the AWP, and the knife. Skins for these weapons are generally more expensive anyway, given how often they’re seen and used, so finding value here is the most important.</p>



<p>Each price listing is the lowest price at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-cs2-skin-wear-rating-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Well Worn or higher wear rating</a>. Well Worn items are cheaper but not as cheap (or worn out) as Battle-Scarred items.</p>
