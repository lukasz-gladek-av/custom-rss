<p>Postal 2 is back for a brand new audience. Developer Running with Scissors has revealed Postal 2 VR for PlayStation VR2, Steam VR, and Meta Quest.</p>



<p>The VR port comes 22 years after the game’s original release in 2003.</p>



<p>“For the first time ever, POSTAL 2 is fully reimagined for VR, bringing its dark humor, open-world mayhem, and unapologetic absurdity to an entirely new level,” the game’s description reads. “Step into the well-worn boots of The POSTAL Dude, a hapless everyman just trying to get through the week in the bizarre town of Paradise, Arizona. Whether you choose to play it cool or go completely POSTAL is entirely up to you.”</p>

<p>According to the developers, the game will “take full advantage of virtual reality”.</p>



<p>“Feel every reload with manual weapon handling, interact with NPCs like never before using gesture-based reactions, and navigate the chaos with an overhauled inventory and minimap system designed specifically for VR,” they said.</p>



<p>“This is POSTAL 2 like you’ve never experienced before—fully unhinged, wildly immersive, and ready to let you loose in the most chaotic VR playground imaginable.”</p>



<p>An official release date will be announced in the future. In the mean time, you can check out the official reveal trailer for the game, below.</p>
