<p>It’s a fact of the franchise that you don’t have to explore the wastelands of Fallout alone. There’s always the option of roaming the open, desolate world with a companion by your side, be that a human, robot, or animal companion. There are dozens of memorable partners stretched across the entire series, but in this list, we’re breaking down the 10 best Fallout companions <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>Does your favourite Fallout companion make the list? Let me know in the comments.</p>



<h2 id="h-greatest-fallout-companions-ever">Greatest Fallout Companions Ever</h2>



<p>It was tough to narrow this list down to just the 10 best Fallout companions, but we did it. If your all-time favourite companion didn’t make the list, let us know in the comments and perhaps we’ll see where they can fit into the line-up. It’s worth stressing that this list isn’t a ranking; it’s just collectively the 10 best Fallout companions ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-dogmeat-fallout-4">1. Dogmeat (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dogmeat is a Fallout staple, having been introduced to the series back in 1997, in the first-ever game. This lovable pup resurfaced in Fallout 3 (2008), and then again in Fallout 4 (2015) – but it’s that latter title in which this canine companion made the most lasting impression on the player. </p>



<h3 id="h-2-boone-fallout-new-vegas">2. Boone (Fallout: New Vegas)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Boone’s story is one of heartbreak, revenge, and devastation, and that’s why he’s one of the best Fallout companions ever. In Boone, you’re not just getting a crack-shot sniper, you’re getting an emotional sub-story that will stay with you long after you’ve decided who gets ownership of The Strip.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-paladin-danse-fallout-4">3. Paladin Danse (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Like Boone, Paladin Danse is a well-trained soldier with an emotional story wrapped around him, only you don’t know that when you first meet him in Fallout 4. While journeying with Danse, you’ll uncover a crushing secret that could devastate or inspire you to change how you think about the rest of the game. </p>



<h3 id="h-4-goris-fallout-2">4. Goris (Fallout 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>That’s right, once upon a time, Fallout players could travel the Wasteland side-by-side with a sentient, intelligent Deathclaw by the name of Goris. From a band of Deathclaws turned hyper-intelligent comes Goris, a <strong>kind </strong>creature that attempts to hide his gruesome appearance by shrouding himself under a robe. Hint: it doesn’t work.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-strong-fallout-4">5. Strong (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Strong is iconic and one of the best Fallout companions for one reason – he bucks the trend. He’s a Super Mutant with a curious streak; a desire to seek out the ‘milk of human kindness’ and evaluate the human race at large. He’s not the first Super Mutant companion in Fallout, but he certainly is a memorable one.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-marcus-fallout-2">6. Marcus (Fallout 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>From one Super Mutant to another, we now come to Marcus, one of the few Fallout characters who has made an appearance in more than one game. In Fallout 2, the player can pair up with Marcus, an unusually intelligent and inspirational Super Mutant with a perfectly normal, reasonable personality. He resurfaces in Fallout: New Vegas, but cannot be recruited.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout"><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout/">10 Most Iconic Brands From Fallout</a></strong></h6>



<h3 id="h-7-maccready-fallout-4">7. MacCready (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Like Marcus, MacCready can be found in two different Fallout games – but he’s a less recognisable character. In Fallout 3, MacCready is the mayor of Little Lamplight, the cave in which a band of children survives the nuclear wastes. He reappears in Fallout 4, which is set around ten years later, as a well-honed marksman with a dark backstory.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-nick-valentine-fallout-4">8. Nick Valentine (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nick Valentine is crucial to progressing the core story of Fallout 4, and because of that, he’s vital to the player’s presence in the game. He’s also one of the most interesting characters in Fallout and easily one of the best Fallout companions ever. He’s a synth that’s accepted by the survivors of the Commonwealth, which is no easy feat, and his psyche is that of a classic private eye – an old-school detective. </p>







<h3 id="h-9-charon-fallout-3">9. Charon (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Charon is a super-effective, hyper-powerful Ghoul combatant with not much say but plenty of damage to dish out. He’s a machine, making use of a devastating shotgun to wreak havoc in a fight, but in true Fallout 3 fashion, he’s not invincible and can permanently die if you’re not careful. He’s one of the best companions in Fallout 3, without any doubt.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-ed-e-fallout-new-vegas">10. ED-E (Fallout: New Vegas)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>ED-E is a simple, charming robot with barely any personality whatsoever, and despite being a relatively passive companion, ED-E boasts some great boosts and one of the most curious and subtly complex side quests in New Vegas. ED-E is a permanent companion, cannot be killed, and can repair things at the press of a button – that’s not bad for a broken robot discarded in the town of Primm.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/donk-elo-might-not-matter-cs2-esports-pros/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cs2%E2%80%99s-donk-explains-what-gets-esports-players-into-the-pro-leagues.1285011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets is one of the most popular Counter-Strike players in the world right now. His meteoric rise to fame began just a couple of years ago, and in the last 18 months, he has become one of the winningest players in the CS2 space.</p>



<p>Recently, donk offered up a home truth, explaining how esports players are more likely to ‘make it’ if they have the right attitude. He stressed that Elo isn’t the best representation of a pro player’s stature, and it shouldn’t be relied on when making decisions as a scout.</p>



<h2 id="h-elo-might-not-matter-in-cs2">Elo Might Not Matter in CS2</h2>



<p>In a statement captured by <a href="https://escorenews.com/en/csgo/news/71528-donk-getting-into-esports-directly-depends-on-dedication-and-persistence-not-on-some-metrics-like-elo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EscoreNews</a>, Team Spirit’s Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets explained what it takes to get into the pro leagues as an esports competitor:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The chances of getting into esports directly depend on dedication and persistence, not on some metrics like Elo. You can have a lot of Elo at 13, but stagnate and not develop for four years. Then no one will need you.&nbsp;Zweih&nbsp;had two thousand Elo in 2023, when I had 5k. Two years later, we ended up on the same team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an earlier interview, donk revealed that his Counter-Strike approach is built mostly around instinctive actions, which require a high level of self-trust and confidence in decision-making.</p>



<p>It’s certainly something to take away for the average esports aspirant, as donk has had a staggering year in the Counter-Strike 2 space.</p>



<p>Since early 2024, donk has exploded, picking up wins at various top-tier tournaments:</p>



<ul>
<li>February 2024 – IEM Katowice</li>



<li>June 2024 – BLAST Premier Spring Final</li>



<li>September 2024 – BetBoom Dacha Belgrade</li>



<li>December 2024 – Perfect World Shanghai</li>



<li>January 2025 – BLAST Bounty Spring</li>



<li>May 2025 – PGL Astana</li>



<li>August 2025 – IEM Cologne</li>
</ul>



<p>He’s fast becoming one of the most recognizable names in Counter-Strike, and he insists that players should stop focusing so heavily on Elo. It was mere weeks ago that he secured MVP in Cologne at one of the most prestigious events in the business, so he knows something.</p>



<p>Do you think donk is right? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-champions-2025-bundle-revealed-riot/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Riot Games has unveiled the VALORANT Champions 2025 bundle, including skins for the Vandal and a gorgeous Butterfly Knife. For the first time, the VALORANT Champions bundle will feature a Flex item, which is a neat replication of the VAL Champs trophy that is believed to interact with the leaderboard for each match a player appears in.</p>



<p>The VALORANT Champions 2025 bundle also includes, as expected, a spray, player card, and gun buddy.</p>



<p>Check out the entire bundle below and find out when it’s coming to the VALORANT store.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-valorant-champions-2025-bundle-coming-to-the-store">When is the VALORANT Champions 2025 Bundle Coming to the Store?</h2>



<p>The VALORANT Champions 2025 bundle will be added to the VALORANT store on September 4, and the bundle will remain live until October 9, 2025. This is a long enough window for any VALORANT esports fans to show their appreciation for the tournament by securing the bundle.</p>



<p>But how much will the VALORANT Champs bundle cost this year? The price hasn’t been confirmed, but it’s <strong>expected </strong>to cost around 6,100 VALORANT Points (VP). That’s around $65 USD in real-world money.</p>



<p>True esports fans will recognize that a portion of that price tag goes to the team partnered with Riot Games in the VCT circuit, so it might seem like a lot, but you’re paying a little something in the pockets of the players you love.</p>



<p>The VALORANT Champions 2025 bundle was revealed by Riot Games with a short, one-minute trailer on social media:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Both the VAL Champs Vandal and the Butterfly Knife look fantastic in the new bundle, boasting exclusive gold trim that shimmers and shines as you dominate the game.</p>



<p>This year’s VALORANT Champions tournament will take place in Paris from September 12 to October 5, and it’s toting a $2.25 million prize pool.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll part ways with $65 to secure the VALORANT Champions 2025 bundle? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-escape-from-tarkov-coming-to-steam-%E2%80%94tarkov-steam-release-date-explained.1285002/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov is arguably the most popular and prolific extraction shooter in the world, but it has earned that status without ever having landed on Steam. This is where most PC games build their audiences, but Escape from Tarkov has managed to grow while being hosted exclusively on Battlestate Games’ proprietary launcher.</p>



<p>That’s all well and good, but is Escape from Tarkov coming to Steam, and if it is, when will it be released on Valve’s flagship PC platform?</p>



<p>Read on to find out everything we know about Escape from Tarkov on Steam.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-tarkov-coming-to-steam">When is Tarkov Coming to Steam?</h2>



<p>It’s not yet known when Escape from Tarkov is coming to Steam, but we do know it’s slated for release on the platform. This is based on a reveal made during a stream in April 2024, when Battlestate Games made the public promise that Escape from Tarkov would come to Steam after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s 1.0 release</a>.</p>



<p>The 1.0 release for Escape from Tarkov is now scheduled for November 15, 2025, which means that the game’s Steam release could be dated in the months following that – potentially landing before Summer 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-has-tarkov-never-been-on-steam">Why Has Tarkov Never Been on Steam?</h2>



<p>In 2025, Escape from Tarkov: Arena, the spin-off multiplayer shooter, was released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the Epic Game Store</a>. This was the first time that an Escape from Tarkov product appeared on a third-party launcher or storefront, but it set a powerful precedent for the world’s most popular extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Many have theorized why Battlestate Games has never released Escape from Tarkov on Steam. On one side, it could be because the developer doesn’t want to share revenue with Valve, which takes a portion of the profits from every game sold on the platform.</p>



<p>On the other hand, it could be because of Steam’s lenient refund policy, which allows users to claim a refund with less than two hours of play time on almost any game, without reason.</p>



<p>Whatever the reason might have been, the situation appears to have been resolved as Battlestate Games once again <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-steam-release-teased-battlestate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased a Tarkov Steam release</a> in August 2025.</p>



<p>Will you buy Escape from Tarkov if it launches on Steam? Let me know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>
