<p>According to a reliable leaker, Fortnite’s next game collaboration could be with the popular Like a Dragon series (formerly Yakuza).&nbsp;</p>



<p>ShiinaBR, known for providing players with Fortnite leaks at the earliest, recently posted about the Yakuza collaboration on <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1889756376404029528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>. Their post revealed that the series’ beloved characters, Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima, will be coming to Epic’s popular battle royale. <span>The information comes from&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Wensoing" target="_blank">Wensoing</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD" target="_blank">Loolo_WRLD</a>&nbsp;on X. Kiryu was the initial protagonist for the series, whereas Majima leads their latest game,</span>&nbsp;Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. </p>



<p>Fans are already pumped for the Fortnite x Yakuza collaboration, with many hoping for a slew of emotes and song tracks for which the Like a Dragon series is popular. Players have also started discussing alternate outfit options for the characters, such as “<a href="https://x.com/Hakuji_03/status/1889846041928933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Mad Dog style and the Cabaret Manager style</a>”. Some wonder if Ichiban Kasuga could be added in the future, too.</p>

<p>In other news, Fortnite is gearing up for a new season called Lawless, which will be released on February 21, 2025. The next adventure takes players to Crime City, where Big Dill is dropping their new single. According to ShiinaBR, the upcoming season’s vaults can’t be opened with key cards and must be broken into with <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1889782607249818034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thermite</a>. Releasing the Yakuza collaboration with the upcoming season makes sense, too, as it matches the “Lawless” theme.&nbsp;</p>

Also, the game might receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-get-more-dc-collabs-after-multiversus-shutdown-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more DC collabs</a> after the Multiversus shutdown.

<p>Milestone has announced the official release date for Monster Energy Supercross 25. Available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, the game is scheduled to launch on April 10, 2025.</p>



<p>It’s been two years since the last game in the franchise, and the developers at Milestone have been “re-inventing” the franchise “from the ground up.” Monster Energy Supercross 25 sees the franchise make the move to Unreal Engine 5 and leave the last-gen systems behind.</p>



<p>“[With] Unreal Engine 5, the game delivers a graphical overhaul with a cutting-edge physics system for precise control over riders and bikes, both in the air and on the ground, as well as the integration of neural AI for increased immersion,” Milestone said. “This package of novelties will result in a more realistic and simulative gameplay which all fans will get to master through dedicated tutorials.”</p>



<p>Along with the release date, a short gameplay showcase trailer was released to give players a look at the gameplay changes coming with the new game. You also get a look at the Anaheim 1 and Glendale circuits with their 2025 layouts as well as a custom-built Motocross course exclusive to the game.</p>



<p>Monster Energy Supercross 25 launches April 10. Those who pre-order the game will get access starting April 7.</p>

<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket card listings have been spotted on eBay, with players charging around $10 for some cards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/people-are-making-money-selling-virtual-pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, Pokemon TCG Pocket cards like <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/405516225584?_skw=pokemon+trading+card+game+pocket&amp;itmmeta=01JKZ7CQRGBCSSKACZV0DRADFH&amp;hash=item5e6aa68c30:g:X6kAAOSwb4FnnyZ-&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1eF6GR6UIxsrCeh9V9p9DhqadEgZyZ5Xp9TDFdXwq3aEI2tK5%2BeaL%2BSWVUFnlsgHgMEPCr%2BYiz6rzyrQrwdjWu81kj9hGgPEj8Wz8nf5fvi8%2FDOZLjnu%2FHT%2FD9A0WJGCAj7nvDXW76koW6z7dheEVkYiKNanxupqbXAah7pKys5xz9dv6fQG%2FcMHqApI8KgJTwSCbYNPmJFtPdb2BVpsVf2uCRL0ZIG%2FdK8EHBT%2BnEY0LhYflRGtWNBnLLqaHsTq63haDs0b4FhT4w68S8PsdAN%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR7T8suefZQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blastoise Ex</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/316188339515?_trkparms=amclksrc%3DITM%26aid%3D1110006%26algo%3DHOMESPLICE.SIM%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D280766%26meid%3D4d4addc9a15446559b0d13c582e1788b%26pid%3D101224%26rk%3D2%26rkt%3D5%26sd%3D316188373597%26itm%3D316188339515%26pmt%3D0%26noa%3D1%26pg%3D2332490%26algv%3DDefaultOrganicWebV9BertRefreshRankerWithCassiniEmbRecall%26brand%3DPok%25E9mon&amp;_trksid=p2332490.c101224.m-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mewtwo Ex</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/405516259939?_skw=pokemon+trading+card+game+pocket&amp;itmmeta=01JKZ7CQRGGP8QY4S7PQ1EXW1Q&amp;hash=item5e6aa71263:g:9IkAAOSw1GJnnyqL&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1f4BEHVgCJq8rJeMbdXEbBdJG8VpHIbnDQlWd0Lp7qNEKWy1%2Bq6A2CrGmBzIV2qahSdEr8agf955XrOO2GfsbBBfWdB5jEIIhrn%2B9dU7wEDniSYs%2BjQKXYmkaz%2FRbOzR3u2ZRzaetp%2F87cuBvmAwDhN3JX6pLPfeNq2K7noujawG0nh5AbSewwstejyIeDyJFuSl%2B1NUCX5zx907NaSJOP80bV7XnQJ%2FywHpsBrojP770YDG6ZVAmebITPKUlu%2FtKjb5Vlbxjq7ealMxLsnbUcg%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR7T8suefZQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gengar Ex</a>, and more have been listed on eBay, with prices ranging from $4 to $10 for each card. Players on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ioctqy/this_is_actually_insane_lol/?share_id=ZW-qMKXrJkBFfLFq-ZP_M&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/PTCGP</a> subreddit have also caught on, with one user posting a screenshot of someone trying to get $5 out of them for a Tauros. The community on the subreddit wants such players to be reported instantly, but the game doesn’t have the feature. However, some wonder how one would prove a card was sold or not sold for real money outside the app, even if a report feature existed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The eBay listing for these cards has appeared even after Pokemon TCG Pocket rigorously tried to stop players from using real money to trade. The developers have already notified players that using “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-real-money-trade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real money</a>” to trade is an offence that can get them banned. Moreover, the developers had instilled <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restrictions</a> into the trading feature to prevent such behaviour, but players have clearly found a way past them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, one of the restrictions of Pokemon TCG Pocket’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-trade-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trading feature</a> states that players can only trade cards of the same rarity, which means the eBay traders will receive a new Ex card for every Ex they trade. This means they can keep doing these trades until the developer catches them.</p>



<p>In other news, Pokemon TCG Pocket recently gifted players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-gifting-players-free-trade-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,000 free trade tokens</a>.
