<p>Nintendo has recently updated its detachable dual-screen patent. </p>



<p>Nintendo and patents are two words that we have been listening to together constantly for the past couple of months, however, not for the reasons you would expect. The patents in question relate to the Palworld lawsuit, with Nintendo recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-modifies-patent-amid-ongoing-palworld-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modifying one</a> of them. However, the new update is for a hardware tech, rather than a game. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-nintendo-going-to-announce-a-detachable-second-screen-for-the-switch-2">Is Nintendo Going to Announce a Detachable Second Screen for the Switch 2? </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/548389/article/nintendo-updated-their-detachable-dual-screen-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, Mike Odyssey on <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1956093315931365493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) informed players about the update on Nintendo’s detachable dual-screen patent. Their post reveals that the update was released yesterday, August 14, 2025, accompanied by new images. These images illustrate how the detachable screen connects to the primary device and also showcase the spring mechanism and various buttons that will be used on the device. </p>

<p>For those wondering, the patent regarding Nintendo’s detachable second screen was seen first in 2023. At that time, many players speculated that Nintendo could be returning to its roots with the Switch 2, introducing a DS-like second screen that could be detached when not in use. However, the Switch 2 has now been released, and we have yet to see any announcements for this detachable screen. </p>



<p>In other news, a new claim states that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-wont-launch-on-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not be available</a> on the Nintendo Switch 2 at launch. Additionally, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-lookalike-appears-on-nintendo-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld lookalike</a> has been spotted on Nintendo’s store.

<p>A dataminer has uncovered that GTA 5 had a climbing feature that was tested and scrapped before launch. </p>



<p>Players have been eagerly awaiting more GTA 6 news since the game’s release date was announced, set for May 26, 2026. However, all we have learned since the last trailer is that the upcoming title will feature a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fair-price-80-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fair price</a>“. However, until we see some gameplay for GTA 6, players can read about new details on GTA 5’s scrapped features that have surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-gta-5-had-a-feature-called-handholds-which-was-tested-and-scrapped">GTA 5 Had a Feature Called ‘Handholds’, Which Was Tested and Scrapped </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/gta-5-climbing-parkour-gameplay-feature-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, the new details about GTA 5’s cancelled climbing feature come from Lucas7yoshi_RS on <a href="https://x.com/Lucas7yoshi_RS/status/1956065169005510657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). It seems that developers were testing a feature called “Handholds,” which was used to define “climbable” objects in the game. These included pipes, walls, poles, and more. The dataminer found a file called “handholds.xml”, but the file only contains test points. </p>



<p>The dataminer also points out a recent video from GTA content creator, whatever57010, which highlights “some oddly placed lightpoles”. The dataminer notes that several test points were also discovered near the same roof as the light poles. Moreover, the poles might have been there to test the climbing features; however, the GTA 5 developer may have forgotten to remove them afterward. Interested readers can check out these test points in the post embedded below: </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Years before release an idea was tested and scrapped in GTA 5 called "Handholds".<br>It was some sort of way to define climbable things like pipes, walls, that might've required pressing buttons for each point.<br>A handholds.xml file is left over, but contains only test points. <a href="https://t.co/LrgmXEzxme">pic.twitter.com/LrgmXEzxme</a></p>— Lucas7yoshi_RS – Lucas7yoshi, but rockstar (@Lucas7yoshi_RS) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lucas7yoshi_RS/status/1956065169005510657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-gta-5-npc-behaviour-detailed-in-game-files">GTA 5 NPC Behaviour Detailed in Game Files </h2>



<p>While scouring through the files, the dataminer also found <a href="https://x.com/Lucas7yoshi_RS/status/1956135971965296873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">references</a> to NPC behaviour in GTA 5. For example, homeless NPCs would insult and ask for change from Michael and Franklin, but would only greet Trevor with a simple ‘hi’. Similarly, buff NPCs would insult Michael, calling him unfit, whereas Franklin would get a ‘hi’ from them. Moreover, firemen, medics, and posh NPCs only say hi to Michael. </p>



<p>In other news, GTA’s longest-serving actor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lazlow-doubt-gta-6-longest-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubts</a> he will be a part of GTA 6. Also, GTA Online will soon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-will-soon-require-age-verification-to-play-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">require age verification</a> to play, according to a new claim. What are your thoughts on GTA 5 developers testing and scrapping the climbing feature? Do you think the feature can be included in GTA 6?
