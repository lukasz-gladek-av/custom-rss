<p>A remake of Resident Evil 0 is in the works, according to a new report.</p>



<p>Since 1996, the Resident Evil franchise has been the pinnacle of playable horror. With its 30th anniversary next year and a new entry, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-returns-to-survival-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, coming out in February, there’s a lot to look forward to. However, some fans have been clamoring way before Requiem for another remake, like Resident Evil 4 had. Rumors have gone around for a while about it but, now, we have a credible source with a scoop on what that remake is and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-0-report-details-plot-changes-release-and-casting">Resident Evil 0 Report Details Plot Changes, Release, and Casting</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In an article from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-resident-evil-0-remake-in-development-new-casting-and-plot-details-unearthed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mp1st</a>, which previously reported on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rare-cancelled-everwild-screenshots-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everwild</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-reboot-concept-art-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark</a> leaks, the site managed to get information on a remake of Resident Evil 0. The report claims that the project is currently in development under the nickname Chamber and won’t be out likely until 2028. It claims that DuskGolem’s report on a Resident Evil Code Veronica remake are true and will release in Q1 2027.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, some new details on its story and casting are in the piece. For example, it’s reported that Billy Coen, the game’s secondary protagonist, will be played by Jon McLaren. The actor, notable for portraying Star Lord in 2021’s Guardians of the Galaxy game, currently has a title called Project Chamber in his resume. If true, it does mean, like the remakes before, no original actors will reprise their roles.</p>



<p>Lastly, changes to the game’s plot look to be happening. The article <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-resident-evil-0-remake-in-development-new-casting-and-plot-details-unearthed">goes into spoilers</a>, but, to put it simply, a character not fully present in Resident Evil 0’s narrative is in the remake in a more vital way. Even more so, a new storyline will be added, though its implications or further details were not revealed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As always, until it’s true, take the report with a grain of salt. Still, with how many times Resident Evil 0 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been rumored</a> for a remake, it does seem reliable. Interestingly enough, a special video celebrating the franchise is releasing on October 29th for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Requiem’s pre-order start date</a>. We could perhaps see the announcement of 0 and Code Veronica at the event, but we don’t know. Still, with the new report, now may be a good time to refresh on your Resident Evil lore.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-theme-song-lana-del-rey-report/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-first-light-theme-song-artist-reportedly-revealed.1328995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>007 First Light may have found its theme song singer in a popular Grammy-award-nominated pop singer.</p>



<p>The upcoming James Bond action game from IO Interactive looks to be one of the biggest hits for next year. With an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gemma-chan-announced-for-007-first-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all-star cast</a>, there’s a lot riding on the Hitman developer’s next project, set to release on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 27th, 2026</a>. The Bond franchise, aside from brilliant action and espionage, is notable for its amazing theme songs. From Adele for Skyfall to Billie Eilish for No Time to Die, the singers involved are the industry’s best. Now, it looks like another iconic performer is ready to shake and stir the community, if a new registration is anything to go by.</p>



<h2 id="h-lana-del-rey-reportedly-performing-007-first-light-s-theme-song">Lana Del Rey Reportedly Performing 007 First Light’s Theme Song</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a Reddit thread on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lanadelrey/comments/1oaryb3/lana_del_rey_has_registered_a_new_song_titled/?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">/lanadelrey subreddit</a>, fans noticed a new song registration with ASCAP under the title “First Light”. While it’s unknown if the two are connected, it’s possible Lana Del Rey is doing the opening theme for 007 First Light. The singer, known for her alternative pop music, is a household name for many. Nominated for several awards, including Grammys, the “Video Games” singer has been going strong since the early 2010s. She is also notable for doing the film adaptation of The Great Gatsby with her song, “Young and Beautiful”. For many fans, Lana Del Rey is a perfect choice, as her style vibes well with the tones of Bond.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that nothing is confirmed about Lana Del Rey and 007 First Light. In fairness, it could just be a new single from the artist, her first since 2024. The singer is also releasing a new album next year, Stove, so it could be a track from it. However, James Bond themes almost always keep the film’s name as the song title, like with Adele’s “Skyfall” and Paul McCartney’s “Live and Let Die”. Either way, fans are getting a new Lana Del Rey song soon and, if connected to Bond, perhaps some new gameplay of 007 First Light.</p>



<p>Do you think Lana Del Rey is doing the 007 First Light theme? If so, are you excited to hear it? Who do you want to do a Bond theme song?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-october-20-862/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-862-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-monday-october-20.1328983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Monday has arrived, and it’s time to beat back those blues by starting on a high note, continuing your NYT Connections streak with the best hints and solutions I’ve got for you. Today’s task was a little tricky, but I managed to pull together what you need to get a strong start on the week.</p>



<p>Check out the full NYT Connections hints for today below.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-20">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 20)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #862:</p>



<ul>
<li>BUGBEAR</li>



<li>UNI</li>



<li>COMPLEX</li>



<li>AS</li>



<li>BIG BEAR</li>



<li>DEMON</li>



<li>A</li>



<li>CENTAUR</li>



<li>BE</li>



<li>CAPRI</li>



<li>HANG-UP</li>



<li>HUNTER</li>



<li>I</li>



<li>LYRE</li>



<li>K</li>



<li>POP</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words relate to internal struggles or mental blocks that can hinder progress.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each word is part of a constellation or closely associated with celestial mythology.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Each word is something elemental</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Think movie theatre, astrology, trees, and mythical horses</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 20.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-20-862">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 20 (#862)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BUGBEAR, COMPLEX, DEMON, HANG-UP</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BIGBEAR, CENTAUR, HUNTER, LYRE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – AS, BE, I, K</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – A, CAPRI, POP, UNI</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Anime Raid is a tower defense–style <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jump-and-splash-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience where you assemble a powerful team of iconic anime characters and defend various maps to level up.

New players will massively benefit from the free rewards, since the initial grinding can be completely avoided.&nbsp;These codes are usually released through the game’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/MBYGSc5dcq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a>, but bookmark this page for easy access to the latest ones. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/emiru-statement-after-twitch-assault-twitchcon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/emiru-releases-damning-statement-after-twitch-assault-%E2%80%98this-is-definitely-my-last-twitchcon%E2%80%99.1328815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, videos surfaced showing a harrowing assault on Emiru at TwitchCon in San Diego this weekend. While participating in a meet-and-greet with fans, the prolific creator was approached by a man who forcefully embraced her, attempting to kiss her in front of a crowd that included security staff.</p>



<p>It was an event that has been lambasted by attendees and viewers, with Twitch’s management and security of the event coming under fire from numerous angles. In response to the event, Emiru, a cosplay and League of Legends streamer with two million followers, posted a lengthy statement berating Twitch and how the firm handled the assault.</p>



<h2 id="h-that-is-a-blatant-lie-emiru-says">‘That is a Blatant Lie’, Emiru Says</h2>



<p>Emiru was attacked by a man at TwitchCon, and while the Twitch leadership and social teams stressed the incident was handled professionally, Emiru had other things to declare that directly conflict with those claims.</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://x.com/emiru/status/1979602519967060414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full statement from Emiru</a> following the TwitchCon assault:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, the man who assaulted me was allowed to cross multiple barriers at twitchcon and even in front of another creators meet and greet to grab me and my face and try to kiss me. Fortunately he wasn’t able to, but a lot of people have pointed out it could have been a lot worse!</p>



<p>I’m obviously shaken up by what happened and it’s not the first time I’ve dealt with something like this, but to tell you honestly, I am a lot more hurt and upset by how Twitch handled it during and after the fact. </p>



<p>Like I said, I don’t understand how he was allowed to make it to me in the first place. The security in the clip who reacts is my own security (it’s true my favorite and usual security guard was banned for holding a stalkers arm to bring him to police, at a past Twitchcon)</p>



<p>However, there were at least 3 or 4 other TwitchCon security staff in the area who did not react and let the guy walk away, as you can see in the clip since they don’t even appear in the frame LOL </p>



<p>The woman who is walking me away is my own personal manager, and behind the booth, the only two people who were checking on me and comforting me were her and my friend. None of the Twitchcon staff came to ask what happened or if I was okay. </p>



<p>My friend who was present told me Twitch security were also behind the booth afterwards joking about how they didn’t even see what happened and immediately laughing and moving on to talking about something else.</p>



<p>So if no one was checking if I was okay or if I needed anything and they let the guy run away initially, I have no idea what anyone hired to keep the event safe was doing LOL </p>



<p>In Twitch’s statement they said that the guy was immediately caught and detained, I’m sorry but that is a blatant lie. He was allowed to walk away from my meet and greet and I didn’t hear he was caught until hours after he attacked me, and it felt like this only happened because of my manager pressing for it, not because Twitchcon staff present thought it was a big deal. </p>



<p>I have a lot more I want to say but I will say it on stream later today instead of writing a book on here. </p>



<p>Thank you guys again, sorry you all had to see that. This is definitely my last Twitchcon, and it saddens me to say as a 10 year off and on attendee of Twitchcon, I think other creators should seriously consider not attending in the future. I did not feel cared for or protected, even bringing my own security and staff. I can’t imagine how creators without those options would feel.</p>
