<p>In order to cut costs, you have to spend money. Unity revealed on Thursday that it had to spend $205 million as part of its restructuring efforts — which included mass layoffs — throughout 2024.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001810806/16c99346-58d4-4022-924d-7cfefa4f7054.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to the company</a>, the money was spent mostly on “incremental” separation costs for the employees being let go. This included $127 million worth of “incremental stock-based compensation”. </p>

<p>“Of the incremental employee separation costs, $15 million are within cost of revenue, $46 million are within research and development, $52 million are within sales and marketing, and $92 million are within general and administrative,” Unity said.</p>



<p>The company added that in they also had $45 million in restructuring costs related to office closures.</p>



<p>In January 2024, Unity announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-is-laying-off-25-of-its-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans to let go 25%</a> of its workforce. The decision was made to allow the company to “focus on our core business and drive our long-term success and profitability”, according to CEO Jim Whitehurst.</p>



<p>The layoffs and changes came after Unity announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-to-charge-game-devs-per-game-install/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial change</a> to its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-apologizes-again-announces-major-changes-to-runtime-fee-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">runtime fees</a>. A change that was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-is-cancelling-controversial-runtime-fee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimately reversed</a> after backlash.</p>



<p>As part of its earnings call, Unity revealed that it’ had $1.4 billion’s year-over-year revenue for the quarter fell to $446.5 million from $544.2. That’s despite operating expenses falling from $520.3 million to $461.6 million. Overall, the company reported a net loss  of $124.5 million for the third quarter.</p>

<p>During the QA Section of Bandai Namco’s latest earnings call, it was revealed that most of the sales for Dragon Ball Sparking Zero came from Europe and North America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-saw-outstanding-sales-and-bandai-namco-says-roughly-90-percent-of-that-was-from-european-and-north-american-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>, Bandai Namco <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/financialstatements/pdf/20241106_qa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that Dragon Ball Sparking Zero “has been a hit mainly overseas, with sales in Europe and the US accounting for about 90% of the game’s sales” (as translated by Google). The publishers changed their global marketing structure for Japan and North America at the start of this fiscal year. They formed different strategies for approach according to the region they were targeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bandai Namco explained that Sparking Zero’s marketing primarily focused on social media for most regions. However, for specific areas, they also hosted on-ground events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is a direct instalment to the iconic Budokai Tenkaichi series, which was dormant for over a decade. The developers have put real thought into the title’s gameplay, and combining that with its spectacular visuals and varying game modes; it has become a recipe for success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While in early access, the game beat the concurrent numbers of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sparking-zero-tops-all-dragon-ball-games-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all Dragon Ball titles and other fighting games on Steam</a>. It also sold over 3 million copies within the first 24 hours. The overall popularity of the title has also <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/financialstatements/pdf/en_20241106_Presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">significantly impacted</a> their “Toys and Hobby” businesses, helping them beat “previous forecasts.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has stated that he is “not really worried” about GTA 6 running on the Xbox Series S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the latest Take-Two <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/06/take-two-interactive-software-ttwo-q2-2025-earning/?irclickid=wQIV77RNJxyKWsB3AWwmhXdXUkCTkgySWUGN2E0&amp;utm_campaign=mpid&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;irgwc=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a>, Zelnick was asked whether the team was concerned about GTA 6 facing problems on the Xbox Series S, as the title could potentially be one of the most advanced games to date. Zelnick replied that they would continue supporting platforms as long as consumers were on them. “Despite different levels of tech”, the team will “find a way to support platforms”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zelnick said he’s not worried about hardware advancements and doesn’t worry about things he has zero control over. He believes in the audience, and if the audience shows up for their properties, they “have to make sure to be on an array of platforms.” From the looks of it, GTA 6 should be fine on the Xbox Series S. </p>



<p>Zelnick also discussed PCs and how open formats will continue to grow. Take-Two believes the PC platform is “a more and more important part of the console business going forward,” which isn’t a problem to support. Zelnick concluded, “We make the tech work when we can make it work as long as the audience is big enough to make that worthwhile.” GTA 6 does not yet have a release window for PCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Take-Two has confirmed that GTA 6 and Borderlands 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-and-borderlands-4-will-not-release-close-to-each-other/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not release close to each other</a>. Also, Rockstar once thought ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-age-of-trump-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the age of Trump</a>’ would mess with GTA 6.

<p>Displate is known far and wide for printing and providing some of the best gaming collectables in the business. The firm focuses on ‘metal posters’, sheets of durable stainless steel with resilient prints finished in a range of effects, from shimmering colours to 3D textures.</p>



<p>To celebrate Black Friday early, Display is running an exclusive promotion, offering sizeable discounts across the full range of <strong>1.5 million designs</strong>. If you’re a gamer – or you’re buying a Christmas gift for one – you can’t go wrong with a Displate (or several).</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-get-a-displate-discount">Get a Displate Discount</h2>



<p>Displates are well worth the money, but getting them at a discount feels even better.</p>



<p>From today to November 10, you can get 27% off when you buy <strong>two </strong>Displates or 35% off three or more posters. That’s a sizeable saving that’ll accommodate you redesigning your gaming room or setup, or helping to pad out a gamer’s gift pile under the tree this coming holiday season.</p>



<p>Displate offers designs that cover almost every major game franchise on the market. It doesn’t matter if you’re a Fallout fan or a Call of Duty player, or if you’re a Cyberpunk 2077 addict or an Elden Ring nut, there’s something for everyone on Displate. Even the niche titles and genres are accounted for on the site.</p>



<p>It couldn’t be easier to install a Displate, either. They’re attached to surfaces using an innovative magnetic bond that doesn’t damage walls, so they’re perfect for bedrooms, living rooms, offices – wherever you want to put them. </p>



<p>If you’re interested in taking part in the sale, simply <a href="https://displate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">go to Displate.com</a>, assemble your basket, and use the discount code <strong>BLACK</strong> when prompted.</p>



<p>It’s worth hanging around Displate after you’ve purchased, too – the company often runs limited edition prints and designs that can sometimes boast an exclusive attribute. For instance, when Cyberpunk 2077 partnered with Displate, a range of tech-focused OLED posters were produced on a limited basis.</p>
