<p>Marvel Rivals continues to be one of the most popular games around, and ranked mode can throw up plenty of engagement in chat. If you’ve seen a C9 message and don’t know what it means, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<p>The Netease title continues to go from strength to strength, with Marvel Rivals developers regularly interacting with the community to explain controversial topics, like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-explain-matchmaking-system-after-player-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">matchmaking system</a>, and to provide content updates.</p>



<p>With fast-paced action, players will often use abbreviations and slang to communicate in chat, and the C9 term is a common sight. To help you understand, we’ve got a full explanation.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-c9-mean-in-marvel-rivals">What Does C9 Mean in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A confusing message. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>C9 in Marvel Rivals is a short, taunting message used when a team neglects to capture a control point or objective, when it’s readily available to capture with ease, and loses a round or match as a result.</strong></p>



<p>The term refers to Esports team <a href="https://cloud9.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cloud9</a>, with the meme stretching back to an Overwatch tournament in 2017, where the team lost several rounds due to abandoning the objective on multiple occasions in a single match against the Afreeca Freecs Blue.</p>



<p>Given that Marvel Rivals and Overwatch share a lot of similarities, it’s not too surprising to see the term make its way into Marvel Rivals, particularly in Ranked mode.</p>



<p>Messages containing C9 will most likely be shared by opponents at the end of a round or the match, mocking mistakes made by your team. Common situations where this can occur are neglecting to capture an objective when it’s there for the taking, particularly if pushing for kills on enemy players outside the zone.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-respond-to-c9-messages-in-marvel-rivals">How to Respond to C9 Messages in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p><strong>Don’t respond with trash talk to any C9 messages sent in Marvel Rivals, as it could lead to temporary or permanent bans from the game. Instead, ignore them.</strong></p>



<p>The C9 term can help you improve, however, as it’s a sure indicator that your team made a big mistake in the match. If you’ve seen this message in chat, go back and watch the replay to see where the mistake happened and what you could do better to improve.</p>



<p>Using replays in this way is a great way to improve your performance in Marvel Rivals, particularly in ranked matches, and was one of the biggest tips that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-sentinels-aramori-confident-more-women-will-make-marvel-rivals-esports-breakthrough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sentinels pro Aramori gave Insider Gaming in an exclusive interview</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded is making a splash across multiple platforms, including a platform debut on PlayStation, but split-screen co-op availability has caused some confusion.</p>



<p>Released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 26</a>, Gears of War: Reloaded has been brought into the modern generation with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-cross-platform-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features like crossplay</a>, which is one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition-gears-of-war-reloaded-differences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest differences compared to Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a>.</p>



<p>While split-screen co-op was commonplace when Gears of War initially launched, the gaming world has changed a lot in the past few decades, so we’ve got all the details on whether the feature is available in the latest version.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-local-co-op-split-screen-on-ps5">Does Gears of War: Reloaded Have Local Co-Op Split Screen on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Return. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Gears of War: Reloaded offers local co-op via split screen on PlayStation 5 as one of its campaign features.</strong></p>



<p>Split-screen multiplayer in Reloaded on PlayStation 5 supports a maximum of two players, with the main account controlling Marcus Fenix and the secondary controlling Dom Santiago. In fact, there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-gears-of-war-reloaded-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophies to earn</a> from completing the game via co-op, which can also be done online.</p>



<p>Split-screen co-op on PlayStation 5 is launched via the Campaign menu.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-local-co-op-split-screen-on-xbox">Does Gears of War: Reloaded Have Local Co-Op Split Screen on Xbox?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, just like the original title and Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, Gears of War: Reloaded on Xbox Series X|S supports local co-op through split screen.</strong></p>



<p>The feature was a core mechanic in the original title over 20 years ago, and while split-screen co-op is becoming increasingly rarer in modern gaming, it remains available in Reloaded. This isn’t too surprising though, as there was no reason for the feature to be removed.</p>



<p>Just like on PlayStation, one player controls Marcus and the other controls Dom. Split-screen co-op is launched in the Campaign Menu.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-local-co-op-split-screen-on-pc-amp-steam">Does Gears of War: Reloaded Have Local Co-Op Split Screen on PC &amp; Steam?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Gears of War: Reloaded does not offer local co-op and split-screen on PC, which has been a cause of contention.</strong></p>



<p>Initial listings for Reloaded on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523720/Gears_of_War_Reloaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> listed split-screen co-op as an available feature, though that mention has since been removed. As a result, the Steam version of the game has received a surge of negative reviews, with other issues, including crashes, also being reported.</p>



<p>The Xbox store listing for Gears of War: Reloaded states that local co-op is not available on PC, though it’s unclear whether this has been added recently or has always been there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation fans finally rejoiced in 2025 with the arrival of Gears of War: Reloaded. It marked the first time Gears has ever been officially playable on a PlayStation console. A glance at Reloaded’s Platinum Trophy suggests we might not be done yet.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-cross-platform-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> is still one of the most shocking games to me in recent memory. The idea of a core Xbox exclusive that helped Microsoft dominate the console wars in the early 00s to 2010s being on PS5 is unreal. That’s where we are, though. Reloaded is a complete remake of the first Gears title, and PlayStation owners can experience it for themselves.</p>



<p>The Reloaded trophy list features many of the original’s challenges, but the description of the Platinum Trophy is eye-catching.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-gears-of-war-games-potentially-coming-to-playstation-5">More Gears of War Games Potentially Coming to PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’d like more. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-gears-of-war-reloaded-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded’s trophy list</a> has a Platinum Trophy called “Nothin’ Left.” As usual, you earn it for getting every other trophy in the game. This is a tough feat when you consider you need to beat every campaign mission on Insane Difficulty.</p>



<p>The Platinum Trophy description is very interesting: “Your adventure is over, <strong>for now</strong>…”</p>



<p>The final two words are very telling. The Platinum Trophy is exclusive to PlayStation users, and Xbox users don’t have an extra Achievement for getting all the others. It feels like a message tailored specifically to PS fans. There are already rumors that <a href="https://www.gearsofwar.com/games/gears-reloaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> is only the beginning of the ports and remakes.</p>



<p>Initial leaks suggested <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-games-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-include/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded was going to be all three</a> of the OG Gears games. Reports indicate that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3-gears-e-day-on-ps5-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears E-Day is on its way to PS5</a>. I think whatever happens, there’s a good chance we’ve not seen the last of new Gears content on PlayStation.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-physical-edition/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s release is right around the corner after years of waiting, and we’ve got all the details on a physical release of the game.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 4</a>, Hollow Knight: Silksong impressed us during our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, and excitement levels are through the roof with players eagerly waiting for their chance to get their hands on the game.</p>



<p>Modern gaming is now a mostly digital world, with physical releases becoming increasingly rarer, and we’ve got all the details on whether Silksong will have a physical edition.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hollow-knight-silksong-have-a-physical-release">Will Hollow Knight: Silksong Have a Physical Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Waiting game. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong will be releasing a Physical Edition, but it won’t be available at launch on September 4. Instead, it will be released in 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Physical copies will first be available on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles in early 2026, before physical versions of the game on other platforms follow later in the year.</p>



<p>Specifics on why a physical release will come months after a digital release have not been stated, though it’s likely to be due to the small team that <a href="https://hollowknightsilksong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Team Cherry</a> has. This has resulted in other changes too, including making up part of the decision <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-hollow-knight-silksong-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not to send out review copies</a> to media and content creators.</p>



<p>Pre-order details for a Physical Edition are also not available, though we should see more news in the weeks and months after the release takes place, with the focus understandably on preparing for release.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-a-hollow-knight-silksong-collector-s-edition">Will There be a Hollow Knight: Silksong Collector’s Edition?</h2>



<p><strong>It has not been confirmed whether Hollow Knight: Silksong will receive a Collector’s Edition, though it could be on the cards in future.</strong></p>



<p>The original Hollow Knight game received a Collector’s Edition, which featured a physical copy of the game, including all DLC, a 14-page comic book, a box case, a metal brooch, and a gold foil art print set. Inside the physical copy, there was also a manual and a fold-out map of Hallownest.</p>



<p>Players didn’t have to wait too long for the Collector’s Edition either, with Hollow Knight initially launching in February 2019, with the Collector’s Edition following in May. However, with the Physical Editions of Silksong not coming until 2026, the wait for a Collector’s Edition this time around will likely be longer.</p>



<p>Are you holding out for a physical release of Hollow Knight: Silksong, or will you purchase it digitally? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-next-starfield-dlc-still-cant-confirm/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda-mentions-next-starfield-dlc-for-the-third-time-but-still-can%E2%80%99t-confirm-details.1282614/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans have all but given up waiting for the next Starfield expansion, which is <strong>long </strong>overdue for an announcement. In July, I conducted a deep dive into the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-missing-expansion-bethesda-silence-unease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next Starfield DLC</a>, which has been teased by Bethesda Game Studios for more than a year but has no firm indication of what it is or when it will be released.</p>



<p>It’s in danger of shattering Todd Howard’s promise of ‘one major expansion a year for Starfield’, the 2023 space RPG that set the world ablaze for all of about two weeks.</p>



<p>In a recent developer showcase, yet another reference to the Starfield expansion was dropped, <strong>but yet again</strong>, it was mentioned that no details can be shared.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-starfield-s-next-expansion">Where is Starfield’s Next Expansion?</h2>



<p>Shattered Space, the first Starfield expansion that ultimately failed to move mountains, was detailed <strong>before Starfield even came out in September 2023.</strong> We knew what it looked like months before it launched in September 2024.</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, almost an entire year later, and <strong>we haven’t got a clue what the next expansion will be</strong>.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios has had umpteen chances to reveal the next Starfield expansion, but has neglected to do so, which suggests issues with the DLC’s development.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/_zknfAghd-s?t=303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent developer spotlight</a> with Tim Lamb, who has been with Bethesda since 2006, broke down his career. In the closing seconds of the interview, Lamb addressed the future of Starfield:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As it comes to Starfield, I’m really excited for players to see what the team has been working on.</p>



<p>We have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features that players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story.</p>



<p><strong>I can’t go into all the details just yet</strong>, but I will say that part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In June 2024, Todd Howard confirmed another expansion was in development, and in March 2025, the Bethesda team said that ‘exciting things’ are planned for this year that they can’t talk about. We’re now approaching September 2025, and <strong>we still have absolutely nothing to go on</strong> where Starfield is concerned.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-76%E2%80%99s-premium-subscription-is-giving-members-another-massive-advantage.1282599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout 76’s ‘premium subscription’, Fallout 1st, is set to give players another huge advantage over ‘non-paying’ users of the post-apocalyptic MMO platform. In recent years, many key perks of the plan have popped up, with Bethesda Game Studios stumping up plenty of reasons why Fallout fans should part ways with some monthly cash to secure Fallout 1st.</p>



<p>In the latest change to Fallout 1st, a ‘Doctor Bag Aid Box’ has popped up on the PTS (Public Test Server) in Fallout 76. This feature will enable Fallout 1st subscribers to store an unlimited number of chems in their C.A.M.P.</p>



<h2 id="h-unlimited-chem-storage-in-fallout-76-courtesy-of-fallout-1st">Unlimited Chem Storage in Fallout 76, Courtesy of Fallout 1st</h2>



<p>When I was a non-stop fan of Fallout 76, I’d endlessly preach the benefits of Fallout 1st. For a few dollars a month, you can secure a stack of Atoms, boosters, custom server access, exclusive outfits and items, survival tents, and <strong>much more</strong>. It seems silly to have a Fallout 76 account that’s <strong>not </strong>paired with Fallout 1st.</p>



<p>The latest addition might be enough to sway more players over to the realms of Fallout 1st.</p>



<p>In the PTS, players have noticed the arrival of the Doctor Bag Aid Box, an item that has been talked about for a few weeks. In Fallout 76, the Doctor Bag Aid Box is a deployable item in your C.A.M.P. that allows you to store an unlimited number of chems, such as Stimpaks.</p>



<p>Given how Stimpaks, Super Stimpaks, Psycho, Jet, Buffout, and other chems have a fair weight requirement in Fallout 76, this is a boon for players building their character/s around using them. No longer will they take up precious stash allowances, and soon, they’ll have a dedicated space in your C.A.M.P.</p>



<p>This mimics the addition of the ammo storage unit that was thrown into Fallout 76 several months ago, and it, of course, aligns with the scrap box that Fallout 1st subscribers have been using for years.</p>



<p>Would unlimited chem storage in Fallout 76 sway you into purchasing Fallout 1st? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>A new rumor suggests Valve’s next-generation Steam Deck could still be several years away. In a post on gaming forum NeoGAF, known hardware enthusiast and reliable hardware leaker <strong>KeplerL2</strong> claimed that the <strong>Steam Deck 2 is currently planned for 2028</strong>. </p>



<p>The comment, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-launch-october-16.1687405/page-5#post-270737598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">made in a discussion</a> about competing handheld PCs, offered no additional details or evidence to support the date.</p>



<p>A 2028 release date somewhat lines up with past claims of the device being “quite a while” away from happening. Valve has previously indicated that it does not plan to release a new version of the Steam Deck until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-still-says-steam-deck-2-isnt-coming-soon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a significant improvement</a> in performance and efficiency is possible. When introducing the Steam Deck OLED in November 2023, Valve designer Lawrence Yang described the device as <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/11/13/valve-steam-deck-old-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the “definitive first-generation Deck”.</a> At the same time, he was said they were confident that in two or three years, there will be better technology to justify a successor to the first Steam Deck. Whether that</p>



<p>In January 2025, rumors picked up of a Steam Deck 2 utilizing AMD’s Ryzen Z2 processor. However, that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-z2-steam-deck-2-says-valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was quickly shot down</a> by Valve engineer <strong>Pierre-Loup Griffais</strong> who said that <strong>“there is (not) and will be no Z2 Steam Deck.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>For now, Valve continues to support the Steam Deck and its OLED revision, while competition in the handheld PC market intensifies from manufacturers such as ASUS and Lenovo.</p>



<p>The company has not announced any official release window for a Steam Deck 2. Even with the past reliability of the source, until anything is made official, take the claim with a grain of salt, especially when 2028 is still over two years away.</p>



<p>What do you think the Valve Steam Deck 2 will finally release? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>
