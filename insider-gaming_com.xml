<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> brings the iconic FPS franchise back to the forefront, offering players a brand new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-mission-list-every-campaign-mission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Campaign</a>, Multiplayer, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a> mode to enjoy.</p>



<p>Treyarch has focused on bringing Call of Duty back to its roots, which has enticed both veteran and new players. With a traditional <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-system-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prestige system</a>, a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/">arsenal of weapons</a> to unlock, and a variety of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps and modes</a> to enjoy, players have been flocking to Multiplayer. Those who love the round-based format of Zombies have been satisfied too, while story enjoyers are getting their fix through the Campaign.</p>



<p>That said, how many are actually paying Black Ops 6 and what does the player count look like? Here’s everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-players-are-in-black-ops-6">How many players are in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there are <strong>no official stats for the Black Ops 6 player count</strong>, but according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, there are <strong>143,030 current Steam OC players on Call of Duty </strong>as of October 28, 2024. </p>



<p>The 24 hour peak sits at <strong>306,460</strong> players, but keep in mind this is only the player count for Steam on PC, so if you take console into account too, the figure is likely much higher than this. Call of Duty is extremely popular on Xbox and PlayStation, and so those platforms likely make up a large portion of the player count which isn’t available to the public.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty HQ app also includes players on COD games such as MW3, MW2, and Warzone. It even takes those playing the Campaign and Zombies into account, so it’s not an accurate number for those playing the Multiplayer.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is also the first Call of Duty title to release on the Game Pass for both PC and Xbox consoles. Because of this, there a likely a lot of PC players enjoying BO6 via the Game Pass, and the SteamDB numbers don’t track that platform. Thanks to the Game Pass release, successful beta period, and hype prior to release, we expect Black Ops 6’s number to be very healthy, pointing to a successful launch.</p>



<p>There also haven’t been many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/are-black-ops-6-servers-down-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">server issues</a> or major bugs, so players have been able to grind. Once we know official numbers we’l be sure to update this piece with all the information. However, Call of Duty haven’t released official player count stats for some time now, so it’s unclear whether we will get any insight.</p>

<p>SAG-AFTRA has announced that its strike against video game studios will continue. The announcement comes after more negotiations between the parties over AI protections and better general working conditions failed to result in a deal..</p>



<p>“After three days of scheduled negotiations, SAG-AFTRA announced that Interactive Media Agreement negotiations with employers would continue, with new dates to be announced as soon as they are confirmed,” the union <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/video-game-negotiations-continue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in a statement</a>. </p>



<p>“Negotiations resumed with the employer unit which includes Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc., Llama Productions LLC, Take 2 Productions Inc., and WB Games Inc. on Oct. 23.”</p>



<p>The union says that the strike remains in place against “all signatories to the Interactive Media Agreeement”. The only exception is to games “signed to the Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement or an Interim Interactive Media Agreement.”</p>



<p>The latest video game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strike began in July</a> when SAG-AFTRA called for it after 18 months of negotiations between the union and various game studios. The union believes that studios don’t have their actors’ best interests in mind when it comes to potential AI exploitation.</p>



<p>“We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate,” SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said at the beginning of the strike.</p>
