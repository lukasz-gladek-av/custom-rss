<p>We know that Hollow Knight: Silksong is a much bigger game than its predecessor. The original game’s file sizes were quite small, but now that Silksong is out, we’ve learned that Team Cherry has done an immense job minimizing the strain on storage.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong came out of the blocks hotter than the sun. The successor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-beat-hollow-knight-all-time-peak-player-count-in-15-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beat the original Hollow Knight’s all-time peak player count in just 15 minutes</a>. This is a miracle when you consider that many people couldn’t download the game due to Silksong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-xbox-eshop-offline-downloads/">taking Steam, Xbox, and Nintendo’s eShop offline</a> due to demand!</p>



<p>If you haven’t had a chance to download it yet, we have all the file sizes for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-file-sizes-are-very-generous">Hollow Knight: Silksong File Sizes Are Very Generous</h2>

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong requires <strong>7.56 GB on PC</strong>, <strong>4 GB on PlayStation 4</strong>, <strong>2.5 GB on PlayStation 5</strong>, <strong>8.01 GB on Xbox</strong>, <strong>2.6 GB on the Nintendo Switch 1</strong>, and a further <strong>4 GB on Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<p>I think it’s safe to say you probably don’t need to delete any games to make room for Silksong! We’ve been through every available storefront and found these file sizes for ourselves—you know these are accurate and what you should bear in mind.</p>

<p>It shouldn’t be a surprise to see Hollow Knight: Silksong absolutely smash it within minutes of its launch. This is exactly what happened as the game’s anticipated launch saw huge player numbers come in and help Silksong destroy Hollow Knight 2017’s peak player count.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight has retained legendary status for nearly a decade. However, the torch has well and truly been passed to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Within minutes of the sequel going live, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-xbox-eshop-offline-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong single-handedly took down Steam, Xbox, and the Nintendo eShop</a>.</p>



<p>Silksong’s player count and peak numbers were very big, very quickly.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-peak-reaches-100-000-players-in-half-an-hour">Hollow Knight: Silksong Peak Reaches 100,000 Players In Half An Hour</h2>



<figure><figcaption>That didn’t take long. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Hollow Knight (as of writing) achieved a more than respectable all-time peak of 72,916, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. Many indie games would kill for numbers like this, and it’s a big reason why the sequel has been so in demand.</p>



<p>Within minutes of Silksong being available to download, its peak player count eclipsed the OG Hollow Knight. As I’m writing this story now, Silksong’s all-time peak stands at an incredible <strong>100,374</strong> players!</p>



<p>With people still at work, waking up around the world, and the weekend still to come, expect this number to be smashed, and Silksong to reach an even bigger player count. There’s simply no telling what Silksong is going to achieve.</p>



<p>Is Hollow Knight: Silksong a lock for Game of the Year contention? How many copies is it going to sell, and how many people are going to play Silksong? There’s so much to pack, so leave a comment below, and share all your thoughts through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is one of the most anticipated games of the year, and for all the completionists, there’s a host of achievements and trophies to grind for.</p>



<p>Having caught our eye in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, Silksong is a successor to the original <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-hollow-knight-silksong-a-sequel-or-prequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight</a>, and fans have had to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wait patiently for nearly a decade</a> for its release.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for the full Gamerscore available in Hollow Knight: Silksong, or are chasing all the trophies to earn the coveted Platinum trophy on PlayStation, we’ve got the full list for you.</p>

<p>In the minutes leading up to the global release of Hollow Knight: Silksong, more than 240,000 viewers were waiting in the chats of thousands of Twitch channels about to stream the game. Unfortunately, the sheer number of people hitting ‘download’ all at the same time took down Steam, leading many to wait and watch others start playing this highly anticipated game.</p>



<p>I scrolled through Twitch, clicking on various channels to see users disappointed at Steam’s implosion, brought on by their own doing.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-silksong-offline-for-everyone">Is Hollow Knight: Silksong Offline for Everyone?</h2>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong reached epic proportions on streaming platforms even before it had been released by Team Cherry. On Twitch, scores of viewers were sitting and eagerly awaiting the game’s launch, joining their favorite content creators in counting down to that inevitable moment when they could finally start downloading the game.</p>



<p>As I write this, more than 310,000 people are watching Hollow Knight: Silksong, and more than 47,000 people have managed to get into the game on Steam.</p>



<p>We’re also seeing reports that the Nintendo eShop and the Xbox Store are suffering, which we’re working to verify. Most recently, the store page for Hollow Knight: Silksong on Microsoft’s platforms disappeared, and we can’t fathom why.</p>



<p>Up until launch, Hollow Knight: Silksong remained the number one most-wanted game on Steam, acquiring a spot on millions of wishlists worldwide. During the Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom, a new trailer for the game was revealed, the the release date was dropped shortly after.</p>



<p>It was a monumental thing that had fans frothing at the mouth, simply because that release date was set to arrive <strong>today</strong>, mere weeks after the latest trailer dropped.</p>



<p>Earlier today, it was revealed by Team Cherry developers that the Silksong protagonist, Hornet, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-new-protagonist-completely-changed-dlc-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caused drastic design changes</a> based on her character model.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s DLC plans were tossed out thanks to the new protagonist, Hornet. </p>



<p>Team Cherry’s new game, which was finally released today, has been in development for 7 long years. The game started out as a DLC, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grew larger than planned</a>, with the devs adding multiple towns, a deep quest system, and a world much bigger than the original games. Now, the developers have revealed one of the major factors that contributed to the game’s lengthy development. </p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-s-hornet-changed-everything-for-the-developers">Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Hornet Changed Everything for the Developers</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/team-cherry-had-to-go-back-to-the-drawing-board-for-hollow-knight-silksong-for-one-simple-reason-hornet-being-taller-changes-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Team Cherry’s leads, Ari Gibson and William Pellen, explained how Hornet led to changes in Hollow Knight: Silksong’s DLC plans. Pellen explained that “Hornet being taller changes everything,” and the devs couldn’t do justice to the new playable character through just a DLC. </p>



<p>In Hollow Knight: Silksong, Hornet is able to travel much faster, jump higher, mantle or clamber onto ledges, and is generally more acrobatic than the previous protagonist. Hence, “the caves around her have to expand to accommodate her height.” Moreover, Hornet’s fighting is faster, and her competence led to a change in enemy design as well. “The core of the world is mainly a reflection” of this character and her nature “is echoed in the way the world is set up.”</p>



<p>If Hornet were straight placed in Hollow Knight’s world, she would be easily able to maneuver through the “would-be hazards,” and the extended attack range changes things as well. Silksong, on the other hand, brings “greater focus on aggression, decisive action, and proactive decision making.”</p>



<p>Gibson also elaborated that Hornet is half-bug, which not only makes the character more physical, but the world as well. Which means players will see “less glowy orb things, and magic bursts of light, and many more blades and traps.”</p>
