<p>An Associate Marketing Director at Ubisoft has claimed that Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown sold 1.3 million units in its first year.</p>



<p>First spotted by X user <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Timur222</a>, the Associate Marketing Director’s LinkedIn profile says that the game sold 1.3 million units in its first year, a number not too surprising as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming reported in October 2024</a> that the game had sold approximately 1 million units in its first 9 months. The game<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-ubisoft-from-low-morale-to-internal-tensions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sold 300,000 copies</a> in its first month.</p>



<p>As reported then, the game failed to meet Ubisoft’s internal expectations, and a Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown sequel was not greenlit. Its team would move over to other Ubisoft projects, including Beyond Good and Evil 2, Project Over (a next mainline Ghost Recon game), and Project Steambot, a Rayman Remake in development at Ubisoft Milan.</p>



<p>The game received generally favourable reviews on launch across all versions of the game on review aggregator Metacritic and while the game failed to miss internal expectations is unknown, it’s likely attributed to Ubisoft’s recent public perception, which has dwindled in recent years due to poor decisions and a lack of understanding the current gaming landscape. </p>



<p>As for other Prince of Persia projects, the Sands of Time Remake continues development after being rebooted and is slated for 2026. Ubisoft has opted to completely know everything we know about the remake, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recasting the original actor Yuri Lowenthal</a>.</p>
