<p>Head back to the spooky Nitemare Island and check out the Friday the 13th-themed skins that have returned to Fortnite for the weekend.</p>



<p>Fortnite announced on social media that Nitemare Island would return to Reload, the Battle Royale-themed mode that launched in 2024. Along with that, Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers are back in the game, in skins for the time being.</p>



<p>Nitemare Island originally debuted in October 2025 and was the fifth Reload map. Epic says that you have until 9:00 a.m. ET on Monday, February 16, to jump back into the Halloween-themed map. What a great weekend for Valentine’s Day.</p>

<h2 id="h-news-on-future-fortnite-collabs">News on Future Fortnite Collabs</h2>



<p>Just like Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, Fortnite has collaborated with numerous IPs to create a truly unique, if not outright bizarre, gaming experience. Right next to Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, you can also purchase SpongeBob SquarePants. Looking for a Jam track? There are plenty of choices from Chapell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter, but you can also choose Feel Good Inc. by The Gorillaz.</p>







<p>Recently, it was announced that Overwatch, which is undergoing a resurgence, would be part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-overwatch-crossover-brings-genji-tracer-d-va/" id="175954">a future Fortnite collaboration</a>. Kingdom Hearts is also planned for release on the popular free-to-play game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Updates have been announced for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6 </a>in version 1.2.1.0</p>



<p>The Battlefield Communications team announced the next major update to the game. This next update adds new weapons, the “Contaminated” map, new limited-time modes, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-modes-coming-to-battlefield-6">New Modes Coming to Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>The update, scheduled to go live on February 17, adds new modes. These limited-time modes are built around a new psychoactive weapon, VL-7</p>



<p>VL-7 Strike is a limited-time mode where psychoactive smoke spreads across select areas in multiplayer and REDSEC. Players must wear masks and carefully manage their filters, as running out will leave them vulnerable to the disorienting effects of VL-7.</p>











<h2 id="h-map-and-mode-fixes-weapon-balancing-coming-in-new-update">Map and Mode Fixes, Weapon Balancing Coming in New Update</h2>



<p>The update fixes numerous map exploits, traversal issues, capture logic problems, and world reset bugs across Conquest, Breakthrough, Strikepoint, Gauntlet, and other modes.</p>



<p>Additionally, the update delivers a broad recoil tuning pass across automatic weapons, alongside targeted balance fixes to improve consistency, clarity, and long-term weapon handling.</p>







<p>Other issues related to Portal stability, audio, and more were addressed. Players can check out the full statement <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/2022340361868198355?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
