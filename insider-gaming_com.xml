<p>Ahead of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-bit-reactor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s official unveiling at the upcoming Star Wars Celebration in April</a>, images from the the turn-based tactics game from Respawn Entertainment and Bit Reactor have appeared online. The XCOM influences are abundant, which is unsurprising given <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/bitreactor-has-a-star-wars-tactical-strategy-game-in-the-works-15-xcom-veterans-on-its-team-and-an-ambitious-vision-for-the-future-of-the-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the number of XCOM veterans</a> at Bit Reactor.</p>







<p>The images were first <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-leaked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered by gaming news outlet MP1st,</a> who found the images within a Bit Reactor artist’s portfolio. The gameplay shown is reportedly dated to mid-2023, when the game went by the internal code name Bruno.</p>

<p>The screenshots show gameplay very reminiscent of the tactical, turn-based squad combat genre that XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM 2 revitalized in the 2010s. In this kind of game, the player controls a squad of characters in turn-based combat, where each character has a limited number of actions and moves they can make. Even the iconic Mario franchise dipped its toes into the turn-based tactics genre with Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle and Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope.</p>



<p>The images of gameplay show the player controlling a Mandalorian character and targeting a Republic clone trooper, with a “95% hit chance” window above the enemy trooper. The window at the bottom of the screen shows a number of other combat actions the player could take, including the use of a thermal detonator (the Star Wars equivalent of a powerful grenade). Another images shows players using an ability taken straight from XCOM: overwatch. When a player activates overwatch on their turn, they wait for an enemy to move into their line of sight and fire automatically. An animated image also shows a makeshift headquarters, where the player can interact with an Armory, Holotable, Special Ops, or Black Market.</p>



<p>Respawn has been collaborating with Bit Reactor on the Star Wars tactical game project. The developers of the critically acclaimed Jedi series were previously working on a Star Wars shooter about a Mandalorian bounty hunter, before that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-mandalorian-game-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">project was canceled in February 2024</a>. </p>

<p>InZOI officially released in Early Access on Friday and one of the first viral experiences making the rounds was the fact that the game allowed players to run over children. According to the game’s developers, however, this isn’t supposed to be the case.</p>



<p>In a message sent to Insider Gaming, a Krafton representative said that it was caused by a “unintended bug” that has since been resolved.</p>

<p>“This issue was caused by an unintended bug that has been resolved in the latest patch,” the representative said. “These depictions are highly inappropriate and do not reflect the intent and values of inZOI. We understand the seriousness of this matter and age-appropriate content and we are strengthening our internal review processes to prevent similar incidents in the future.”</p>
