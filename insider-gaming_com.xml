<p>Discord is rolling out a new commerce experience for users and has partnered with Marvel Rivals as the first title with integrated shopping and gifting.</p>



<p>Launching just in time for the Marvel Rivals anniversary celebrations and the holiday season, players in the Marvel Rivals Discord will be able to browse and purchase digital goods within the Marvel Rivals Discord.</p>











<figure><figcaption>New feature. Image via Discord</figcaption></figure>



<p>Players in the Marvel Rivals Discord can now create a wishlist of the items they want to add to their collection and gift in-game items to their friends, with purchased and gifted items instantly accessible within Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p><a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-introduces-a-new-commerce-experience-for-gaming-communities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord says</a> the integration is a huge boost for players and developers alike, as gifting isn’t limited to players of the game, so items can be gifted to friends to encourage them to jump into the game, extending in-game currency, and building upon the existing gifting behavior on Discord.</p>



<p>It’s added that 20% of all Shop purchases on Discord are gifts, a number that increases to almost 30% during the holiday season, so the integration is described as “a natural evolution of how people use Discord to connect and celebrate together.”</p>



<p>Initially, the integration will support purchases in USD only on the Discord desktop client, though players from the US, Canada, Ireland, and Oceania will be able to use it. Additional regions and platform support will be explored in the future, Discord says.</p>



<p>Additional game support is expected to be added in the future as part of the feature’s evolution.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Survive Wave Z monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Scrap and much more.</p>



<p>Are you a fan of the classic multiplayer Call Of Duty game mode Zombies? If so, Survive Wave Z is going to be right up your alley, and you need to check out this <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-ants-empire-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> wave defence experience immediately. As the name of the game suggests, players are tasked with defending and surviving against endless waves of enemies, with the end goal being to survive Wave Z, which is considered the last one. There is a wide variety of weapons and other items that the players can use in their mission to survive, but not all of them will be available for use at the start of the game.</p>







<p>As is the case with most games of this genre, unlocking powerful weapons required a massive amount of grinding, and for players who are new to the game, acquiring some of these can seem like a pipe dream. That’s where these codes can come to the players’ aid. They provide free rewards to the players, including key resources like Scrap, making it a key part of the game. Redeeming these codes will help players get ahead of the competition and progress through the levels faster than they otherwise would be able to.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-expired-survive-wave-z-codes">Expired Survive Wave Z Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Survive Wave Z, as the game only came out quite recently. The one active code given above is the only one that has been released by the developers so far. However, with the game’s increasing popularity, new codes are likely on the horizon. As soon as any of the active codes expire, they will be moved to this section of the page.</p>

<p>Redeeming codes in Survive Wave Z is as simple as navigating through the menus and inputting one of the active codes into the correct text box. There are no prerequisite steps, making it a very beginner-friendly process. For players who are new to the Roblox, however, here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Survive Wave Z.</li>



<li>Click on the settings button at the top of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down till you see the codes text box.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click on the Submit button to claim your rewards.</li>
</ol>

<p>New Roblox game codes are often released by the developers through the game’s official Discord server, through the Roblox game page, or on their social media pages. However, tracking all of these regularly can be a hassle, and that’s where this article can be a lifesaver. We update this page with new codes as soon as they drop, so we recommend that all players bookmark this page to not miss out on any free rewards.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion has soared onto the scene, with the beat ’em up title boasting an impressive roster of characters, including several that are locked behind progression.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review-a-cosmic-blast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming review of Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, a ‘Great’ verdict of the game was issued, with the title attracting praise for providing chaotic gameplay in a good way, with a perfect balance of depth to keep players engaged, but not overwhelmed, in the vintage beat ’em up.</p>



<p>If you’re diving into Marvel Cosmic Invasion but want to know how to unlock a specific character, or are wondering who there is to choose from on the roster, this guide has all the crucial details.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-marvel-cosmic-invasion-characters-amp-how-to-unlock">All Marvel Cosmic Invasion Characters &amp; How to Unlock</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Locked. Image via Tribute Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 15 playable characters in Marvel Cosmic Invasion, four of which are locked behind specific requirements in progression.</strong></p>



<p>The base roster in Marvel Cosmic Invasion is kind, with 11 characters unlocked by default, including fan-favorites like Captain America, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Rocket Raccoon.</p>



<p>However, Jean Grey/Phoenix, Venom, Phyla-Vell, and Silver Surfer must be unlocked by completing specified missions, which require exploring several areas of the game as split paths present themselves regularly. Due to this, you won’t be able to unlock all the characters immediately, and will have to backtrack at some points.</p>



<p>The challenge of unlocking the restricted characters is not difficult, however, as you only need to complete the specified levels, and don’t need to achieve any particular objectives, though this means potentially venturing out of your way to the four individual levels containing the locked characters.</p>



<p>The full list of playable characters in Marvel Cosmic Invasion and how to unlock them is shown in the table below.</p>
