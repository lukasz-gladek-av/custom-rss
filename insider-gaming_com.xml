<p>The former developers of Little Nightmares are now working on a game that merges twin stick Shooters with Metroidvanias. End of Abyss is being developed by Section 9 Interactive Studios and published by Epic Games. While it is yet another in a long line of Metroidvania-style games, it also promises to shake up the formula with twin-stick shooter controls.</p>



<p>Section 9 is a Swedish game development studio whose founders, Marcus and Matthews Ottvall, have a history of working on hit games, including Little Nightmares and Little Big Planet on the PlayStation Vita. Now, they’re excited to begin revealing their unique take on what a Metroidvania can be.</p>







<h2 id="h-section-9-co-founders-discuss-inspiration-for-end-of-abyss">Section 9 Co-Founders Discuss Inspiration For End of Abyss</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/former-little-nightmares-devs-end-of-abyss-is-a-satisfyingly-creepy-blend-of-top-down-twin-stick-shooter-and-metroidvania-exploration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with Games Radar+</a>, Marcus discussed that the initial plans for End of Abyss called for a cartoony action game. However, they later explored a top-down Metroidvania, leading to a darker atmosphere.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The game started out as a bit of a cartoony action game, a kind of top-down twin stick shooter with some adventure elements. Player movement was quicker back then and with fast dodges to avoid enemy attacks. During development, we talked about how there really weren’t that many top-down Metroidvania games, and we wanted to explore that idea. We started leaning towards a more serious tone. We discussed sci-fi anime and classic horror movie inspirations, and began forming a darker atmosphere, and horror elements were introduced, shifting the game toward slower-paced gameplay.”</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>Marcus did not want to disclose too much about the game’s story and characters, but his brother, Mattias Otvall, spoke about the game’s scanner tool and how it was designed to stand out in a crowded genre.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It’s a tool that we created for making the exploration more manageable and enjoyable. Scanning your environment and creatures also provides a bit of extra information about the world around you and may even help you find some secrets. Metroidvania games can get disorienting at times, so the scanner helps you to mark points of interest on your map so you can have an easier time finding where to go later on.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As of yet, there’s no release date for the forthcoming game. Still, it is expected to be released in 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series consoles, and PC via the Epic Games Store.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is a third-person extraction adventure game and has been since Embark Studios concocted the concept several years ago. That hasn’t stopped fans worldwide from wondering how the game would fare as a <strong>first-person </strong>shooter. Now, they’re one step closer to seeing what that would look like.</p>



<p>In a new clip uploaded on social media and circulated online, one user manipulated ARC Raiders via dev console commands, a function that has now been <strong>patched out </strong>by Embark Studios. By forcing a first-person perspective, this user allowed us to see what the post-apocalyptic shooter would look like if it <strong>weren’t </strong>a third-person game.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-in-first-person-is-kind-of-trippy">ARC Raiders in First Person is Kind of Trippy</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders is a phenomenal, award-winning extraction adventure title <strong>exclusively </strong>available as a third-person game. That’s absolutely fine, as it works and beats the norm where the <strong>first-person perspective </strong>is king in the extraction space.</p>



<p>However, a new three-minute clip uploaded to social media and shared online showcases a forced first-person perspective in ARC Raiders. It admittedly is a little janky because it’s an exploit and a manipulation effort more than anything else, but it shows the potential of what might have been:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>FIRST PERSON in ARC Raiders 😮</p><p>A Reddit user managed to force FPP camera using dev console commands. Even without dedicated animations, seeing the world from this perspective looks incredibly immersive. <a href="https://t.co/mJB6sHA57I">pic.twitter.com/mJB6sHA57I</a></p></div>— ARC Raiders Alerts (@ArcRaiderAlerts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcRaiderAlerts/status/2010011248922853451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Earlier today, Embark Studios published a hotfix to address this very issue. It was found that PC players were exploiting hidden dev console commands to boost their FOV and disable some of the game’s environmental mechanics, like fog. This resulted in them having hugely advantageous edges over the competition, especially those playing on PlayStation and Xbox.</p>



<p>This exploit is what led to the forced first-person perspective you see in the clip above.</p>



<p>The reception was mixed on social media, with many claiming that it should <strong>never </strong>have some kind of PUBG-influenced switchable mode between first- and third-person, while others suggested it looks much more immersive in first-person.</p>







<p>What do you think? Does ARC Raiders work as a first-person shooter, or should it stay forever locked to third-person? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo has denied claims that generative AI was used in promotional images for their new “My Mario” toy line.</p>



<p>Nintendo announced on Thursday, January 8, 2025, that its My Mario products would launch in the United States on February 19. On social media, they advertised the lineup with pictures of parents playing with their children and several products from the new line. Some who saw the images raised concerns that the company was using generative AI in its marketing, citing the way adults’ hands appear in some of the photos.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-and-campaign-actress-deny-gen-ai-usage">Nintendo And Campaign Actress Deny Gen AI Usage</h2>



<p>One of the models, Brittoni O’myah Sinclair, even commented on Nintendo’s Instagram post to deny using generative AI in the campaign. Now, Nintendo has commented on the matter, telling Insider Gaming that no generative AI was used in the campaign.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The topic of generative AI continues to become more prominent in gaming as Gen AI tools become more commonplace and accessible. Recently, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stripped of its wins </a>at The Indie Game Awards due to the use of generative AI. Also, Larian Studios, the developers of Divinity, recently said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-devs-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-for-concept-art/">they would not use Gen AI</a> tools for concept art or dialogue.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve never played Fallout 76, Bethesda Game Studios’ post-apocalyptic MMORPG, you’d be excused for having no idea what ‘Fallout 1st’ is. It’s the game’s premium and entirely optional subscription service that unlocks a wealth of bonuses, boosts, and advantages for subscribers, and historically, some have dubbed it a ‘pay-to-win’ service.</p>



<p>In recent social circles, news surfaced regarding the Fallout 1st subscription service, and it wasn’t good. It was claimed by some Japanese users that Bethesda Game Studios suddenly stripped them of their paid subscriptions without warning because the service <strong>wasn’t supposed to be available to Xbox users in Japan in the first place</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-76-subscriptions-stripped-from-japanese-gamers">Fallout 76 Subscriptions Stripped from Japanese Gamers</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 is a premium service that the most dedicated users pay a monthly (or yearly) fee to uphold. It unlocks various benefits, such as free monthly ‘Atoms’, exclusive cosmetics, fancy base-building items, handy storage containers, and the ability to <strong>host private servers</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’re anyone who is sinking time into Fallout 76, you should at least <strong>consider </strong>Fallout 1st, as the quality-of-life improvements it offers for the nearly decade-old MMORPG are insane.</p>



<p>However, certain users <strong>can’t </strong>take advantage of those bonuses as of a few days ago.</p>



<p>On social media, Japanese users started complaining that Bethesda Game Studios had stripped them of their Fallout 1st subscriptions without so much as a warning. In one post on Medium, a user explained that contacting Bethesda or Xbox’s support channels resulted in a stock message being offered:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Fallout 1st is not officially offered for Xbox in Japan. There was a period when it was mistakenly available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the story goes, Fallout 1st <strong><span>rarely</span> worked properly </strong>in Japan, for whatever reason. Suddenly, in April 2024, it popped up on the Japanese Xbox Store and <strong>stayed</strong>. Users could run their subscriptions without any issues, and it was a bountiful time to be a Fallout 76 fan within the territory of Japan.</p>



<p>Then, ‘around New Year’s Eve’, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1q83g4h/japanese_xbox_user_fallout_1st_subscription_was/?utm_source=syndication&amp;pubDate=20260109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">players started explaining</a> that their subscriptions had been stripped from their accounts without any warning. If you <strong>have </strong>Fallout 1st, play for hundreds of hours, and then <strong>lose </strong>Fallout 1st, it can have a pretty dire knock on your experience, especially when it comes to storage of junk, ammunition, healing items, and so on.</p>



<p>On Reddit, one user explained the situation quite nicely:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>playing this game without fallout 1st is such a nightmare, and japanese are one of the biggest population contributor in xbox oce/sea region server, if the region lose them it will be kinda dead</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was reported that PlayStation 5 and Steam-based users <strong>have no issue </strong>running their Fallout 1st subscriptions in Japan.</p>



<p>As detailed <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/fallout-76-20260106-399011/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Automaton</a>, a Japanese outlet, no official explanation has been offered by Bethesda Game Studios or Microsoft to explain why the service was a) suddenly made available, and b) removed from the grasp of Japanese users without warning.</p>
