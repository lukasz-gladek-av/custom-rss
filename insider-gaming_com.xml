<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why.

<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities.

<p>Diablo 4’s Lord of Hatred DLC overhauls skill trees, adds talismans, the Horadric Cube, and introduces long-awaited loot filters.</p>



<p>During the 30th-anniversary Diablo presentation on February 11, it was announced that the Warlock class was coming to 3 Diablo games, including Diablo 4.</p>



<p>Additionally, it was announced that major updates would overhaul parts of Diablo 4, with the Lord of Hatred update coming in April. One of those updates is a major change to how skill trees work.</p>



<p>The team even joked about hearing players call skill trees “skill twigs,” but that is coming to an end.</p>



<p>“We’re adding new customization options to every single skill across the entire tree,” they revealed. “It isn’t just a small tweak, it’s a major disruption to the current class system.”</p>

<h2 id="h-skill-tree-updates-are-coming-to-every-class-in-diablo-4">Skill Tree Updates Are Coming to Every Class in Diablo 4</h2>



<p>It was stated that every class will receive skill tree updates with more than 40 choices and over 80 additional options. Those who purchased the Lord of Hatred DLC will have 20 additional transformative skill options.</p>



<p>Plus, they’re introducing talismans, which will add even more adjustments to your characters. The DLC is also introducing the Horadric Cube, another way to continue shaping your endgame journey. They also excitedly announced that loot filters are finally being added to give players more control over their items.</p>

<p>In addition to coming to Diablo 2, the Warlock class is also coming to Diablo 4 and Diablo Immortal. The Immortal update will be available this summer, and the Diablo 4 update will be available in April 2026.</p>



<p>As another teaser, the Blizzard staff featured in the presentation teased a major announcement coming for BlizzCon this September.</p>







<p>Along with the update, the game is now available on Xbox Game Pass and PC on Steam. The announcement of the new class on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2536520/view/490465019074445508?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam </a>came with a note from the development team that they are aware of issues impacting players:</p>



<p>“We are aware of an issue impacting Diablo II: Resurrected Infernal Edition bonus incentives for Diablo IV and World of Warcraft, where some players who purchase on Steam may not see these items unlock immediately. Our team is actively working on a fix, and eligible rewards will automatically unlock once resolved,” the statement reads.</p>
