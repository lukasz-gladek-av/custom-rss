<p>Ubisoft has announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows has passed 3 million players in its first 7 days since launch.</p>



<p>The news was shared on the official Assassin’s Creed X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1905268079958904991" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account</a>, where it was officially confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the 2nd highest day 1 sales</a> (in revenue) in Assassin’s Creed’s franchise history.</p>



<p>It was also announced that the game is the biggest day 1 release on the PlayStation Store, with over 40 million hours of the game already being played.</p>



<p>In addition to the games commercial success, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is one of Ubisoft’s highest-rated Metacritic games in recent history, which currently sits at 82/100.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Grant-Taylor Hill gave Shadow’s a “Buy” verdict, praising the game’s visuals and cinematics but said that the game had “too many niggling flaws for me to consider this a perfect title.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-virtual-game-cards-for-digital-games-on-switch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Nintendo has officially unveiled Virtual Game Cards today: a new, easier way to share digital games between two Switch consoles. With this new feature, Nintendo aims to make games purchased digitally “as flexible and convenient” as physical game cards.</p>







<p>Virtual Game Cards were announced today <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a Nintendo Direct</a>. In the future, all games purchased on the Nintendo Switch digitally will be loaded onto the system as a Virtual Game Card. These cards can be “loaded” and “ejected” onto a second Nintendo Switch system (under the same account) using an internet connection. The two Switches only need to be linked locally once, and an internet connection is only needed during the load and eject phases. The new feature will also support Virtual Game Card swaps between a Nintendo Switch and a Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The new Virtual Game Cards also provide enhanced features to family group managers. Virtual Game Cards can be lent out to a Nintendo account’s <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/products/detail/p/989?_gl=1*1dv082h*_gcl_au*MTc5MTU0MzU5LjE3NDMwODcwMzE.*_ga*NzE2NTIxOTAxLjE3NDMwODcwMzU.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*MTc0MzA4NzAzNC4xLjAuMTc0MzA4NzA2MS4wLjAuMA.." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">family group</a> members, but only for up to two weeks, after which they will return to the original account’s Switch. The Nintendo account can only share one game at a time with one specific family group member, and the Switches also need to be locally linked once before swapping.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This new feature will be added via a system update in late April. For parents with multi-Switch households, this is welcome news, as they no longer have to manage multiple libraries and purchase games across multiple Switches. All they have to manage is their own library, and they can lend their Virtual Game Cards to members of their family group. </p>



<p>Will you be lending out Virtual Game Cards to Nintendo Switch users when this feature launches in late April?

<p>Pokémon games are no stranger to innovating gameplay mechanics. The March 2025 Nintendo Direct revealed this to be the case as a new Pokémon Legends Z-A gameplay video showed off new features, including day and night gameplay, and Z-A Royale.</p>



<p>Don’t panic, even though I’ve mentioned the word “Royale,” there’s no emphasis on battle royale here. Z-A Royale ties into the new day and night cycle introduced in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-platforms-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>. Previous games have tinkered with the idea of dynamic daily cycles, but few have changed the gameplay in such a way.</p>



<p>The newest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Direct</a> showed us what we’re in for, and Legends Z-A looks mouth-watering.</p>



<h2 id="h-day-and-night-gameplay-changes-pokemon-legends-z-a">Day and Night Gameplay Changes Pokémon Legends Z-A</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Better earn those wins. Credit to The Pokémon Company </figcaption></figure>



<p>The March 27 gameplay trailer showed us a lot of what we’ve seen from <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-legends-z-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> already: The real-time action of Pokémon-catching and Trainer-battling antics. We also know that Pokémon are hiding all over Lumiose City—even on the rooftops.</p>



<p>But now we’ve seen what’s lurking in the city at night. Once the sun goes down, Z-A Royale begins. Trainers come out at night to fight in new Battle Zones.</p>



<p>Trainers are classified with ranks, signifying their status in the new Z-A Royale league system. You need to work your way from Z to A, and you can do so with the newly confirmed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-will-bring-27-new-mega-evolutions-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Evolutions</a> we reported a few days ago.</p>



<p>We know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-reportedly-not-adding-any-new-pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A reportedly isn’t adding new Pokémon</a>, which is a shame. But the new features make up for this, and it’s still set to launch in 2025.</p>
