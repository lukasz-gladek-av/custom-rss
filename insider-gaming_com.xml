<p>Black Ops 7 is fighting to stay relevant as the worldwide reveal approaches. On August 19, during the Opening Night Live showcase, Activision’s studios will unveil Black Ops 7 beyond what they’ve already shown, hopefully contending for their slice of the FPS pie and wrangling attention away from Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>In a series of new leaks that have emerged on social media, prominent Call of Duty insider TheGhostofHope has revealed a slew of information about the upcoming shooter.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-maps-are-coming-back-in-black-ops-7">What Maps Are Coming Back in Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p>According to TheGhostofHope, Black Ops 7 will launch with three remastered maps pulled from 2012’s Black Ops II:</p>



<ul>
<li>Raid</li>



<li>Express</li>



<li>Hijacked</li>
</ul>



<p>The post containing the remastered maps tidbit came after a claim that Specialist abilities will return for Black Ops 7. This mechanic hasn’t been seen since Black Ops 4, and it simply allows players to pick from characters or classes that have a unique ability. As GhostofHope puts it, this could be ‘active camo, grapple hook, and more.’</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Thanks to the Black Ops 7 title reveal at the Xbox Game Showcase in June, we already knew that active camo is a thing in this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>GhostofHope went on to explain that Black Ops 7’s larger-than-life multiplayer mode, which will be akin to the recent outings of ‘Ground War’ is apparently ‘<strong>trash</strong>‘. They also mentioned that a wingsuit appears in this mode, given that it will unfold over much larger maps than those seen in traditional multiplayer playlists.</p>



<p>What do you think of these latest Black Ops 7 leaks? Are you excited about remastered maps and perhaps want more? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re thinking.</p>

<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta returns tomorrow for another fun-filled weekend of destructive action, and fans are <strong>excited</strong>. The hiatus between the first and second weekend of the open beta was to allow Electronic Arts to make a few tweaks, and in a new blog post, the team revealed some of those adjustments.</p>



<p>Most importantly, players will be able to lean on a ‘Custom Search’ feature with the Battlefield 6 Open Beta Weekend 2 playlist. It’s not exactly a server browser, but it’s one step closer.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-battlefield-6-beta-get-a-server-browser">Will The Battlefield 6 Beta Get a Server Browser?</h2>



<p>We won’t see a server browser appear during the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, but we are getting Custom Search.</p>



<p>This new feature was unveiled by Electronic Arts in a new blog post, and it promises to change how you search for matches. With Custom Search, you can select specific maps and modes that you want to play, such as Conquest on Siege of Ciaro, and the matchmaking algorithm will throw you into that very match (if it’s available).</p>



<p>You’ll be able to use Custom Search across Open Weapon mode playlists during the Battlefield 6 Open Beta Week 2 window, giving you the ultimate freedom to explore.</p>



<p>The inclusion of a server browser mechanic in Battlefield 6 is one of the most requested deliverables from the community, and it hasn’t gone unnoticed by Electronic Arts’ teams. Recently, DICE was asking users on social media <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-server-browser-dice-asks-what-important/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>why </strong>a server browser is so important</a> to them.</p>
