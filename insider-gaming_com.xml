<p>New Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma discusses what she likes in video games. She also admits she’s got a lot to learn in her new role.</p>



<p>Asha Sharma became the head of Xbox on February 20, 2026, following a shake-up that saw Phil Spencer retire and Sarah Bond leave the company. She’s tried to be an engaging CEO in her first 24 hours, outlining her<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-has-no-tolerance-for-bad-ai/" id="178392"> vision for AI in Xbox’s future</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-xbox-ceo-responds-to-fans-desire-for-console-exclusives/" id="178442">responding to gamers on social media</a>. Still, her background at Microsoft saw her leading the CoreAI division.</p>



<p>Before Microsoft, she held top positions for Instacart and Meta. While those are successful companies, they don’t exactly scream “gaming.” As such, Sharma knows she has a lot to learn in her new position.</p>







<h2 id="h-asha-sharma-on-what-she-likes-to-see-in-video-games">Asha Sharma on What She Likes to See in Video Games</h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-xbox-games-ai-1236668829/">Variety</a>, Sharma was quoted as saying that she likes games with deep emotional resonance. She also touted the game Firewatch as a game that resonated with her emotionally.</p>



<p>Sharma plans to win over core Xbox gamers and earn the right to be trusted. She hopes to develop consistency over time that will lead to a stronger relationship with the player base. “I’m coming into gaming as a platform builder,” Sharma noted.</p>



<p>In response to a social media comment, she even listed her three favorite games: Halo, Valheim, and GoldenEye.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Moving forward, she will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/matt-booty-full-memo-following-promotion-to-cco-of-microsoft-gaming/" id="178377">work closely with Matt Booty</a> to enact her initiatives. Sarah Bond will assist her and provide guidance during the transition before her exit from Microsoft.

            <guid>1442884</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26 will once again include MyFACTION, a single-player mode that competes with NBA 2K’s MyTeam and EA Sports FC’s Ultimate Team. It offers a collection-oriented experience centered on in-game trading cards. </p>



<p>Players start with a specific pack of wrestlers and then use in-game points or virtual currency to purchase new packs that improve their team.</p>



<p>As with most sports and live-service games in 2026, microtransactions are part of the experience. In the case of WWE games, microtransactions will allow you to get a specific card of a specific player needed for a specific event. Now, the team behind the mode is discussing their philosophy on microtransactions in MyFACTION.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-designer-says-they-try-to-provide-extra-benefits-for-players-who-pay-for-myfaction-content">WWE 2K26 Designer Says They Try To Provide Extra Benefits for Players Who Pay for MyFACTION Content</h2>



<p>Interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/wwe-2k26-myfaction-interview-talking-microtransactions-and-mixed-gender-matches-with-the-popular-modes-leads/">VGC</a>, Terrell Carter, MyFACTION’s lead designer, explains that he and the team try to give players an extra benefit for spending real-world money.</p>



<p>Internally, the hope is that they don’t make players feel they have to make purchases like that to use any of the game’s features. Still, if the purchase is made, they want them to feel there is as much upside as possible.</p>



<p>“So we try to give more content based on those things, rather than be ultra restrictive. Hopefully, it doesn’t feel ultra-restrictive to the players,” he said.</p>







<h2>Team Chemistry is A Major Feature in This Year’s MyFACTION Mode</h2>



<p>2K recently announced that a new mechanic called team chemistry would be a major focal point of this year’s MyFACTION. With 60 in-game traits that can have positive and negative effects on your team, there are plenty of scenarios that will play out depending on your specific team’s chemistry.</p>



<p>For example, Carter says that if your team has bad chemistry, it could fall apart when Partners refuse to tag each other. Luckily, there’s a way to circumvent that: a new teleport option this year that draws on fighting games like Marvel vs. Capcom and places them in the WWE environment. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-myfaction-adds-team-chemistry-and-quickswap/" id="178385">here</a>.</p>

            <guid>1442881</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Toronto KOI has just secured a win after an eight-match losing streak in the Call of Duty League. The team managed to produce a huge 3-0 sweep over Minnesota G2, putting out something of a masterclass while flexing the new talent in the recently promoted Kips. The young competitor came up from Challengers, departing the Huntsmen and moving into the League.</p>



<p>It was a much-needed victory for Toronto KOI, especially in the run-up to Major II, which will take place in the United Kingdom for the first time in six years.</p>







<h2 id="h-toronto-koi-manages-to-secure-a-win">Toronto KOI Manages to Secure a Win</h2>



<p>Toronto KOI, which rebranded ahead of this season after dropping the Ultra moniker, has pulled off a sweep against Minnesota G2. The Call of Duty League has not been kind to Toronto KOI this season, and the team currently sits in 10th place in the overall season standings.</p>



<p>That being said, today’s fixture against G2 could be an indicator of things to come, now that Kips has taken up a spot on the roster after moving up from the Huntsmen. To make space for him, Reeal was pushed out.</p>



<p>Kips admitted in a post-match interview that his first series with Toronto, which was a 0-3 loss to FaZe Vegas, was him getting his feet wet. He now has a win under his belt in the Call of Duty League, and it was secured against a Minnesota side that hasn’t been performing too badly of late.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Minnesota went on something of a run at Major I in Dallas, Texas, in January. The squad pushed FaZe Vegas into the lower bracket and eliminated Miami Heretics from the tournament before falling in a <strong>very close </strong>redemption series against FaZe.</p>



<p>Toronto’s next fixture will be <strong>next Saturday </strong>against Miami Heretics, followed by a series against Paris Gentle Mates, this season’s Major I champion side. Will Toronto remain resilient?</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re enjoying the Call of Duty League this season.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/midsummer-studios/" id="1480">Midsummer Studios</a> has closed, but not before giving a look at a life simulator that the team was working on.</p>



<p>The studio was founded by XCOM designer Jake Solomon, and it was Solomon who shared on social media that the studio was closing its doors but wanted to provide a look at a game called Burbank. According to Solomon, the game was a mix of The Sims and The Truman Show, the film starring Jim Carrey that focused on a man discovering that his life was a television series.</p>



<p>“We built a studio, we made a game, and I’m really proud of both,” wrote Solomon. “This game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us,” he said in his post.</p>

Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into.</p><p>It's like "Life Sims + The Truman Show," but it's more than that. I believe people are… <a href="https://t.co/RuYvDhdEZO">pic.twitter.com/RuYvDhdEZO</a></p></div>— Jake Solomon (@SolomonJake) <a href="https://twitter.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>











<p>Jake Solomon later stated in a social media post that the characters in the pre-alpha trailer he shared were generated by AI. However, he insists that the studio had no intention of replacing any developers with AI.</p>



<p>“Our characters use AI for memory, reasoning and speech. That’s what let’s you create anyone you want and drop them in any story you write. But all of our art is created by our talented artists. We had no interest in replacing <em>any</em> developers with AI,” he wrote.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-xcom-devs-form-midsummer-studios-to-make-next-gen-life-sim/" id="40302">The studio opened in 2024</a>, with Solomon partnering with Will Miller, the lead designer at Firaxis Games, and Leslie Birch. Less than 2 years later, it is closed. The studio launched with $6 million in funding from investors. </p>



<p>The initial press release announcing the company states that Transcend Fund led the way, with participation from Tirta Ventures, Betaworks Ventures, 1 Up Ventures, F4 Fund, Krafton, and Day Zero Productions.</p>



<p>The major life simulator was the company’s main game.</p>







<p>There are even more major shakeups in the game industry. Recently, Ubisoft Toronto confirmed that it had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-toronto-lays-off-40-employees/" id="177713">laid off 40 employees. </a></p>



<p>Xbox is also undergoing a massive restructuring, following Phil Spencer’s recent retirement and Sarah Bond’s resignation from the company.
