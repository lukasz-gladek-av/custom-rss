            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Saturday, and while I’ve not been around for a while, I hope that your streaks are all going strong, pushing into the weekend. I unfortunately lost mine, but it’s time to kick that back into gear with more NYT Connections hints and solutions for Saturday, October 11.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know about today’s NYT Connections hints.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-11">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 11)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #852:</p>



<ul>
<li>ALLEY</li>



<li>SPORT</li>



<li>TACKLE</li>



<li>LANE</li>



<li>TOM</li>



<li>COURT</li>



<li>KIT</li>



<li>BOB</li>



<li>DON</li>



<li>BILL</li>



<li>WEAR</li>



<li>GEAR</li>



<li>PAT</li>



<li>WAY</li>



<li>PUT ON</li>



<li>STUFF</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Whether you’re camping or competing, this collection has you covered.</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Ready for the runway or the rugby pitch? These words help you get suited up.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – You’ll find these at the end of addresses — just don’t take a wrong turn</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – These names double as everyday nouns — from currency to movement.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 11.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-11-852">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 11 (#852)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– GEAR, KIT, STUFF, TACKLE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DON, PUT ON, SPORT, WEAR</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – ALLEY, COURT, LANE, WAY</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BILL, BOB, PAT, TOM</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/vince-zampella-complains-ea-app/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/respawn-ceo-vince-zampella-complains-about-ea-app-and-suggests-players-go-to-steam-instead.1322491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 was released yesterday, and some PC-based players have been experiencing issues tied to the EA App, a digital storefront and launcher that supports the game. It has been actively blocking users from booting the game and presenting an error message, which is something that has actively ’embarrassed’ EA leadership.</p>



<p>In a series of social media posts, Respawn Entertainment CEO and co-founder Vince Zampella actively criticized the EA App, suggesting that users consider refunding the game and purchasing it through Steam instead, which offers a more stable experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-vince-zampella-bags-on-the-app-his-owner-created">Vince Zampella Bags on the App His Owner Created</h2>



<p>Respawn Entertainment is one of the many subsidiaries under the Electronic Arts banner, but that hasn’t stopped CEO Vince Zampella from taking to social media to lead a crusade against the EA App.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/VinceZampella/status/1976718941063151656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a post</a> responding to a communication about the rampant EA App issues, Zampella wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I have yelled about ea app people. Any suggestions on next levels of escalation?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the comments beneath that post, Zampella admitted he’s playing the game on Steam, and he actively advised others to do the same. When one user explained they had similar issues, Zampella asked if they could refund the game on the EA App and buy it on Steam instead.</p>



<p>He also confirmed that other platforms, like Xbox, aren’t having these issues whatsoever.</p>



<p>When one user demanded that Zampella ‘yell at Andrew Wilson’ (EA’s CEO), Zampella said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s not his fault, he’s just as upset as me</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth stressing that <strong>as of a few hours ago</strong> (at the time of publishing), the EA App was no longer exhibiting these issues and things had returned to normal for users across the platform.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In July, a PEGI rating surfaced for Assassin’s Creed Shadows on Nintendo Switch 2. This was just days after Ubisoft stated the game, which is one of the best-received Assassin’s Creed games in <strong>years</strong>, would be headed to ‘other machines’.</p>



<p>Now, a listing on a French storefront has revealed a placeholder cover and a product description for the game. It could be the site getting ahead of the game, or it could be a slip that was posted early in error. The listing was spotted by eagle-eyed fans, but if it’s a real listing, it comes as no surprise.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-assassin-s-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2">When is Assassin’s Creed Shadows Coming to Switch 2?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing, there’s no release date for Assassin’s Creed Shadows on Switch 2, but it’s widely believed that it will land in the coming months. It’s looking as though it’ll follow a similar path to Star Wars: Outlaws, which landed on Switch 2 on September 4.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-rating-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a PEGI rating</a> for Nintendo Switch 2 back in July, which is usually applied within a few months of launch and no earlier. Now, a French outlet <a href="https://www.auchan.fr/assassin-s-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2/pr-C1851867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">named Auchan</a> has shown a listing for the game.</p>



<p>On the French storefront, it’s written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Experience Assassin’s Creed Shadows in a whole new way with Nintendo Switch 2!<br></p>



<p>MASTER THE SERIES’ MOST DEPTH-BASED STEALTH MECHANISMS AND ENJOY VISCERAL COMBAT.<br>Play as Naoe, a cunning shinobi, and use light, sound, and shadows to avoid detection. Infiltrate enemy strongholds with a variety of free-running options, including the new grappling hook, distract guards with shurikens or smoke bombs, and assassinate targets with your Hidden Blade. As the samurai Yasuke, perform silent takedowns with a bow or unleash devastating combos with a katana or naginata.<br></p>



<p>Switch between these two heroes to adapt your strategy and experience feudal Japan through two radically different approaches: stealth or power, shadow or steel.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was released in March 2025, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our review</a>, we praised the game’s visuals, world, and cinematic campaign, all of which were on point for this stellar release.</p>



<p>If Assassin’s Creed Shadows comes out on Nintendo Switch 2, will you be picking up a copy? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Pre-orders for Resident Evil Requiem are set to go live on October 29, along with a special series-themed video.</p>



<p>The Resident Evil franchise has been delivering the scares since 1996. With the 30th anniversary coming next year, a new entry, Resident Evil Requiem, is releasing on February 27th, 2026. From what we’ve seen (and played), it looks to capitalize on what makes the series iconic: terrifying creatures and survival skills. If you cannot wait to return to Raccoon City, like I am, we know know when pre-orders will start. Plus, we’ll get an extra special video to go along with it.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-special-video-requiem-pre-orders-to-release-on-october-29th">Resident Evil Special Video, Requiem Pre-Orders To Release On October 29th</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The nightmare begins soon. <br>Resident Evil Requiem pre-orders will start on October 29th, US time. Plus, we'll be releasing a video celebrating the Resident Evil franchise at the same time (note: no new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay will be shown). Keep an eye out.… <a href="https://t.co/M8ssS8PJsS">pic.twitter.com/M8ssS8PJsS</a></p>— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1976773536883609715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/1976773536883609715?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a>, Capcom has announced that pre-orders for Resident Evil Requiem will go live on October 29th, 2025. No specifics were given as for what time that will be other than “US time”. In addition, a special video celebrating the Resident Evil series will premiere on October 29th as well. Unfortunately for fans hoping to see more Requiem gameplay, Capcom confirmed that no new footage will be shown.</p>



<p>However, for the optimists in the room, it doesn’t confirm that nothing new from the series will be shown. Rumors of a remake of Resident Evil 0, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-resident-evil-5-getting-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5</a>, and Code Veronica have made the rounds for a while. Perhaps we could see a reveal for one of those titles during the video? Furthermore, the film adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-2026-resident-evil-movie-will-be-in-spirit-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-2026-resident-evil-movie-will-be-in-spirit-of-games/"> Evil</a>, directed by Weapon’s Zach Cregger is currently in production. Maybe we’ll see some footage or principal photography? We’ll just have to wait and see on October 29th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-powerwash-simulator-2-have-early-access.1322407/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Are you looking to play PowerWash Simulator 2 in early access? Are you hoping for any chance to jump in as soon as possible?</p>



<p>With the first game being a surprise hit, PowerWash Simulator 2 is looking to be another rewarding experience, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-powerwash-simulator-2-splitscreen-local-multiplayer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this time with more friends</a>.</p>



<p>Here is everything you need to know about any potential PowerWash Simulator 2 early access.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-powerwash-simulator-2-have-early-access">Does PowerWash Simulator 2 Have Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You have to wait just like everyone else to clean this. Image via FuturLab</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no early access period in PowerWash Simulator 2. The game’s full release is set for October 23, which is when everyone will be able to access the game.</strong></p>



<p>The original <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/games/powerwash-simulator-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerWash Simulator</a> was released into early access, in the way that it did not have its 1.0 release until much later, but that is not the case with the sequel. All content in PowerWash Simulator 2 can be considered the game’s full launch, with any future maps likely coming via DLC packs, like the first game saw.</p>



<p>It is not necessarily surprising that there is no early access for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>. Typically, only very large games offer that kind of benefit for buying a deluxe edition or something like that. With a smaller, but still anticipated, game like this, that doesn’t happen much.</p>



<p>With that said, it is nice to see the game have a full 1.0 release so soon after the release date announcement.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-does-powerwash-simulator-2-have-a-demo">Does PowerWash Simulator 2 Have a Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, there is a demo available for download for PowerWash Simulator 2, but it is only available on Steam. There is no demo for the game on Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X|S, at least as of this writing.</strong></p>



<p>In the demo, you get a look at the early portion of the game, with two jobs available: Removal Van and Public Facility. You can also walk around your home base and see how this new area will be in the full game.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, with the demo only available on Steam, console players are left out of the early fun. There is always a chance that these storefronts will get access to the demo before the game releases, but as of now, there is no indication that it is happening.</p>

<p>Have you given the PowerWash Simulator 2 early demo a try? Let us know your thoughts in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p>Want to play PowerWash Simulator 2 with friends when it fully releases? Here are all of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platforms the game will be released on</a>, and whether or not the sequel has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-powerwash-simulator-2-crossplay-cross-platform-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossplay functionality</a>.</p>

<p>The Haunted Masquerade in Overwatch 2 is the game’s latest Halloween event, bringing with it a new game mode, skins, and more content in a new season update.</p>



<p>While Overwatch was dealing with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/almost-half-of-players-who-quit-overwatch-jumped-to-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loss of players due to Marvel Rivals</a> about a year ago, the game has been making a resurgence with some great content updates, and this looks to be the latest.</p>



<p>Here is when the Haunted Masquerade starts in Overwatch 2 and all the content you can expect in it.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-overwatch-2-haunted-masquerade">When is the Overwatch 2 Haunted Masquerade?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The new Stadium additions. Image by Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Haunted Masquerade Halloween event in Overwatch 2 begins on Tuesday, October 14, alongside the update to Season 19.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24232473/beware-a-haunted-masquerade-begins-in-season-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Season 19 in Overwatch 2</a> brings a bunch of Halloween content, like the Haunted Masquerade and the return of Junkenstein’s Revenge, as well as a mythic hero skin for Lifeweaver and a mythic weapon skin for Kiriko. For the first time, Junkrat will also receive a mythic hero skin when the midseason update happens in November.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatchs-stadium-a-round-based-competitive-mode-that-borrows-from-deadlock-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Stadium mode</a> is getting three more heroes added to the mix in Hazard, Torbjorn, and Sojourn. Stadium is also getting a new shop item called gadgets that will help to turn the tide in your favor for battle.</p>



<p>Outside of that, you can expect the usual rotation of new skins and bundles in the shop themed around archangels and spirits.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-overwatch-2-haunted-masquerade-mode">What is the Overwatch 2 Haunted Masquerade Mode?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Be sure to have friends wear each other’s masks for a boost! Image by Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Haunted Masquerade in Overwatch 2 is a limited-time mode that allows players to first select the hero they want to play and then choose a mask of a different hero in the spawn room to gain a special ability for that match.</strong></p>



<p>After you select your mask, your hero will instantly get a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-adds-ability-altering-perks-brings-back-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small perk power-up</a>. For example, putting on a Genji mask will give whatever hero you are playing a double jump, or Reaper’s mask will heal you slightly as you deal damage to enemies.</p>



<p>That’s not all, though, as masks have a little extra surprise if you and a team member select lore-appropriate heroes. For example, if your team has Mei and Juno and they have each other’s masks, their ultimates will combine, bringing in an Orbital Ray boost to your teammates, while also having Blizzard freeze enemies in range.</p>
