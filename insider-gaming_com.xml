<p>The all-Brazilian FaZe Clan roster has stepped up in the grand final of the Six Invitational in Boston to hand Team BDS a decisive loss. With a 3 – 1 scoreline, the curtain came down over the $3 million tournament and FaZe Clan took centre stage to lift the iconic hammer. Team BDS had a solid run to reach the final, but ultimately failed to overcome FaZe Clan’s staying power.</p>

<h2 id="h-another-year-done">Another Year Done</h2>



<p>The Six Invitational was a monumental event, which is fast becoming the par for the course with this tournament. As one of the single-biggest esports events in the world, the Six Invitational awards a whopping $1 million to the victor, and nobody goes home empty-handed.</p>



<p>In Boston, in front of a sold-out crowd, FaZe Clan stormed to the top spot and secured that hefty cash prize.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan has competed at every Six Invitational since 2018, but this is the organisation’s first win. It follows a close second-place finish in 2024 when the team lost against w7m Esports in front of a packed crowd in Sao Paolo.</p>



<p>It was a dramatic couple of weeks in the run-up to the grand final. In the qualifying stages, emotions were running high, and M80 faced a fine and a two-year staff suspension when the team’s coach, Budega, exploded against DarkZero. Those scenes came shortly after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/m80-gunnar-team-liquid-six-invitational/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M80’s Gunnar went on a rant</a> against all comers – then dropped out of the tournament a day later.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan’s finish against Team BDS came after a defiant run through the elimination bracket. It was an epic thing, with FaZe Clan being knocked into the lower bracket by Spacestation at the earliest opportunity.</p>



<p>From there, the team knuckled down and pushed forward, eliminating Team Liquid, Virtus, Falcons, <strong>Spacestation</strong>, Unwanted, and finally FURIA, which also hails from Brazil. It was one of the most incredible lower-bracket runs in esports history, and it ended with FaZe Clan securing the ultimate win over Team BDS and securing the $1 million prize.</p>



<p>That’s not bad at all.</p>



<p>Just before the grand final took place, Ubisoft jumped on stage to reveal Siege X – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/">find out more here</a>.</p>

<p>The CDL Major II qualifiers are in full flow after the competitive season resumed this past weekend, but it hasn’t been fun and games for all involved. In a twist of fate, OpTic Texas – last year’s Call of Duty Championship winner – failed to secure a single map against both Atlanta FaZe and Minnesota Rokkr just days after Pred returned to the starting lineup.</p>



<p>Pred temporarily departed the team late last year to deal with personal issues, and Huke stepped up to fill in for him. Following Huke’s dismissal from the roster, some fans are up in arms, as the change seems to have done more harm than good.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-the-result-you-wanted">Not The Result You Wanted</h2>



<p>To put it in a word, OpTic Texas was <strong>decimated </strong>this weekend by Atlanta FaZe and Minnesota Rokkr.</p>



<p>Atlanta FaZe is coming into the qualifiers hot off a win at Major I <strong>and </strong>the first CDL Minor, while OpTic Texas was nursing a sore spot after dropping out of the running at the recent Madrid Major. FaZe now has a relatively ridiculous record over OpTic Texas in the CDL era.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Minnesota Rokkr currently occupies sixth place in the overall standings and hasn’t clashed with OpTic Texas since June 2024. Coincidentally, Rokkr was able to hand OpTic Texas a loss back then, too.</p>



<p>Between these two fixtures, OpTic Texas failed to secure <strong>a single map win</strong>. On social media, the team was quick to express concerns:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Actually unacceptable from me. 

Feel terrible to everyone who supports me, gotta just be better. Simple as that, sucks but I’ve been here before. GGs Faze and MN.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Following the loss against Atlanta FaZe, a clip was captured showing OpTic Texas’ Dashy trying to snap his webcam in half. It has been a tough couple of weeks for the OpTic side, and we’re already a long way from the COD Champs win.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the Call of Duty League this weekend, LAT continued to lay the smackdown against all comers, wiping the Royal Ravens with a 3 – 0 scoreline and laying waste to the Vegas Falcons. The Falcons are still to grab a single win this season.</p>



<p>LAG M8 lost again, this time against Boston Breach. It started as a close match, with the opening Hardpoint coming down to just a two-point difference, but things quickly fell apart for LAG M8. Presently, the team sits in 11th place in the CDL standings with just two matches won to <strong>eight </strong>lost. </p>



<p>The Call of Duty League Major II qualifiers will continue this coming weekend, with all eyes resting firmly on the Major II tournament in Texas. It’s set to run between March 20 – 23.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 has reached a new milestone today, setting a new standard for total players while still chasing the the all-time record for the series. The latest iteration of the Counter-Strike franchise reached its highest player peak ever.</p>



<p>Is CS2 perfect? No, but it couldn’t be further from “dead.”</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cs2-strengthens-its-hold-as-the-most-popular-game-on-steam">CS2 Strengthens Its Hold As The Most Popular Game on Steam</h2>



<p>On February 16, 2025, Counter-Strike 2 reached a concurrent player peak of 1,744,015 players, according to the trusted <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB database</a>. This occurred around 13:50 UTC: mid-to-late afternoon in Europe, night-time around Asia, and morning for the Americas. This number represents the most amount of players playing CS2 at once <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-2-reaches-highest-player-peak-after-shanghai-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since just a couple months ago in December 2024</a>.</p>



<p>Since December, CS2 has averaged over 900,000 players, according to SteamDB. As impressive as the peaks and averages have been recently, they’re still just a bit short of the all-time records set by CS:GO. May 2023 saw the highest player peak ever in Counter-Strike history at 1,818,773 players, as well as the highest average ever at over 1.11 million players. Those historic numbers can be attributed to the announcement of the CS2 limited test and the start of the final CS:GO Major, BLAST Paris.</p>



<p>The slight dip in CS2 player peaks and averages in January 2025 could be attributed to the break in the professional circuit following the Perfect World Shanghai Major. As the schedule has resumes with events like BLAST and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vitality-stuns-spirit-3-0-in-grand-finals-of-iem-katowice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IEM Katowice</a> at the start of February, the player count swells once again. CS2 effectively owns the top spot on Steam’s player charts, as it has only been surpassed in active players in exceptionally rare circumstances.</p>



<p>While the game’s popularity and player base show zero signs of trailing off, there are still concerns that players want addressed. These range from the still-rampant cheating issue to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-launch-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">problems with FPS performance</a> to a lack of content such as operations or new modes. Still, outside of maybe League of Legends, it remains the most popular PC game in the world.</p>



<p>Will CS2 eventually beat the CS:GO player peak? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>In a recent interview on the XboxEra Podcast, Phil Spencer got talking about the future of Xbox showcases like the Developer Direct. In one segment, the conversation turned to Xbox using those stages to reveal multi-platform games, presenting both the Nintendo and PlayStation logos in trailers and title splashes.</p>



<p>It’s not the typical operating model, as most of these events are usually reserved for platform-specific trailers and promos. Recently, Xbox bucked that trend, showing off the PlayStation logo to let consumers know that whatever game is being showcased will be available on platforms <strong>other than </strong>Xbox.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-honest-and-transparent">‘Honest and Transparent’</h2>



<p>On the most recent episode of <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the XboxEra Podcast</a>, Phil Spencer spoke about the recent inclusion of PlayStation iconography in Xbox-backed showcases. In his words, that’s the set standard going forward, and players should expect to see more multi-platform imagery in trailers and broadcasts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s just being honest and transparent about where the games are showing, and we actually even had this discussion last year for the June showcase, and by the time we kind of made our decision, we couldn’t get all of the assets done and it felt weird to have some of them in and some of them out.</p>



<p>But I just want to be transparent with people – for shipping on Nintendo Switch, we’re gonna put that. For shipping on PlayStation, on Steam… People should know the storefronts where they can get our games, but I want people to be able to experience our Xbox community in our games and everything we have to offer, on every screen we can.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s all about openness and transparency, according to Spencer.</p>



<p>Recently, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/">Forza Horizon 5</a> will be zooming onto PlayStation platforms later this year. That follows a few titles that were once exclusive to Xbox making their way onto the platform. There have also been rumours that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/">Gears and Halo</a> might head over to  PlayStation and Nintendo Switch at some point.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nrg-benches-verno-and-coach-bonkar-after-vct-americas-kickoff/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>After 12 official matches as a team and only three during VCT Americas, NRG has benched Andrew “Verno” Maust and VALORANT coach Malkolm “bonkar” Rench. Following a strong performance at offseason events that resulted in high expectations, NRG has already made significant changes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-verno-and-bonkar-out-from-nrg-after-only-a-dozen-official-matches">Verno and Bonkar Out From NRG After Only a Dozen Official Matches</h2>



<p>Roster changes to the NRG VALORANT roster had been rumored since the conclusion of Kickoff, but were confirmed by the organization today. NRG’s Chief Gaming Officer Jaime Cohenca <a href="https://x.com/bikeage/status/1891179079015285152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a> the benching is a result of a lack of cohesion that has been brewing for months.</p>



<p>“What I can say is that we put together a roster that was poised to contend for international championships but ultimately failed in terms of team cohesion,” Cohenca wrote on X. “Winning SEN City and SOOP [in the offseason] only delayed the effects of the issues brewing. The team no longer could function as constructed, so continuing with the current five players/head coach was not an option.”</p>



<p>“Given the nature of the VCT schedule, this break is pretty much the only window to make a roster move, so we are doing things now to be ready for when a Champs slot is on the line.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>VCT Roster Update: Verno and Bonkar have been moved to the NRG VALORANT reserve roster.

They will remain a part of NRG as we prepare for the remainder of the 2025 VCT season.</span></p></article></div>



<p>Long-time veterans of NRG in Sam “s0m” Oh, Pujan “FNS” Mehta, and Ethan “Ethan” Arnold will seemingly stay on the starting roster. Adam “mada” Pampuch, who joined the team during this past offseason, will also stay following an exceptional statistical performance at Kickoff. Some fans speculate that former coach Chetan “Chet” Singh could return when his suspension expires at the end of Masters Bangkok. Chet was suspended by Riot Games for streaming VODs deemed “confidential” on his personal channel.</p>



<p>NRG lost to Cloud9 and KRÜ at Kickoff, while managing to win against 100T in between those matches, but earned no points towards Champions qualification. Their season resumes when VCT Americas Stage 1 starts in late March.</p>



<p>Who should NRG bring on to the starting lineup? Let us know down below or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
