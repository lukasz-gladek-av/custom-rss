<p>SpongeBob SquarePants may be heading to Fortnite, if notable leakers’ claims are correct. Furthermore, the collaboration is coming sooner than we’d expect.</p>



<p>If you grew up in the 2000s, you know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-the-tide-launches-november-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob SquarePants</a> quite well. The hit Nickelodeon show has been airing for 26 years and still going. Entertaining both kids and adults, the legacy of the animated cartoon is enormous. So, naturally, it’s high time (or tide, in SpongeBob’s case, for the series to come to Fortnite. While a collaboration has happened between the two with UEFN, it seems like it could be much bigger in Season 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-spongebob-squarepants-decals-leaked-for-fortnite-hinting-at-possible-collab">SpongeBob SquarePants Decals Leaked for Fortnite, Hinting at Possible Collab</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The rumor of SpongeBob SquarePants being in Fortnite was first said by <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1984659306851991621" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>, a known leaker in the gaming community. Other insiders like SamLeakss reported the same, stating that the franchise would <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1984669485534466115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">be added with Season 7</a>, launching November 27th, 2025. However, the most concrete evidence comes from <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1984658819226476786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1984658819226476786%7Ctwgr%5Ef357053515844a5306205f97171b8abb11aeca93%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D155457action%3Dedit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a>, who had an art asset of a smushed Plankton. As some commenters have noticed, it looks like a wheel for the racing game, possibly hinting at what the collab may be for. It also helps that SamLeakss mentions that an SUV would be part of the addition, seemingly confirming it’s part of Rocket Racing.</p>



<p>Just today, The Simpsons were added to Fortnite, transforming the map to Springfield. Seeing how the game has grown into a big commercial success with collabs left and right is crazy. With recent ones being The Black Phone, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-season-10-gorillaz-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gorillaz</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnitemares-2025-features-largest-ever-collabs-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a>, every series under the sun seemingly wants in with Epic Games’ mulitplayer shooter. Whether SpongeBob appears on the battlefield or as cosmetics is unknown, but fans can expect the porous fellow to appear real soon.</p>



<p>What do you think of the SpongBob x Fortnite collab? What do you hope it looks like? Skins? Cosmetic items? Sidekicks?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-release-date/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Even more psychological manipulation awaits in Poppy Playtime Chapter 5. If you’re eager to be reunited with Huggy Wuggy, we’ve got the latest release date details and when it could be expected.</p>



<p>Chapter 4 apparently wasn’t enough for Poppy Playtime fans, which is why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-teaser-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 5</a> is on the way. The lovingly-named Huggy Wuggy and his minions are waiting to massacre you once again, and no doubt you’re here because you’re excited at the prospect, instead of running away—you have ZERO survival instincts, people!</p>



<p>That said, if you’re eager to enter a new area of the factory, let’s get into it.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-comes-out">Do We Know When Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 Comes Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’ll happen, so be ready. Credit to Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mob Entertainment hasn’t revealed Poppy Playtime Chapter 5’s full release date yet, but Steam shows that we shouldn’t expect the new DLC until 2026 at the very earliest.</strong></p>



<p>If you head to Steam, you’ll see quite clearly: “<strong>Planned Release Date:&nbsp;2026</strong>,” under the usual launch details section.</p>



<p>A Halloween announcement for Chapter 5 understandably had the Poppy Playtime community excited. Was the new release a shadow drop? Was it an announcement to say that it was coming during Holiday 2025? Unfortunately not.</p>



<p>We’ve done the research, checked the game’s Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 – Teaser Trailer, and searched on the main website to no avail. Interestingly, all the top comments on the Chapter 5 teaser trailer are from fans and creators asking for the developer to <strong>take their time with the game</strong>.</p>



<p>Chapter 4 debuted with some technical issues and bugs at launch, which marred the game for many. If Mob Entertainment does this, we might not see Chapter 5 until well into 2026, maybe even closer to next Halloween.</p>



<p>You can check out the full Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 teaser trailer right here if you’ve not seen it.</p>

<p>Don’t Scream Together brings back the terrifying horror of the original and amplifies the fear by allowing you to have multiple friends join you. We’re seeing if Don’t Scream Together has a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S future.</p>



<p>If you’ve somehow not heard of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dont-scream-is-taking-the-horror-world-by-storm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don’t Scream</a>, it’s probably better for your sanity. The 2023 indie sensation quickly went viral with its retro-looking graphics, palpable tension, and the game’s simple premise: DON’T SCREAM. 2024 saw the game’s full 1.0 launch, and it’s been such a hit that developer Digital Cybercherries is working on Don’t Scream Together—and it would be better on PS5 and Xbox.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-don-t-scream-together-come-to-ps5-consoles">Will Don’t Scream Together Come To PS5 Consoles?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’d run too. Credit to Digital Cybercherries</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It can’t be ruled out for the future, but for now, Don’t Scream Together won’t be launching on PS5 consoles</strong>.</p>



<p>So far, developer Digital Cybercherries has made it quite clear that the new multiplayer version of Don’t Scream is targeting a Steam release, meaning it’s only on PC at launch.</p>



<p>On the game’s official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1128949867457302530/1156475689789304842/1431060015195881482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> server, a community post outlines this quite clearly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’re incredibly proud to announce DON’T SCREAM TOGETHER, an improved and expanded version of DON’T SCREAM will be <strong>launching on Steam soon!</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s no mention of consoles, and it’s not even addressed anywhere in the news or info threads.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-don-t-scream-together-come-to-xbox-series-x-s-consoles">Will Don’t Scream Together Come To Xbox Series X|S Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>We also have to say that Don’t Scream Together isn’t scheduled for any Xbox consoles right now: The Xbox Series X|S or even the Xbox One, to extend the reach a bit more.</strong></p>



<p>This answer is much the same as our PS5 verdict. It seems like Digital Cybercherries is firmly fixed on getting Don’t Scream Together right on PC before even contemplating a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S console release.</p>



<p>But keep reading, because interested Don’t Scream onlookers might like what we have to say next! </p>



<h2 id="h-is-don-t-scream-coming-to-ps5-or-xbox-consoles">Is Don’t Scream Coming to PS5 or Xbox Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>A Don’t Scream developer has hinted that the original single-player experience “may find itself on other platforms in the future.”</strong></p>



<p>It’s not all doom and gloom then. While we’ll have to wait for Don’t Scream Together on console, a console port for 2024’s full Don’t Scream debut could be on the cards.</p>



<p>When asked about Don’t Scream Together crossplay, developer [DCC] Dec (on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2692990" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>) said this:</p>



<blockquote></blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>“Crossplay is not in the works currently for this title. The classic DON’T SCREAM singleplayer experience may find itself on other platforms in the future though.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s up to you if you take this as a win. If you’re looking for a console port of Don’t Scream, you should at least be getting a taste of the OG game that set the Don’t Scream Together wheels in motion.</p>



<p>We’ll have more on its console port later when the news is announced. Are you picking up Don’t Scream Together at lunch? Or are you hungry for horror on PlayStation and Xbox consoles?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-zombies-release-early-suggests/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-campaign-and-zombies-to-release-four-days-early-data-suggests.1341157/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, a claim surfaced that Activision’s studios were preparing to announce an earlier release date for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. That was more or less refuted by Treyarch, the lead development studio piecing the game together, but now a new claim has hit the airwaves.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, famed dataminer ‘PlayStation Game Size’ dug up information about the install sizes, pre-load dates, and <strong>release times </strong>for Black Ops 7 on <strong>PlayStation 4</strong>. While a disclaimer highlighted that things can change, the data found suggests that the Black Ops 6 campaign and Zombies platform will go live on November 10, rather than November 14.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-7-s-campaign-coming-early">Is Black Ops 7’s Campaign Coming Early?</h2>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Black Ops 7’s campaign (and the Zombies offering) is almost certainly <strong>not </strong>being released earlier than intended. This is something that would have been telegraphed by Treyarch to drive up pre-orders, and that hasn’t been the case.</p>



<p>In the comments under <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1984367269372145836">their post</a>, PlayStation Game Size suggested that the ‘current release time’ listed in the files could be a PSN error:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Current Release time</p><p>Maybe PSN Error!</p></div>— PlayStation Game Size (@PlaystationSize) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlaystationSize/status/1984367615729618976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Activision’s studios rarely detach the campaign portion of a new Call of Duty game from the multiplayer platform, but it’s not unheard of. In a way, it’s a good thing, as it allows fans to complete the campaign without worrying about falling behind with everyone else flooding the multiplayer platform.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That’s not the case this year, as Activision hasn’t arranged a way for players to access the campaign early, regardless of what the data seems to suggest.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’d like to play the Black Ops 7 campaign early – or Zombies!</p>

<p>Call of Duty games are notorious for intruding on your storage space. Black Ops 7 is the biggest and latest CoD title to make its mark on the series, and its early preload details and file size guidelines might be known already.</p>



<p>There have been so many conversations about Black Ops 7 that it’s hard to keep up. The topics of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-skill-based-matchmaking-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skill-Based Matchmaking</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season One Roadmap</a> are just two of many. But its potential file size and preload details are another we have to talk about, and while information is limited right now, it might be good news! </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-preload-date-amp-file-sizes-could-have-you-smiling">Black Ops 7 Preload Date &amp; File Sizes Could Have You Smiling</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Pointing us in the right direction, are you Activision? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>, you can start preloading Black Ops 7 from November 9 at 10 AM PT—making this a full five days before the game’s full November launch.</p>



<p>The page does say that multiple details here are subject to change, so bear this in mind, but PlayStation Game Size is usually very accurate when it comes to these details. </p>



<p>If so, here’s a quick look at when you can expect to preload Black Ops 7 in your region.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Black Ops 7 Preload Times</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM—November 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">12 PM—November 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM—November 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">6 PM—November 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Standard Time (AST)</td><td data-align="center">5 AM—November 10</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Also, while it’s only the PlayStation 4 file sizes that have been noted for now, there’s every chance this could translate to the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S as well.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at the latest details on the game’s file sizes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Campaign</strong>: 11.9 GB</li>



<li><strong>Multiplayer</strong>: 11.6 GB</li>



<li><strong>Zombies</strong>: 320 MB</li>
</ul>



<p>This would be very generous and useful, especially if you have Warzone installed as well. We’ll keep you updated on any changes to the preload or file sizes.</p>

<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is often hailed as one of the greatest games ever made. It’s a timeless classic (or a modern classic, at least) that allowed players to explore an expansive, emotional, and immersive story at the end of the Old West, a time when outlaws were being… Well, <em>outlawed</em>.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser admitted that Red Dead Redemption 2 almost fell flat and ‘wasn’t coming together’ because it was so over budget and behind schedule that everyone started doubting the project.</p>



<h2 id="h-red-dead-almost-died">Red Dead Almost Died</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with Lex Fridman (a three-hour interview!), Dan Houser opened up about all things Rockstar Games and beyond, addressing his tenure with the legendary studio and what happened to him after he resigned from the firm in 2020.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>One segment led to Houser and Fridman talking about Red Dead Redemption 2, the 2018 open-world epic that blew everyone’s hair back with intense realism, granular detail, and an incredible story and cast.</p>



<p>Even though the end product was a phenomenal game that won awards and remains a top-selling title today, it wasn’t all smooth sailing for the cowboy caper. Dan Houser revealed to Fridman that Red Dead Redemption 2 <strong>was almost </strong>in trouble:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think with Red Dead 2, we were behind schedule. We were over budget so much I didn’t want to think about it.</p>



<p>And you’re making a game about a cowboy dying of TB, and the game’s not coming together. Turns out a lot of people doubt you at that moment, you know, it’s not that fun. I think that was a lot of pressure.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Houser took a moment to praise his old team, stressing that what they did to deliver Red Dead Redemption 2 was nothing short of mythical. Even today, Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the most talked-about and widely appreciated games.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that the West and all of the themes around the West really lend themselves to that. And then the gunplay was fantastic, and the horses were incredible. So I think you had this combination of technical know-how, a very, very strong team, and really strong material.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 has been in the news recently as fans await an overhaul that brings it up to spec on current-gen consoles, including an update to allow to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-60-fps-update-arthur-morgan/">game to run at 60 FPS</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans for years clung to the faint hope of Agent still being released by Rockstar Games. The Cold War shooter was set to expand on the company’s already stellar portfolio, but development stalled, and the game was officially canceled after 11 years.</p>



<p>It’s rare to hear either <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-working-closely-with-remedy-entertainment-on-max-payne-1-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games</a> co-founder speak so candidly about the gaming empire they created. In a three-hour chat, one co-founder—Dan Houser—explained about the history of Rockstar, and the subject of Agent came up.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Deep and honest. Credit to Dan Houser: GTA, Red Dead Redemption, Rockstar, Absurd &amp; Future of Gaming | Lex Fridman Podcast #484</figcaption></figure>



<p>Dan Houser sat down with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lexfridman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lex Fridman</a> and opened up on a wide variety of Rockstar-related topics and answered some of the most burning questions we’ve all had for years.</p>



<p>Arguably, the one that got away for Rockstar Games was Agent. First teased in 2007, Agent was set in the 1970s—during the Cold War—and you were to play a spy, getting embroiled in the deep-seated political world tensions at the time.</p>



<p>It was formally announced in 2009, but that’s about all we got for the next 10 years. Houser explained in the Fridman interview why Agent never panned out:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We worked a lot on multiple iterations of an open-world spy game, and it never came together. Agent had about five different iterations. I don’t think it works, I concluded. I keep thinking about it sometimes, I lie in bed thinking about it, and I’ve concluded: What makes them really good as film stories makes them not work as video games, or I need to think through how to do it a different way as a video game.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Interestingly, Houser explained that the public perception of the game’s 70s Cold War setting was only one version of Agent.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That was one of the versions. There was another that was set in current [times]…we had so many different versions of this game, we worked on it with so many different teams.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After further explanation, Houser concluded with an interesting statement: “I question if you can make a good, open-world spy game.” </p>



<p>You can check out the video below, and it automatically plays from the moment Dan opens up on Agent.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dan Houser: GTA, Red Dead Redemption, Rockstar, Absurd &amp; Future of Gaming | Lex Fridman Podcast #484" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3gbXDjNWyI?start=6998&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It does bring up a good point. The closest thing in recent memory is a game that’s not even out yet—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-theme-song-lana-del-rey-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">007 First Light</a>. IO Interactive’s spy thriller isn’t an open-world game, but it does feature semi-open sections. This could play into Houser’s point even more, that there’s an obvious disconnect between an open-world game and the serious, race-against-time narrative a spy thriller usually tells.</p>



<p>Do you think Dan Houser is right? Was Rockstar’s goal for Agent too ambitious? Is it too late for Rockstar or Houser’s new company (Absurd Ventures) to give it another go?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders isn’t safe from cheaters or hackers, and most games aren’t. There’s a chance you could have some of your inventory stolen or taken through nefarious or illegal means at any point. If this happens, Embark Studios has your back with lost items in ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>Finding and losing items is part of the extraction shooter formula. You win some, you lose some—that’s how it goes. But there’s an ick when you lose hard-earned goods to cheaters. It can happen, and people are more than happy to extort your efforts for their own gain. </p>



<p>However, if it does happen in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, you should automatically get your stuff back.</p>



<h2 id="h-cheaters-amp-hackers-don-t-prosper-in-arc-raiders">Cheaters &amp; Hackers Don’t Prosper In ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The chicken, well, Embark, has spoken. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>As shown by <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersNews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Radar</a> (via u/Jfourmes), if you’re targeted by a hacker, your items will be returned.</p>



<p>“Your items were lost due to unfair play, but we managed to get them back for you! They’re now available for you to claim and take with you on your next journey Topside. We’re committed to building an environment where gameplay is about skill, teamwork, and fun, not unfair advantages. Thank you for being part of this mission! Together, we’re building ARC Raiders into a fair and fun experience for everyone,” says the official in-game message.</p>



<p>We did some digging into the original <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olbx4i/i_didnt_know_we_get_refunded_is_someone_cheats_o/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> post, and it seems the original user didn’t report the cheater or submit a report; it was an automatic message from the devs informing them of what had happened.</p>



<p>It’s also unclear what constitutes “unfair play.” Still, we imagine anything pertaining to cheating, hacking, or items being stolen that shouldn’t ordinarily be allowed to be taken falls under this umbrella.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Have you encountered any hackers or cheaters in ARC Raiders so far? Let us know if you’ve experienced this message pop-up, and what happened for more details. You can let everyone know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-sidekicks-customization-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sidekicks are finally coming to Fortnite after months of speculation, giving players pets to accompany them across all game modes, but there are some specific customization choices that are permanent.</p>



<p>The first Sidekick is coming in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons Battle Pass</a>, with additional Sidekicks being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-announces-return-of-companions-with-new-sidekicks-arriving-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added to the Item Shop from November 7</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-sidekick-leak-shows-prices-will-be-the-same-as-collab-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked prices indicate they will cost around the same as a Collab Skin</a>.</p>



<p>With a high price and restrictions to some customizations, Sidekicks have caused a stir in the community, and we have all the details on the customization rules.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-fortnite-sidekick-customizations-are-permanent">What Fortnite Sidekick Customizations Are Permanent?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big additions. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Each Fortnite Sidekick has a one-time customization changes to their appearance that are applied before you can equip the item.</strong></p>



<p>These are the major customization choices with each Sidekick, impacting the base colours, any color accents, or major features, like the style of ears, body size, and similar. The final permanent choice is the name for a Sidekick.</p>



<p>Once locked in, these choices are permanent and cannot be adjusted. However, you can purchase the same Sidekick again and make a fresh style, though this, of course, incurs the cost of splashing out on the same item.</p>



<p>This is a big difference to The Mandalorian Warrior outfit, for example, which allows for constant cosmetic changes and the ability to save different appearances in your loadout. </p>



<p>Understandably, there has been some backlash to the permanence of some of the big customization choices for Sidekicks, and it remains to be seen whether Epic Games change their approach, or add a purchaseable item that allows you to edit a Sidekick again. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-fortnite-sidekick-customizations-are-repeatable">What Fortnite Sidekick Customizations Are Repeatable?</h2>



<p><strong>Not all customization choices for your Sidekick in Fortnite are permanent, with additional accessories and some cosmetics being freely available to change.</strong></p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N0m9H13pGM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer for Fortnite Sidekicks</a>, a screen showing editable Styles offers a tease of what will be freely interchangeable with Sidekicks, with the example being clothing for a dog. In the video, two styles are shown, each with a different color and look.</p>



<p>Based on this, it’s expected that style choices for accessories like clothing, collars, and similar attire will all be able to be changed as many times as you want. What isn’t clear, however, is how you will gain access to these items, and whether there will be a deep supply of them.</p>



<p>As the amount of Sidekicks in Fortnite grows though, expect more customization options for attire to be added.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite fanatics with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership had the blow of price increases to the service softened with the announcement Fortnite Crew was being added as a perk, and we’ve got all the details of when that comes into effect.</p>



<p>Price rises for Xbox Game Pass subscriptions caused a stir last month, rising <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as much as 50% in some cases</a>, though it was also announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-battle-passes-will-now-be-included-in-xbox-game-pass-ultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Crew would be included</a> in some memberships.</p>



<p>The wait for that perk to come into effect continues, however, and if you’re wondering exactly when Fortnite Crew is added to a subscription, particularly with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons-themed Battle Pass</a> landing, we can tell you the exact release date for the bonus perk.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-fortnite-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">When Is Fortnite Coming to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New bonus. Image via Microsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite Crew will be included in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate memberships from November 18, 2025, Epic Games has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>Announced as part of the pricing structure changes to the Game Pass service in October, Fortnite Crew is being added as an additional perk for subscribers to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>.</p>



<p>The inclusion was not immediate, however, and players are still waiting for this bonus to be unlocked—but it’s on the horizon, with the perk adding to memberships from November 18, as stated by an <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-battle-royale-c-202300000001636/billing-and-payment-c-202300000001723/fortnite-crew-availability-with-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-a202300000020476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games blog post</a>.</p>



<p>No additional cost will be added to the monthly Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription price, though the previously announced price rises are in effect, but the bonus will soften the blow for Fortnite players.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-included-in-fortnite-crew">What’s Included in Fortnite Crew?</h2>



<p><strong>Fortnite Crew membership includes full access to all the Battle Passes added in Fortnite across all modes, with a total of four passes in Fortnite.</strong></p>



<p>The main Battle Pass, OG Battle Pass, Festival Pass, and LEGO Pass are all included in the membership, along with the Rocket Pass Premium in Rocket League.</p>



<p>Additional bonuses include 1,000 V-Bucks every month, available to spend on cosmetics in the Item Shop, and an exclusive monthly Crew Pack that provides a new Outfit alongside a matching accessory—a Glider, Pickaxe, or Emote.</p>

<p>Chapter 6 in Fortnite is rapidly approaching a conclusion but, before the big jump into Chapter 7, a mini-season themed around The Simpsons is taking center stage, with a new Battle Pass to enjoy.</p>



<p>Kicking off with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live event on November 1</a>, The Simpsons takeover of Fortnite will see a smaller map brought onto the scene, representing Springfield, with lobby sizes in battle royale reduced from 100 to 80 as a result.</p>



<p>There’s also the long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-announces-return-of-companions-with-new-sidekicks-arriving-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduction of Sidekicks</a>, Fortnite’s new pets feature, and the Battle Pass is stacked full of Simpsons goodies.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-battle-pass">How Much is The Fortnite x The Simpsons Battle Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to enjoy. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Simpsons Battle Pass in Fortnite costs 1,000 V-Bucks to unlock, though it’s also available as part of a Fortnite Crew subscription.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a cheaper price than usual Battle Passes in Fortnite, due to the shorter duration of the season and fewer rewards, but there’s still plenty to sink your teeth into. 1,000 V-Bucks are purchasable for a base price of $8.99, though you may be able to find cheaper codes and better value for money if you purchase a larger amount.</p>



<p>Remember, Fortnite Crew will also be included with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription starting from November 18, so don’t splash out twice if you have a membership!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-the-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-battle-pass">All Rewards in The Fortnite x The Simpsons Battle Pass</h2>



<p><strong>There are seven pages of rewards in The Simpsons Battle Pass in Fortnite, not including the bonus rewards that become available once the basic pass is completed.</strong></p>

<h2 id="h-is-the-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-battle-pass-worth-it">Is The Fortnite x The Simpsons Battle Pass Worth It?</h2>



<p><strong>For fans of The Simpsons, the Fortnite Battle Pass is certainly one of the best in a long while and highlights just how great Epic Games’ creativity is.</strong></p>



<p>With appearances of fan-favorite characters Ned Flanders, Marge Simpson, and Homer Simpson, alongside an abundance of fun easter eggs and references with Emotes, Pickaxes, and Back Blings, The Simpsons Battle Pass is worth every dollar.</p>



<p>On top of that, the Battle Pass includes a return of 900 V-Bucks, plus potentially more when the bonus rewards are revealed later this month, so you’ll pretty much get your money back in V-Bucks that can be spent on other Simpsons items in the shop.</p>

<p>A Rare Fortnite skin has returned to the Item Shop for the first time in half a decade, making its first appearance since 2020.</p>



<p>Fortnite has an abundance of skins players can use across all modes, and, with hundreds to choose from, some of those introduced take a long while to be brought back into the Item Shop.</p>



<p>These skins with limited appearances have been dubbed ‘rare’ by the community, with those owning them being able to flex on rival players—but the door has opened for players to finally get their hands on one of the rarest skins.</p>



<h2 id="h-dante-returns-to-fortnite">Dante Returns To Fortnite</h2>

<p>As leaked by <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1984395460040126887">ShiinaBR</a>, Dante returned to the Item Shop for the first time in five years on November, marking the first appearance of the skin since the same date five years ago.</p>



<p>Initially released on November 2, 2018, the Dante skin had featured just eight times in the Item Shop prior to its return today, with yearly reappearances in the Item Shop around Halloween.</p>



<p>That trend came to an end in 2020, however, with Dante not appearing for five consecutive years until the streak was broken with today’s appearance.</p>



<p>Priced at 1,500 V-Bucks, the Dante skin is available to pick up until November 4, and has the added bonus of being reactive and glowing in the dark.</p>



<p>Though the wait for Dante has been a lengthy one, it pales in comparison to some of the other rarest skins in Fortnite, with the likes of Reflex and Summit Striker not appearing in the shop for over 2,400 days.</p>
