<p>The very foundations of Rockstar Games were rocked in 2020 when Dan Houser left. Losing a co-founder was tough, but a source claims that the communication breakdown actually stemmed from a disagreement between Dan and his brother Sam.</p>



<p>Dan Houser has usually shied away from the spotlight over the years. But the Absurd Ventures founder has been more vocal in recent weeks. His sit-down interview with Lex Fridman revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-co-founder-reveals-real-reason-why-agent-was-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real reason why Agent was canceled</a>, and he’s also opened up on why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bully-2-rockstar-development-bandwidth-dan-houser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bully 2 never happened</a>.</p>



<p>A new unofficial line has opened up on his Rockstar Games departure.</p>

<p>If you know anything about GTA leaks, you probably know how reliable and revered Tez2 is in the GTA community. They’ve been a constant source of major GTA and Rockstar leaks for years.</p>







<p>So when the topic of Dan Houser leaving Rockstar Games recently popped up on the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1004182-rockstar-games-alleged-union-busting/page/6/#comment-1072611067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GTAForums</a>, Tez2 stepped in with a claim. One user asked: “We will probably never know exactly the reasons why [Dan Houser left], but I’m not the only one with this opinion, and pretending everything is hunky dory at Rockstar is baffling, especially when we keep hearing bad things coming from people working at a company that is in the middle of a union-busting scandal.”</p>



<p>Here was Tez2’s response:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“He left over a disagreement with his brother about the company’s direction, as per two former devs. If it was due to union busting or working conditions, he would have left in 2018 as a way of apologizing for his comment quoted in Schreier’s article.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was in response to the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games firings</a>. Tez2 makes it clear that the two issues are not connected, but again, this isn’t official until this is all confirmed in the books one day.</p>



<p>Do you think Dan Houser’s exit will affect the quality of GTA 6? Should the brothers reunite for at least one more big project in the future?
