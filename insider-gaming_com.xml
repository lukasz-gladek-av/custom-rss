<p>According to a new report, Steven Spielberg really wanted to direct a ‘Call of Duty’ movie and even pitched for it.</p>



<p>For those who have been living under a rock, Paramount and Activision have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-is-officially-making-a-call-of-duty-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreed on a deal</a>, and the former has officially acquired the rights to produce a Call of Duty movie. However, we still don’t know who will be writing and/or directing the film or who will star in it. A new report reveals that the Call of Duty movie was almost directed by Spielberg. </p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-movie-nearly-had-steven-spielberg-as-its-director">Call of Duty Movie Nearly Had Steven Spielberg As its Director</h2>



<p>The details about Spielberg wanting to direct a Call of Duty movie through Puck’s latest <a href="https://puck.news/newsletter_content/what-im-hearing-spielbergs-call-of-duty-pitch-phil-suns-exit-the-rock-rebrand-a-rotten-reckoning/#selection-2355.0-2381.131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">newsletter</a>. According to three of their sources, “Steven Spielberg really wanted to direct the&nbsp;CoD&nbsp;movie and his Amblin teamed with Universal dealmaker Jimmy Horowitz to present the filmmaker’s vision for one of the world’s biggest gaming franchises.” </p>



<p>The report adds that Spielberg is “famously a big gamer” and has a special love for the Call of Duty franchise. However, when bringing Spielberg on, Activision would have to abide by his rules, which include top-of-market economics, final cut, and full control over production and marketing. These requirements “spooked” Activision, and they opted for David Ellison’s pitch instead, as it provided them with more control over the movie.  </p>



<p>Nevertheless, as this information does not come from an official source, readers should approach it with caution. </p>



<p>In other news, Call of Duty is set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-will-drop-100-gb-in-an-upcoming-ps5-update-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drop 100 GB</a> in an upcoming PS5 update.
