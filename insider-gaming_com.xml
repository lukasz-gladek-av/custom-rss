<p>Samsung has taken to the stage at MWC 2025 to unveil a stunning lineup of technology ranging from new OLED television sets to immense gaming monitors – and everything in between. The set included an incredible <strong>500 Hz OLED monitor </strong>and a gorgeous 240 Hz OLED laptop – and a conceptual handheld gaming device <strong>that folds in the middle</strong>.</p>



<p>This is following on from Samsung’s success with foldable mobile phones and tablets, and it’s a natural enough progression point, but is anyone asking for it?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-foldable-gaming-experiences">Foldable Gaming Experiences</h2>



<p>At MWC 2025, <a href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Samsung revealed</a> Flex Gaming, a conceptual device with a 7.2-inch screen that folds down the middle for ease of storage. It was revealed at the showcase, and a demo was held, but it wasn’t confirmed if the device was usable.</p>



<p>It looks as though it boasts a relatively traditional layout featuring a pair of joysticks and a d-pad, but there’s a recess on either side of the device. This is to allow the joysticks to ‘enter’ the device when it’s collapsed, which means it takes up even less space. </p>



<p>It was sat alongside a Steam Deck and Razer Blade 16, and all these devices were being used to run KRAFTON’s ‘popular games’, which included InZOI, a realistic competitor to The Sims.</p>



<p>Tech aficionados flocked to the event to check out Samsung’s new 77-inch QD-OLED televisions, as well as a 31.5-inch QD-OLED monitor, both of which boast utterly remarkably visuals and colour expression.</p>



<p>One of the more bizarre elements of the Samsung lineup was the Flexible Cabinbag, a bag-like device that unfolds into an 18.1-inch display. It can be compacted to fit inside a briefcase, and it comes equipped with – you guessed it – an OLED screen. That’s the order of the day where Samsung is concerned.</p>



<p>Do you think you’d invest in a folding handheld gaming device? Let us know in the comments.</p>
