<p>In a new interview, the Russo brothers have said that they are open to developing video games tied to their Avengers movies.</p>



<p>The interview comes courtesy of <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/the-electric-state-video-game-prequel-netflix-russos-1236325355/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, where the Russo brothers were pushing their latest project “The Electric State.”</p>



<p>In the interview, it was said that the Russos helped Netflix develop a mobile game based on Electric State with their media company AGBO and will be expanding with recent hire of Nifty Games vet&nbsp;Pete Wanat&nbsp;as president of interactive technology.</p>



<p>It was said that the company now plans to produce three large-scale transmedia projects based on original ideas, but are open to developing games tied to their upcoming Avengers films. This includes Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers Secret Wars.</p>



<p>“We would definitely be open to it,” said Joe Russo. </p>



<p>“Right now, what we’re doing is creating new IP. At AGBO, we want to tell new stories. We want to tell new stories with new characters and new worlds that people haven’t seen before. So Anthony and I and Donald are working together to build out new worlds. And we have three that we’re currently working on that the intention is, for every world we build to have the scale and depth of a “Star Wars” universe, but in a different genre. And then we’ll build materials around those new worlds. We’ll tell stories in different ways using different media in those worlds,” he continue.</p>



<p>So although it might be a ways off, the Russo’s are definitely open to having a games tied to the Avengers games and its upcoming movies.</p>

<p>Special Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remake editions can make an already seismic release greater. The remake we never thought would happen is happening, and Activision is making sure to capitalize on it by releasing several unique editions. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remake</a> rumor is less a whisper and more a truth. While we’ve all been kept in the dark waiting and wondering, developer Iron Galaxy has been busy working on the remake. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-revealed-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 and Pro Skater 4</a> will be reimagined in 2025, and you can customize your experience with different editions.</p>



<p>That’s why I’m here to hold your hand as we idly coast along on our boards and check out the scenery. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie’s Marathon Pre-Order Bonuses Have Been Found on Steam]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-marathon-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie%E2%80%99s-marathon-pre-order-bonuses-have-been-found-on-steam.1125747/</guid>

<p>Bungie’s next game, Marathon, has reportedly had its pre-order bonuses uploaded to the backend on Steam.</p>



<p>That’s according to the SteamDB Discord server (and reported to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j3pv6f/marathon_preorder_cosmetics_found_in_steamdb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>), who noticed that that extra editions of Marathon and packages relating to pre-order bonuses were uploaded to Steam.</p>



<p>According to the information, such pre-order bonuses will include free Marathon skins that can be used in Destiny 2.</p>



<p>Such an update suggests that the game will be announced soon, and according to industry insider Jeff Grubb, he said in February that he believes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/">Bungie will reveal </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/"> in April</a>.</p>



<p>“Marathon wasn’t here because they’re probably going to do their own thing. Bungie does their own thing usually for Destiny. They’re going to adopt that same ‘we’re going to talk to our audience’ strategy this year as well. I think April [is] when we probably hear from them about Marathon. And it would be its own thing separate from a State of Play,” he said.</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon was first revealed on May 24, 2023, with a teaser trailer revealing that the game would be a sci-fi PvP extraction shooter. </p>



<p>In June 2023, Insider Gaming exclusively reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon’s gameplay loop</a>, including an experimental feature that would see players have an in-game timer controlled by their oxygen supply. </p>



<p>Marathon is scheduled to release in 2025 for the Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to seeing more of Bungie’s Marathon? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Bad Guitar Studio’s Fragpunk is being touted as a game-changer for online shooters. Its console release date is a big talking point for PlayStation and Xbox users, so let’s check out the latest details on the launch.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-new-hero-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fragpunk</a> delivers Indiana Jones-sized Short Rounds with quick battles and ever-changing dynamics. It may be a Hero shooter—taking inspiration from Overwatch and Marvel Rivals—but it has its fresh twists. Shard Cards allow players to customize their playstyle on the fly, midgame with gameplay-altering abilities.</p>



<p>It looks cool, it enjoyed a smooth <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-closed-beta-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed beta</a>, and its PC release is already locked in. But what about if you’re waiting for the Fragpunk console release?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-fragpunk-come-out-on-console">When Does Fragpunk Come Out on Console?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Do you take American Express? Credit to Bad Guitar Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fragpunk’s console release date has been delayed indefinitely until an unspecified date.</strong></p>



<p>The news has shocked players waiting to gear up for Fragpunk on PlayStation and Xbox. The March 6 release date is only happening for PC players now, and the developer has neglected to reveal so much as a vague release window to look forward to.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-has-fragpunk-s-console-release-date-been-delayed">Why Has Fragpunk’s Console Release Date Been Delayed?</h2>



<p><strong>Developer Bad Guitar Studio provided an update on March 4 to explain the delay was due to “console compliance testing” issues.</strong></p>



<p>The explanation came via a March 4 post on the team’s official <a href="https://x.com/PlayFragPunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X social media page</a>.</p>



<p>“During the console compliance testing process, we encountered unexpected technical challenges in optimization and adaptation. Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, no update or timeframe is provided for a Fragpunk console release. All that’s promised is the “Team is working closely with both the Xbox and PlayStation teams to get Fragpunk into your hands as soon as possible.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>A message from FragPunk team about the delay of the launch on console platforms:</span></p></article></div>



<p>Console players who jumped on board early will be compensated at least. Players can claim a ton of engagement rewards, refunds, in-game currency, and much more.</p>
