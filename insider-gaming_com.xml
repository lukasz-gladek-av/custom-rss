<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="114633">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> (GTA 6) is Rockstar Games’ next mainline GTA release and easily one of the most anticipated video games in years. Rockstar itself has stayed mostly quiet since confirming the game is in development, but reporting, leaks, and publisher comments have steadily filled in the gaps around GTA 6’s setting, release window, and gameplay direction.</p>



<p>This hub is where Insider Gaming keeps everything together—what’s confirmed, what’s been reported, what’s changed, and what still isn’t clear—and it’s updated as new information comes in.</p>







<h2 id="h-latest-gta-6-update">Latest GTA 6 Update </h2>



<p><strong>Latest Update (February 6, 2026)</strong></p>



<p>While details surrounding the game’s features have yet to be officially announced, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-marketing-to-start-this-summer-will-have-physical-version/" id="173882">it has been confirmed</a> that the game’s marketing will begin sometime this summer. It was also confirmed that Rockstar is planning to release a physical version of the game. </p>



<p>Also, with generative AI being a heavy talking point in the industry right now, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick said in a recent interview that GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-genai-has-zero-part-in-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t be using GenAI</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-gta-6-stands-right-now">Where GTA 6 Stands Right Now</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Developer: </strong>Rockstar Games</li>



<li><strong>Publisher: </strong>Rockstar Games</li>



<li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S</li>



<li><strong>Status: </strong>In Development</li>
</ul>



<p>Rockstar officially announced GTA 6 in December 2023, with the game’s first trailer amassing over 270 million views on the official Rockstar Games YouTube Channel. Beyond that, however, news has been limited. Fans have received one other trailer as well as some information about the game’s location—Leonida (Florida)—and main characters Jason Duval and the franchise’s first female protagonist Lucia Caminos.</p>

<h2 id="h-gta-6-release-date-what-we-know">GTA 6 Release Date: What We Know</h2>



<h3 id="h-what-s-confirmed">What’s Confirmed</h3>



<p>Rockstar’s latest release date for GTA 6 is November 19, 2026. That release date announcement came in November 2025, when it was revealed that GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was being delayed</a> from its May 26, 2026 release. This was the third announced release for the game after it was originally announced for a fall 2025 launch. That then turned into the May 2026 release that became November 2026.</p>



<h3>Will GTA 6 Be Delayed Again?</h3>



<p>Rockstar and Take-Two Interactive seem adamant on making sure GTA 6 launches on November 19. However, anything is possible with this franchise, and it won’t be released until the developers feel it’s ready. Should any news or rumors come out about the release date, Insider Gaming will have full details. </p>



<h3 id="h-will-gta-6-come-to-pc">Will GTA 6 Come To PC?</h3>



<p>GTA 6 has only been confirmed for a release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. While it won’t come to PC at first launch, it should be expected on the platform at a later date.  </p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-setting-and-map">GTA 6 Setting and Map</h2>



<p>For the first time in two decades, Grand Theft Auto returns to Vice City in GTA 6. But it’s not just Vice City that players will explore. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-gta-6-location-confirmed-so-far-vice-city-included-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game is set in the state of Leonida</a> (Florida), with multiple locations to visit and learn about. </p>



<p>While Vice City is the main locale, there are five other key places in GTA 6. The settings for Grand Theft Auto 6 include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Vice City</strong> – The main location based on Miami, Florida</li>



<li><strong>Leonida Keys</strong> – A tropical archipelago based on the Florida Keys</li>



<li><strong>Grassrivers </strong>– Known as the “untamable jewel”, it’s based on the Florida Everglades</li>



<li><strong>Port Gellhorn</strong> – An area filled with “cheap motels, empty strip malls and shuttered attractions”</li>



<li><strong>Ambrosia – </strong>A town in the middle of Leonida</li>



<li><strong>Mount Kalaga National Park </strong>– Located in the northern part of the state, the park features areas to explore, hunt, and fish.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-how-big-is-the-gta-6-map">How Big Is The GTA 6 Map?</h3>



<p>GTA 6 is set to feature the largest map in the history of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. It’s also expected to be an evolving map that will change overtime, though those reports are unconfirmed as of now. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-gameplay-details">GTA 6 Gameplay Details</h2>



<p>As of February 6, officially gameplay details have yet to be released. All that’s known is that, like past GTA games, it will be an open-world action-adventure game. More details will come as the marketing picks up this summer.</p>



<p>One thing that seems to be confirmed is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-support-will-seemingly-continue-after-gta-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online support</a> will continue after the game’s release. That makes sure that, at least for a little while, longtime players still have something to go to, especially on platforms where the game isn’t launching yet like PC. </p>



<hr>



<h2>Latest GTA 6 Leaks</h2>



<p>With any game as anticipated as the next Grand Theft Auto title, many will look for as much information as possible about the game. That can also lead to leaks making their way out of the studio.</p>



<p>For the most part, however, there hasn’t been much in that sense over the past year or so. Back in 2022 and 2023 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-leaks-online-with-90-gameplay-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there were plenty</a> of leaks from the game, but Rockstar had caught the party responsible. That lead to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hacker-sentenced-for-gta-6-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arion Kurtaj being sentenced</a> for the leaks.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-trailers">GTA 6 Trailers</h2>



<p>There have been two trailers released so far for Grand Theft Auto 6. You can check them both out below.</p>

<h2 id="h-gta-6-screenshots">GTA 6 Screenshots</h2>



<p>In addition to the two trailers, there have been a number of GTA 6 screenshots release to get players accustomed to the area of Leonida along with some of the people you’ll meet along the way. You can check out some of the screenshots below. </p>

<p>Embark Studio’s CEO has revealed the company has two new games in the works after ARC Raiders. </p>



<p>Recently, we were informed about the ARC Raiders’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-budget-was-75-million-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported budget</a> and the amount of profit it was able to make, thanks to those costs. The CEO has now revealed that he can’t give a specific number, but the reported budget is “not too far off.” When discussing the game’s profitability, the CEO revealed that he had two more games in store for us. </p>







<h2 id="h-embark-has-two-more-games-in-development-after-arc-raiders">Embark Has Two More Games in Development After ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund revealed they were working on “two new games”. Söderlund first stated that the money ARC Raiders is generating has provided the company with financial security and employment stability for the devs. It has also enabled the studio to grow, hire more developers, and further develop ARC Raiders and The Finals. </p>



<p>Söderlund added that the studio has “two new games in development,” which they hope to finish at some point. So, overall, the game’s profitability is a “sigh of relief” for any developer, and Söderlund wants to thank the community for supporting and purchasing the game. Hopefully, that continued profits can help them provide “competitive salaries, good bonuses” for the devs that worked on the game, concluded the CEO. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/</link>
            <guid>1428121</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>MindsEye co-CEO Mark Gerhard has alleged in an internal meeting with Build a Rocket Boy employees that they have “caught the guys” who sabotaged MindsEye in an alleged <strong>€</strong>1 million+ campaign.</p>



<p>In the meeting, which took place in late January and was sent to Insider Gaming on the condition that the video not be made public, Gerhard opened the call by saying they “caught the guys who’ve been sabotaging MindsEye.” </p>







<p>He alleged that the company behind the campaign was a “very big American company,” but that “it’s probably not the company you’re thinking of.”</p>



<p>Gerhard alleged that the smear campaign had a budget of over<strong> €1 million spent in 2025</strong>, and was orchestrated by the UK-based company ‘Ritual Network’, who are “a bunch of gangsters”. According to Gerhard, the company has been paying several influencers, including ‘Cyberboi’ (an influencer Gerhard recently threatened with a Cease and Desist via Discord), three journalists, and Build a Rocket Boy employees, to harm MindsEye and Build a Rocket Boy’s reputation.</p>



<p>In the meeting, Gerhard alleges that all of these individuals “will all be served in person, criminal complaints, shortly,” and that the criminal charges are for “espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference.”</p>



<p>“Everyone who’s involved has real problems, including the company behind it. This is the start of our comeback,” he said.</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-ritual-network-denies-the-allegations">Ritual Network Denies The Allegations</h3>



<p>Insider Gaming contacted the UK-based company ‘Ritual Network’ for comment about the allegations, to which they replied:</p>



<p><em><strong>“Ritual Network is a creator support platform and is not involved in the matter you referenced. We are not aware of any legitimate legal action involving Ritual Network and have not been provided with any evidence supporting these claims. Any suggestion that Ritual Network is connected to these allegations is incorrect.”</strong></em></p>



<p>When Insider Gaming asked Build a Rocket Boy for comment on the allegations Mark Gerhard made in the meeting, a Build a Rocket Boy spokesperson said:</p>



<p><em><strong>“We don’t comment on leaked internal communications. Sadly, we do have evidence that there has been a coordinated campaign to purposefully and maliciously damage Build A Rocket Boy’s reputation and undermine confidence in MindsEye. We are working with our legal team and taking steps to address this.”</strong></em></p>



<p>Following the allegations made in the meeting, Gerhard went on to say, “The way we win as a business is through the quality of our games, through the love, the passion that we put into MindsEye.”</p>







<h3 id="h-they-are-going-to-put-the-alleged-members-in-mindseye">They Are Going To Put The Alleged Members In Mindseye</h3>



<p>He continued, “Given this has happened to us, I’m gonna own this narrative. We will use these people, these names and these facts for our own fun. We’re gonna put some of these names into our upcoming spy mission.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that MindsEye’s upcoming spy mission will be a reused version of the now-cancelled ‘Hitman’ mission announced in June 2025, as they <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/build-a-rocket-boy-io-interactive/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/build-a-rocket-boy-io-interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">separate from IOI Partners as its publisher</a>.</p>



<p>“And let’s have some fun with it,” said Gerhard.. “Let’s tell the community the story before it even plays out in court. So, you know, I think this is not us being the victim. </p>



<p>“We’ve taken a couple of punches. We’ve kept turning the other cheek while we got our house in order. And now it’s time to start judoing this right back at them. And, you know, so let’s have some fun with it. At the end of the day, we’re storytellers, we’re game makers.” </p>



<h3 id="h-they-are-tracking-employees">They Are Tracking Employees</h3>



<p>The meeting then moved to Gerhard explaining why Build a Rocket Boy had recently rolled out an “enhanced cybersecurity software” to employees without their knowledge. Insider Gaming understands that this software is called ‘Teramind’, and according to one source, was rolled out to employees’ PCs without their knowledge. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.teramind.co/" id="https://www.teramind.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Teramind</a> is an employee monitoring and cybersecurity platform that tracks user activity, including keystrokes and screen behaviour, in an attempt to track insider threats.</p>



<p>“It leads me to the next point. You know, I know there’s been a rollout of some enhanced cybersecurity software that I think has caused quite a lot of confusion, upset, perhaps even mistrust,” said Gerhard. </p>



<p>He continued to say that the reason why the cybersecurity measures were rolled out was to “see the IT team periodically try and improve our security measures,” and that he hates “the fact that we even have to monitor in the first place. And, you know, I think it goes without saying that we can trust 99.9% of this business. The problem is it’s the one. It’s the 1%. That is the problem. And, you know, the next 90 days for this business are absolutely critical.”</p>



<p>Gerhard continued that he hopes that the cybersecurity measures can be removed from employees’ computers in the next three months, but he takes “full responsibility” for how the software was rolled out and poorly communicated. </p>



<p>The meeting ended with Mark Gerhard saying that he believes February 4th is a “defining chapter” for the game, as the game will run as a live service. But stressed that the call was to share the “huge news” that those involved in the alleged sabotage campaign were caught and will lawyers “have served them or serve in the process of serving them.”</p>



<p>Gerhard concluded, “you guys will get a fair chance to have your game seen and enjoyed by players without the manipulation that has happened and the criminal behavior that has happened. And yeah, please bear with us guys in terms of the additional cybersecurity controls 10:21 It’s only there because of what we’ve been through. And I want to make sure that I can protect you guys going forward. And no one in the team is able to sabotage your work, your careers and your studio” </p>



<p>Insider Gaming asked Build a Rocket Boy for comment on its cybersecurity measures but received the same response as above.</p>

<p>A new announcement from Kojima Productions reveals that Hideo Kojima will not be attending the upcoming GDC Festival of Gaming event. </p>

Many fans have been waiting to hear about both of these games from the man himself. </p>







<h2 id="h-kojima-productions-will-still-attend-gdc-2026">Kojima Productions Will Still Attend GDC 2026</h2>



<p>Kojima Productions has announced via a new post on <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/2019682481327239619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that Hideo Kojima will not be attending GDC 2026.
