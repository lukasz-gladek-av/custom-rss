            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s time for a bit of midweek madness; hopefully, your streak can keep up with today’s NYT Connections puzzle! That’s right, I’m here with the latest NYT Connections hints to get you through this midweek lull and keep pushing towards the inevitable weekend. It’s almost the festive window, but for now, we’ll wait to celebrate until you’ve smashed today’s puzzle.</p>



<p>Read on for today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-26">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 26)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #899:</p>



<ul>
<li>CAN</li>



<li>DEB</li>



<li>COULD</li>



<li>JAN</li>



<li>MAY</li>



<li>KAT</li>



<li>MIGHT</li>



<li>SUE</li>



<li>APR</li>



<li>FLOW</li>



<li>CFO</li>



<li>GOD</li>



<li>IRA</li>



<li>MAR</li>



<li>SEC</li>



<li>TAB</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Words that hedge or allow something, often before a main verb.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Common nicknames that stand in for longer given names.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>You’ll see these on statements, filings, and in boardrooms.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Animals that feel a little backwards,</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 26:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-26-899">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 26 (#899)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CAN, COULD, MAY, MIGHT</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DEB, JAN, KAT, SUE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – APR, CFO, IRA, SEC</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – FLOW, GOD, MAR, TAB</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Leaker Claims Destiny 3 Is In Development]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-3-possible-leak-twitter-bungie/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/leaker-claims-destiny-3-is-in-development.1364971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a <strong>credible leaker on Twitter</strong>, <strong>Destiny 3 is currently in development at Bungie</strong>. While not much is said, it seems <strong>the project is very early</strong> in the process.</p>



<p>The Destiny series is a much newer franchise, starting in 2014. It received plenty of acclaim for its great FPS gameplay and multiplayer aspects. Then, in 2017, Destiny 2 was released and has become one of Bungie’s biggest games. Even today, the game continues to get new updates and expansions, including with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-star-wars-collaboration-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars</a>. </p>



<p>While it hasn’t been without controversy, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-copyright-lawsuit-destiny-2-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent copyright lawsuit</a>, fans still flock to the titles for a good time with friends for raids and such. Bungie is currently working on Marathon, set to release in 2026, but, as one credible source posted on social media, the company is returning to the space opera once again.</p>







<h2 id="h-destiny-3-in-early-development-claims-credible-bungie-leaker">Destiny 3 In Early Development, Claims Credible Bungie Leaker</h2>



<p>The claim in question comes from <strong>Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Colony Deaks</a></strong>. In previous years, the insider has leaked several Bungie-related information regarding Destiny and Marathon. In <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993498863764672752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the tweet</a>, they state,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yes, <strong>Destiny 3 is in extremely early development</strong>. </p>



<p>Some of you may have seen a tweet early this afternoon that mentioned that. We have been sitting on the info for a few weeks now and wanted to wait to talk about this seeing as it is in <strong>such an early state</strong>, and it just sucks to see others post about it carelessly for free internet points. </p>



<p><strong>We plan to share more info in the coming months</strong> as we wait on the larger scale things to develop and take shape. Sit tight.<a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993498863764672752/photo/1"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite their credibility, <strong>there has been no official confirmation from Bungie</strong>, so <strong>take the leak with a big grain of salt</strong>. It’s also important to note that, since the project is claimed to be in early development, there’s no telling just how far it is. </p>



<p>Sometimes, early development is story building or maybe just even a pitch board. Even still, likely, it’s likely that fans won’t hear much about a possible Destiny 3 for a long time, even if the leak is true. Regardless, it would be nice to see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-mobile-game-destiny-rising-announcement-may-arrive-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Destiny</a> done for newer consoles and with all the new advancements.</p>







<p>What do you think of the Destiny 3 leak? Do you think Bungie is working on it? When do you think it’ll come out?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-pc-port-leak-esrb/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-2-pc-port-leaked-ahead-of-announcement.1364950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A <strong>PC port of Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</strong> has <strong>leaked ahead of any official announcement</strong>. The leak comes from <strong>an ESRB rating</strong>, which has been registered for <strong>Windows PC</strong>.</p>







<p>As one of 2025’s best titles, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-script-was-changed-midway-through-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> continues the legacy of the original 2019 Death Stranding. Crafted by Kojima Productions for PlayStation, the ‘Strand’ game has taken players cross-country delivering packages and building back a broken world. The sequel has garnered much acclaim for its storytelling, music, and direction by Hideo Kojima of Metal Gear fame. At The Game Awards 2025, the title is up for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game of the Year</a>, as well as six other categories. While only available for PlayStation 5, it seems it’s coming to PC, if the ESRB is anything to go by.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-pc-port-of-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-has-been-leaked-by-the-esrb">A PC Port of Death Stranding 2: On The Beach Has Been Leaked by the ESRB</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An ESRB rating for Death Stranding 2: On The Beach has emerged online ahead of an official announcement.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As mentioned above, <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41057/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official ESRB site</a> has leaked a <strong>Windows PC version</strong> of <strong>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</strong>. No official announcement of a PC port has come out yet, making this a pretty huge leak. Still, until then, take it with a grain of salt. Its rating, M (Mature), matches its PS5 counterpart. The description for its rating also includes some in-depth references, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-esrb-rating-confirms-a-battle-guitar-melee-weapon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the guitar weapon</a> and robotic samurai. As of writing, the page has not been taken down.</p>



<p>The original Death Stranding didn’t go to PC until July 2020, a few months after its first release. With it being rated, it’s likely that Death Stranding 2 is coming to Windows PC sooner than we thought. Interestingly enough, The Game Awards are in two weeks, so perhaps Kojima was planning to reveal it there. Either way, the leak seems rather legit and, if true, means players will get to play one of the year’s best titles in a whole new way.</p>







<p>What do you think of Death Stranding 2’s PC leak? Do you think it’s legit? When do you think it’ll be announced? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Four iconic NES and Game Boy games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online’s Classics catalog for November 2025. Two of them, in particular, are some deep-cut, difficult titles.</p>







<p>As a benefit of Nintendo Switch Online, the Classics catalog offers many nostalgic games from Nintendo’s past. There are plenty of titles to choose from, like Donkey Kong and Metroid 2: Return of Samus. While the Expansion Pack adds Nintendo 64 titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/luigis-mansion-nintendo-switch-online-halloween-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luigi’s Mansion</a>, there’s still plenty of new additions to the base catalog. Now, there are some iconic games making their way to the Classics lineup that are sure to unlock some fun (and frustrating) memories. </p>



<h2 id="h-battletoads-kid-icarus-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online-tomorrow">Battletoads, Kid Icarus Coming to Nintendo Switch Online Tomorrow</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In the video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wZZI8a4uDI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, we see four nostalgic games coming to the Nintendo Switch Online Classics Catalog for November 2025. Those games are <strong>Battletoads, Ninja Gaiden 2: The Dark Sword of Chaos, Bionic Commando, </strong>and <strong>Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters</strong>. The titles <strong>will be available</strong> starting tomorrow, <strong>November 26th</strong>, for all Nintendo Switch Online players.</p>



<p>If you were an avid Nintendo fan in the 1990s, you know how difficult Ninja Gaiden 2 and Battletoads are. The iconic Turbo Tunnel level in Battletoads has left many with good and bad memories, depending on perspective. For Capcom lovers, Bionic Commando is a welcome sight, as the last time we saw the series was 2009’s controversial reboot. Then, Kid Icarus, who has yet to get another entry since 2012’s Uprising, can now complement the original, which Of Myth and Monsters is a sequel to.</p>







<p>What do you think of the new November 2025 Nintendo Switch Online lineup? Any games you remember from back in the day? Excited to try them out?

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series Casts Euphoria Actor as Lead]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-series-actor-toby-wallace-euphoria/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix%E2%80%99s-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-series-casts-euphoria-actor-as-lead.1364776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The upcoming <strong>Netflix live-action adaptation of Assassin’s Creed</strong> has <strong>cast a co-lead</strong> for the show. Furthermore, it’s an actor whose resume includes projects like <strong>Euphoria </strong>and <strong>The Bikeriders</strong>.</p>







<p>The Assassin’s Creed series of games has been going strong since 2007. Spanning eras of history with action-packed gameplay and gripping story, it’s had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-hits-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a decent streak recently</a>. A film adaptation starring X-Men: First Class’ Michael Fassbender came out in 2016 to negative press. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ordered-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed earlier this year</a>, Netflix is working with Ubisoft to develop a live-action Assassin’s Creed series. Multiple ones are in the works, as revealed in the blog from July, but it seems traction has been gained on at least one of them.</p>



<h2 id="h-toby-wallace-to-co-lead-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-series">Toby Wallace to Co-Lead Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/assassins-creed-toby-wallace-cast-netflix-series-1236628211/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive report from Deadline</a>, <strong>actor Toby Wallace</strong> is <strong>set to co-lead Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series</strong>. While no date or story was announced, it’s stated that <strong>he will be a series regular</strong>. Even more so, the report says that <strong>filming will occur in Italy</strong>, which <strong>may serve as the main setting</strong>.</p>



<p>Toby Wallace is a fairly new actor, only having a few big roles under his belt, like The Bikeriders and Eden. However, the actor is set to star as a series regular in the new season of HBO’s Euphoria. An interesting tidbit is that Wallace will co-lead, so another actor, not yet known, will star alongside him. Given the game’s usage of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-assassins-creed-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">present and past</a>, perhaps another actor will play the ancestor or present-day descendant. In the film, Michael Fassbender played both parts, so maybe the co-lead is a Templar head or another role. Either way, it’ll be interesting to see how the cast, and show, shape up.</p>







<p>What do you think of Toby Wallace’s casting in Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series? Do you think the show will work out? Who do you want to see cast in the series? Any actor in particular?
