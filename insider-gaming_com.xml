<p>Pokémon Day 2026 was full of big announcements, with the most significant being the reveal of the 10th generation, Pokémon Winds and Waves.</p>



<p>As part of the 30th anniversary celebrations, marking three decades since the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Red and Green in Japan, a major showcase on Pokémon Day detailed a wide array of what fans can look forward to.</p>



<p>The first Pokémon Winds and Waves trailer was packed with information, and Insider Gaming has highlighted the main things we learned.</p>

<h3 id="h-new-starter-pokemon">New Starter Pokémon</h3>

<p>One of the biggest standouts from the Pokémon Winds and Waves first trailer was the reveal of three starter Pokémon that players will choose from at the beginning of their journey.</p>



<p>Pokémon does not always reveal the starters immediately when dropping the first tease for a new generation, and doing so this early is eye-catching. However, the trio are already starting to make an impression on fans.</p>



<p>Browt, Pombon, and Gecqua are the three Pokémon available at the start of the journey in Winds and Waves, and while they’re already fully revealed, there’s still plenty of mystery.</p>



<h3 id="h-costumed-pikachu">Costumed Pikachu</h3>



<p>The Pokémon Wind and Waves trailer began by showcasing artwork from the various locations seen in previous games, before a knock on the door from two costumed Pikachu. </p>



<p>It turns out that they weren’t just there for the holiday vibes, as the two costumed Pikachu will appear in Gen 10. The exact version of the costumed Pikachu depends on which game you purchase.</p>



<p>No details have been shared on further details on the costumed Pikachu and how they fit into the game, but more is sure to be revealed soon.</p>

</ul>



<h3 id="h-returning-pokemon">Returning Pokémon</h3>



<p>While Pokémon Wind and Waves will be headlined by a new generation of Pokémon, adding to the already-bloated list of 1025 to find and collect, there will also be returning Pokémon. During the trailer, plenty were shown.</p>



<p>The likes of Wailord, Tangela, Wingull, Sandygast, Tympole, and Duskull were among those seen, which confirms their evolution lines will also feature, meaning there will be a host of familiar faces to encounter on your journey.</p>



<p>More Pokémon<strong> </strong>returns are certain to be shown in the future, and we could also see the debut of new regional forms.</p>



<h3 id="h-island-landscapes">Island Landscapes</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sea and Sky. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pokémon Winds and Waves will be an island-sprawling adventure, similar to what fans experience in Sun and Moon on the Nintendo 3DS, but with the added gem of being an open-world title.</p>



<p>Pokémon has moved away from the traditional linear structure in recent years, debuting a semi-open-world in Pokémon Legends: Arceus before a fully-fledged open-world adventure in Scarlet and Violet, and Winds and Waves will take this up a notch.</p>



<p>Further details on the environment will be revealed in the future, but there are already some stand-out landscapes.</p>



<h3 id="h-underwater-exploration">Underwater Exploration</h3>



<p>Pokémon Winds and Waves, as the name suggests, has big ties to the ocean, so bringing underwater exploration back for the 10th generation of the franchise was a natural step.</p>



<p>Although not explicitly stated to be the case, underwater exploration in Winds and Waves was leaked previously, and a tease toward the end of the trailer heavily suggested it will feature.</p>



<p>The footage showed the camera diving beneath the surface of the waves, with a variety of Pokémon swimming along and walking along the sandy floor.</p>

</ul>



<h3 id="h-switch-2-exclusive">Switch 2 Exclusive</h3>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the trailer confirmed that Pokémon Winds and Waves will be a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, with no mention of the original Switch console.</p>



<p>This was to be expected, considering Pokémon Pokopia is a Switch 2 exclusive, albeit also playable on the original Switch with gameshare, but similar features are unlikely to be present for Winds and Waves.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of time to secure a Switch 2 before Pokémon<strong> </strong>Winds and Waves releases, however.</p>



<h3 id="h-2027-release-window">2027 Release Window</h3>



<p>While there was a lot of expectation that Pokémon Winds and Waves would be released this year, that is not the case, and a tentative 2027 release window has been set.</p>



<p>That would make it a five-year gap between the release of Gen 9, Scarlet and Violet, to Gen 10, the biggest gap between two generations of the Pokémon franchise. However, considering the performance problems Gen 9 had at launch, there’s unlikely to be many complaints.</p>



<p>A more precise release window will be announced in time, and it does leave the door open for Pokémon to drop something else in Fall 2026.</p>

            <guid>1448683</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gray Zone Warfare’s 0.4 update is on the horizon, and Insider Gaming has received a behind-the-scenes look at what’s coming in this supersized overhaul. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/madfinger-games/" id="2643">MADFINGER Games</a> has dubbed the 0.4 update a ‘new game, new experience’, and it’s easy to see why.</p>



<p>From the open-world experience to the weapons you use, and from the in-game bosses to the visual palette, <strong>everything </strong>has been impacted in the 0.4 update, which represents a major turning point for the PvE-first tactical shooter.</p>







<h2 id="h-gray-zone-warfare-faces-immense-changes">Gray Zone Warfare Faces Immense Changes</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gray-zone-warfare/" id="1330">Gray Zone Warfare</a> came out in 2024, emerging to a curious audience that wasn’t really sure what to expect. It began life as an extraction shooter with a twist, adopting an open-world approach that facilitated sandbox-style play. The game’s identity has changed since then, and most recently, MADFINGER branded the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-now-pve-first-tactical-shooter/">a PvE-first tactical open-world shooter</a>.</p>



<p>Since it was released, Gray Zone Warfare has undergone some monumental changes, but the most important updates are yet to come, and that <strong>starts with </strong>the 0.4 patch.</p>



<figure><figcaption>No pun intended, but Gray Zone’s changes are night and day</figcaption></figure>







<p>To give you an idea of what’s coming, here’s a high-level overview of what’s coming or being impacted by the 0.4 update:</p>



<ul>
<li>New onboarding mechanics</li>



<li>New weapons, gear, and weapon skins</li>



<li>New customization elements</li>



<li>Fresh lore and storytelling elements</li>



<li>Updated movement mechanics</li>



<li>New character models, bosses, and allies</li>



<li>Upgraded loot pools</li>



<li>100 new tasks <strong>and </strong>50 <strong>reworked </strong>tasks</li>



<li>Finer optimization and audio tweaks</li>



<li>New progression mechanics and strange ‘mysteries’</li>
</ul>



<p>As you can see, this represents one of the most important updates to hit Gray Zone Warfare since it dropped in April 2024.</p>



<p>The breadth of the game is being blown wide open with 0.4. The 100 new tasks bring the count up to 263, and the world has been made more diverse to accommodate them. MADFINGER will introduce 25 new locations and four new biomes in 0.4, fine-tuning the sandbox vibes of Gray Zone and making things feel denser in the world of Lamang.</p>



<p>MADFINGER’s CEO, Marek Rabas, admitted in a briefing that Gray Zone felt too linear at times, despite boasting a massive open-world map. With that in mind, the team has sharpened – and continues to evolve – the game’s sandbox elements, adding more depth, threats, dynamic events, and mechanics.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Upgraded weather, a day/night cycle, better lighting, and more, and you can see the difference</figcaption></figure>







<p>New players will find it easier to get to grips with Gray Zone Warfare based on the fresh onboarding model and ‘Field Guide’ created to help newcomers. Thanks to a new in-game radio system and tactical screen, players can spend longer in the field, doing and finding more things, and extending their session without needing to dip back to their faction base.</p>



<p>It’s impossible not to be impressed by Gray Zone Warfare’s 0.4 update, but it’s important to stress that this is just another node on a massive roadmap, so there’s more to be excited about.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Winds and Waves was revealed to the world during the Pokémon Day showcase on February 27, including the first look at the Gen 10 starters.</p>



<p>Releasing as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive in 2027, Pokémon Winds and Waves is the tenth generation of the franchise and will bring a heap of new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> into the fray.</p>



<p>While there were no new wild Pokémon revealed in the trailer, a detailed look at the Gen 10 starters was shown, and Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-are-the-pokemon-winds-amp-waves-starters">What Are The Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves Starters?</h2>



<h3 id="h-browt">Browt</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Angry bird. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Browt is a small, angry-looking bird-type Pokémon that serves as the Grass starter in Winds and Waves, standing at a measly 0.3m tall and weighing 3.5kg. It is described as the ‘Bean Chick Pokémon’, with the Overgrow ability.</p>



<p>Bird-like starters are not a new concept for the Pokémon franchise, with Browt joining the likes of Torchic and Rowlet in the category.</p>



<h3 id="h-pombon">Pombon</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Bark. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pombon is a brown, dog-like Pokémon that resembles a pomeranian, though it’s mane has some lion similarities. Pombon is 0.4m tall and weighs 6.7kg. </p>



<p>Described as the “Puppy Pokémon,” Pombon has the Blaze ability, and joins a long list of dog-like Pokémon in the franchise’s history, including Growlithe and Arcanine, who are also Fire-type.</p>



<h3 id="h-gecqua">Gecqua</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dive in. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gecqua is the Water-type starter in Pokémon Winds and Waves, standing at 0.3m tall and weighing 4.3kg. Described as the “Water Gecko Pokémon,” it has the Torrent ability.</p>



<p>Similarities will certainly be made with Treecko, another Gecko-like starter Pokémon from Ruby and Sapphire, but it’s a good choice to fit the environment of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-evolved-forms-of-the-pokemon-wind-amp-waves-starters">Do We Know The Evolved Forms of The Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves Starters?</h2>



<p>No further details are known about the Pokémon Winds and Waves starters, including their evolved forms, and reveals could be hidden until the game releases in 2027.</p>



<p>While there is certainly more to be shown from Pokémon Winds and Waves ahead of release, Pokémon always keeps a tight lid on major reveals like the fully-evolved forms of the starter Pokémon.</p>



<p>Additionally, the mid-evolution lines for the Gen 10 starters are unlikely to be shown until release, and spoilers will be at a minimum as the game is Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, meaning it can’t be datamined.</p>
