<p>In its new financial report, UK-based Dambuster Studios has reported that it is aiming to release Dead Island 3 by Q1/Q2 2028 (April – October 2028).</p>







<p><span>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09140280/filing-history/MzQ5NDAyNTM3OGFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&amp;download=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial report</a>&nbsp;(thanks,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/bogorad222" target="_blank">Timur222</a>), it says that the primary focus for Dambuster Studios is now Dead Island 3, a</span>nd all developers, who currently consist of 194 employees, will be assigned to the project once the Luna and Mac versions of Dead Island 2 are complete.</p>



<p>“Parts of the game [Dead Island 3] are now in early production with feature, character, world, and story design moving at pace,” says the report.</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time that we’ve heard of Dead Island 3 from Dambuster Studios, though.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the studio celebrated 14 years since the original game debuted, with the studio revealing that the second game has accumulated an impressive 20 million players.</p>



<p>The post teased that the “journey” was far from over, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-3-teased-dambuster-new-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accompanied by a photo showing a character leaving LA</a>, suggesting that there will be a new location for the third game.</p>







<p>In July,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-dead-island-2-dev-address-delay-sucked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a former Dead Island 2 developer</a>&nbsp;addressed the calamities caused by the game’s delay, which saw its development cycle pushed out to around&nbsp;a decade, including studio swaps and abandoned deadlines.</p>
