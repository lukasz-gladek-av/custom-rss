<p>Just one day before the theatrical release of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Paramount Pictures has confirmed the next movie in the series. First reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-release-date-2027-1236254778/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 will release in theaters in spring 2027.</p>



<p>No other details about what Sonic the Hedgehog 4 would be about were revealed. The only thing we can guess comes from spoilers of the latest movie, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-credits scene</a> that reveals another new character.</p>



<p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 features the return of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles along with Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik. Joining the cast for the third film is Keanu Reeves who voices Shadow the Hedgehog. And, yes, Shadow does have his gun.</p>



<p>Based on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sonic_the_hedgehog_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">early reviews</a>, the latest movie in the franchise is going to be yet another success. According to Variety, it’s expected to make anywhere from $55-$60 million at North American theaters on opening weekend. The first two movies pulled in roughly $725.4 million.</p>
