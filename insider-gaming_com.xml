<p>Minecraft has been out for over 15 years, and many fans have questioned if the time was right for the game to finally go free-to-play. If you happen to be one of those fans, you’re not going to like the answer.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-wont-go-free-to-play-its-the-best-deal-in-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Minecraft executive producer Ingela Garneij said that neither Microsoft nor Mojang have any plans for the game to go the free-to-play route. </p>



<p>“Yeah, it doesn’t really work with the way we built it,” she said when posed with the question. </p>



<p>Garneij continued: “I mean we built the game for a different purpose. So monetization doesn’t work in that way for us. It’s a purchase of the game and then that’s it. For us it’s important that our game is available for as many people as possible. And so I think that’s a very core value that it should be accessible for everyone. It’s the best deal in the world.”</p>

<p>Minecraft first launched on PC in May 2009 before released a full 1.0 release in November 2011. It debuted on console when it released for Xbox 360 in May 2012 and is now available on every major platform.</p>



<p>Since its launch, the game has sold over 300 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling video games of all time. The game, alongside its developer Mojang, was purchased in 2014 by Microsoft for $2.5 billion.</p>

<p>Just a week before the full Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event on April 2, Nintendo is expected to hold a separate event sometime this week. That’s according to well-known leaker Nate The Hate.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1904275415075606643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> on Monday, Nate The Hate said that he’s “heard there is a Nintendo presentation this week”. He added that he believes it will be on or around Thursday, and that “it’ll be a Direct”.</p>



<p>“I’m not 100% certain on the format at present,” he said.</p>



<p>Also unknown is what type of games will be shown during the event, if it happens. Will it focus exclusively on games releasing for the current Nintendo Switch, or will Switch 2 games be teased or shown as well?</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nintendo for comment on the claims, but the company won’t comment on rumor or speculation.</p>



<p>What do you think about a final Nintendo Direct before the full Switch 2 reveal next week? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is Ubisoft’s second-biggest launch to date, just behind Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.</p>



<p>That’s according to Insider Gaming sources, who have provided data for the last three mainline Assassin’s Creed titles. The information was <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1904177799419634137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted public on my ow</a><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1904177799419634137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">n</a><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1904177799419634137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> X</a> (formerly Twitter) account a few hours ago. </p>



<p>According to our sources, who have obtained the information via Ubisoft’s own tracking tools (and have provided such data on past titles), it shows that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is behind that of Valhalla, but ahead of Odyssey.</p>



<p>Last week, Ubisoft announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-surpasses-odyssey-and-origins-launch-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">past two million players just two days after launch</a> and one million players one day after launch.</p>



<p>According to the data, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla achieved 2.55 million players on its first day, whereas Odyssey achieved just shy of 1M (roughly 430,00 during early access).</p>



<p>At the time of writing (March 24), Shadows is tracking to hit three million players in the coming days. According to its trajectory, Shadows could hit roughly six million players within its first month, but its worth pointing out that the game has released in Q1, compared to other successful Assassin’s Creed games that release in the holiday season.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla did 8M in its first month, whereas Odyssey did 3.4 million. </p>



<p>At the time of writing, Odyssey currently has the most unique players of any Assassin’s Creed title sitting at over 40 million.</p>



<p>As always pointed out online, these are <strong>player numbers and not sales</strong>, but we should here more on the games performance from Ubisoft themselves in the coming months. </p>
