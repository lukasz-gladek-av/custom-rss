<p>ARC Raiders Shrouded Sky update 1.17.0 is now live, and it introduces the new map condition, new ARC enemies, weapon buffs &amp; nerfs, and much more. </p>



<p>Some details of this update have been revealed ahead of its release, including the new map condition that introduces <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hurricane-map-condition-in-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hurricanes</a>. However, the update is much more comprehensive than that, adding new balancing changes for popular weapons, items, and crafting, bug fixes, and much more. Learn everything new in update 1.17.0 below.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-1-17-0">What’s New in ARC Raiders Shrouded Sky Update 1.17.0</h2>



<p>Starting with the highlights, the ARC Raiders Shrouded Sky Update 1.17.0 adds a new Hurricane Map condition, which was mentioned above. There’s a new ARC threat to look out for, with two new unique machines that players can face: the Firefly and the Comet. Additionally, there’s a new project to build a Weather Monitoring System, a Free Raider Deck: Surgeon, and a new area has been uncovered in Dam Battlegroud, the Controlled Access Zone. Lastly, the game has also added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-giving-arc-raiders-players-what-they-want/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facial hair</a> with this update. </p>



<h2 id="h-weapon-and-item-balancing-changes-in-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-1-17-0">Weapon and Item Balancing Changes in ARC Raiders Shrouded Sky Update 1.17.0</h2>



<p>Regarding balancing, the developers have revealed that many players reported a “shadow buff” in update 1.13. The developers fixed it in 1.13.1, but it inadvertently impacted the game’s weapon input buffers. The developers want to fix that now while maintaining some middle ground between what already exists. The developers are also looking to balance between low-tier and high-tier weapons. The balancing changes have been made to the following weapons: Stitcher, Kettle, Venator, Jupiter, and Aphelion.</p>



<p>Additionally, there are changes to Item &amp; Crafting, tons of content &amp; bug fixes, and an update to Anti-Cheat that players can check out in the patch notes below: </p>

<h2>Anti-Cheat</h2>



<blockquote>
<p>When we shared our last update about tackling unfair play, we didn’t fully convey the complexity and scale of what goes into cheat detection. Our defenses operate on multiple levels: some checks are simple and definitive, while others are behavioral and data-driven and evolve over time. We also leverage broad gameplay telemetry and machine learning techniques to spot patterns that aren’t obvious at first glance. These methods take longer to develop, must adapt as game systems change, and don’t always offer instant certainty the way blunt software detections can.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve recently taken action against different exploits and we are further tightening our rules and stepping up enforcement. Serious infractions now carry stricter consequences. Strong detections will receive permanent bans right off the bat, while others will receive a temporary suspension and a single chance to correct the behavior. Recent updates to Family Sharing have strengthened our ability to curb misconduct and streamlined the removal of bad actors from the game. We are preparing to launch a systematic manual review of ban appeals. The game is young and the volume of telemetry is enormous, but this process ensures every case is handled with care as we continue to learn quickly and invest heavily in the precision of our enforcement tools.</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Shrouded Sky update for ARC Raiders is here, and there’s a lot to unpack. From the new Hurricane Map Condition to the two new ARC threats, there’s a heap of content to explore. However, one of the highlights is the brand new Project, the Weather Monitor System.</p>



<p>Shani needs you to help her build the system so Speranza isn’t caught off guard by weather anomalies like the Hurricanes in the future. Don’t worry, it’s not all done out of the kindness of your heart, as there are plenty of rewards on offer too. </p>







<p>If you want to know what items to look out for on your next raid, then you’re in the right place. Follow this guide to see every requirement and reward tied to the Weather Monitor System Project in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, along with how long you have to complete it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-the-arc-raiders-weather-monitor-system-project">How To Complete The ARC Raiders Weather Monitor System Project</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The first stage. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five stages to the Weather Monitor System Project in ARC Raiders, with each one having four requirements to fulfil.</strong></p>



<p>Frustratingly, you cannot cycle through the stages to see what you’ll need down the line, and since the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shrouded Sky update</a> is so fresh, only the first stage will be viewable for many. However, some raiders are already making swift work of the Project, and they’ve shared the requirements for each stage—as well as the rewards.</p>



<p>As more stages are unveiled by the fanbase, Insider Gaming will be quick on the trigger to update the article.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hurricane-map-condition-in-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/hurricane-map-condition-in-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hurricane Map Condition, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>With that said, here’s every stage of the Weather Monitor System Project, including the requirements as well as the rewards:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Project Stage</th><th data-align="center">Project Requirements</th><th data-align="center">Project Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 1: Atmospheric Pressure</td><td data-align="center">– 25x Plastic Parts<br>– 15x Metal Parts<br>– 5x ARC Alloy<br>– 3x Oil</td><td data-align="center">– 5x Durable Cloth<br>– 5x Great Mullein<br>– 5x Antiseptic<br>– 3x Vita Shot</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 2: Sunlight</td><td data-align="center">– 1x Snitch Scanner<br>– 3x Wires<br>– 3x Sensors<br>– 1x Comet Igniter</td><td data-align="center">– 10x Processor<br>– 5x Advanced Electrical Components<br>– 3x Zipline<br>– 1x Raider Hatch Key</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 3:</td><td data-align="center">—</td><td data-align="center">—</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 4:</td><td data-align="center">—</td><td data-align="center">—</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 5:</td><td data-align="center">—</td><td data-align="center">—</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Project Completion</td><td data-align="center">Complete all 5 Stages</td><td data-align="center">– Anemometer Backpack Charm<br>– 250x Raider Tokens</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-arc-raiders-weather-monitor-system-project-end">When Does The ARC Raiders Weather Monitor System Project End?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Is it worth it? Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, there is no expiry date on the Weather Monitor Display Project in ARC Raiders.</strong></p>







<p>That means that, theoretically, you can take as long as you’d like to grind through the Project and earn the rewards. It’s in line with the ongoing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy Display Project</a>, which also carries over progress between the Expedition resets. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders Map Condition Tracker</a></li>
</ul>



<p>However, that doesn’t mean that an end date won’t be added to the Project in the future. It could be months away yet, but it might be best not to leave it too late, especially if you’re interested in that bulk of Raider Tokens.</p>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 24, 2026, Quordle is the #1491 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>

<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games because it requires you to guess four words at once correctly, and you can do so on the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You are shown four equal lines reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-quordle-daily-game">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 25.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>

<li>Food</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-contexto-hints-for-today-february-24-2026">Contexto Hints For Today, February 24, 2026</h2>
