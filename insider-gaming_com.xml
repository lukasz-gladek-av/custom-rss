<p>It has been reported that Troy Baker, one of the industry’s most sought-after talents, will return to work under Neil Druckmann on whatever comes next at Naughty Dog. Baker has been in bed with ND since 2013’s The Last of Us, and the developer is unwilling to part ways with the superstar VA just yet.</p>



<p>In an interview with GQ, Troy Baker discussed his recent ventures. In one segment, he promised to return to work with Naughty Dog on Druckmann’s new project, whatever that may be.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-always">‘Always’</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/troy-baker-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with GQ</a>, it was reported that Neil Druckmann, the creator of The Last of Us, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In a heartbeat I would always work with Troy</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was quoted alongside a report that Baker <strong>will </strong>return to Naughty Dog to play a role in Druckmann’s next project, which for now remains under wraps.</p>



<p>It has been an uncharacteristically quiet year for Troy Baker, but he is playing the chief role in the upcoming Indiana Jones: The Great Circle, which will be released on December 6. He also had a spot in Arkham Shadow, playing Joker.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, I caught up with Troy Baker and talked about a project away from video games. He provided his vocal talents to James Cox for an audiobook, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-troy-baker-james-cox-grand-theft-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covering ‘Grand Theft AI’</a>, a cyberpunk novel of epic proportions.</p>



<p>It isn’t clear what Neil Druckmann’s next game looks like, but in 2025, Baker will surface in Ken Levine’s Judas, a spiritual successor to BioShock and a long-awaited first-person title.</p>



<p>What do you think Neil Druckmann’s next project looks like at Naughty Dog? Are we talking about another game set in The Last of Us’ universe, or could it be something else entirely? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/where-can-you-play-path-of-exile-2-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>While I primarily play on PC, like many other ARPG fans, the genre is growing on other systems, too. You can now play some of the best titles in the genre on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, including Path of Exile and Diablo IV. But what about the upcoming PoE2? What are the Path of Exile 2 platforms for Early Access? Here’s what you need to know to prepare for the monolithic ARPG!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-systems-is-path-of-exile-2-releasing-on">What Systems is Path of Exile 2 Releasing On?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-path-of-exile-2-early-access-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access release day</a>, you can play Path of Exile 2 on PC (Steam and Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. On PC, you can buy a supporter pack ranging in price from $30 to nearly $500, depending on where you purchase. More options are available on the Grinding Gear Games’ official website, all offering game keys. But if you’re playing the ARPG on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, then you can scoop up one of the multiple supporter packs, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Path of Exile 2 Early Access Supporter Pack – $30</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lord of Ogham Supporter Pack – $60</strong></li>



<li><strong>King of the Faridun Supporter Pack – $100</strong></li>



<li><strong>Thamaturge of the Vaal Supporter Pack – $150</strong></li>



<li><strong>Warlord of the Karui Supporter Pack – $220</strong></li>



<li><strong>Liberator of Wraeclast Supporter Pack – $370</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Prices will vary depending on your platform, region, and associated taxes.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-path-of-exile-2-be-free-to-play-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s">Will Path of Exile 2 Be Free to Play on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>While the full 1.0 launch of Path of Exile 2 will be a free-to-play experience available to anyone who wishes to download and enjoy the game, the current Early Access launch for PoE2 is a paid endeavor. If you want access, you must purchase one of the supporter packs mentioned earlier, all of which include a key to the early release of the ARPG. These packs, once again, range in price, with the cheapest being $30. </p>



<p>Now, if you’re a long-time fan of the ARPG genre, eating up all of the grind you can, $30 isn’t a high asking price. Many people wind up playing PoE for hundreds or thousands of hours.</p>



<p>Where do you intend to play Path of Exile 2? Let us know in the comments below, or start a discussion about ARPGs and PoE2 on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will release in March 2025. That’s according to the latest rumors published by popular Nintendo news channel Nintendo Prime.</p>



<p>According to the latest rumors, which the channel found on Chinese forum <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5103984429499076#comment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Weibo</a> and the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-speculation-thread-st-this-is-furukawa-president-of-nintendo.7757/page-2146#post-1426497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famiboards gaming forum</a>, Nintendo will officially reveal its next system in January 2025 followed by a March launch. </p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>Nintendo has not responded to requests for comment as of publishing. As always, until something is made official or Insider Gaming can independently confirm the details, please take all rumors with a grain of salt. That said, this isn’t the first time a March 2025 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-reportedly-headed-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date has been rumored</a> for the follow-up console. Also, the last update from the company is that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console will be announced</a> before April.</p>



<p>As far as what to expect with the next Nintendo Switch console, Nintendo confirmed that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-backwards-compatible/">will have backwards compatibility</a> as well as feature the same Nintendo Switch Online service that players currently have. </p>



<p>Other rumors about the console include magnetic Joy-Con <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controllers with additional buttons</a> as well as support for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">up to 4K resolution</a> when docked. It’s also been claimed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-get-aaa-games-at-launch-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new system will get AAA games</a> around its launch, something the current Nintendo Switch didn’t have. </p>



<p>None of those reports have been confirmed, either. </p>



<p>Do you think the Nintendo Switch 2 will release in March 2025? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

<p>The year is nearly over, but we still have a handful of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/three-upcoming-free-to-play-games-may-dominate-the-end-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free-to-play titles</a> launching in December that promise hundreds of hours of gameplay between them. One of the biggest upcoming launches is Path of Exile 2, an ARPG that rivals Diablo IV in nearly every way. If you’re excited, join the club, but first, check out what’s inside each of the Path of Exile 2 supporter packs on Steam!</p>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-early-access-supporter-pack">Path of Exile 2 – Early Access Supporter Pack</h2>



<p>If you want access to Path of Exile 2 during its Early Access period, supposedly, you’ll have to buy the Early Access Supporter Pack for <strong>$30</strong> to receive a key ahead of the game’s free-to-play launch.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Path of Exile 2 Early Access Key</strong></li>



<li><strong>Extended Digital Soundtrack</strong></li>



<li><strong>300 Points</strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-lord-of-ogham-supporter-pack">Path of Exile 2 – Lord of Ogham Supporter Pack</h2>



<p>If you’re the type of player who knows they’ll wind up playing Path of Exile 2 for many tens of hours, then dropping the equivalent of a full price retail game on the ARPG with the Lord of Ogham Supporter Pack for <strong>$60</strong> doesn’t seem like a bad choice. You’ll receive the following:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Path of Exile 2 Early Access Key</strong></li>



<li><strong>Extended Digital Soundtrack</strong></li>



<li><strong>600 Points</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lord of Ogham Supporter Forum Title</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lord of Ogham Portrait Frame</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lord of Oham Armour Pack</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lord of Oham Back Attachment</strong></li>



<li><strong>Baby Crowbell Pet</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Rust King Portal Effect</strong></li>



<li><strong>Iron County’s Zqeihander</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lord of Ogham Kiwi Pet</strong></li>



<li><strong>Commemorative Hillock Statue Hideout Decoration</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2>Path of Exile 2 – King of Faridun Supporter Pack ($100)</h2>



<p>On Steam, the most expensive Path of Exile 2 Supporter Pack is the King of Faridun bundle for $100. It includes everything the two previous editions offer, plus more. It’s for the supporter who knows they’ll continue playing PoE2 for years to come and wants to pump up developer Grinding Gear Games with funds for future development!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Path of Exile 2 Early Access Key</strong></li>



<li><strong>Extended Digital Soundtrack</strong></li>



<li><strong>1000 Points</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lord of Ogham Supporter Forum Title</strong></li>

<li><strong>Tyranny’s End Spear Skin</strong></li>



<li><strong>Faridun’s Glory Bow Skin</strong></li>



<li><strong>Deshret’s Blessing Level-Up Extra Effect</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, the official GGG website features additional Supporter Packs for sale, ranging in price from $160 to nearly $500 for a single bundle. These packs include in-game goodies, physical items like a sweater and artbook, and additional copies of the game so that you can hand some out to your friends!</p>

<p>You’ll find all manner of weapons throughout the Zone, and while many of them come to you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-to-do-with-broken-weapons-in-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broken and worn</a>, they’re still viable if you don’t mind spending a little money on repairs. But sometimes, it’s not worthwhile. It’s better to stick with what you know, what you’ve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-upgrade-weapons-in-stalker-2-full-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent time upgrading and using frequently</a>. Yes, the game does have “meta” weapons that excel, whereas others falter. Here is an overview of the best weapons in Stalker 2 for every situation!</p>



<h2 id="h-stalker-2-s-best-weapons-for-every-encounter">Stalker 2’s Best Weapons for Every Encounter</h2>



<p>It’s life or death in the Zone, and a competent weapon that’s well-maintained, upgraded, and customized with a few worthwhile attachments that you’re comfortable using makes a difference. Of course, not any old weapon will suffice. You want the meta. You want the rifle that’ll keep you alive in mid-range encounters, the sniper rifle for long-range precision, and the up-close-and-personal shotgun to clear abandoned labs. These are the best weapons in Stalker 2 that I recommend for every player:</p>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Best All-Around Weapon</strong>: The AKM-74S is an easy to acquire assault rifle with one of the most common ammo types available in the Zone. With a relatively low overall weight, manageable recoil, and relatively stable accuracy across mid and long-range engagements, you’ll find the starting AKM a stalwart companion through most of the game.</li>



<li><strong>Best CQB Weapon</strong>: The Ram-2 is not only a gorgeous bullpup-style shotgun with multiple barrelts but also a powerful one capable of clearing a hallway with ease. It’s a large weapon, taking up a 5×2 slot in your inventory, but that space isn’t going to waste. With high damage and rate of fire, the Ram-2 offers the discerning Stalker a chance at toppling enemies who dare to enter your personal bubble.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Best Pistol</strong>: Skif’s Pistol, yes, is a starting weapon and a PM. It’s not the most powerful handgun in the game, a title most will agree goes to the revolver, but your first handgun is special. It’s lightweight, highly customizable and upgradeable, versatile, and its ammunition—9x18mm PST—is readily available from the jump.</li>



<li><strong>Best Customizable Rifle</strong>: The AR416 feels like it should be a rare assault rifle, but it’s not. You can find it on Ward Soldiers at the Laboratory in Garbage, you’ll also occasionally receive one as a quest reward, such as during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-the-poppy-field-in-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Fields</a>. </li>



<li><strong>Best Sniper Rifle</strong>: The M701 Super shines as one of the most attractive and powerful sniper rifles in the Zone. It’s a bolt-action precision rifle that’s powerful, heavy, and expensive. Oh, and you can only upgrade it at Harpy in Yaniv Station, making it a bit of a unicorn. But for all of its downfalls, which aren’t really that bad, the M701 will serve you well in clearing enemy forces from afar.</li>
</ul>
