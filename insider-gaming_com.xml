<p>The Splinter Cell movie that was slated to star Tom Hardy has been cancelled, according to one of the film’s producers.</p>



<p>Twelve years after it was first reported as in development, producer Basil Iwanyk was asked about the state of the movie. In his response to <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/splinter-cell-tom-hardy-movie-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, Iwanyk confirmed that the movie wasn’t happening due to not being able to “get it right”.</p>



<p>“That movie would have been awesome… Just couldn’t get it right, script-wise, budget-wise,” Iwanyk said. “But it was going to be great. We had a million different versions of it, but it was going to be hardcore and awesome. </p>



<p>“That’s one of the ones that got away, which is really sad.”</p>



<p>The news of the movie’s demise shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Since being announced over a decade ago, there had been nary an update on it’s status. It’s likely that most fans that heard about it complete forgot by now.</p>



<p>If the cancellation of the Splinter Cell movie has you upset, however, don’t be too upset. Ubisoft is continuing work on its remake of the first Splinter Cell, which is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently targeting for a 2026 release date</a>.</p>

<p>Obsidian Entertainment, known for fantastical RPGs like The Outer Worlds and Pillars of Eternity, returns in 2025 with a first-person RPG that many believe may rival The Elder Scrolls. That may feel a little generous, but if you’ve ever played Pillars of Eternity, then you know the team is adept at world-building and lore, making for a truly unique and captivating role-playing game experience. But for now, we must wait and prepare. To that end, here’s your first look at the Avowed system requirements!</p>



<h2 id="h-these-are-the-avowed-pc-system-requirements">These Are the Avowed PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>We’re still months from the release of Avowed, but Obsidian Entertainment finally unveiled the game’s system requirements ahead of time. Overall, they’re relatively approachable, especially on the low end, but man, storage space requirements have quickly ballooned in size in recent years. You’ll soon need an entire SSD for a single game, just you wait and see!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements-nbsp">Minimum System Requirements&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 with updates</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 2600 / Intel i5-8400</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: AMD RX 5700 / Nvidia GTX 1070 / Intel Arc A580</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 75 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-what-to-play-while-we-wait-for-avowed">What to Play While We Wait for Avowed</h2>



<p>Seeing as Avowed doesn’t release until February 18, we still have a few months until we can dive into the fantasy world. That’s plenty of time to beat another large-scale RPG or two in the meantime. To help you prepare, we recommend the following RPGs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hogwarts Legacy</strong></li>



<li><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Outer Worlds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pillars of Eternity</strong></li>



<li><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dragon’s Dogma 2</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The Outer Worlds doesn’t take too long to complete, but you can easily spend hundreds of hours exploring every nook and cranny in all of the other recommendations!</p>

<p>Speaking of the upcoming RPG, according to Phil Spencer, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-wasnt-due-to-game-quality-phil-spencer-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed wasn’t delayed due to the game’s quality</a> but for other reasons instead!</p>
