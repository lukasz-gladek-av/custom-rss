<p>PGA Tour 2K25 is 2K’s newest golf sequel, and its Xbox Game Pass and status is up in the air—like a well-struck golf shot. That’s why we’re here today to let you know if you need to pay your green fee, or if this one’s on the house.</p>



<p>The golf game market is hotter than it’s ever been. EA Sports PGA Tour is the up-and-coming Pro making a big impression, but the PGA Tour 2K series is the evergreen veteran of the links. Take-Two’s newest golf title is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a>—carrying on the company’s trend of biannual releases.</p>



<p>2K’s franchise has a healthy following of fans—myself included—but let’s see if the audience can grow thanks to the Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pga-tour-2k25-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play PGA Tour 2K25 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A warm welcome indeed. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>PGA Tour 2K25 isn’t available as a day-one release on Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</strong></p>



<p>Consider <a href="https://pgatour.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PGA Tour 2K25</a> a private membership. Not a single PGA Tour 2K25 trailer or prerelease gameplay video has made any mention of the sports title coming to Game Pass. It’s hardly a shock though. Few (if any) sports titles come to Game Pass on day one. I also can’t recall any 2K sports title doing this either.</p>



<p>You must go through each <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pga-tour-2k25-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25 Edition</a> and agonize over which one you want. Each Edition is TaylorMade for a different type of PGA Tour 2K fan. You must consider if you want the base game, extra content on top, or everything and more!</p>



<h2 id="h-will-pga-tour-2k25-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will PGA Tour 2K25 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Historical data suggests PGA Tour 2K25 isn’t coming to Xbox Game Pass later on.</strong></p>



<p>A quick browse of recent history shows neither PGA Tour 2K23 or 2K21 have come to Game Pass. I’m not sure if it has anything to do with it, but you <em>can </em>play EA Sports Tour on Game Pass. There might be some exclusivity rights there, maybe?</p>



<p>Either way, if you’re hoping to play PGA Tour 2K25 through Xbox Game Pass, my advice would be to not sit around in the grandstand and wait for Game Pass to take the first shot.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Peter is Not Gone’ in Spider-Man 3, Lowenthal Reveals]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/yuri-lowenthal-spider-man-3-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98peter-is-not-gone%E2%80%99-in-spider-man-3-lowenthal-reveals.1116834/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/yuri-lowenthal-spider-man-3-claim/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>At a recent benefit held to fundraise for those impacted by the LA wildfires, Yuri Lowenthal caught up with one publication about Spider-Man 3. The benefit – MultiCon – was held on February 22 and featured guests such as Rob Liefeld, Kevin Smith, and Seth Green, and Lowenthal, who has played Peter Parker since 2018’s Spider-Man, was also in attendance.</p>



<p>He couldn’t say much, but what he confirmed was that Peter Parker is not gone in Spider-Man 3 and will still play a pivotal part in the campaign, despite what the ending of Spider-Man 2 might suggest.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-og-remains">The OG Remains</h2>



<p>In a report published by <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/spider-man-3-ps5-game-story-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, it was confirmed by Yuri Lowenthal himself that Peter Parker is not ‘relegated to the couch’ in Spider-Man 3, which will be developed by Insomniac Games:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There are very few things that I can say about this game, but you have somehow landed on the one thing that I can answer, and that’s that, yes, Peter is not gone. He will be a part of the next game and he won’t be relegated to the couch, I promise.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The running theory is that Spider-Man 3 will have <strong>three </strong>protagonists, much like 2013’s Grand Theft Auto 5. It’s envisioned that players will be able to utilise the live switching mechanic introduced in Spider-Man 2 to flick between these heroes at the press of a button and that the third playable character will be Cindy Moon, otherwise known as Silk.</p>



<p>Spider-Man 2’s fluidity between protagonists allowed players to soak up a dual perspective, with each protagonist – Peter Parker and Miles Morales – boasting unique abilities and aesthetics.</p>



<p>One protagonist is the norm, two is rarer but not unheard of, and three protagonists is downright nuts for some gamers to comprehend, but in an expansive open-world hero title like Spider-Man, it just might work. The third game has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-creative-director-teases-a-third-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">been teased since 2023</a>, so it could be revealed soon. Could three be the magic number?</p>



<p>Do you want to see Silk become a playable character in Spider-Man 3? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[OpTic Texas Plummets After Not Winning a Map in a Month]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-plummets-map-win/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/optic-texas-plummets-after-not-winning-a-map-in-a-month.1116831/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-plummets-map-win/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty League’s second Minor tournament is approaching, but it seems not every team is prepared for it. It has been a month since OpTic Texas won a single map in competitive play, scoring 1 – 3 in a loss against the Carolina Royal Ravens at Major I in Madrid.</p>



<p>This poor losing streak, which now sits at zero maps won to nine lost, comes after Pred rejoined the roster, which many fans are now starting to judge as an erroneous action. Up next, OpTic Texas will face the Vegas Falcons at Major II, and that has the Green Wall <strong>concerned</strong>.</p>



<p>Will the Vegas Falcons’ first win come over OpTic Texas, the reigning Call of Duty League Championship winner?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-mighty-have-fallen">The Mighty Have Fallen</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas went into Major I as the favourite to win, but the team got passed from pillar to post, being pushed into the lower bracket by the Heretics and then being ejected entirely by the Carolina Royal Ravens. It was Atlanta FaZe that ultimately lifted the trophy in Madrid.</p>



<p>Nobody could have predicted what would happen thereafter.</p>



<p>OpTic Texas has failed to win a map in three fixtures, a fact that is having a visible impact on the squad. Following a loss against Atlanta FaZe on February 15, OpTic’s Dashy seized his camera and tried snapping it. In terms of map records, OpTic Texas isn’t alone at the bottom of the table.</p>



<p>The Vegas Falcons are yet to win a single match, and so far this stage, the team has secured a map record of 2 – 12. Similarly, LAG M8 has produced a map record of just 3 – 9 with zero game wins.</p>



<p>In a dire spot, the Vegas Falcons have found themselves the laughingstock of the Call of Duty League. They’ve never won more than a single map in any series, and they haven’t come close to producing a single CDL point in the pro standings.</p>



<p>This past week of competitive play was a boon for some teams, though. The LA Thieves produced a 3 – 0 record, beating Carolina, Vegas, and Ultra without too many issues. In stark contrast to OpTic Texas, LAT secured that win record while dropping just <strong>one map</strong>.</p>



<p>Surge has also won every fixture so far in the run-up to the Major II tournament in Texas. It was just a couple of weeks back that Surge announced the signing of Neptune, an appropriately-named player who stepped up to replace Hicksy. He has proven to be a star player already, with the team walking all over Cloud9, LAG M8, and even Atlanta FaZe, the Minor I and Major I champions.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-to-warzone-og-march-2020-version/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/verdansk-will-return-to-warzone-as-%E2%80%98pretty-much-the-og-march-2020-version%E2%80%99-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1116828/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-to-warzone-og-march-2020-version/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been claimed on social media by a prominent Call of Duty leaker that Verdansk will return to Warzone with Season 03 of Black Ops 6. It was also mentioned that it’ll be ‘pretty much the OG March 2020 version’, which is insane news for Warzone fans the world over.</p>



<p>It has been more than four years since we lost that version of Verdansk, with an alternate rendition taking over the game for Black Ops Cold War before it was replaced entirely by Caldera in December 2021.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-verdansk-details">New Verdansk Details</h2>



<p>On X, ‘TheGhostofHope’ <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1893792956227698707" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted a series of details</a> that gel with what we already know about the return of Verdansk.</p>



<p>It was claimed:</p>



<ul>
<li>Will launch with Season 3 of BO6</li>



<li>It is pretty much the OG March 2020 version</li>



<li>Train Station interior will be closed</li>



<li>Interior of Stadium will be open BUT roof will be closed</li>



<li>The Train returns</li>



<li>No fast travel subway system</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s back to basics with Verdansk, but that’s what fans have been asking for since the map disappeared in 2021. No other map – aside from the smaller maps like Rebirth Island and Fortune’s Keep – has come close to Verdansk over the last few years.</p>



<p>Warzone <strong>started </strong>with this map in March 2020, when Call of Duty: Warzone was released at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. It became an overnight sensation, pulling in tens of millions of users with the utmost ease.</p>



<p>We published a report in January outlining the return of Verdansk in Season 03 of Black Ops 6, and TheGhostofHope’s claim puts us one step closer. In August 2024, Activision took to the stage at COD NEXT to announce the impending return of Verdansk, but few details were shared.</p>



<p>Are you excited for the imminent return of Verdansk in Warzone? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mecha-break-open-beta-hits-317-000-concurrent-players-on-its-first-day.1116672/</guid>

<p>The Mecha BREAK Open Beta launched earlier today and has already seen over 300,000 concurrent players try the game.</p>



<p>Mecha BREAK see’s players take control of giant mechs in a third-personal multiplayer shooter. The game features three unique game modes filled with high-octane ground and aerial combat.</p>



<p>Announced on February 21, the game will have its first major invitational in China in March, where teams will battle it out for a grand prize.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">play the open beta on steam for free here</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Scott Robertson recently got hands-on with the game at a behind-the-scenes event, where he sat down with Amazing Seasun Games CEO, Kris Kwok, so keep your eyes peeled on the website for that interview later this week.</p>



<p>“In the aftermath of the Catastrophe, a mysterious carbon-silicon mineral known as Corite has breathed new life into Earth’s depleted energy industry. But its gift came with a curse — its pathogenic nature and uncontrollable spread are slowly devouring the last habitable spaces on the planet. Within 30 years, the heavily polluted Marcens Zones threaten to engulf the entire globe, pushing humanity to the brink of extinction,” the game description reads.</p>



<p>It continues, “Amid the chaos of this catastrophic event, you find yourself thrust into the role of an unlikely hero — a pilot of the third-generation BREAK Striker. Now, you must navigate an uncertain path, one fraught with peril and discovery. But you are not alone. A secretive organization known as S.H.A.D.O.W. has extended an offer, one that could change the fate of both you and the world.”</p>



<p>“Assault, melee, sniper, reconnaissance, support… Choose your preferred mech and take on enemies across three distinct combat modes: 3v3 Deathmatch, 6v6 Hero Shooter, or PvPvE Extraction Shooter.”</p>
