<p>The Nintendo Direct event to reveal all of the features of the Nintendo Switch 2 takes place on April 2, but that doesn‚Äôt mean rumors aren‚Äôt going to stop spreading before then. In a new claim by a known leaker, the Nintendo Switch 2 will have a unique feature that connects to the current-gen Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://youtu.be/l2QbjzzdVj8?si=TzuZlQutPSLgmFJk&amp;t=546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2‚Äôs mysterious ‚ÄúC‚Äù button will have multiple functions. One specific function, however, is that it will let you connect the new system to an original Nintendo Switch. This will reportedly allow players to use the Switch 1 as a controller or screen for Switch 2 games.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the only function, or it will have more,‚Äù eXtas1s said via translation. </p>



<p>He then went on to give an example of how this would work based on what his sources explained to him. Using Mario Kart 9 as an example, the Switch 2 user will be able to hit the ‚ÄúC‚Äù button and connect to the Switch 1, letting it then be used as another controller for the game. That would also allow, in this example, for Mario Kart 9 to be played on the Switch 1 screen to avoid split-screen play.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs unclear what‚Äîor how many‚Äîgames this feature would work with.</p>



<p>As with all rumors, please take this with a grain of salt unless Insider Gaming can independently verify the information or it is confirmed by Nintendo itself.</p>
