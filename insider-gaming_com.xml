<p>It’s finally time for PS5 owners to book their ticket to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The title has so far been kept from the blue brand’s main console, but now MSFS 2024 has a PlayStation 5 release date, along with complete start times.</p>



<p>A one-way ticket to the sky beckons for PS5 players. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> took off just over one year ago, and boarded with plenty of Xbox and PC passengers on board. The flight-sim title is the latest in the franchise, and it’s going to be another instance of ‘Xbox Game Studios’ being bizarrely plastered all over a PS5 game.</p>



<p>Here are the official Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 release details for PS5.</p>

<figure><figcaption>On plane. Credit to Xbox Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launches worldwide for PlayStation 5 owners on December 8.</strong></p>







<p>It’s nearly a year to the day since MSFS 2024 debuted on Xbox and PC: November 19, 2024, to be exact. But now it’s time for MSFS to add its name alongside Forza Horizon 5, Gears of War: Reloaded, and the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved as Xbox hits to make the jump to the blue side of life.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-on-playstation-5-have-early-access">Does Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 On PlayStation 5 Have Early Access?</h2>



<p><strong>The PS5 release of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 comes with early access for those who pre-order the Deluxe, Aviator Edition, or Premium Editions.</strong></p>



<p>Consider this the gaming equivalent of securing priority boarding on a flight. Early access is out—meaning you don’t need to wait until December 8—and there are more details below on dates and times.</p>



<h2 id="h-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-start-times">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024’s first official launch time is on December 3 at 5 AM PST, with its default release arriving on December 8 at 5 AM PST.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Was The Most-Searched Game of 2025, Despite Dropping in October]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-most-searched-game-2025-drop-october/</link>
            <guid>1373998</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Google Trends has just published its Year in Search report for 2025, and it uncovers a juicy tidbit about Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders, the all-new extraction adventure that has taken the gaming world by storm in the last few weeks. The game was released on October 30 to an overwhelmingly positive reception and has been on the upswing ever since.</p>



<p>Google’s new report revealed that, in 2025, ARC Raiders was the <strong>most-searched game</strong>, despite being released at the tail end of October. It beat all comers to hold the top spot, which is indicative of the sheer amount of interest around this game.</p>







<p>ARC Raiders has been scoring high in the review stakes, securing award nominations, and holding a consistent audience of hundreds of thousands of concurrent players. It’s arguably the most accessible extraction game ever made, and it has turned the tide for a genre otherwise thought of as being ‘too challenging’ for the average gamer.</p>



<p>That’s partly why ARC Raiders was the most-searched game in 2025 on Google, which was confirmed in a recent report published by the Google Trends team.</p>



<p>Here’s <a href="https://trends.withgoogle.com/year-in-search/2025/">the full list</a>, and it might surprise you where certain games fall:</p>



<ol>
<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Strands</li>



<li>Split Fiction</li>



<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li>



<li>Path of Exile 2</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto 6</li>



<li>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>Roblox</li>
</ol>



<p>It might come as a shock to see GTA 6 so far down the line, but that’s mostly because it’s a case of gamers biding their time until news surfaces. There’s almost nothing to search for otherwise related to Grand Theft Auto 6. On the other hand, ARC Raiders has mission guides, item location tips, loadout walkthroughs, and more, all of which are being eagerly sought out by players far and wide.</p>







<p>It’s a well-deserved accolade for ARC Raiders, which has turned out to be a stunning game that has impressed players more than anyone truly expected. Embark Studios has promised to support the game for years to come, so only bright things are in store.</p>

<p>Activision hasn’t officially unveiled this season’s Call of Duty League skins, and until now, all we’ve seen is the default Call of Duty League Launch pack. That is, until one user on social media uploaded a video showcasing all the CDL 2026 skins in the Call of Duty store.</p>



<p>Thanks to the short video, we now know what every CDL 2026 skin looks like, and this year, they’re more customized per team than they have been in a minute, with a special focus on the skin’s face mask layout.</p>







<p>On social media, user RealityUK uploaded a two-minute video detailing every CDL 2026 Operator skin. This included a brief snapshot of every team competing in this season’s Call of Duty League:</p>



<ul>
<li>Boston Breach</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Cloud9 New York</li>



<li>FaZe Vegas</li>



<li>G2 Minnesota</li>



<li>LA Thieves</li>



<li>Miami Heretics</li>



<li>OpTic Texas</li>



<li>Paris Gentle Mates</li>



<li>Riyadh Falcons</li>



<li>Toronto KOI</li>



<li>Vancouver Surge</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the full video, provided by Reality:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The feedback on the leaked CDL skins was mixed, with many coming to claim that their favorite teams were ‘done dirty’ by the skin designers. Many had issues with OpTic Texas’ skin in the video, one of which (the away skin) was almost a plain, stark white with no OpTic colorways.</p>



<p>One user wrote, <em>‘Why does OpTic look so barebones? They are getting more revenue this year the more people buy it’s not fixed anymore why did they go so basic I’m confused?’</em></p>



<p>What wasn’t revealed are the incoming weapon camos, stickers, emblems, and charms associated with each CDL team. It typically costs around $9.99 to purchase a CDL skin pack, and when doing so, you’ll unlock all the above, but all we’ve seen leaked thus far are the Operator skins themselves.</p>



<p>Is there a particular skin standing out to you? Let us know on the I<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">nsider Gaming Discord server</a> which you’d want to invest in.</p>

<p>VALORANT Night Market, the special event that fans of the first-person arena shooter love, is set to return on December 11. This time around, the Night Market will remain open for almost a month, giving players a longer opportunity to secure their dream VALORANT skins.</p>



<p>As always, getting the skins you’re seeking in the Night Market isn’t a <strong>guaranteed thing</strong>, but if you do manage to swing the one you’re after, you’ll secure it at a hugely discounted price.</p>



<p>It’s a little bit of gacha, but it’s good fun for players, and it only comes around once every few months.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-valorant-night-market">When is the Next VALORANT Night Market?</h2>



<p>The next VALORANT Night Market has been revealed by Riot Games as coming on December 11. It’s set to run until January 6, giving you plenty of time to hopefully unlock the skins that you’re hunting in this gacha-style event.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>How does the Night Market work?</strong></p>



<p>The VALORANT Night Market is a limited-time shop event that offers players six randomly selected weapon skins at discounted prices, ranging from 10% to 49%. The offers are unique per player, and only certain ‘collections’ are selected for the Night Market event.</p>



<p>You simply access the Night Market, click to reveal your discounted skins, and if you want them, you can buy them with a heavy discount. The only drawback is you’re never going to get bundle-exclusive skins or Ultra-tier skins.</p>



<h2 id="h-valorant-night-market-december-skins-act-6">VALORANT Night Market December Skins (Act 6)</h2>



<p>There are <strong>stacks </strong>of skins available in the Act 6 Night Market, which runs from December 11 to January 6.</p>

<p>A new look at Resident Evil Requiem will be debuting at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-megabonk-nomination-withdrawal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>. The event is set to occur on December 11th, with Requiem one of the nominated titles.</p>



<p>Releasing on February 27th, 2026, Resident Evil Requiem marks the next chapter in the iconic horror franchise. Following Grace Ashcroft, you’ll return to Raccoon City and investigate a series of mysterious deaths. Fans have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leak-reveals-first-and-third-person-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seen a lot</a> of the title since its reveal last year, but with rampant rumors and leaks, it seems there’s a lot of mystery still left to discover. Luckily, it won’t be long before players can see more, as the Capcom title is set to show at one of the biggest gaming events of the year.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-look-at-resident-evil-requiem-debuting-at-the-game-awards">New Look at Resident Evil Requiem Debuting at The Game Awards</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Announced on <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1996731931103580519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> by The Game Awards’ official account, <strong>Resident Evil Requiem will be in attendance at the show</strong>. Specifically, <strong>a new look at the title will premiere</strong> at the award show, streaming on <strong>December 11th</strong>. It’s unknown the extent of the first look or content like gameplay or story. Either way, it’s more Resident Evil Requiem, and that’s not a bad thing whatsoever.</p>



<p>It’s a big night for the game, too, as it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nominated for Most Anticipated Game</a>. Resident Evil Requiem is up against some heavy-hitters like Grand Theft Auto 6, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-4-wont-feature-at-the-game-awards-despite-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a>, 007 First Light, and Marvel’s Wolverine. Fortunately, given the series’ pedigree, with Village, 2 Remake, and 4 Remake getting GOTY nominations, its chances of taking some gold next year are quite good. In any case, there’s a lot more left to look forward to for Requiem as February 27th creeps up.</p>

<p>Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, known for his prolific career in film and TV, has passed away. His resume includes roles in The Man in the High Castle, Memories of a Geisha, and, for many, Shang Tsung in the Mortal Kombat film series. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/cary-hiroyuki-tagawa-dead-mortal-kombat-actor-1236636368/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, the Japanese actor died this morning, surrounded by family in California. His cause of death was due to complications of a stroke. The actor was only 75 years old.</p>

<p>Starting in 1986 with Big Trouble in Little China, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa had become a prevalent figure in many blockbusters in the 90s and 2000s. Films like License to Kill, Memories of a Geisha, Elektra, and Planet of the Apes brought the actor into the limelight. However, it was his portrayal of evil sorcerer Shang Tsung in the 1995 film adaptation of Mortal Kombat (and it’s 1997 sequel Mortal Kombat: Annihilation) that made him an icon. While the film was pure 90s, Cary’s devilish portrayal of Tsung was met with high praise, especially for the line “Your Soul is Mine!”.</p>



<p>In the 2010s, Tagawa found himself in roles in projects like The Man in the High Castle, 47 Ronin, and even an adaptation of Tekken as Heihachi Mishima. He even found himself reprising his role as Shang Tsung in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-500m-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat 11</a>, available as DLC. Other video game credits of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa include Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu and Soldier Boyz.</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to his family and friends during this difficult time.</p>
