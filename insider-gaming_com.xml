<p>Midnight Society has announced that it will be cancelling its NFT-backed extraction shooter, DEADROP, with 55 developers affected.</p>



<p>Announced on X (formerly Twitter), Midnight Society wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>Today we are announcing Midnight Society will be closing its doors after three incredible years, with an amazing team of over 55 developers contributing to our new IP DEADROP.</p><p>We are actively seeking other game studios that would be interested in offering employment opportunities to our talented team members.</p><p>If you know anyone who’s hiring please forward this message to them or DM us for direct intros.</p><p>We express our sincere gratitude to each and every one of our community members and deeply sorry we were unable to reach our ultimate goal.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>Midnight Society was originally founded by Robert Bowling of Call of Duty fame and content creator Dr Disrespect. However, following a series of allegations being levelled at the streamer last year, it was announced that Dr Disrespect would no longer be working at the studio.</p>



<p>After those events unfolded, Midnight Society’s leadership team insisted that Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm was little more than an influencer and marketer for the brand, but the shamed streamer claimed he was much more important to the project. Could his removal from the company have been a factor in this house of cards collapsing in on itself?</p>



<p>DEADROP was poised to be a ‘vertical extraction shooter’ fused with the blockchain and featuring NFT-driven mechanics. In a series of ‘snippets’ released during the game’s development cycle, players were invited to get early access to the title – myself included – and it wasn’t anything to write home about.</p>
