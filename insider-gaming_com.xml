<p>Split Fiction encourages co-op, and adding cross-platform play would facilitate this wonderfully. Hazelight Studios has a sterling reputation for letting you play its games with friends, and crossplay would make exploring Split Fiction‚Äôs vibrant and volatile world a pal-friendly pleasure.</p>



<p>Gaming‚Äôs interconnectivity has changed for the better in the last few years. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where more games have crossplay and cross-platform integration than those that don‚Äôt. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>‚Äòs co-op-centric ideology encourages players to join together as the game has to be played with another player.</p>



<p>You can play Split Fiction together on the same console, but let‚Äôs see if crossplay is enabled.</p>

<p><strong>Split Fiction includes complete crossplay and cross-platform features‚Äîallowing you to enjoy the co-op romp with another player playing on a different format.</strong></p>



<p>In layman‚Äôs terms, if you want to play Split Fiction and you have a PS5, but your friend is on Xbox Series X, crossplay allows you to join forces, despite playing on different consoles. The same goes if you‚Äôre on PC and your buddy is on PC, and so forth.</p>



<p>The news comes courtesy of <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/ea-originals-discussion-en/announcement--faq-split-fiction%E2%84%A2---launching-march-6-2025---pre-order-now/5037251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction‚Äôs official FAQ</a>. Under the ‚Äú<strong>Will the game be available to play online?</strong>‚Äù question, the answer succinctly states ‚ÄúYou can play the game online with cross-play enabled.‚Äù You don‚Äôt need to worry about <em>how </em>you own Split Fiction or owning two copies!</p>



<h2 id="h-does-split-fiction-have-friend-s-pass">Does Split Fiction Have Friend‚Äôs Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Hazelight Studios brings back the Friend‚Äôs Pass scheme for Split Fiction, allowing one person to own the game and invite another player to enjoy the title for free.</strong></p>



<p>Friend‚Äôs Pass is also available for the developer‚Äôs other titles: A Way Out and It Takes Two. Both are acclaimed co-op games, and Friend‚Äôs Pass ensures you can play with another player without you both needing a copy of the title.</p>



<p>You‚Äôd think this might affect sales, but quite the opposite. A Way Out has reportedly sold over nine million copies and counting.</p>



<div><article><p><span>A Way Out has now sold more than 9 million units! üí•

The development was a wild ride and the game was already a success back when it released. But even then, we never dared to dream of THIS many people playing our game! üòç

With that said, we will continue to look back at‚Ä¶ </span></p></article></div>



<p>Whereas It Takes Two went one better in every way. Not only did it scoop multiple Game of the Year awards in 2021, but it‚Äôs also sold a staggering 20+ million copies!</p>



<div><article><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ItTakesTwo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ItTakesTwo</a><span> HAS SOLD OVER 20 MILLION!!!

You‚Äôre the best fans in the world, how you have embraced our game is blowing our minds! ‚ù§Ô∏è

We‚Äôre so grateful to every one of the millions upon millions who have enjoyed their time with Cody and May üòç </span></p></article></div>



<p>Split Fiction looks to be another winner for Hazelight Studios. It has Friend‚Äôs Pass‚Äîmeaning only one of you needs to own it‚Äîand looks to recapture the magic of its predecessors.</p>



<hr>



<p>So, Split Fiction has crossplay and cross-platform compatibility and has Friend‚Äôs Pass. It‚Äôs a win-win all around, and Split Fiction should be in the GOTY conversation come the end of 2025. Or do you disagree? Offer your thoughts if you feel different.</p>

<p>Liquid Swords, the video game studio founded by Avalanche Studios founder Christofer Sunberg, has announced its plans to hold layoffs at the company.</p>



<p>The announcement was made via a post on the <a href="https://www.liquidswords.com/news/liquid-swords-announces-proposed-workforce-reduction-amid-business-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio‚Äôs website</a>.</p>



<p>According to the announcement, the decision was made after an ‚Äúevaluation of Liquid Swords‚Äô financial situation and the present challenges of the video game industry.‚Äù It was added that the moves are being done to ‚Äúensure the studio‚Äôs long-term sustainability‚Äù.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-exclusive-10-10-games-employees-offered-no-severance-layoffs-happened-while-on-holiday-and-more">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/1010-games-employees-offered-no-severance-laid-off-while-on-holiday-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXCLUSIVE: 10:10 Games Employees Offered No Severance, Layoffs Happened While On Holiday, And More</a></h6>



<p>‚ÄúI promised our employees and shareholders success and to build a studio redefining game development with a small, expert-driven team and a sustainable work model,‚Äù Sunberg said. ‚ÄúWhile we achieved much of this, shifting market conditions prevented us from succeeding within our timeframe. As a result, we must part ways with talented individuals who have been instrumental in our journey. This is incredibly difficult, but we remain committed to our vision and will continue to work on our IP and first game with a dedicated team.‚Äù</p>



<p>There was no mention of the number of people being let go nor how many people remain with the company. Insider Gaming has reached out to Liquid Swords for clarification after this round of layoffs.</p>



<p>Sundberg added that the studio ‚Äúremains focused‚Äù on its vision of ‚Äúsimplifying the game development process to create exceptional gaming experiences for players.‚Äù</p>



<p>Liquid Swords is currently working on its first game, which is described as ‚Äúa narrative-driven, open-world, hardboiled AAA revenge story‚Äù that is developed in Unreal Engine 5. No other details on the game are known.</p>



<p>In 2025, there have been <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 1,000 estimated jobs</a> lost due to layoffs a cross 30 companies. </p>

<p>Warhorse Studios has announced that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has sold two million units in its first two weeks.</p>



<p>The announcement was made on the developers X (formerly Twitter) page, where the developers said ‚ÄúA toast to you all for making #KCD2 a triumph!‚Äù</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 hit its highest concurrent player count on Steam last week at 256,206 players, far surpassing the original game that released in 2018.</p>



<p>On its success, Embracer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-ceo-says-teams-need-to-have-the-resources-to-make-games-after-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEO Lars Wingefors praised the games success</a> and said its a ‚Äúreminder‚Äù to the company about creating ‚Äúgreat products‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúKingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is beautiful in every aspect,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs deeply authentic and riddled with emotion and catharsis, and the way the story comes together is just perfection.‚Äù</p>

<p>Days Gone Remastered can be grabbed through a $10 upgrade if you already own the game digitally or physically; however, if you own the game from PlayStation Plus, you are not eligible for this offer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1iok0hw/days_gone_remastered_game_redemptions_via_ps_plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStationPlus</a> subreddit, the Days Gone Remastered‚Äôs fine print clearly states that ‚ÄúGame redemptions via PlayStation Plus are not eligible for upgrade‚Äù. PS Plus players must pay $49.99 to play the Days Gone Remastered, whereas digital or disc copy owners can upgrade for only $10. Many players in the subreddit have stated that they would happily upgrade for the earlier price, but now that they have to buy the whole game, they aren‚Äôt interested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During PlayStation‚Äôs State of Play event, Bend Studio announced that Days Gone Remastered will be released on April 25, 2025. The remastered version has been built for the PS5 and supports Tempest 3D Audio, VRR, DualSense‚Äôs haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers. The game also features improved graphical fidelity and better frame rates for the quality and performance modes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Days Gone Remastered includes new modes and features: Horde Assault, a survival arcade mode; Permadeath mode; Speedrun mode; enhanced Photo mode; and new accessibility features. The new features can also be accessed on PC by purchasing the Broken Road DLC, which costs $10.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the director of Days Gone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slammed Bend Studio</a> for not protecting the game‚Äôs legacy in Astro Bot ads.
