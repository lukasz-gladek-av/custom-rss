<p>A new teaser for the upcoming Until Dawn movie has been released by Sony Pictures. The teaser sets the stage for the movie ahead the reveal of the first trailer.</p>



<p>“As a huge fan of the Until Dawn game and how cinematic it was, I thought a lot about how we can continue the story without just giving the audience the same experience that they got when they were playing,” Writer and Producer Gary Dauberman said.</p>



<p>Director David F. Sandberg says that the movie “has sort of the same tone and same vibe” as the original game. However, he says, it “expands upon the universe”. Sandberg then touched on what he viewed as one of the more creative aspects of the game which is players making different choices and dying in different ways. </p>



<p>“The movie has this mechanic where things start over and they get to try again,” he said. “Every time they come back to life, it’s like their in a new horror genre. To survive, they have to make it until dawn.”</p>



<p>You can check out the first look teaser for the film below.</p>

<p>The movie’s description reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One year after her sister Melanie mysteriously disappeared, Clover and her friends head into the remote valley where she vanished in search of answers. Exploring an abandoned visitor center, they find themselves stalked by a masked killer and horrifically murdered one by one…only to wake up and find themselves back at the beginning of the same evening. Trapped in the valley, they’re forced to relive the nightmare again and again – only each time the killer threat is different, each more terrifying than the last. Hope dwindling, the group soon realizes they have a limited number of deaths left, and the only way to escape is to survive until dawn.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Until Dawn is scheduled to release in theaters on April 25. </p>

<p>Dynasty Warriors Origins is out, which means its Metacritic score is available. The hack-and-slash franchise has nearly 30 years of developing and publishing mileage on the clock, so let’s see if Origins has managed to land its biggest killing blow yet. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dynasty-warriors-cancelled-before-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dynasty Warriors 10 was canceled</a> before it was ever shown to the public. Instead, we got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-dynasty-warriors-origins-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dynasty Warriors Origins</a>, one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-biggest-video-game-releases-of-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 2025’s hottest games</a>. Origins features an unbelievable amount of soldiers on screen and more of the classic action that’s helped the series to ship over 20 million copies and counting.</p>



<p>As with any game’s release, reviews are everything. In today’s social-media-heavy society, review embargos are paramount. Everyone is desperate to know how a new title is received by critics, helping to sway people in their decision to buy it. Dynasty Warriors Origins’ reviews are out, so let’s dive into its final scores.</p>







<figure><figcaption>A beautiful blood-letting battle. Credit to Omega Force</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Dynasty Warriors Origins has a score of 80 out of 100 on Metacritic.</strong></p>



<p>Individually, Origin rates <strong>85 out of 100 for PC</strong> based on 18 reviews, <strong>80 on PS5</strong> using 48 reviews, and <strong>78 on Xbox</strong>—taking into account 10 reviews.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dynasty-warriors-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Origins’ Metacritic page</a> is the source for all the information we’ve collated. I find the best way to aggregate a game is the review score with the most quantitative verdicts, and in this case, it’s the <strong>PlayStation 5’s 80/100 score</strong>.</p>



<p>The Xbox’s number is only based on 10 reviews, so it’s hard to gauge this figure properly. A score of 80 out of 100 is a very good result for Dynasty Warriors—but more on this later.</p>



<h2 id="h-dynasty-warriors-origins-opencritic-score-explained">Dynasty Warriors Origins Opencritic Score Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Dynasty Warriors Origins has a combined score of 82 out of 100—based on 62 reviews—on OpenCritic, with an “80% Critics Recommend” percentage.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17485/dynasty-warriors-origins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OpenCritic</a> considers more reviewers than Metacritic and is considered to be a more versatile source of reviews and opinions. It also doesn’t split up platforms and takes the best from each format for one averaged-out rating.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-dynasty-warriors-origins-reviews-compare">How Do Dynasty Warriors Origins Reviews Compare?</h2>



<p><strong>Dynasty Warriors Origins is the highest-rated game in the franchise’s history!</strong></p>



<p>Using Metacritic, and without historical data for 1997’s very first Dynasty Warriors, I can tell you Origins’ main Metacritic score of 80 out of 100 is a record high. Dynasty Warriors 3 and 4 are the closest competitors with a rating of 78 out of 100—so congratulations to Dynasty Warriors Origins for being the best yet.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick look at how every other DW title compares to Origins from a Metacritic standpoint.</p>

<p>According to a new leak, players will be able to transform into Godzilla in Fortnite thanks to a new mythic coming this Friday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fortnite-godzilla-mythic-giant-transformation-beam-stomp-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TheGamer</a>, reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1879121165522026773" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a> has revealed that Fortnite is receiving a Godzilla transformation mythic this Friday, January 17. The new mythic will allow players to transform into Giant Godzillas and wreak havoc across the islands with their monstrous abilities. When transformed, players can use skills like Beam, Stomp, Roar, and more. Additionally, a “throw banana” ability has been spotted in the files, which is believed to be a Kong mythic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Godzilla descended onto Fortnite Island yesterday, marking the start of the Godzilla X Kong collaboration. We have already seen the Japanese kaiju make an appearance on the island, and it’s just a matter of time before King Kong from Skull Island shows up, too. If the Kong mythic does show up, there will be some interesting Godzilla vs Kong matchups that players can experience this season.&nbsp;</p>
