<p>No one saw the huge rebranding of Overwatch coming in 2026, and the revised identity comes with plenty of actual new identities. We’re taking a look at every new character, the voice actors behind the fresh-faced heroes, and more.</p>



<p>Aside from the rather unfortunate business surrounding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatchs-anran-set-for-redesign-after-community-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch’s Anran undergoing a redesign after community backlash</a>, the new cast of characters has been well-received, particularly a certain flying feline.</p>



<p>Props to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/blizzard/" id="1092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-overwatch-heroes-added-in-2026">All Overwatch Heroes Added In 2026</h2>



<p><strong>Blizzard has added five new Heroes to the rebranded Overwatch in 2026: Anran, Domina, Emre, Jetpack Cat, and Mizuki.</strong></p>



<p>There were the first new faces of 2026, with a few more to be added throughout the year. They range from expert warriors to…a cat…with a jetpack. More cats, please.</p>

<h2 id="h-who-voices-anran-in-overwatch">Who Voices Anran In Overwatch?</h2>



<p><strong>Farheea Andersen is the voice actor for Anran in Overwatch.</strong></p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>The Twitch streamer and content creator was given the honour of playing Anran for Overwatch, and to be fair to her, she didn’t hold back in her assessment of Anran’s original design, citing the character as an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-anran-actor-bags-on-ozempic-chic-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Ozempic Chic Character Design.’</a></p>



<p>This is believed to be Andersen’s debut role in gaming, movies, and TV.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-domina-in-overwatch">Who Voices Domina In Overwatch?</h2>



<p><strong>Overwatch’s Domina is voiced by Taj Atwal.</strong></p>



<p>Atwal is a British actress who has racked up acting credits across a multitude of TV shows, from Line of Duty to Hullraisers. It’s not her first foray into voice-over work, though, as she played Dr. Neema Chandra in Surgeon Simulator 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-emre-in-overwatch">Who Voices Emre In Overwatch?</h2>



<p><strong>Actor Kerem Erdinc has confirmed on social media that he is the voice of Emre.</strong></p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/KeremIsWhelmed/status/2021461358743855562?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X post</a>, he said: “The best thing about being the voice actor for Emre is people just let me pick him in the lobby. Gotta show up for the squad if I’m the one taking Emre for a spin. First match of the night, play of the game? Oh yeah, me and Emre were made for each other.”</p>



<p>Erdinc has plenty of other video game work under his belt, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/delta-force/" id="878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Force</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/ready-or-not/" id="1170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ready or Not</a>, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, and much more.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-mizuki-in-overwatch">Who Voices Mizuki In Overwatch?</h2>



<p><strong>The masked Mizuki is represented by Julian&nbsp;Cihi.</strong></p>



<p>Unless the facts are wrong, that seems to be Cihi’s debut into the world of video gaming voice-over work, too! Before grabbing the role of Mizuki with both horns, Cihi has appeared in several shows, such as Only Murders in the Building.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mewgenics-controller-support-playstation-xbox/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The usual array of questions is being thrown at Mewgenics, as a Steam title. This includes wondering about its Steam Deck compatibility and if the game supports PlayStation and/or Xbox controller support.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mewgenics/" id="170919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mewgenics</a> needs to be enjoyed in any way possible. The cuddly yet catastrophically grim and violent cat-oriented strategy title has wowed everyone since its February 10 release, and if you’re looking to play it on Steam, controller support could be a sticking point.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-mewgenics-using-a-playstation-or-xbox-controller">Can You Play Mewgenics Using a PlayStation or Xbox Controller?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A fun time to be had. Credit to Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mewgenics has complete PlayStation and Xbox controller support, and this has been verified and confirmed by its official Steam store listing.</strong></p>



<p>Good news: If you want to play Mewgenics with a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S controller (or something adjacent), you can.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mewgenics-playstation-xbox-switch-console-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Mewgenics on PlayStation, Xbox, or Switch? Console Release Date, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>There’s always an iffy element of can you/can’t you with games on Steam, even if they’re only available to buy on the platform. Some are only usable with a mouse and keyboard, as the configuration is easier to manage.</p>



<p>However, if you check the Mewgenics <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> page, you’ll clearly see a box in the right column saying ‘Full Controller Support,’ with <strong>Xbox Controllers</strong> and <strong>PlayStation Controllers</strong> listed, too.</p>



<p>Connecting a controller is easy, as you can do it either directly through a USB cable and looking for the device, or manually setting it up by connecting the controller and computer system using Bluetooth.</p>



<p>It’s as easy as training a cat, sort of.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-mewgenics-steam-deck-verified">Is Mewgenics Steam Deck Verified?</h2>



<p><strong>Steam Decks are compatible with Mewgenics, meaning you can play using your Steam console if you want.</strong></p>



<p>A little bonus question answered for you: Steam Deck verification is A-ok for Mewgenics!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mewgenics-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mewgenics Release Date Countdown &amp; Exact Start Times</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Again, you’d think it would be self-explanatory, but not all games have Steam Deck support. Mewgenics does, and that’s all that meowtters for this query.</p>



<p>Check out the Steam compatibility evaluation:</p>



<p>“Valve’s testing indicates that Mewgenics is <strong>Verified </strong>on Steam Deck. This game is fully functional on Steam Deck, and works great with built-in controls and display.”</p>



<p>It’s always good to get the IG community’s thoughts on things like this: Do you prefer using a controller for Steam games? Or are you part of the PC master race who settle for nothing less than a mouse and keyboard?
