            <guid>1400650</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Netflix’s new post has confirmed that 2026 is the year in which The Witcher series comes to an end. </p>



<p>We were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-final-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">informed</a> back in 2024 that Netflix’s The Witcher series would be renewed for its fifth and final season. Now that the fourth season has aired and the fifth season has been filmed, all we need to wait for is the last season to air. Netflix has confirmed that the fifth season will end its run in 2026. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-s-season-5-will-end-in-2026-bringing-the-series-to-a-close">The Witcher’s Season 5 Will End in 2026, Bringing the Series to a Close</h2>



<p>The confirmation that The Witcher series will end in 2026 comes from a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/new-shows-on-netflix-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tudum</a> post by Netflix, which talks about all the content releasing this year. The summary states that “the time of the end is nigh,” and that dark forces will be coming together across the continent to target Ciri. If Geralt and Yennefer wish to save their daughter and reunite as a family, they will have to face never-before-seen obstacles and enemies. The fifth and final season of the show will air in 2026.</p>



<p>The Witcher series is highly revered in the fan base, even after going through a major recasting with Henry Cavill exiting for Liam Hemsworth to take his place. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witchers-ciri-had-considered-leaving-with-henry-cavill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actress</a> who plays Ciri in the series also recently stated that she had considered leaving, along with Cavill. Still, she ultimately decided to return and take Henry’s role as “knowledgeable and loyal to the books,” as well as pushing for “certain lines to be included.” Even amid these twists and turns, the series has remained strong, and now fans are eagerly awaiting its epic conclusion. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Trigger ‘Nade Nerf, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trigger-nade-nerf-explained/</link>
            <guid>1400584</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has taken the gaming world by storm, and a key reason for its success is its combat. Whether you’re fighting PvP or PvE, there’s a strong variety of weapons and gadgets at your disposal, but one item in particular stands tall above the rest—the Trigger ‘Nade.</p>



<p>This pocket-sized rendition of a C4 packs a serious punch, and whilst it’s fairly effective against the enemy ARC, it’s best utilised against <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ceo-the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fellow raiders</a>. However, the Trigger ‘Nade might be a little bit too good at ending people’s raids, as plenty of fans have been clamouring for a nerf.</p>



<p>Follow along with this guide to see whether Trigger ‘Nades are actually being nerfed in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-tv-show-and-movie-ideas-being-pitched-embark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, and the reason why fans are calling for one. </p>



<h2 id="h-are-trigger-nades-being-nerfed-in-arc-raiders">Are Trigger ‘Nades Being Nerfed In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll want a stash full of them. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>An ARC Raiders Community Manager has confirmed that the development team is looking into nerfing Trigger ‘Nades. </strong></p>



<p>The news was broken in the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJgbCVm_yRAxUaZ0EAHRmqL0gQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Finvite%2Farcraiders&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Fa-gWhhqWUNZh3rIuGRH-&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Raiders Discord</a>, where Lily, a Community Manager, was asked whether there were any updates regarding a PVP-focused balancing update. Trigger ‘Nades were specifically mentioned, and Lily promptly responded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The team’s looking into some nerfs, including trigger nades. Keep an eye on ⁠game-announcements for updates!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As things stand, that’s all there is to know regarding the Trigger ‘Nade nerf in ARC Raiders. Its existence is confirmed, but to what extent it will present itself in-game, and when you can expect it, you’ll have to wait for further updates from Embark Studios.</p>



<p>One thing Insider Gaming is certain of, though, is that the nerf can’t come soon enough.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-are-trigger-nades-being-nerfed-in-arc-raiders">Why Are Trigger ‘Nades Being Nerfed In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>For a small ‘Nade, they pack a mean punch. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, the Trigger ‘Nade in ARC Raiders is incredibly OP, rendering many of the other utility items obsolete. </strong></p>



<p>On paper, the Trigger ‘Nade seems intended for use as a trap; place down the grenade, and remotely detonate it when enemy raiders step within range. However, what has transpired is that raiders use it more like an impact grenade, due to its incredibly quick detonation time and absurd damage potential. </p>



<p>A single well-aimed Trigger ‘Nade can down an entire trio of raiders with ease, thanks to its ludicrous damage output and large radius. To make matters worse, they’re dirt cheap to craft: both Crude Explosives and Processors are immensely simple to acquire. </p>



<p>All of these attributes combined transform the Trigger ‘Nade into what feels like a pocket-sized nuke. Fans have long been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-november-20-update-full-1-3-0-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">desperate for a nerf</a>, and thankfully, it seems like Embark Studios is aware of its unbalanced nature—fingers crossed there isn’t too long a wait.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders retained its popularity heading into the new year, making 2026 an exciting chapter for Embark Studios and all ARC Raiders players. A 2026 roadmap is what the community is begging for, and this live tracker has the latest details and updates on future changes.</p>



<p>It feels redundant to say, but ARC Raiders is quite good, isn’t it? A record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 million Peak Player count</a> serves to highlight this more, and ARC Raiders is expected to be a huge presence throughout 2026.</p>



<p>One thing that will keep you all coming back is new content, and this live tracker runs through everything known about the roadmap and future incomings.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-have-a-2026-roadmap-yet">Does ARC Raiders Have A 2026 Roadmap Yet?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hang fire for now. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>At the time of writing, Embark Studios hasn’t revealed the ARC Raiders 2026 Roadmap yet.</strong></p>



<p>It’s January 8, and Embark Studios is either still feeling the come-down of the holidays (who isn’t?) or reluctant to commit to a 2026 roadmap just yet. There’s always the daunting reality that there might not be a roadmap at all, but it’s unlikely.</p>



<p>Embark has already committed to a 10-year development cycle for ARC. You don’t claim this unless you’re cooking up some serious stuff. Thanks to some digging, a couple of details about the 2026 roadmap content have already been discovered.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will update this once the roadmap is live, per its tracker status.</p>



<h2 id="h-2026-arc-raiders-roadmap-changes">2026 ARC Raiders Roadmap Changes</h2>



<p><strong>Initial ARC Raiders changes for 2026 include changes to the Trigger Nade, Kettle, and other weapons.</strong></p>



<p>On the ARC Raiders official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1107589599045361695/1427256238651084895/1458832856120819724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> server, community manager ‘CM | Lily’ had this to say on January 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The team’s looking into some changes to trigger nades.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Then, on January 6, community manager ‘CM | Birdie’ added some more details to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1107589599045361695/1427256238651084895/1458217158160154704" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> about upcoming changes in 2026:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Hey! The holidays delayed things a bit, but the dev team want you to know that they are looking into balance, for example, the stitcher, kettle, and trigger nade. Rest assured that we hear you and work on delivering a good gaming experience, things are just not immediate.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>These are minor details for now, but they show that the team is already working behind the scenes. A 2026 roadmap likely isn’t far off, and IG will let you know when it’s here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2026 is set to be another big year for Nintendo, and the first major content drop of the year on the console is coming to an already-established classic, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, with the Nintendo Switch 2 update, and all the price details you need are here.</p>



<p>Six years after the game was first released, and four years on from the 2.0 update, the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade for Animal Crossing: New Horizons brings <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updates to the base game for all players</a>, as well as graphical enhancements for those who purchase the title on the latest console when it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-switch-2-edition-exact-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases on January 15</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re yet to splash out on the latest entry in the Animal Crossing series, or are considering upgrading your edition, Insider Gaming has all the important price details.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-animal-crossing-new-horizons-on-nintendo-switch-2">How Much is Animal Crossing: New Horizons on Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Arrival. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 edition of Animal Crossing: New Horizons is priced at $64.99, $5 more than the original Switch edition of the game.</strong></p>



<p>Purchasing the original Nintendo Switch version of New Horizons will still provide you with the free content coming in the big 3.0 update, though it won’t allow you to take advantage of the Switch 2-exclusive features, which include increasing the maximum amount of players in multiplayer to 12.</p>

<p><strong>If you already own Animal Crossing: New Horizons on the original Nintendo Switch, an upgrade pack for the Switch 2 version costs just $5.</strong></p>



<p>There is no need to purchase the game outright again, as Nintendo offers a much cheaper option, but it won’t save you any money if you purchase the base game on the original Switch, then purchase the Switch 2 upgrade. </p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether the Switch 2 edition requires a completely new download, or if it will just update the standard edition of the game, though other Nintendo titles with a Switch 2 upgrade do require a completely new install.</p>
