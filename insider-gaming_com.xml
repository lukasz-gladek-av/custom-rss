            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Dragon Ball team recently revealed an all-new project, codenamed ‘AGE 1000’, set to be released in 2027. In a short trailer posted online that showcased a never-before-seen character, it was confirmed that a full reveal will take place on April 18 during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to pick up on the AGE 1000 reference, which until now, has only been used in connection with Dragon Ball Online. This MMORPG debuted in 2010 but has long since been shut down, being replaced somewhat by <em>Xenoverse</em>.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-dragon-ball-game-coming-2027">New Dragon Ball Game Coming 2027</h2>



<p>The Dragon Ball team wrote on social media that AGE 1000 offers ‘a new world and new characters brought to life by Akira Toriyama,’ the father of Dragon Ball. You can see the two-minute teaser trailer below:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Announcing a New Dragon Ball Game Project, "AGE 1000", set for 2027!<br>A new world and new characters brought to life by Akira Toriyama!</p><p> The latest updates will be unveiled at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 in the U.S. on April 18-19.<br>Stay tuned for more information. <a href="https://t.co/ouBqvz5FwA">pic.twitter.com/ouBqvz5FwA</a></p></div>— Dragon Ball Games (@dragonballgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/2015246051461210565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Eagle-eyed fans spotted the AGE 1000 reference in seconds, pointing out that, until now, the only other game to use that setting was Dragon Ball Online.</p>



<p>In <strong>that </strong>game, players are transported to the age 1000 in a time-traveling adventure that sees them explore an open-world environment, search for Dragon Balls, and interact with NPCs and other players on their journey. It boasted multiple classes and races, several settings in terms of time and location, and diverse quest mechanics.</p>



<p>While Dragon Ball Online died years ago, <em>Xenoverse </em>almost took its place, adopting the core story elements and character creation features that surfaced in DBO.</p>



<p>This is why fans think AGE 1000 is a direct follow-on (or reboot) of Dragon Ball Online.</p>

Still, much more information has been revealed about the forthcoming WWE video game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rayman is getting a 30th Anniversary game, and it has been rated in Australia.</p>



<p>Rayman was Ubisoft’s mascot at one time, and while the series may be best known today for introducing the Rabbids, Rayman was one of the premier adventure-platforming titles. The original game was released in 1995 for PC, Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, and Atari Jaguar, and now a 30th-anniversary edition is coming to modern consoles.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson recently stated on <a href="https://youtu.be/8rRejJWM3jg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Insider Gaming Weekly podcast</a> that two Rayman projects were in the works at Ubisoft, and while one, codenamed “Steamboat,” is believed to be a remake of Rayman Legends, Insider Gaming understands that this project is currently under the codename “Iceman.”</p>

<h2 id="h-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-s-rating-in-australia">Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition’s Rating in Australia</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Australian classification </a>has rated the currently unannounced title as G, safe for the General Public, with very mild content and minimal impact. Specifically, this game is noted as having very mild violence. The classification date is listed as Thursday, January 22, 2026.</p>



<p>The game is listed for release on both the Nintendo Switch and the Sony PlayStation 5. Atari is listed as both the publisher and developer. Atari also handles the remakes and new releases in the once-popular Bubsy franchise.</p>







<p>Even though Rayman is no longer the face of the Ubisoft franchise, this remake comes at a time when Ubisoft is undergoing a massive restructuring in its own right. Recently, the planned remake for Prince of Persia: Sands of Time was shelved as the company moves forward in a new direction.

<p>As Nintendo continues to celebrate Milestones like the 40th anniversaries of the Super Mario and Legend of Zelda franchises, key developers from Nintendo’s history are entering the next phases of their lives as well.</p>



<p>Legendary producer Kensuke Tanabe recently announced that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be his final game at Nintendo. The news was shared in an interview with the Japanese magazine<a href="https://www.ndw.jp/category/news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Nintendo Dream</a>, which was later posted on<a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405257646218805574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Weibo.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-kensuke-tanabe-confirms-he-s-worked-on-his-last-title-at-nintendo">Kensuke Tanabe Confirms He’s Worked On His Last Title at Nintendo</h2>



<p>As <span>reported by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><span>Vi</span>deo Games Chronicle</a>, Tanabe confirmed that he will no longer be involved in the studio’s production, but trusts that Risa Tabata and the team at Retro Studios will be able to continue moving forward should that be what Nintendo requests.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Completing this game took far longer than anticipated… Furthermore, I have confirmed that I will no longer be involved in the production of the series moving forward. Whether a sequel will be made is still uncertain, but I sincerely hope that one day, Ms Tabata and Retro Studios will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close.</p>



<p>It’s been 40 years since I joined Nintendo. Metroid Prime 4 will be my final title developed at Nintendo.</p>



<p>However, we didn’t set out to create anything ‘special’ because of this. Instead, we worked closely with Retro Studios, just as we always have with Nintendo projects, aiming to deliver a fun and unique experience for players of all ages and playstyles.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Following news about Tanabe, it was also confirmed that Hideki Konno, known for launching the Mario Kart franchise, left the studio in July 2025. </p>



<p>The news was confirmed via his private Facebook account. He received a special thanks credit in the recent Mario Kart World release and last worked on the Mario Kart 8: Deluxe DLC for the original Nintendo Switch.</p>







<p>Shigeru Miyamoto, the man behind the Mario and Zelda franchises, remains on board at Nintendo. Currently, he has been working closely with Universal on the release of the Super Mario Bros. movies. The forthcoming Super Mario Galaxy movie is due to release in April 2026. A Nintendo Direct will reveal new information about the movie on January 25.

<p>The head of Xbox Games Studio has commented on the mindset and strategy behind XGS-produced games landing on PlayStation and Nintendo consoles.</p>



<p>The days of the console wars of the 2000s, pitting Xbox, Nintendo, and Sony consoles against each other, have come and gone. These days, the Xbox team wants players to get behind the idea that everything is an Xbox. As part of the strategy, Xbox’s first-party games are beginning to release on PlayStation 5 and the Nintendo Switch family of consoles.</p>



<p>Recently, Xbox announced that the forthcoming Fable reboot and Forza Horizon 6 would both be coming to PlayStation 5, with Fable releasing across all consoles on the same day and Forza coming to Xbox platforms in May with a later release on PlayStation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/were-going-to-try-and-be-more-consistent-with-what-we-do-the-head-of-xbox-game-studios-on-the-developer-direct-reveals-multiplatform-strategy-and-hard-lessons-learned-from-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">During the recent interview with Games Radar+,</a> Craig Duncan of XGS stated that his main focus is to ensure as many players as possible get to experience Xbox-produced titles. </p>



<p>When questioned about the consistency of titles across different platforms, Duncan admitted that, while strategies and realities change, they’re aiming to be more consistent with multiplatform releases in the near future.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s always development realities about when these projects start – how big a team is, and what plans we have at the start of development. Like you said, when a strategy changes, maybe you’ve got a plan that exists with a game and maybe you can adopt that, maybe you can’t. So that’s why. And to be clear, this is totally fair feedback. Sometimes we are inconsistent. You see some games in one place, some games in multiple places. Just know that we’re going to work on that, and we’re going to try and be more consistent with what we do.</p>



<p>But you know, for our game makers, if you’re on the Fable team, you just want as many people who love Fable to appreciate the great work that the team’s doing. That’s always our goal. It’s rarely more complicated than that. It’s like, how can we get this game to as many players as we can?</p>
