<p>After a brief hiatus from new packs, it’s time to go on a heater again with Pokémon TCG Pocket’s red-hot Crimson Blaze B1a set. Its release date will make a nice, early Christmas present to start the Holidays off right, so stay tuned for full launch details.</p>



<p>You can’t say you haven’t had ample time to prepare for a new set. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising-b1-release-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon TCG Pocket B1 Mega Rising</a> was the second, big-time main set to celebrate the game’s anniversary, and as such, the game’s developers rightly felt time was needed to catch ’em all.</p>



<p>It’s time for Crimson Blaze B1a to be the new craze.</p>

<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket B1a Crimson Blaze has a December 17 release date for all users.</strong></p>



<p>Well, sort of, if you’re on Pacific Time, you get the set an hour earlier than most—you lucky Pokémon trainers, you! This guide will cover start times shortly, but the general launch period is Wednesday, December 17.</p>



<p>If you haven’t already, complete your challenges, win your Solo Battles, hoard as many Hourglasses as you can, and prepare to rip packs and get fat stacks…of duplicates.</p>



<p>It’s not likely to be the biggest set in the world, but it has some cool cards.</p>

            <guid>1382836</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The rumored Modern Warfare 4 release—set for 2026—allegedly copies almost all of its multiplayer components from 2022’s Modern Warfare 2 reboot, and excessive ‘visual recoil’ is reportedly back as well.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 reboot wasn’t the most memorable CoD, but it was a huge success for Activision. Players aimed reservations at the multiplayer and other features, and if reports are true, those reservations might be repeated in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-campaign-reportedly-set-in-north-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026’s Modern Warfare 4</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-modern-warfare-4-leaks-indicate-a-ton-of-visual-recoil">Modern Warfare 4 Leaks Indicate ‘A Ton Of Visual Recoil’</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Oh boy, here we go. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Reputable leaker TheGhostOfHope delivered some bombshell news on December 14 about the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD 2026</a> game—rumored to be Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4.</p>







<p>The first reveal was huge:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Modern Warfare 4 Multiplayer in its current state is currently a complete copy of Modern Warfare II except for no perk charging system and less ADS/slide penalties…”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To what extent ‘a complete copy’ entails, we’re not sure, but it means we could have Platforms and Receivers back, leaving the community to scramble across all classes to unlock specific weapons and attachments. It was a convoluted and complex system that didn’t fit the usual casual unlock mechanics the franchise has become known for.</p>



<p>This might not be the smartest decision, and when prompted by a user, “Sooo… no Ninja and no red dots? FUNNNNN,” Hope simply replied: “Nope lol it’s literally MWII 2.0.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leaks and reports didn’t stop there. Hope went on to explain about one of the prominent fixtures in MW4’s multiplayer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There is A TON of visual recoil on weapons in Modern Warfare 4 just like Modern Warfare II. Like I said in my last tweet it’s pretty much a complete copy outside of a few little things.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After a lackluster Black Ops 7 in terms of revenue and player base, Activision really needs a win with Call of Duty 2026. The reception to Hope’s reports is already a bit frosty, to say the least, and the game is currently slated to release in and around GTA 6. It’ll be interesting to see if Hope’s leaks are true, and if so, how the CoD community would receive this.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is A TON of visual recoil on weapons in Modern Warfare 4 just like Modern Warfare II. Like I said in my last tweet it's pretty much a complete copy outside of a few little things.</p>— Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1999997428465090593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Do these reports sound promising? Or is Call of Duty and Activision doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past?

<p>Team Vitality and FaZe Clan will take to the stage later today in Budapest for a shot at a $500,000 prize and one of the most coveted trophies of 2025. The former team enters as the clear favorite, but FaZe Clan has managed to push into the grand final with some outsider energy that might sustain a final victory in 2025.</p>



<p>In this breakdown, we’re taking a closer look at the betting predictions for the StarLadder Budapest Major grand final, a frantic showdown between two very capable teams.</p>



<p>If you want to bet on the grand finals of the Budapest Major, look no further. Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a>&nbsp;to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>



<figure><a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"></a></figure>











<h2 id="h-will-vitality-dominate-the-final-run-of-2025">Will Vitality Dominate The Final Run of 2025?</h2>



<p>Team Vitality has been the most consistent force in Counter-Strike 2 throughout much of 2025. They have stormed through the major with clinical precision, defeating Team Spirit with a sweep in the semifinals and refusing to drop a map thus far.</p>



<p>ZywOo has led the roster to greater heights than this in 2025, and this is just another potential trophy for the jam-packed cabinet.</p>



<p>On the other side of the fence, you’ve got FaZe Clan, a team that has pushed for a miraculous run throughout this event. FaZe Clan also dropped from the running in the tournament’s opening stage, but stellar performances from the likes of broky, Twistzz, and, of course, karrigan, have kept them afloat.</p>



<p>However, we need to be critical ahead of the betting predictions for the StarLadder Budapest Major.</p>



<p>Team Vitality is easily the safe bet for the outright market. They’ve proven that already time and again this year, and if you want an easy (but small) return, you’ll float this wager.</p>



<p>For bigger potential returns and the love of the game, you might back FaZe Clan, as the final best-of-five could be anyone’s series in truth. That’s the beauty of Counter-Strike esports, and stranger things have happened.</p>



<p>If you want to have a flutter on MVP markets, consider backing ZywOo to take the accolade away.</p>



<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> which team you think will win the StarLadder Budapest Major.</p>

<p>FaZe Clan has eliminated Natus Vincere to reach the grand final of the StarLadder Budapest Major. The team, which had a rocky road to get where it is, will now face Team Vitality with the hopes of securing a massive $500,000 grand prize. The team, led by the iconic karrigan, almost dropped in the first stage of the tournament, but the resilience from the squad has proven insane.</p>



<p>The semifinal clash against Natus Vincere could have gone either way, and it went to the wire, with FaZe Clan securing a 2-1 victory over the Ukrainian side.</p>

<h2 id="h-faze-clan-makes-the-grand-final">FaZe Clan Makes The Grand Final</h2>



<p>FaZe Clan will now need to contend with Team Vitality at the final post. This is a team that has dominated much of 2025 with near-flawless consistency. Recently, Team Vitality won awards based on its consistency this year, marking it as the greatest esports organization of 2025.</p>



<p>During the recent semifinal round, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-vitality-defeats-spirit-to-secure-grand-final/">Team Vitality swept past Team Spirit</a> with ease, setting up an intense best-of-five showdown for hte grand final.</p>



<p>For FaZe Clan, the spot in the final round is a testament to holding firm against all odds. Earlier in the tournament, the team sat on the brink of elimination, and now they’re one series away from securing a huge prize in front of hundreds of thousands of viewers.</p>

<p>Team Vitality has secured a prestigious place in the grand final of the Budapest Major after a thrilling semifinal victory over Team Spirit, one of the favorites to go all the way. In one of the most anticipated fixtures of the tournament, the powerhouse platform of Vitality easily overcame Team Spirit, issuing a 2-0 sweep to kick the Russian side out of the running.</p>



<p>Now, Team Vitality will wait patiently in the grand final slot, and Natus Vincere and FaZe Clan will duke it out for a shot at the grand final and the $500,000 prize.</p>

<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-team-vitality-navi-and-faze-remain-in-budapest">Team Vitality, NAVI, and FaZe Remain in Budapest</h2>



<p>Team Spirit had one heck of a run thus far, with donk going so far as to set a new record, but it wasn’t enough to beat Vitality to the punch in Budapest. The first map of the series, Mirage, proved to be a tenuous enough battle, going long into overtime, but the second map, Dust II, was much easier for Vitality to handle.</p>



<p>Vitality has had a remarkable run in Budapest. The team failed to secure a perfect record in the tournament’s third stage ahead of the playoffs, but the squad has made up for that in the bracket by refusing to drop a single map.</p>



<p>The streak has been enough for ZywOo to rack up a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zywoo-secures-record-for-best-map-performance-starladder/">new single-map Major record</a>.</p>



<p>In our recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/budapest-semi-finals-predictions-and-betting-tips/">predictions piece for the semi-finals</a>, we accurately predicted that Team Vitality would make it through to the grand final, and we also suggested that Natus Vincere would rise to meet them. The accuracy of that prediction will be revealed very soon.</p>
