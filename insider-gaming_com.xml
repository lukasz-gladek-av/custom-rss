<p>A new report has released an internal memo from META’s CTO saying that 2025 could be a make-or-break year for the Metaverse.</p>



<p>The memo, which was obtained by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-cto-metaverse-reality-labs-legendary-misadventure-memo-2025-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Business Insider</a> reportedly originates from November 2024, where META’s CTO, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth told staff that 2025 is its “most critical” year for the Metaverse.</p>



<p>In the memo Bosworth said, “”We need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR [Metaverse],” he said. </p>



<p>He continued, “And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance. If you don’t feel the weight of history on you then you aren’t paying attention. “This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.”</p>



<p>As reported by Business Insider, Meta’s Reality Labs reported a record $1.08 billion in revenue in Q4, however, it also had its biggest-ever quarterly loss of $4.97 billion. At the time of writing, the Meta Reality Labs division had accumulated a loss of $60 billion since 2020.</p>



<p>To put things into perspective, the <strong>ENTIRE</strong> US video game industry spent $58.7 billion on games and hardware in 2024, a 1% decrease from 2023.</p>



<p>The full memo to employee’s reads:</p>



<p><strong><em>2025: The Year of Greatness</em></strong></p>



<p><em>Next year is going to be the most critical year in my 8 years at Reality Labs. We have the best portfolio of products we’ve ever had in market and are pushing our advantage by launching half a dozen more AI powered wearables. We need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR. And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance. If you don’t feel the weight of history on you then you aren’t paying attention. This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.</em></p>



<p><em>I’ve been re-reading “Insanely Great,” Steven Levy’s history of the Macintosh computer. If you haven’t read it the book chronicles the incredible efforts of individuals working in teams of 1-3 to build a device that more than any other marked the consumer era of personal computing. What I find most fascinating about it is the way that even people who left the program on bad terms (it was not particularly well managed) speak about the work they did there with an immense sense of pride. There was a widespread cultural expectation, set by none other than a young Steve Jobs, that the work needed to be “insanely great.”</em></p>



<p><em>On paper 2024 was our most successful year to date but we aren’t sitting around celebrating because know it isn’t enough. We haven’t actually made a dent in the world yet. The prize for good work is the opportunity to do great work.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Greatness is our opportunity.&nbsp;</strong>We live in an incredible time of technological achievement and have placed ourselves at the center of it with our investments.&nbsp;There is a very good chance most of us will never get a chance like this again.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Greatness is a choice.</strong>&nbsp;Many people have been at the precipice of opportunity and failed to achieve. For the most part they failed to even challenge themselves.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>You should be doing the best work of your career right now.</strong>&nbsp;You should be pushing yourself to grow where needed and doubling down on your strengths. When you look back on this time I want you to feel like you did everything in your power to make the most of it.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>You don’t need big teams to do great work.&nbsp;</strong>In fact, it may make it harder. One trend I’ve observed the last couple of years is that our smaller teams often go faster and achieve better results than our more generously funded teams. Not only that, they are much happier! In small teams there is no risk of falling into bad habits like design by committee. You should be so focused on results that being in a bunch of docs or meetings is too frustrating to bear.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>The path is clear.&nbsp;</strong>You don’t need to come up with a bunch of new ideas to do this great work. Most people in the organization just need to execute on the work laid out before them to succeed. It is about operational excellence. It is about master craftsmanship. It is about filling our products with “Give A Damn”.&nbsp;This is about having pride in our work.</em></p>



<p><em>I will close with an Arnold Glasow quote: “Success isn’t a result of spontaneous combustion. You must set yourself on fire.” 2025 is the year. Let’s be on fire.</em></p>



<p>What do you think of the Metaverse? Do you think it can succeed with a $60 billion loss? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>&nbsp;if you have any success.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-faze-gta-6-rp-crypto-server/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/adin-ross-and-faze-plan-to-build-a-crypto-backed-gta-6-rp-server.1100601/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-faze-gta-6-rp-crypto-server/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Grand Theft Auto’s RP scene is what has kept GTA 5 so popular for all these years. If you venture onto Twitch, you’ll often see that Grand Theft Auto 5 sits at the top of the charts at any given time, and that’s because of the success of ‘GTA RP’. These servers offer a more immersive experience, allowing players to have jobs, join gangs, and generally live out virtual lives on modded servers.</p>



<p>Big streamers have enjoyed the amount of viewers they’ve accrued while exploring the GTA RP world. Now, one of the most prolific creators of them all, Adin Ross, has joined forces with FaZe Banks, and the pair plan to create a GTA 6 RP server backed by cryptocurrency, which players will be able to ‘earn’ as they play.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-probably-not">But Probably Not</h2>



<p>During a recent stream, Adin Ross and FaZe Banks outlined their GTA 6 RP vision, expressing their desire to create a server linked with a token or two that you can use to earn money while you play GTA 6 online.</p>



<p>Adin Ross explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When GTA 6 drops, me and Rick here are going to make the biggest server together. We’re going to do the best s*** ever and I promise you, it’s going to be completely crypto — everything pro-crypto about it.</p>



<p>It’s going to change the game because GTA 6 – I promise you guys – they already bought FiveM, it’s going to be all RP.</p>



<p>I’ll have the best and biggest server, I promise you I will.</p>



<p>We’re going to put a lot of money into it.</p>



<p>This is my passion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Currently, Rockstar Games supports the modding and RP communities that exist at the heart of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. However, the gaming titan <strong>does not </strong>allow cryptocurrencies to be integrated in any way with the slew of GTA RP servers out there. This will be a huge sticking point for Adin Ross and FaZe Banks’ plans.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Adin ross announces GTA 6 news</span></p></article></div>







<p>Historically, ventures linking games with the blockchain, NFTs, or cryptocurrencies have fallen flat on their faces. Ubisoft tried to set up an NFT marketplace tied to Ghost Recon, and it didn’t work at all. Recently, Midnight Society, the developer behind the NFT-backed DEADROP, announced a studio shutdown.</p>



<p>The most dedicated GTA RP players live out virtual lives on the platform. They’ll hold down a job, earn in-game cash, buy and customise houses, meet up with their friends, and even accept punishment from the police when they commit crimes. All of this is done in a world populated by other players.</p>



<p>It’ll be a big seller when GTA 6 is released, but if the track record represents anything, it’s that a solid RP ecosystem won’t exist until a few years after GTA 6 has hit the open market.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cankers-camp-location-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-is-canker%E2%80%99s-camp-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-answered.1100580/</guid>

<p>In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll eventually come across a quest named ‘Canker’. It’s a side quest given to you by Gules in Semine, and it requires you to head to the camp of a former associate of Gules and ‘get rid of’ the band occupying it. However, all you’re given by way of a location is a large, open area on the map.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll help you find Canker’s camp in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and teach you what to do with it when you get there.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-canker-s-camp-in-kingdom-come">How to Find Canker’s Camp in Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>Canker’s Camp is located north of Nebakov, in the lower half of the game world. It’s in a densely wooded area, set back under a rocky outcrop alongside a stream.</p>



<p>Here’s the map location for the camp:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Canker’s Camp location in Kingdom Come</figcaption></figure>







<h2 id="h-how-to-deal-with-canker-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">How to Deal with Canker in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</h2>



<p>Once you’ve tracked down the camp, you’ll want to take it slow and silent, especially if you plan on killing all the camp’s occupants.</p>



<p>The easiest way to deal with Canker is to approach the camp in the dead of night with a dagger. There will be one guard roaming the nearby area with a torch, making him easy to identify. Try to lead him away from the main camp, taking him out swiftly before he can raise the alarm.</p>



<p>Every other member of Canker’s camp – including Canker himself – will be asleep on the beds scattered around the camp, making it easy to stealth kill them with the dagger.</p>



<p><strong>Note: You MUST have a dagger to perform a stealth kill</strong>.</p>



<p>Once you’ve killed every bandit in the camp, you can secure Canker’s mace, which is the core goal of this quest. Then, loot the area and leave when you’re satisfied with the quest completion, heading back to Semine in your own time.</p>



<p>If you like Canker’s mace, you’ll have the option to keep it after the quest. Just ask Gules if you can hang onto it.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/find-nikvard-kingdom-come-deliverance-quest/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-is-nikvard-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-%E2%80%93-magnum-opus-quest.1100559/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/find-nikvard-kingdom-come-deliverance-quest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll pick up a quest relatively early on called ‘Magnum Opus’, but it’s a lengthy one that’ll sit in your quest log for quite some time. It could be many hours until you finish it, and there are quite a few steps along the way to resolving it.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I’ve put together a Magnum Opus quest guide, designed to help you conquer the most troublesome objective – finding Nikvard in Kingdom Come Deliverance. He’s a slippery character, but in this guide, you’ll learn Nikvard’s location in just a few steps.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-finding-nikvard-in-kingdom-come">Finding Nikvard in Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>Magnum Opus will be handed to you by the Lower Semine Miller if you follow his quest line.</p>



<p>It requires Henry of Skalitz to find his way into Trosky Castle and liberate a book that’s hidden somewhere within, but details are sparse. As the quest pieces itself together, Henry concocts a plan to get himself inside, but things quickly turn awry.</p>



<p>Once you’ve made your way into Trosky Castle (against your will), you’ll find yourself facing the objective with almost nothing to guide you on your quest. Talking to the Scribe and some of the castle’s occupants doesn’t reveal much, and ultimately, you learn that Nikvard has the book, <strong>but nobody knows where he is</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-where-to-find-nikvard-for-magnum-opus">Where to Find Nikvard for Magnum Opus</h3>



<p>Nikvard has the book – that much is obvious.</p>



<p>If you want to go through the various speech checks and minor actions to advance the quest and level up some skills, feel free to follow the quest as it was designed. If you’d rather skip that and head straight to Nikvard’s location to force the completion of the quest, then you’ll need to go here:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Look for the red flag!</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The red and yellow flag marker is where you’ll find Nikvard in KCD2</strong>.</p>



<p>The location of the Magnum Opus in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is actually <strong>outside </strong>the castle grounds. It seems that Nikvard had a spot of bother with his digestive health and the book ended up falling down a latrine, passing through the sewer pipe and landing on the floor outside the castle.</p>



<p>It’s sitting immediately alongside Nikvard’s dead body, which is a shame. He seemed like he would have been a nice guy.</p>



<p>Don’t worry, the guard standing nearby commenting on the dead body won’t mind you taking the book – but the Miller will comment on how badly it smells when you take it back to him.</p>

<p>There’s yet another rumor suggesting that the next PlayStation State of Play is coming this month. This one, however, has a date tied to the claim.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxgL5aFU6I7_BMaJmsuX3xaYVbkLo9cv_Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PH Brazil</a>, PlayStation is set to host its next State of Play on Friday, February 14. His claims back up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prior ones from Nate the Hate</a> of an event happening in February.</p>



<p>PlayStation’s last State of Play took place in September 2024. That event included games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a>, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Palworld, and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-revealed-at-state-of-play-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>. In total, they held four in 2024, with the first happening on January 31. </p>



<p>As far as what this State of Play would include, that wasn’t hinted at. There are plans for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-more-xbox-games-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more Xbox games</a> to make their way to the PlayStation 5, so it could be the time for some announcements on that front. Halo and Gears of War are two of the bigger names making the rounds online, though there is nothing to confirm those being the next games to come.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony for comment on these growing rumors. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>
