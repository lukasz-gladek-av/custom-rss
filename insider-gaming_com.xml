<p>Microsoft is kicking off the year the same way it did 2024, holding layoffs across the company. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-hit-security-devices-sales-gaming-2025-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Business Insider</a>, Microsoft is letting go people from its sales, security, and gaming teams.</p>



<p>Business Insider sources say that employees started getting notifications of the layoffs on Tuesday. Microsoft told the outlet that the layoffs “are small” while not giving information on the number of cuts.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft about the exact number of people being let go from the gaming division in this latest round of layoffs. As of publishing, no response has been received.</p>



<p>In January 2024, Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-microsoft-layoffs-affect-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let go 1,900 people</a> from its gaming team after it closed on its purchase of Activision Blizzard. More layoffs were held throughout the year via studio closures and other mass layoffs, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-650-people-lay-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including 650 people</a> in September 2024. The company even shut down four studios in May 2024, including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. Tango Gameworks, however, would ultimately be purchased by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-acquired-by-pubg-publisher-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Krafton </a>and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-rebirth-krafton-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relaunched</a>.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/transformers-reactivate-cancelled-splash-damage-to-lay-off-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transformers: Reactivate Cancelled, Splash Damage To Lay Off Developers</a></h6>



<p>Last year saw nearly 16,000 people let go from their jobs in the games industry across more than 160 companies.  In the first 15 days of 2025, <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">there have been 10 known layoffs</a> and closures with at least 160+ people let go based on known numbers. With estimates, we are looking at well over 200 people thus far. </p>

<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 announcement feels imminent if rumors and leaks are to be believed. Every passing day feels like an excruciating wait for Nintendo fans, so we’ve collated every possible detail including the latest rumors, leaks, and Switch 2 speculation—including a potential Nintendo Direct in January 2025.</p>



<p>March 3, 2017, was a landmark day in the annals of gaming history. It was the official launch of the Nintendo Switch. A money-making phenomenon that has allegedly sold close to (if not more than) <strong>150 million units</strong>. The OG Switch has printed money for Nintendo, and after eight years, it’s about time we got its successor—the long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/we-desperately-need-the-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Rumors and gossip have circulated for months about when its announcement could be. 2025 has picked up where 2024 left off, only, the speculation has intensified one millionfold. The Nintendo Switch 2’s announcement feels closer than ever, and evidence supports this.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-date">Do we Know the Nintendo Switch 2 Announcement Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a line-up. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No official date has been officially or unofficially announced yet regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement, but it’s believed it could arrive on Thursday, January 16.</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo hasn’t confirmed the existence of the console, but it has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-acknowledges-recent-nintendo-switch-2-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged the Switch 2 leaks</a>. The company’s response was in retaliation to alleged <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-have-seemingly-surfaced-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons surfacing</a>. </p>



<p>Nintendo has previously said the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 will be announced before April 2025</a>. Everything feels like it’s dovetailing nicely, and the rumors are only the beginning.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-direct-january-2025-rumors-amp-leaks">Nintendo Direct January 2025 Rumors &amp; Leaks</h2>



<p><strong>A January 2025 Nintendo Direct could be on the cards with the showcase happening as early as the week of January 13.</strong></p>



<p>As of writing, this means the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-revealed-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 is being announced this week</a>! This is the biggest <em>take with a pinch of salt</em> imaginable, but the source is a reliable one. YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nate the Hate</a> says the console is going to be shown off, along with a reveal trailer.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Nintendo 2025 Predictions: When Switch 2 Will be Revealed &amp; Major 3rd Party Support; 3D Mario &amp; More" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RWifbMkXe_4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Nate also says the Direct will “<strong>focus almost exclusively on the console itself</strong>” and is saving software reveals and information for a later date.</p>



<p>Again, <strong>January 16</strong> is being outed as the crucial date, but we’ll update you as and when we get new information or leaks.</p>

<p>2025 could be a big year for Nintendo Switch 2 games, and possible launch-day software includes <strong>Metroid Prime 4</strong>, <strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</strong>, and <strong>classic Xbox titles</strong> too.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond</a> seems like a logical choice to help shift units at launch.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-ceo-wants-a-list-to-be-violently-killed-in-the-movie/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-ceo-wants-a-listers-to-be-%E2%80%98violently-killed%E2%80%99-in-the-movie.1082787/</guid>

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios CEO has recently stated that he would like to see A-list actors “get violently killed” in the upcoming Helldivers movie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1i1sa6p/arrowhead_ceo_on_actors_for_the_helldivers_movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Helldivers</a> subreddit (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-movie-arrowhead-wants-hollywood-stars-die-opening-montage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>), the Helldivers 2 community has been discussing the upcoming movie in its official Discord channel, where the CEO, Shams Jorjani, recently shared some interesting thoughts. When asked whether the team knows details about the upcoming film, Jorjani responded that they do have some information, as the production keeps them “in the loop.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jorjani was also asked whether A-list actors like “Chris Pratt” will be featured in the upcoming Helldivers movie. He replied that the whole team is “hoping for as many A-list actors as possible—as long as they all get killed violently immediately.” </p>



<p>The essence of Helldivers 2 comes from giving your life for democracy, and the developers want this same form of hilarious self-sacrifice to be relayed in the movie, too.&nbsp;Players have already started making their predictions in the comment section, hoping to see the likes of Sean Bean, Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Tom Holland and more get killed. Fans also don’t mind joining in as nameless actors if they get the opportunity to be mowed down by friendly fire. </p>



<p>On the topic of the Helldivers movie, the creative director also revealed Arrowhead’s involvement in the upcoming film, explaining that they are unaware of what it takes to make a movie and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-director-talks-about-their-involvement-with-the-upcoming-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“don’t, and shouldn’t, have the final say.”</a></p>



<p>In other news, Helldivers 2 developers have already begun fleshing out the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dev-next-game-concept/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high concept’ for the team’s next game</a>. Also, the title was Insider Gaming Community’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-best-multiplayer-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Best Multiplayer Game” of 2024</a>.
