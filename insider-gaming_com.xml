The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Between PvP, PvE, and PvPvE, there are a lot of terms to remember in online shooters. ARC Raiders is notorious for its player versus player and player versus AI gameplay, but many raiders just want a PvE experience.</p>



<p>The thought of coming up against another human player is a double-edged sword in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders.</a> On one hand, they could be a noob and a far less tough adversary compared to AI, or they could be a pinpoint wizard who can laser you from a mile away.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-there-a-pve-mode-in-arc-raiders">Is There A PvE Mode In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>All too familiar. Credit to Embark</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>ARC Raiders does not have a dedicated PvE mode, and playlist options are restricted purely to PvPvE gameplay, incorporating both human and AI threats.</strong></p>



<p>The call for a PvE-specific game mode grows stronger week by week. ARC Raiders’ player base is still holding strong months after launch, but a large segment of the audience wants PvE.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More IG: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-budget-was-75-million-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders budget was $75 Million, it’s claimed</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Embark is freshening things up, but a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-arc-raiders-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking</a> option isn’t something people are crying out for. The community wants PvE, and they currently aren’t getting it.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-pve-rumor-explained">ARC Raiders PvE Rumor, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>A social media post from the <a href="https://x.com/SperanzaIntel"></a>Speranza Intel X account unexpectedly went viral and caused a lot of confusion as it unintentionally caused ARC Raiders fans to think Embark had confirmed a PvE mode was arriving in 2026.</strong><a href="https://x.com/SperanzaIntel"></a></p>



<p>On February 1, <a href="https://x.com/SperanzaIntel"></a>Speranza Intel posted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Embark Studios has officially ⁿᵒᵗ confirmed the introduction of a PvE mode, planned for release in Q2 2026.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Because of the way it’s worded and the style of the font and size on “not,” it’s very easy to overlook the word. The message has since racked up over 800,000 views on X, and word of mouth through the grapevine is a powerful and dangerous tool.</p>



<p>The account later apologized for the initial message, outing its “joke tweet,” and confirming that Embark has given no confirmation about a PvE mode.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorry, we didn’t expect this tweet to blow up. It was meant to be a joke tweet, but since many of you seem to have misread it, let us clarify. It says that Embark Studios has not officially confirmed this.</p>— Speranza Intel (@SperanzaIntel) <a href="https://twitter.com/SperanzaIntel/status/2018064473148502143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-will-pve-ever-come-to-arc-raiders">Will PvE Ever Come To ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More of this would be nice. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The developer is always working on new content for ARC Raiders, and while Embark has not mentioned that PvE is coming, it’s always a possibility.</strong></p>



<p>This is 100% specualtion more than anything else. However, Embark generally listens to fans. With so much planned in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026 roadmap</a> and more game modes and LTMs on the way, it’s impossible to rule out a PvE-only mode arriving.</p>

<p>Console boundaries are constantly shifting, especially concerning Xbox. It seems like most of their titles are playable on other platforms, and plenty of them are available as part of the Game Pass service.</p>







<p>When it comes to third-party titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a>, though, it’s not always a guarantee that they’ll appear on Xbox, let alone on Game Pass. If you were hoping to pick up Suda51’s latest title on Game Pass, then allow Insider Gaming to let you know if you stand a chance.</p>

<p><strong>Yes, Romeo Is A Dead Man will be available to play on both Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>Suda51’s titles have appeared on Xbox platforms in the past, so it’s not surprising that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-romeo-is-a-dead-man-have-early-access/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/does-romeo-is-a-dead-man-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a> will be available on the Series X|S. With the latest and greatest consoles available, expect to see bloody and gory brilliance like Grasshopper Manufacture has never displayed before.</p>







<p>However, while it may be available on the console, that doesn’t mean it will necessarily appear on Xbox Game Pass. </p>

<p><strong>Whilst Romeo Is A Dead Man will be playable on Xbox consoles, it won’t be available as part of the Xbox Game Pass service. </strong></p>



<p>Whilst it may not launch on the service, that’s not to say that it will never be available there in the future. Xbox often pick up third-party titles after they’ve released and includes them as part of the deal—maybe Romeo Is A Dead Man could feature down the line?</p>



<p>If it ever does, Insider Gaming will be the first to let you know, so keep your eyes peeled on the site and the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" id="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> for Xbox Game Pass updates. </p>
