            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has said that GTA 6 will have a “fair price” when the game releases in 2026.</p>



<p>Following a question from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/take-two-gta-6-pricing-debate-june-earnings-1236481561/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> ahead of Take-Two’s recent quarterly earnings report, the outlet asked Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick about $80 games and what that means for GTA 6.</p>



<p>According to Zelnick, that announcement will come from Rockstar Games, the developer behind GTA 6, in due time.</p>



<p>“Our goal always is to deliver more value than what we charge, so we’ve had variable pricing at the company forever. As you know, the approach of the industry is to launch at a premium price, sometimes with special editions, and over time, typically to reduce the price to enhance the overall size of the market. We do the very same thing. I think, probably more than most, we’re highly focused on making sure that the experience is great, not just because the game itself is great, but also because consumers have paid a fair price for it,” Zelnick said.</p>



<p>So to put it bluntly, Zelnick dodged the question pretty perfectly (hurrah for training), diverting the question from the actual price point to the value to customers.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-gta-6-release-at-the-80-price-point">Will GTA 6 Release at the $80 Price Point?</h2>



<p>Frankly, I find it hard to believe that GTA 6 won’t release at $80. Nintendo has already got the accolade for being the first publisher to make that plunge, and while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-cuts-prices-of-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-holiday-xbox-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft recently pulled back on their price increase</a>s, Take-Two won’t want to miss out on another 14% increase, especially for a game like Grand Theft Auto that is going to sell at that price point regardless.</p>



<p>Will other publishers follow suit with $80 games after GTA 6? I’d argue yes, and while Microsoft’s decision to revert their price points suggests otherwise, I believe it was a strategic move based on their current game pipeline and the issues the company is currently facing.</p>



<p>Another common rumor floating around is that GTA 6 will launch at $100, and while I don’t think that will be the case, they’ll almost certainly have an edition to tempt us, and likely go beyond that price point. </p>



<p>What do you think of GTA 6 costing $80 is a fair price? Do you think it will be justified, and what do you think of other games following suit?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals has a year’s worth of new characters planned, and preparation 12 months in advance for new heroes is underway, Marvel Rivals Director Guangguang has revealed to Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>New heroes are one of the core features of Marvel Rivals, which has transitioned into introducing a new hero every half-season, and the next 12 months of content are prepared.</p>



<p>Speaking exclusively to Insider Gaming at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ignite-mid-season-finals-complete-scores-standings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals Ignite Mid-Season Finals</a> in Guangzhou, Guangguang revealed that initial work has begun on characters set to be released this time next year.</p>

<p>It takes “about a year” to bring a new character into <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>, with a long list of work to be done that includes gameplay aspects, concept art, modelling, animation, and voice acting. Therefore, content is planned for the next 12 months and beyond.</p>



<p>While other games have adopted a yearly roadmap for content drops, highlighting what players can expect in the months ahead, Guangguang explained why the preferred approach for Rivals is to reveal new content at the start of each season to maintain “freshness and surprises.”</p>



<p>This approach also allows the Rivals team to keep a close eye on what the playerbase and Marvel fans are enjoying most, paying attention to their discussions to see how that can inspire the team to see what they can come up with.</p>



<p>One of the most highly requested additions from the community is Deadpool, but Guangguang did not confirm whether Wade Wilson is on the release schedule for the next year, telling fans to “stay tuned” for future reveals.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-bans-issued/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-3-600-bans-issued-in-21-days.1265373/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has taken to social media to announce that 3,600 <strong>more cheaters </strong>have been banned from Escape from Tarkov in a 21-day window that ended yesterday, August 7. To some, this might look like a huge success, but to those in the know, this is business as usual for Escape from Tarkov, a game utterly plagued by malicious operators.</p>



<p>Recently, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheating-situation-nikita-speaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fight against cheaters</a> is ‘hard and never-ending’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-eternal-battle">Eternal Battle</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is one of the worst games when it comes to cheaters, and it has been that way for a few years. It’s one of the reasons why the launch of Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform was such a success, as it allows players to get the fundamental Tarkov experience without running into cheaters.</p>



<p>In a document posted on social media, the Battlestate Games team revealed that more than 3,600 cheaters had been banned during a 21-day window spanning July 17 to August 7.</p>



<p>Even a cursory glance <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQKZ0uxCB5Zi3Q3PsM_Ud4opkrpAeNax6UxrfBJFN0uxLPbcSRJqXCo7BChE7OCQu7jQWLwL8stGYO5/pubhtml?gid=1329899061&amp;single=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">at the document</a> reveals some of the key concerns about the cheating epidemic spoiling the most popular extraction shooter ever made. For instance, there are batches of accounts with almost the same name, which indicates that cheaters are running multiple accounts and have plenty of backups to work through.</p>



<p>In a few months, Escape from Tarkov is expected to finally graduate from early access and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become a fully released title</a>, but many claim that the game isn’t 1.0-ready, especially as the title is still swarming with cheaters.</p>



<p>It’s one of the biggest hurdles to the game’s success in longevity, and it’s why the peak player counts for the games are believed to be sliding. Recently, Battlestate Games unveiled a rare glimpse at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-player-count-rare-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s player count</a>, which prompted fans to wonder what portion of that count is represented by cheaters.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty To Rely on 17-Year-Old Character to Drive Pre-Orders for Black Ops 7]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-rely-on-17-year-old-reznov-pre-orders/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-to-rely-on-17-year-old-character-to-drive-pre-orders-for-black-ops-7.1265370/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been discovered that Activision’s studios are preparing to rely on the resurgence of a character almost two decades old to drive pre-order volume for Black Ops 7. In a series of posts on social media, the ‘Reznov Challenge Pack’ was unveiled, with dataminers finding a triple pack of skins focused on Victor Reznov, a character first seen in 2008’s World at War.</p>



<p>Reznov has surfaced a few times in the Call of Duty timeline, and his appearance in the pre-order pack for Black Ops 7 comes as little surprise, given how accustomed Activision has been to relying on nostalgia to drive sales.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-reznov-revealed">Reznov Revealed</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, HeyImAlaix revealed the three Reznov skins reportedly coming to Black Ops 6 and Warzone when you pre-order Black Ops 7:</p>











<p>This was followed up by a video from realityuk that shows the skins from all perspectives:</p>











<p>The same profile also uploaded shots <a href="https://x.com/realityuk/status/1953569138560971009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of some pre-order screens</a>, specifically the one that thanks players for pre-ordering Black Ops 7 and immediately unlocking the ‘SOG Reznov Operator’ pack.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many Call of Duty fans lambasted the skins, stressing that the character doesn’t look like the Reznov they know and love. Others were quick to highlight that Activision’s studios did the same thing before Black Ops 6’s release, allowing users to unlock a triple pack of Woods skins for pre-ordering the game:</p>



<div><article><a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1953503715945484678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Replying to @charlieINTEL</a><p><span>Literally the same pre order rewards as BO6 but instead it’s Reznov. They are relying heavily on nostalgia to keep this game alive😂 </span></p></article></div>







<p>As Battlefield 6 enters a beta period and takes the world by storm, decimating every Call of Duty game, we have to wonder about Activision’s marketing efforts. Is relying on a character revealed almost 20 years ago the best way forward when your chief competitor is bringing so much fresh content to the table?</p>



<p>Nostalgia sells, I guess.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that this content is the result of datamining efforts, which means there’s every potential it’ll change or be stripped entirely in the coming weeks.</p>
