<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embar</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">k Studios</a> has confirmed what’s making ‘Shrouded Sky’ so <strong>shrouded </strong>when the next major ARC Raiders update comes around in just a few days. The next update hits <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> on February 24th, introducing a new small-scale ARC enemy, a map overhaul, some new quests, an Expedition Project, and a <strong>new map condition</strong>.</p>



<p>Fans have been racking their brains trying to think of what the new map condition could be, but Embark Studios has finally confirmed it. The world outside Speranza is about to be rocked by a hurricane.</p>







<h2 id="h-hurricanes-are-coming-to-arc-raiders">Hurricanes Are Coming to ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new blog post</a>, Embark Studios has confirmed what’s coming on February 24th with Shrouded Sky, focusing on the new map condition. Based on the data available, we always thought it would be a ‘Toxic Swamp’ map condition, but that might be lined up for a later update.</p>



<p>For now, we’re getting <strong>Hurricane</strong>.</p>



<p>This will change the game’s weather and physics, introducing powerful winds that heavily impact players as they explore the maps:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The wind will change how you navigate topside. When you have a tailwind, you’ll feel fast and nimble, but fighting against the gales will inhibit your speed and quickly drain your stamina. Throwables will also behave differently in these conditions, and it may take a while to master the trajectory of thrown items like grenades. Other aspects of gameplay like smoke, gas, and even jumping will be affected by the power of the Hurricane.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Debris will fly around at breakneck speed, striking the player and causing their shields to glitch. Embark has advised that you might prefer to remove your shield entirely, as the bits and pieces flying around will make your shield degrade and spark, making you <strong>very </strong>visible.</p>



<p>Further, visibility will take a huge hit in Shrouded Sky under the Hurricane map condition. Players will find themselves enveloped by thick mists that make spotting ARC and other Raiders almost impossible. That, combined with the ‘howling winds’, means that navigating the maps will be much tougher than usual.</p>



<p>The gem of the Hurricane map condition is a new stack of First Waves Caches, buried boxes containing rare relics that have been unearthed by the violent winds and harrowing rain.</p>

<p>A new report reveals that PlayStation has decided to shut down Bluepoint Games. </p>



<p>Bluepoint Games has been instrumental in enhancing past titles for the current-gen consoles, including Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection and Shadow of the Colossus. The team was also responsible for bringing us the PlayStation 5 remake of Demon’s Souls. Now, the studio has been closed down. </p>







<h2 id="h-bluepoint-games-will-shut-down-next-month">Bluepoint Games Will Shut Down Next Month</h2>



<p>According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTUyNzAyNiwiZXhwIjoxNzcyMTMxODI2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQVBZWlBLR0lGUFkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.utABYnI4m_K6kqNqybZarBQ9T5WW_aWCH6NI3kt8Q64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>&nbsp;report, PlayStation has decided to close Bluepoint Games, leading to the dismissal of approximately 70 employees from a total of 80. A spokesperson for PlayStation stated that this decision was made “following a business review.” The shutdown of Bluepoint Games is scheduled for next month. Here is the PlayStation spokesperson’s statement:</p>
