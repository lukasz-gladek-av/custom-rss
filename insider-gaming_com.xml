<p>Sony is gearing up to enter the handheld console market. A new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch?leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a> states that Sony is developing a portable handheld console that would allow people to play their PlayStation 5 (PS5) games while on the go.</p>



<p>According to the report, development on this new system is in the “early stages”.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>“Sony’s portable device is likely years away from launch and the company could still decide against bringing it to market, the people said, asking not to be named discussing private plans,” the report reads.</p>



<p>It’s said that the development “builds on the PlayStation Portal”. As opposed to playing games via streaming them from the console over the internet, however, this new device will be an actual console that is aiming at competing with the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo’s upcoming Switch successor. Bloomberg adds that sources told them that Sony’s original plan for the Portal was for it to work as a standalone system “like Valve’s Steam Deck” before it became the streaming device it is.</p>



<p>Sony declined to comment to Bloomberg on the report.</p>



<p>In addition to PlayStation developing a handheld console, Microsoft is also working on their own handheld to tap into the market. Xbox boss Phil Spencer says that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-handheld-confirmed-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their handheld is still “years away”</a>.</p>

<p>PerriKaryal surfaced at DreamHack Stockholm, and for a few minutes, she sat down with Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky to discuss the origins, and more importantly, the future of her <strong>thing</strong>. For a while, Perri has been creating top-tier content by using an EEG device that translates her brain activity into game-based inputs.</p>



<p>In the last few months, she has beaten Elden Ring’s hardest boss using nothing but her brainwaves, and recently, she tried to master FPS titles using her EEG-powered abilities. At DreamHack, she spoke about where it all goes from here.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-and-more-complicated">‘More and More Complicated’</h2>



<p>As if it didn’t sound impressive enough, Perri endeavours to make her ‘mind control’ gaming efforts more complex. While speaking to Jake Lucky at DreamHack Stockholm, she explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Currently, I’m just trying to get more and more complicated, so doing things like World of Warcraftg with all of these different inputs and finding ways to do that. I’m combining multiple EEGs, literally wearing more than one at the same time, to keep adding more and more commands.</p>



<p>I’m trying to play games just with mind control. Currently, I use mind control for buttons on a virtual Xbox controller, but then gyro and eye-tracking for the joysticks, and I’m trying to completely banish that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Perri explained to Jake that her next conquest is a psychic-only Pokémon run using <strong>just </strong>mind control.</p>



<p>On the topic of the tech ever making it into the mainstream, Perri – who has a Master’s in Psychology – admitted that the technology is a little archaic and inaccurate, but the next step could involve <strong>implants</strong>. In the vein of Musk’s Neuralink technology, an implant would circumvent the need to wear multiple devices to use your brainwaves to play games.</p>



<p>The immediate future, Perri hopes, looks positive for the development of this technology. Jake asked her where she thinks this will go in the next ‘decade-plus’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think just building super, super immersive gaming rigs, but then also for everything. Recently, I controlled robot arms with mind control, which was very cool. Hopefully, it gets to the stage where it can help people with accessibility issues. Currently, the tech is so hard to use that it’s not really a viable solution.</p>



<p>If it can get to the stage where it’s actually helpful, and super immersive, and then you can create games that are around it. I think the possibilities are infinite.</p>



<p>The sky’s the limit.</p>
</blockquote>
