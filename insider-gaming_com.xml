<p>I was fortunate enough to get hands-on with Splitgate 2 a month before the game entered the current open alpha. I also had the chance to sit down with Ian Proulx, the co-founder and CEO of 1047 Studios, the developer behind this high-octane shooter. As I explored the intense mechanics of Splitgate 2, I found myself gelling <strong>very nicely </strong>with what was on offer.</p>



<p>As questions were put to Proulx, I learned about the future of Splitgate 2, which is a direct follow-on from the shooter that was released in 2019 on PC, and then later on console. In this sequel, evolution is the order of the day.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-to-do">More To Do</h2>



<p>Ian Proulx was very transparent about the areas in which Splitgate (the first game) fell short. The title had awesome short-term retention, but players dropped off alarmingly fast after realising that there wasn’t much ‘to do’ or chase in the game.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was super fun, super simple, but it lacked variety and that staying power. </p>



<p>We had really strong short-term retention, our day one and day seven was world class – better than many of the top shooters you’ll see today. </p>



<p>But what we saw is players would come on, play for 3 or 4 weeks, and then say, ‘now what?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team at 1047 Games has addressed those concerns in the follow-up title.</p>



<p>There will be more things to unlock, and as Proulx said, ‘We can keep you on the hook for longer by giving you more content over time.’ This will include seasonal events, ‘lots of live-ops stuff’, and customisation elements. </p>



<p>The game has been bolstered immeasurably by new movement mechanics, like sliding, and a massive 24-player multi-team mode inspired by Halo’s Big Team Battle mode. It’s also being released on PS4 and Xbox One to serve the last generation of players quite nicely, which is a solid touch from the team.</p>



<p>In the last few years, Splitgate 2’s potential has allowed 1047 Games to expand from a team of 10 to almost 200 employees, all of which are stoked about the impending launch of this fantastic shooter.</p>



<p>I asked Ian Proulx about the proposed operating model for the game, given that so many free-to-play shooters have launched in recent years – and not all of them have succeeded.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Splitgate 2 will be free-to-play.</p>



<p>We’re innovating on gameplay, we’re not innovating on monetisation.</p>



<p>(It’ll feature) traditional industry elements and no pay-to-win or gacha mechanics.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to play the Splitgate 2 alpha ahead of the release, thanks to 1047 Games. Before the session took place, I sat down with the studio’s CEO to talk about the development – and more importantly, the future – of this innovative first-person shooter.</p>



<p>Given my passion for the industry, I was eager to learn whether esports plans sat in the pipeline for Splitgate 2. My discussion with Ian Proulx, also one of the studio’s founders, revealed exciting things about the competitive future of Splitgate 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-future-is-competitive">The Future is Competitive</h2>



<p>Splitgate 2 is a phenomenal shooter with stacks of potential. When I got hands-on with the title a month before it entered the current alpha playtest, I was instantly hooked. The fast-paced gameplay twinned with genuinely enjoyable weapon mechanics had me by the throat – in a good way. I was <strong>enthused </strong>by what I experienced.</p>



<p>In a brief conversation with Ian Proulx, I dove into the competitive landscape for Splitgate 2, learning about the potential for this game to slot nicely into the esports landscape.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I would say it’s not a priority for launch, but I definitely see this game being an esport one day.</p>



<p>We like games that are fair, and that falls under the ‘fun category’ for me. We also like the fact that the game has a lot of skill expression, which nautrally lends itself to esports.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Splitgate 2 uses genius ‘portal mechanics’ that allow players to warp around the battlefield like never before. It adds a unique element to the pacing, which is otherwise built around a typical run-and-gun operating model.</p>



<p>Proulx continued:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For us, the top priority is, ‘Let’s just go and make a fun shooter.’</p>



<p>If we do that and it turns into an esport, that’s great – but if it’s just a casual thing, that’s great too.</p>



<p>That said, I would love for this to be an esport one day. It’s a post-launch thing and not something I want to force or prioritise, though.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s typically quite tough for new games to elbow their way into the esports market. It has been dominated for so long by The Big Three: Counter-Strike, League of Legends, and Dota 2. Other titles have cut their way into the wider business, but it’s tough.</p>



<p>In recent years, the most successful <strong>new </strong>game was VALORANT, but that’s backed by Riot Games, so the foothold was already there. For a new IP to break into the market successfully, a perfect storm of positive circumstances must unfold.</p>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket and a Ranked Mode would go hand in hand. Players can already battle the computer—and each other—and there are a ton of cards to choose from. A ton of features have already made their way into Pokémon TCG Pocket, and Ranked Mode needs to be one of them.</p>



<p>It’s amazing to see how Pokémon TCG Pocket has gone from strength to strength since launch. New sets have continually been added from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-space-time-smackdown-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space-Time Smackdown</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-officially-announced-ranked-battles-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a>. But the community is always asking for new content and modes to be welcomed. It was a big day when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading</a> was finally integrated into Pocket.</p>



<p>Another core gameplay mechanic Pokémon TCG Pocket is missing is Ranked Battles. Are the player’s cries being heard? Or will the wait go on?</p>

<p><strong>Ranked Mode finally debuts in Pokémon TCG Pocket at the end of March 2025.</strong></p>



<p>The long-awaited news came during the exciting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Pokemon Presents</a> affair. The special presentation celebrated all things Pokémon and included breaking news and ended with a groundbreaking gameplay trailer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-gets-release-window-extended-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>. Amidst the reveals and content drops, we were informed of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-officially-announced-ranked-battles-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a>—a new Pokémon TCG Pocket booster set.</p>



<p>This was cool, but what was even cooler was the set’s trailer also mentioned Ranked Matches at the very end of it. Even though a specific date wasn’t given, we know for sure it’s coming at the end of March 2025. A delay could happen between now and then, so be prepared for the worst, if not, you can use your best decks to conquer opponents in Ranked Mode.</p>



<p>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Official Pokémon YouTube channel</a>‘s full Triumphant Light trailer below—featuring the Ranked Battles mention for the finale.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-is-ranked-mode-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">What is Ranked Mode in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s not confirmed, but we believe Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Ranked Mode is a conventional ranked system whereby players are matched up into divisions or leagues appropriate to their skill level, and wins and losses determine if you rise or fall through the ranks.</strong></p>



<p>Let’s say there are 10 ranked divisions for Ranked Mode. if you’re in Rank 5, winning matches in a row may end up with you <strong>being promoted</strong> to Rank 4, then 3, and so forth. Consecutive losses could very well see you <strong>drop down the rankings</strong>.</p>



<p>Many Pokémon TCG Pocket decks revolve around coin flips, the cards you draw, and a lot of luck overall. So it will be interesting to see if any rules and regulations are established for Ranked Mode.</p>



<hr>



<p>Could the addition of Ranked Mode be a game-changing feature for Pokémon TCG Pocket? Have you already got a deck in mind to frustrate and defeat opponents?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/4a-games-rebrand-reburn-la-quimera/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>4A Games Ukraine, one of the studios behind the Metro franchise, has revealed a rebrand and an all-new IP. It’s called ‘La Quimera’, which is Spanish for ‘The Chimera’. The game and the studio’s foundation were leaked recently, but today, a full and official announcement has taken place, with the game’s first trailer debuting online.</p>



<p>La Quimera is a futuristic sci-fi shooter set in Latin America, and it boasts a narrative-driven campaign that can be played either solo or with friends. The game has been written by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, The Neon Demon), and it features a combination of Latin American folklore and ‘advanced weaponry and technology.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-introducing-reburn">Introducing Reburn</h2>



<p>Reburn is a rebranding of 4A Games Ukraine, and it’s an independent studio with around 110 employees. Many of these developers have worked on the Metro franchise, and some have experience going back to the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game. The studio is being led by Dmytro Lymar, a twenty-year industry veteran.</p>



<p>It’s a little confusing, admittedly. The long and short of it is that in 2014, a split took place at 4A Games that left part of the company in the Ukraine while another branch opened up in Malta, but they both shared technology and teams and collaborated on games like Metro Exodus.</p>



<p>In 2020, Embracer acquired the 4A team in Malta, while the 4A Ukraine studio started working on La Quimera after landing fresh funding and becoming much more independent. While 4A Games (Malta) continues to work on Metro, Reburn is an entirely separate entity working on this all-new IP.</p>



<p>In a statement, Lymar said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series</em>. <em>We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>La Quimera is set in a Latin American megalopolis and ‘lush jungle’. Players will be able to adorn themselves in an advanced suit of armour as they battle rival factions across what looks like a gorgeous world. In a press release, it was stressed that the game has ‘tense gunplay and intimate storytelling’.</p>



<p>Here’s the announcement trailer for La Quimera:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="La Quimera - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It looks good, and it’s a wonder it has been kept under wraps for so long. The team at Reburn has been working on La Quimera for almost five years, and if the announcement trailer is anything to go by, it should be a banger of a title.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of the enemies that seem to resemble the Helghast from the Killzone franchise.</p>



<p>The game can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">wishlisted on Steam</a>, but no release window has been confirmed for the game.</p>
