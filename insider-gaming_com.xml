<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 has concluded with a series between two titans: Team Vitality, the tournament favorite, and FaZe Clan, an unexpected entrant to the grand final. In the end, Vitality proved unstoppable, defeating FaZe Clan with a memorable 3-1 finish and securing back-to-back Major trophies.</p>

<p>The grand final began with FaZe Clan picking Nuke, where they managed to edge out Team Vitality with a strong scoreline, presenting fans with promise in the earliest map of the final. However, Vitality quickly regained control, crushing FaZe 13-3 in the follow-up. From there, the French-led roster never looked back.</p>



<p>It was a decisive victory for Team Vitality, which has gone down in the history books after putting up one of the best single seasons in the world of esports this year. The team claimed the half-a-million-dollar prize and lifted <strong>another trophy </strong>in 2025.</p>



<p>This makes Vitality the first team since 2019 to secure consecutive Major titles, which is a perfect way to end the season. For FaZe, the loss is a bittersweet one. It was a rocky year for the team, and many had their doubts going into the tournament, let alone the grand final.</p>



<p>Fans of the organization were begging for a redemption shot at the final Major of 2025, but it just wasn’t to be.</p>



<p>Now, we start looking to the 2026 esports calendar and whatever comes next.</p>
