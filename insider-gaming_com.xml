<p>Resident Evil Requiem director has arrived with new details about the upcoming title after their big reveal at The Game Awards 2025, stating it’s almost like playing two games. </p>



<p>Capcom has kept a lot of stuff under wraps since Resident Evil Requiem was revealed, with Leon Kennedy being playable as the biggest secret of them all. However, we had an idea from the leaks, but confirmation was required. Now that Leon has been officially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-the-game-awards-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a>, the director has revealed how the gameplay of both characters contrasts. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-s-leon-and-grace-sections-are-almost-equally-split-but-heavily-differ-from-each-other">Resident Evil Requiem’s Leon and Grace Sections are ‘Almost Equally Split’, But Heavily Differ From Each Other</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Resident Evil Requiem director Akifumi Nakanishi&nbsp;spoke about Leon and Grace’s gameplay, along with other details. Nakanishi first revealed that “in terms of gameplay, Grace and Leon’s playable sections are almost equally split,” with the structure being similar to Revelations. The director added that Leon isn’t “well suited to horror”, hence his sections “focus on intense, adrenaline-pumping action”. Grace has the scarier sections, and the devs are “really emphasizing the difference in their experiences this time.”</p>



<p>Nakanishi explains that the two experiences are “almost like having two games with completely different types of tension mixed together.” Players would feel like “jumping into a cold bath after sitting in a hot sauna,” he said while laughing. The director also revealed that Leon’s chapters are where the players will feel safer and scared again when Grace comes back on. It is a “consciously designed horror structure,” he stated. </p>

<p>Resident Evil insider has revealed details about the release windows for Code Veronica and Zero Remakes. </p>



<p>Based on insider information, it was already known that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next remakes</a> in development for the Resident Evil franchise are allegedly Code Veronica and Zero. The insider had also revealed earlier that these games are scheduled for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-resident-evil-remakes-are-releasing-in-2027-2028-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2027/2028</a>, but didn’t have exact details. Now, he is back with more. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-code-veronica-remake-will-reportedly-be-announced-next-year-and-release-in-2027">Resident Evil Code Veronica Remake Will Reportedly be Announced Next Year, And Release in 2027</h2>



<p>The new details about Resident Evil Code Veronica and Zero Remakes come from a prominent insider, Dusk Golem. Most recently, their highly anticipated leak about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-the-game-awards-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon being playable</a> in Requiem was proven to be true through a new trailer at The Game Awards 2025. Now they are back with a new scoop, this time providing us with the announcement and release windows for the next remakes in the franchise. </p>



<p>According to Dusk Golem’s new post on <a href="https://x.com/aestheticgamer1/status/1999736688848113831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), they have heard that Code Veronica will be announced in 2026 and released in 2027. The Zero Remake is scheduled to release in 2028. Readers should take this information with a grain of salt, as there is no official announcement regarding these release windows, and they may change depending on how development progresses. </p>







<p>Back in October 2025, it was reportedly revealed that Resident Evil 0 Remake is in development under the nickname ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-0-remake-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chamber</a>‘ and won’t be released until 2028. Additionally, Resident Evil Requiem leak suggests there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leak-reveal-new-playable-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another playable character</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-flickering-flames-update-notes/</link>
            <guid>1383409</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has published all the information you could want to know about the upcoming Cold Snap update, which includes the Flickering Flames event and the new Raider Deck. The update drops on all platforms <strong>tomorrow</strong>, and there are stacks to learn about what’s coming next in ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>The update includes a new community challenge, a fresh series of Feats to complete to unlock free rewards, and map conditions that present a dire threat to Raiders everywhere.</p>







<h2 id="h-cold-snap-new-map-condition">Cold Snap: New Map Condition</h2>



<p>From December 16, ARC Raiders players will be able to jump onto maps blanketed with snow and featuring a new map condition: Cold Snap. This condition is harmful and poses a serious threat to players:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>During the&nbsp;<strong>Cold Snap&nbsp;</strong>condition<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>the clock is ticking. The freezing weather will cut your Raider down in minutes unless you get indoors, or heal up quickly. Bear this in mind when engaging other Raiders – getting pinned down in the open is a death sentence during a Rust Belt winter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Flickering Flames is the new event coming to ARC Raiders tomorrow. The details have been outlined in a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/whats-coming-in-the-december-update">recent blog post</a> published by Embark Studios:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Below ground, the tenacity of the human spirit endures. Despite food scarcity and rolling blackouts, survivors gather to light candles, swap war stories, and appreciate what little they have. The festival of&nbsp;<strong>Flickering Flames</strong>&nbsp;is about to begin.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Candleberry</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Bush&nbsp;</strong>forms the centerpiece of these festivities. For Speranzans, this hardy plant is a versatile asset during the winter months: boiling the berry creates a wax that burns for hours. Crushing them yields a refreshing juice while the roots make for a tea that drives out the toughest colds. Candleberries make hearty stews, warming soups, and gifts of perfume and soap, while the wreaths can be fashioned into festive decorations that offer Speranzans a hint of Topside’s greenery. Speranza needs A LOT of them for the Candleberry Banquets!</p>



<p>Speranzans rely on other essential items through the winter too.&nbsp;<strong>Light and heat sources</strong>&nbsp;boost morale and help keep Speranzans comfortable, while giving them the best chance to fight through to the spring.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When you collect Candleberries and ‘other special items’, you’ll receive Raider Tokens, new items, rare utility items, weapons, cosmetics, and merit tokens, so there’s some give and take there. Players can unlock Merits simply for playing ARC Raiders, but finding and extracting Candleberries will elevate their gains.</p>



<p>An all-new Raider Deck will be introduced from <strong>December 26th</strong>, featuring a series of exclusive <strong>and free </strong>unlocks:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With our Winter Update, we’re also introducing our second<strong>&nbsp;free, permanent Raider Deck. Available from the 26th December</strong>, The Goalie Raider Deck lets you unlock a series of items, Raider Tokens, and Cosmetics as you earn Cred Topside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The flagship skin of the new Raider Deck is an old world outfit that some Speranzans have claimed was worn by the world’s most fierce and respected gladiators. Who knows, really? But hey, it comes with a pretty cool new hockey stick Raider Tool.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As explained, the new skin comes with the first new Raider Tool, which takes the form of a hockey stick, because why not?</p>



<p>Flickering Flames is a limited-time, winter-themed event that runs from December 16 until January 13, so be quick if you want to maximize your rewards.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re looking forward to the Cold Snap update.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Build To Climb monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Stumps, Pets and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Planting the tallest Stumps to reach the top and potentially to the next map is the primary goal of Build to Climb. Purchasing different Stumps will deplete your treasury and will take some time to earn all the money back. Plus, you will need the help of Pets to boost your Cash income. This is when you should use the active Build to Climb codes. Claim free Stumps and Pets using these codes. You’ll easily reach 9.6km and progress further within a few hours after redeeming the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-sorcerer-battlegrounds-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game codes.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="h-active-build-to-climb-codes-nbsp">Active Build To Climb Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>WELCOMEBUILDTOCLIMB – Mint Stump and Cat</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-inactive-build-to-climb-codes">Inactive Build To Climb Codes</h2>



<p>There are no expired codes in Build to Climb. If any active code goes inactive, it’ll be added here. Redeem all the active codes in a single sitting as they risk going inactive at any moment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-build-to-climb-codes">How To Redeem Build To Climb Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Roblox Build To Climb Code Redemption Menu | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>

<li>Click the “CHECK” button to redeem the active code.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-more-about-build-to-climb-codes">More About Build To Climb Codes</h2>



<p>Stumps are very important and contribute heavily to the Build to Climb gameplay. Players can easily increase the overall height of their giant stalks by using the free Stumps obtained from codes. The core principle of Build to Climb is that the more distance you cover, the more Cash you earn. You can easily earn thousands of Cash and invest it into new Stumps, however, note that certain Stumps must be unlocked by reaching specific height milestones.</p>



<ul>
<li>Blue Stump – 1km – 10,000$</li>



<li>Chocolate Stump – 2.8km – 40,000$</li>



<li>Purple Stump – 3.9km – 130,000$</li>



<li>Lemon Stump – 6.8km – 800,000$</li>
</ul>



<p>With that sorted, try purchasing Eggs to obtain Pets that provide Cash multipliers. The Cat, which is redeemed from an active code, is part of Egg 1. Below are all the Eggs, their Pets, and their hatch chances:</p>

<p>Hyung-tae Kim, the CEO of Shift Up and the director behind Stellar Blade, has received a Presidential Commendation in South Korea. This prestigious awardwas presented by the South Korean President himself, and it was given for Kim’s services to the domestic game industry. </p>



<p>While Stellar Blade was mentioned, the award was also given amidst recognition of Shift Up’s other games, like Goddess of Victory: NIKKE.</p>







<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-was-a-game-changing-title">Stellar Blade Was a Game-Changing Title</h2>



<p>Stellar Blade first dropped in April 2024, before being released on PC a little more than a year later. The game would go on to sell millions of copies, with players being pulled in by the visuals and staying for the combat and intriguing story.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that much of the attraction in Stellar Blade rests with the game’s protagonist, Eve. Her character model was built around a scanned representation of a South Korean glamour model, which gives you an idea of why the character was such a hit with gamers.</p>



<p>As revealed by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-director-hyung-tae-kim-receives-award-from-president-of-south-korea-for-contributions-to-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton Media</a>, Hyung-tae Kim, the visionary director behind Shift Up’s Stellar Blade, recently received an award from the South Korean President, Lee Jae Myung. This commendation was bestowed upon Kim because of his contributions to the industry and ‘achievements in overseas expansion’.</p>



<p>In the report, it was stressed that Kim ‘humbly thanked his development teams and Shift Up’ for their pivotal work on bringing Stellar Blade to life.</p>



<p>In September, it was confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/">a Stellar Blade sequel</a> was in development and moving along quite nicely. In November, reports were circulated suggesting that Shift Up was targeting more platforms for further Steller Blade expansion, eyeing up the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform-shift-up/">Xbox and Nintendo</a>.</p>

<p>Red Bull has created the world’s largest game of Tetris powered by 2000 drones as a part of the Red Bull Tetris World final.</p>



<p>The special event saw Red Bull use the iconic 150-metre high Dubai Frame, which opened in 2018, as the border for the Tetris game, which Red Bull says made the game the “world’s first open-air, live playable Tetris game”.</p>







<p>A grand total of 2800 drones were used for the game, with each player needing 1400 drones per game due to the drones’ battery life.</p>



<p>Fehmi Atalar of Türkiye went home as the champion of the game, achieving a score of 168,566 during the five-minute game. Leo Solórzano of Peru managed a score of 57,164.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.redbull.com/int-en/red-bull-tetris-world-final-recap-and-winner-fehmi-atalar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Red Bull</a> described the event as “phone to drone, with Qualifiers featuring participants in 60 countries playing directly on their mobile devices. </p>



<p>“This event was one of a kind. It’s not a thing you can describe in words,” said Red Bull Tetris World final winner Fehmi Atalar.</p>

<p>“Over [my] five years of Tetris experience, this was the best moment, and this event was one of a kind. It’s not a thing you can describe in words,” Atalar concluded. “I managed to play like a machine, and although I could have done things a bit cleaner, I achieved a flawless run and did not miss a single point in any of my matches, so I am very happy.”</p>
