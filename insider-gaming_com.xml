<p>Kirby Air Riders could end up being one of the sleeper hits of 2025 for Nintendo, and if you’re a Switch or Switch 2 user eager to know if everyone’s small, round, pink cutie is coming to old-gen or current-gen hardware, you’ve raced into the right place.</p>



<p>Since day one, the differentiation between games, hardware, updates, and other issues has been unclear for the Nintendo Switch and its Switch 2 successor. It’s like this will continue for several years yet. This is where we come in to tell you which pit lane you need to go to for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p>



<p>The spiritual successor to 2003’s Kirby Air Riders has a lot of competition to catch up.</p>

<p><strong>Kirby Air Riders is most definitely launching on the Nintendo Switch 2 when its November 20 release date finally arrives.</strong></p>



<p>The Switch 2 has had a decent amount of exclusives in its first year. Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and the upcoming Metroid Prime 4: Beyond are system-selling starlets. But Nintendo isn’t content with this, which is why we’re getting another exclusive—and another racer at that.</p>



<p>You could say Kirby Air Riders isn’t the type of game everyone has been crying out for, but we won’t say no. It should provide competition and another option to Nintendo racing fans. The main thing that wasn’t in doubt was the game releasing on the Nintendo Switch 2, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-kirby-air-riders-on-nintendo-switch-1">Can You Play Kirby Air Riders On Nintendo Switch 1?</h2>



<p><strong>You can’t buy and play Kirby Air Riders on the OG Nintendo Switch, making it a Switch 2 exclusive.</strong></p>



<p>A Switch 2 port was never in doubt, but the original Nintendo Switch was touch-and-go. We’re already sensing a theme with big-time Nintendo exclusives—Metroid Prime 4 aside. The old-gen hardware has served its purpose and attracted well over 150 million buyers. Now, the race is on for Switch 2 to surpass the device it succeeded.</p>



<p>How do you do this? By restricting the availability of shiny new Nintendo titles. Kirby Air Riders is only coming to Nintendo Switch 2, which means if you’re keen to ride the airy waves, you need to make a Kirby-sized jump to the Switch 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-kirby-air-riders-on-any-other-platform">Is Kirby Air Riders On Any Other Platform?</h2>



<p><strong>Kirby Air Riders isn’t coming to PlayStation, Xbox, or PC; it’s only available on the Nintendo Switch 2.</strong></p>



<p>We thought we’d address this question quickly, especially in this day and age of exclusives and first-party titles flying here, there, and everywhere. Kirby Air Riders is coming to Switch 2 and nothing else.</p>



<p>Are you excited for Kirby Air Riders? Can it be a force in the kart-racing genre, battling Mario Kart, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, and others?

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: Dying Light: Hellrunners—The Zombie Game That Never Made It]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-hellrunners-zombie-game-never-made-it/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-dying-light-hellrunners%E2%80%94the-zombie-game-that-never-made-it.1353982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dying Light fans have been enjoying The Beast since mid-September, and thanks to updates made by Techland, it’s proving to be a gift that keeps on giving. In case you’re uninitiated with The Beast, the game effectively sets up the next generation of Dying Light, an open-world zombie slasher title that has existed since 2015.</p>



<p>However, not <strong>every Dying Light game </strong>ever concocted has made it to the market. In 2015, the Techland team released Dying Light, then in 2022 came Dying Light 2: Stay Human. But between those games sat a whole array of concept titles, and one in particular would have been a total genre pivot for fans of the relatively new franchise.</p>



<h2 id="h-dying-light-hellrunners-laid-to-rest">Dying Light: Hellrunners Laid to Rest</h2>



<p>Between 2016 and 2017, the team at Techland was busy innovating in the Dying Light space, and one title that came out of the creative minds of those at the firm was Dying Light: Hellrunners.</p>



<p>Hellrunners would have been a ‘runner’; a game that typically uses procedural generation or a never-ending loop to permit the player to, you guessed it, <strong>run forever</strong>. As the player traverses an endless pathway, they’re faced with obstacles to repeatedly overcome while securing points, coins, tokens, or something else entirely.</p>



<p>However, Techland was quick to point out that the endless approach was just one angle, and that the team was also trying out a ‘level-based’ approach.</p>



<p>Think of a game like Canabalt, a horizontally-scrolling endless runner, but add in nicer graphics, is what I was told. Then, throw in the undead and some parkour mechanics, and you’re probably close to picturing Dying Light: Hellrunners.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Canabalt is a side-scrolling endless runner with a single-button input that kept players engaged by demanding them to dodge obstacles</figcaption></figure>







<p>I caught up with Techland’s Tymon Smektala, Franchise Director, to learn more about Hellrunners and why the game never saw the light of day:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We experimented with a runner DL game but after some prototypes realized that there’s not much we can do to make it stand out or innovate within the genre.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With that, Hellrunners was shelved, never to be revisited, and the team moved on to piece together Dying Light 2: Stay Human.</p>



<p>Being a Dying Light fan, I was curious to learn if there were any relations between ‘Hellrunners’ and ‘Nightrunners’, the faction that exists within Villedor in Dying Light 2: Stay Human.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There was no connection between Hellrunners and Nightrunners – Nightrunners were conceptualized later in the production of Dying Light 2: Stay Human, long when Hellrunners was altogether scrapped.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s easy to imagine Dying Light: Hellrunners as a pretty gnarly mobile game. Runners are still pretty popular today, but they’re mostly hyper-casual experiences that offer little in the way of gameplay depth and are mostly time-killer titles.</p>



<p>I could just picture Dying Light: Hellrunners, though. I can imagine obstacles being items to vault or leap over, gaps that need to be crossed with a well-timed grapple hook, and undead lumbering in your path that need to be struck down as you run, all while you collect UV bars, coins, or vials of Antizin.</p>



<p>Do you wish Dying Light: Hellrunners had been made in the end? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>NCSoft’s and PlayStation’s Horizon Steel Frontiers is not the only multiplayer game on the horizon; Guerrilla Games has something cooking in this space as well. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Horizon Steel Frontiers is a new MMORPG that was revealed yesterday. It is launching for PC and mobile devices, but we do not have a release date yet. Also, a new interview recently revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-developers-used-ai-extensively/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI was used ‘extensively</a>‘ in the development process of the upcoming multiplayer game. </p>







<h2 id="h-guerrilla-s-horizon-multiplayer-title-is-their-next-big-project">Guerrilla’s Horizon Multiplayer Title is their ‘Next Big Project’</h2>



<p>The clarification about Guerrilla’s Horizon multiplayer title came through a post by Jason Schreier on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5jd6otif22v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BlueSky</a>. Schreir stated, “Just to clear up some confusion I’ve seen,’ Horizon Steel Frontiers’ from NCSoft is different from the multiplayer Horizon game that’s in development at Guerrilla Games.” Schreier added that Guerrilla Games’ upcoming Horizon multiplayer title is their “next big project”. He also thinks that NCSoft’s MMO is “meant for Asian markets”. </p>



<p>The Horizon franchise has been in the news a lot lately. Earlier this year, it was all about Sony’s Horizon clone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-lawsuit-against-tencent-for-allegedly-copying-the-horizon-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawsuit against Tencent</a> for the latter’s upcoming title, Light of Motiram. Then the focus shifted to NCSoft and PlayStation’s Horizon Steel Frontiers, which dropped an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN-NNgWIyIQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10-minute video</a> revealing some gameplay and other elements of the title. And now, we have been informed that another Horizon multiplayer game is on the way; it seems the series fans have a lot to look forward to in the coming years. </p>







<p>In other news, court documents have revealed that the Horizon Zero Dawn movie is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-zero-dawn-movie-planned-to-release-in-2027-court-documents-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned to release in 2027</a>. Additionally, Tencent recently responded to the lawsuit, stating, “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-responds-to-sony-horizon-clone-lawsuit-fame-does-not-create-a-trademark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fame doesn’t create a trademark</a>.” What are your thoughts on another Horizon multiplayer game being worked on by Guerrilla Games?
