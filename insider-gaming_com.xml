<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5 is a dream for many PlayStation owners. It’s been too long since Indy graced our screens in computer game form, and it feels like the right moment. Thankfully, we don’t need to go on a crusade to tell you the status of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s release schedule.</p>



<p>The iconic Indiana Jones jingle applies to almost any situation. Carry the shopping into your house in one go, play the jingle, beat a boss on a game, play the jingle, watch footage of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-you-play-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-full-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>—you get the idea. It’s fair to say Indiana Jones games haven’t gone down as well as the films, with releases such as The Emperor’s Tomb and Staff of Kings not living long in the memory.</p>



<p>It’s time for Indy to have a successful virtual outing—that isn’t a LEGO entry—and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5 can be the one. </p>

<p><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is definitely coming to PlayStation 5</strong>, despite initial doubts it would due to Microsoft’s ownership of Bethesda Softworks.</p>



<p>In September 2020, Microsoft famously purchased Bethesda in a shocking deal worth $7.5 billion. Microsoft effectively owned the rights to a ton of franchises in the blink of an eye: Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, DOOM, and Wolfenstein. Bethesda announced it was working on a new Indiana Jones game several months after the announcement—leaving PlayStation players in the dark over its release exclusivity.</p>



<p>An agreement was eventually released ensuring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is confirmed for PS5</a>. The slight caveat is the Xbox Series X|S and PC get first dibs for a few months, meaning, PS users need to channel some patience. So it’s not all Temple of Doom and gloom, and even the developer is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-developers-thrilled-game-is-coming-to-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thrilled the Great Circle is making its way to PS5</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-releasing-on-ps5">When is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Releasing on PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>April 2025 is when Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is expected to release on PS5.</strong></p>



<p>The projected Great Circle launch window for PS5 comes courtesy of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge’s Tom Warren</a>, In a report, they said, “Sources familiar with Bethesda’s plans tell me the company has been targeting an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-targeting-an-april-2025-release-for-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 2025 release for&nbsp;Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;on PS5</a>, but this date could naturally shift depending on development schedules.”</p>



<p>Obviously, this wording means there could be some changes as we get closer to April 2025. Take the information with a grain of salt—although Tom is a very reliable reporter—in case Indiana Jones and the Great Circle doesn’t release in April 2025.</p>
