<p>Battlestate Games has taken to social media to announce that 3,600 <strong>more cheaters </strong>have been banned from Escape from Tarkov in a 21-day window that ended yesterday, August 7. To some, this might look like a huge success, but to those in the know, this is business as usual for Escape from Tarkov, a game utterly plagued by malicious operators.</p>



<p>Recently, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheating-situation-nikita-speaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fight against cheaters</a> is â€˜hard and never-endingâ€™.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-eternal-battle">Eternal Battle</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is one of the worst games when it comes to cheaters, and it has been that way for a few years. Itâ€™s one of the reasons why the launch of Escape from Tarkovâ€™s PvE platform was such a success, as it allows players to get the fundamental Tarkov experience without running into cheaters.</p>



<p>In a document posted on social media, the Battlestate Games team revealed that more than 3,600 cheaters had been banned during a 21-day window spanning July 17 to August 7.</p>



<p>Even a cursory glance <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQKZ0uxCB5Zi3Q3PsM_Ud4opkrpAeNax6UxrfBJFN0uxLPbcSRJqXCo7BChE7OCQu7jQWLwL8stGYO5/pubhtml?gid=1329899061&amp;single=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">at the document</a> reveals some of the key concerns about the cheating epidemic spoiling the most popular extraction shooter ever made. For instance, there are batches of accounts with almost the same name, which indicates that cheaters are running multiple accounts and have plenty of backups to work through.</p>



<p>In a few months, Escape from Tarkov is expected to finally graduate from early access and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become a fully released title</a>, but many claim that the game isnâ€™t 1.0-ready, especially as the title is still swarming with cheaters.</p>



<p>Itâ€™s one of the biggest hurdles to the gameâ€™s success in longevity, and itâ€™s why the peak player counts for the games are believed to be sliding. Recently, Battlestate Games unveiled a rare glimpse at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-player-count-rare-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the gameâ€™s player count</a>, which prompted fans to wonder what portion of that count is represented by cheaters.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty To Rely on 17-Year-Old Character to Drive Pre-Orders for Black Ops 7]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-rely-on-17-year-old-reznov-pre-orders/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-to-rely-on-17-year-old-character-to-drive-pre-orders-for-black-ops-7.1265370/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been discovered that Activisionâ€™s studios are preparing to rely on the resurgence of a character almost two decades old to drive pre-order volume for Black Ops 7. In a series of posts on social media, the â€˜Reznov Challenge Packâ€™ was unveiled, with dataminers finding a triple pack of skins focused on Victor Reznov, a character first seen in 2008â€™s World at War.</p>



<p>Reznov has surfaced a few times in the Call of Duty timeline, and his appearance in the pre-order pack for Black Ops 7 comes as little surprise, given how accustomed Activision has been to relying on nostalgia to drive sales.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-reznov-revealed">Reznov Revealed</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, HeyImAlaix revealed the three Reznov skins reportedly coming to Black Ops 6 and Warzone when you pre-order Black Ops 7:</p>











<p>This was followed up by a video from realityuk that shows the skins from all perspectives:</p>











<p>The same profile also uploaded shots <a href="https://x.com/realityuk/status/1953569138560971009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of some pre-order screens</a>, specifically the one that thanks players for pre-ordering Black Ops 7 and immediately unlocking the â€˜SOG Reznov Operatorâ€™ pack.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many Call of Duty fans lambasted the skins, stressing that the character doesnâ€™t look like the Reznov they know and love. Others were quick to highlight that Activisionâ€™s studios did the same thing before Black Ops 6â€™s release, allowing users to unlock a triple pack of Woods skins for pre-ordering the game:</p>



<div><article><a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1953503715945484678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Replying to @charlieINTEL</a><p><span>Literally the same pre order rewards as BO6 but instead itâ€™s Reznov. They are relying heavily on nostalgia to keep this game aliveðŸ˜‚ </span></p></article></div>







<p>As Battlefield 6 enters a beta period and takes the world by storm, decimating every Call of Duty game, we have to wonder about Activisionâ€™s marketing efforts. Is relying on a character revealed almost 20 years ago the best way forward when your chief competitor is bringing so much fresh content to the table?</p>



<p>Nostalgia sells, I guess.</p>



<p>Itâ€™s worth stressing that this content is the result of datamining efforts, which means thereâ€™s every potential itâ€™ll change or be stripped entirely in the coming weeks.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Beta Already Hit by Cheaters, Clips Reveal]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-hit-by-cheaters-clips/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-beta-already-hit-by-cheaters-clips-reveal.1265367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Less than 24 hours ago, the Battlefield 6 beta kicked off, and millions of fans have already found their way into the game, <strong>including Insider Gamingâ€™s team</strong>. Unfortunately, the cheaters have also discovered how to bypass the much-discussed Javelin Anti-cheat system set up by Electronic Arts to support the gameâ€™s integrity.</p>



<p>On social media, several clips of (alleged) cheaters have surfaced and are being circulated, showing how much of a joke Javelin is to some malicious operators.</p>



<p>Why people feel the need to cheat in a <strong>beta </strong>is beyond me.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-good-thing">Good Thing?</h2>



<p>It could be argued that cheaters finding their way into Battlefield 6 in the beta is a good thing, as it allows Electronic Arts and all associated studios to firm up their anti-cheat engine ahead of the gameâ€™s full launch on October 10.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the gameâ€™s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-to-the-day-we-die-confirmed/">leadership team revealed</a> just how important it is to keep cheaters out of the game, but itâ€™s a never-ending battle thatâ€™s constantly evolving.</p>



<p>On social media, clips of cheaters spoiling the Battlefield 6 beta for legitimate players have surfaced:</p>



<div><article><p><span>ðŸš¨CONFIRMED: Cheats are already working in Battlefield 6.

This footage proves CHEATS are FULLY FUNCTIONAL on Day 1 of Early Access Beta. </span></p></article></div>



<div><article><a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1953553413972877435" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Replying to @CODUpdates</a><p><span>Just a quick heads up! Forcing players to enable TPM 2.0 and Kernel-level driver anti-cheat system doesnâ€™t prevent hackers/cheaters spoofing and/or use 3rd party cheat software. Believe it or not, it is still happening on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Battlefield</a><span> 6 Open Beta test!</span></p></article></div>







<p>The beta isnâ€™t perfect, but itâ€™s feeling very polished already. Iâ€™ll dismiss the videos of streamers finding map exploits that allow them to hide in the terrain and still attack enemies across the map for now and give the game the benefit of the doubt, but the cheating situation has to be nipped in the bud.</p>



<p>In the days leading up to the Battlefield 6 beta kicking off, fans were wrestling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-secureboot-not-enabled-error/">with the SecureBoot topic</a>, with some being actively prevented from booting Battlefield just because they have some kind of third-party application (accessories, lighting, etc) enabled on their PC.</p>



<p>Have you been impacted by a blatant cheater in Battlefield 6? Let me know in the comments.</p>
