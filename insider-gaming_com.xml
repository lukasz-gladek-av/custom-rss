<p>Several reports indicate that Battlefield 6’s anti-cheat software is asking players to remove Valorant from their systems. </p>



<p>Electronic Arts announced that Battlefield 6’s open beta was their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-biggest-ever-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest open beta to date</a>. However, the test version of the game was plagued by cheaters, with BF6’s anti-cheat engine blocking over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-blocked-cheating-attempts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">330,000 cheating attempts</a>. Interestingly, the same cheat engine seems to be facing an issue with Valorant. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-anti-cheat-wants-players-to-uninstall-valorant">Battlefield 6 Anti-Cheat Wants Players to Uninstall Valorant </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/battlefield-bf-battlefield-6-bf6-anti-cheat-valorant-conflict/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, several reports about Battlefield 6’s anti-cheat engine facing issues with Valorant have surfaced on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mlwcbl/battlefield_6_just_told_me_to_uninstall_valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/Battlefield</a>. All the reports include a screenshot of the same ‘Security Violation’ pop-up, which states that BF6 failed to launch due to ‘general software incompatibility’. The pop-up further asks players to “uninstall the conflicting software, or adjust its settings”, and the software in question is Valorant. </p>

<p>A post by Revolutionary Sun on <a href="https://x.com/_WCS_/status/1954339677647040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> states that Battlefield 6’s anti-cheat engine, Javelin and Valorant’s anti-cheat engine, Vanguard, are clashing due to secure boot kernel-level access. </p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6 Open Beta surpassed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500,000 concurrent players</a> on Steam, crossing Call of Duty’s all-time high. Additionally, the former Blizzard boss thinks that BF6 will “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-is-going-to-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-this-year-according-to-former-blizzard-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boot stomp</a>” Call of Duty this year, which in turn will be better for FPS games.

<p>The developers of Pokémon TCG Pocket, DeNA, have revealed that they are aiming to release a ‘major update’ in 2025. </p>



<p>During the latest earnings <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/2432/ir_material3/256980/00.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>, DeNA revealed several details about Pokémon TCG Pocket’s progress over Q1 FY2025 and their future actions. The report states that average monthly active users for the first quarter were approximately 39 million. Close to 60% of the virtual currency consumption came from international markets, and subscriptions are seeing “steady demand”.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-s-major-update-will-focus-on-retention-and-login-frequency">Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Major Update will Focus on Retention and Login Frequency</h2>



<p>Regarding future actions, DeNA states that “New user acquisition remains steady”; however, the retention rate of existing users is decreasing compared to the initial launch period. Maintaining a monthly active user base has become a priority for them. The developers have recognised “initiatives to improve retention rate and login frequency, such as enhancement of collection experience.”</p>



<p>The developers are now planning and developing a “major update” for Pokémon TCG Pocket, which will focus on improving the retention rate and login frequency of users. The details of this update will be announced later; however, we do know that DeNA is planning to release it “within this calendar year”. </p>
