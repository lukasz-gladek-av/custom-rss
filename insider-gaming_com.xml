<p>The year ahead promises to be a big one for gaming, with 2026 stacked full of big releases, and Highguard is among the major names landing this year, though there has been some confusion about the platform availability.</p>



<p>Revealed at The Game Awards, Highguard is set to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on January 26</a>, though the build-up has gone under the radar for many players due to an eerie radio silence from the developer.</p>



<p>Expect that to change in the final days before release, however, and if you want to know which platforms Highguard is available on, Insider Gaming has the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-highguard-on-playstation-5">Is Highguard on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Combat ready. Image via Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Highguard is available on PlayStation 5, as the title from the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall is releasing the game across all major platforms.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation 5 is, naturally, among those platforms, and, similarly to other games in the genre, crossplay will allow you to play with friends and other players across various platforms.</p>



<p>Uncertainty over the title being available on PlayStation stems from a very quiet build-up to the game, with pre-ordering and wishlisting for the title not available, apart from the latter on Steam.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-highguard-on-xbox-series-x-s">Is Highguard on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, just like PlayStation 5, Highguard will be available on Xbox Series X|S at launch, allowing players on the platform to join the new title at any point.</strong></p>



<p>Similar to the PlayStation confusion, the quiet approach to promotion on Highguard has led to some queries on what platforms exactly the game will be released on, with details scarce following the initial trailer.</p>



<p>However, that trailer, albeit briefly, confirmed Highguard will be available on Xbox Series X|S, so fear not if you’re active on either console, as the game will be available.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-highguard-on-pc">Is Highguard on PC?</h2>



<p><strong>Highguard will be playable on PC, and, in fact, Steam is the only place in the build-up to the launch where you can wishlist the title.</strong></p>



<p>While store listings have been absent on other platforms, the Steam listing for Highguard has been live since the unveil, and you can add the game to your wishlist so you don’t forget exactly when it drops.</p>



<p>If you play on PC, you won’t be locked out of playing with those on other platforms, as the game will feature full crossplay support.</p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite continues to get a regular slew of updates and, following on from the major South Park collab introduced earlier this month, a new game mode, dubbed Pimlico, is set to be added.</p>



<p>Regular content drops in Fortnite often include new game modes, ranging from permanent additions, like Fortnite OG and LEGO Fortnite, to temporary modes, including the recently departed Delulu.</p>



<p>Pimlico is the latest mode set to be added to Fortnite, and Insider Gaming has details on everything we know so far.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-pimlico-in-fortnite">What is Pimlico in Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pimlico is a new game mode coming to Fortnite that ties in with another Epic Games title, Fall Guys, but the full details are scarce.</strong></p>



<p>A full reveal of the Pimlico game mode is set to be made on January 21, so this article will be updated with official details as soon as possible, but there are some intriguing leaks that have emerged.</p>



<p>Teasers <a href="https://x.com/Stentric/status/2013627583036821808]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X by Stentric</a> showed Fall Guys characters dressed as birds, with one holding a basketball-like object, with the caption ‘Why Fall when you can Ball?’ Suggesting that the new mode could be a mixture of sports game in a similar style to Fall Guys, which will be playable through Fortnite.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1982167577603244498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">October</a>, leakers first revealed the Pimlico mode, said to be in collaboration with Warner Bros, which incidentally coincides with the upcoming addition of Warner Bros’ skins in Fortnite, with the likes of Bugs Bunny, Lola Bunny, and Daffy Duck rumored to be landing in the near future.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-pimlico-released-in-fortnite">When is Pimlico Released in Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>No release date has been confirmed for the arrival of the Pimlico mode in Fortnite, but it’s widely expected to land on the date of the game’s next update.</strong></p>



<p>Thursday, January 22, is the next patch day for Fortnite, bringing additional content into the game, and the addition of the new mode is a big one after the exit of Delulu this week.</p>



<p>A full reveal of the mode will take place on Wednesday, January 21, unveiling exactly what players can expect, and there’s sure to be a slew of new information.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 launched to high praise back in late 2025, and before long, Season 1 kicked off the live-service model for the title. Just as fans were beginning to get excited for Season 2, though, EA broke some very sour news—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 2 had been delayed</a>. </p>



<p>Instead of a new Season kicking off on January 20, it was revealed that Season 2 had been pushed back to February 17, leaving three weeks devoid of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new content</a>. Luckily for fans, EA has revealed its short-term plans to fill the gap with the Frostfire Bonus Path.</p>







<p>If you’re still playing Battlefield 6 and eager for new content, check out what’s in store while you wait for Season 2.</p>

<p><strong>The Frostfire Bonus Path is a new pathway of rewards coming alongside the Season 1 Battle Pass, launching on January 27, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>At this moment in time, the full Bonus Path hasn’t been shared online, but some details have been made available. Rewards will range from a new Weapon Package and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-fans-art-copy-call-of-duty-ghosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soldier Skin</a> to various XP Boosts.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, not all of it will come for free. EA have confirmed that some content will require the purchase of the Season 1 Battle Pass. Here are some of the upcoming Frostfire Bonus Path content broken down into free and paid rewards.</p>

<p><strong>Rewards on the Frostfire Bonus Path are unlocked with Bonus Path Points; these are earned by completing Weekly Challenges.</strong></p>



<p>The Frostfire Bonus Path can be completed alongside the Season 1 Battle Pass, so you won’t need to choose to make progress between the prior paths and the new one. To make progress through the Bonus Path, though, you’ll need Bonus Path Points, with every ten unlocking a new reward.</p>







<p>Weekly Challenges are the source of these points, but the amount of points varies depending on the difficulty of the challenge. That being said, not all Weekly Challenges reward Bonus Path Points, so be sure to check the in-game Challenges menu for more detailed information.</p>
