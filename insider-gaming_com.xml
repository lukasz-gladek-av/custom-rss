<p>In an effort to reach a larger audience, developer Gerana has unveiled a collaboration between its free-to-play battle royale title, Free Fire, and the ever-popular football anime Blue Lock. The Free Fire x Blue Lock collab will introduce in-game content straight from the Japanese anime series, with items, iconic jerseys, emotes, and other cosmetics that players can unlock and equip. The entire collab runs between November 20 and December 8, so it’s an extremely limited-time event you won’t want to miss!</p>



<p>For long-time fans of the animated series, you’ll be happy to learn all about Isagi’s Spatial Awareness and Nagi’s Trapping emotes, available as unlocks during the collab, that you can use mid-round in the battle royale game.</p>



<p>While emotes certainly prove interesting and can shake up the battlefield experience, it’s the cosmetics that most people seek from these collaborations. For the Free Fire and Blue Lock collab, you can expect the following:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Weapon Skins</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vehicle Skins</strong></li>



<li><strong>Avatars</strong></li>



<li><strong>Banners</strong></li>



<li><strong>Isagi’s Team Z Costumes</strong></li>



<li><strong>Nagi’s Team V Costumes</strong></li>



<li><strong>Football Uniform Costumes</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-what-is-blue-lock">What is Blue Lock?</h2>



<p>If you’re a long-time fan of Free Fire but don’t yet know about Blue Lock, let us enlighten you on the truly exceptional anime. It’s a highly-rated series out of Japan, focusing on the Japanese Football Association. The JFA launches a secretive training program designed to test the country’s best football players to the extreme, with each challenge resulting in the weakest member of the team being eliminated. Only one prospective player can win the training regimen and earn a place on the team vying for the World Cup. </p>



<p>With an average rating of 4.8 on Crunchyroll and an astounding three seasons to catch up on, Blue Lock continues to bring in new and returning fans, making this collab with Free Fire a surefire success for Garena!</p>

<p>Don’t let the numbers fool you. Unlike numbered sports titles that launch annually with little evolution, the Farming Simulator genre launches every few years. It includes plenty of new content, mechanics, and more to satisfy long-time fans. If you’re interested in learning what’s new in Farming Simulator 25, join us for the ride!</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-new-in-farming-simulator-25">Everything New in Farming Simulator 25</h2>

Everything could go smoothly until a tornado strikes, tearing up your fields and pens and wreaking havoc on your livelihood. Alongside everything mentioned, you can enjoy the following new features and mechanics:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>All-new maps across North America, East Asia, and Central Europe</strong></li>



<li><strong>New Crops: Rice, Spinach, Peas, and Green Beans</strong></li>

<h2 id="h-when-does-farming-simulator-25-release">When Does Farming Simulator 25 Release?</h2>



<p>Farming Simulator 25 officially launches on <strong>November 12 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</strong>. Currently, there’s no word about the farming simulation game launching on Game Pass, though the previous title did within a year of its release.</p>



<p>Typically speaking, many titles from Giants Software launch somewhat roughly, with countless bugs and glitches plaguing the gameplay on day one until the first patch hits. For long-time fans, it won’t matter. They know what’s coming, and they’re excited to play. You’ll find me behind the wheel of a tractor this month, that’s for sure!</p>

<p>As an active subscriber to Xbox Game Pass, I’m constantly on the lookout for new and upcoming titles hitting the monthly subscription platform. Who doesn’t want to test out new releases without paying any additional money? But not every title launches on Game Pass, leaving some communities waiting or caving in and buying a copy on day one. So, which is it for the upcoming farming game we’re all eagerly awaiting? Is Farming Simulator 25 on Game Pass?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-farming-simulator-25-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">Is Farming Simulator 25 Coming to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p>As of right now, Farming Simulator 25 isn’t coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one. It could happen in the future, likely within one year of its launch, as the last game in the franchise did, but for now, we must either buy a copy or wait. For many, that means waiting. Now, I’m a massive fan of farming games in general, and I love Farming Simulator as a whole, but I know from firsthand experience that a Giants Software release is, more often than not, quite buggy. </p>







<h2 id="h-where-can-you-play-farming-simulator-25">Where Can You Play Farming Simulator 25?</h2>



<p>While most long-time fans of the franchise will ultimately play Farming Simulator 25 on PC, there’s still a growing community on Xbox Series X|S interested in the game. If you’re in the latter camp, you should know the game is approximately $10 more expensive per edition on console. On PC, it’s $49.99 for the Standard Edition but $59.99 on Xbox Series X|S for the same version.</p>



<p>In any case, the farming simulation game is coming to:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PC</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>Xbox Series X|S</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>FS25 will also offer Mac support.</p>



<p>Will you grab a copy of Farming Simulator 25 on day one or wait for the inevitable Game Pass release?

<p>Blizzard has announced that 6v6 matches are coming back to Overwatch for a limited time with Overwatch: Classic. The — new? — mode launches November 12 for all players and will run to December 2.</p>



<p>The announcement came alongside a new teaser video for the mode showing the original cast of characters, game modes, and maps.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/YMrIozIBTl0GxGBZ.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>“Eight years ago, Blizzard released a completely new gaming world called Overwatch,” Blizzard said <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a blog post</a>. “Connected by a theme of fighting for the future, millions of you jumped in to experience new heroes like a time-jumping adventurer, an esports champion turned mech pilot, and a genetically-modified gorilla from the Moon.</p>



<p>“Now you’ll be able to relive the nostalgia in a series of new limited-time events in Overwatch 2, where you can experience the original heroes, abilities, and maps in the classic 6v6 team-based action you remember.”</p>



<p>Overwatch: Classic will see access to 21 characters from the original launch of the game. The mode takes players back to Overwatch 1.0 from May 2016 with classic abilities from the heroes. The heroes will be grouped into their original classes, but the mode will feature the No Hero Limits rule meaning you can have a full team of the same heroes.</p>



<p>Regarding maps, all 12 original maps will be available along with the four original game modes.</p>



<p>As far as if Overwatch: Classic is the way for Blizzard to bring 6v6 back permanently, the studio says not right now.</p>



<p>“We are running separate 6v6 test modes in future seasons to gather feedback and gauge player interest on that format,” Blizzard said.</p>



<p>What do you think of 6v6 matches coming back to Overwatch via Overwatch: Classic? Let us know in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1197/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
