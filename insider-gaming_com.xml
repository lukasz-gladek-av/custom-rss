<p>The 0.30 version for R.E.P.O, the Monster Update, as well as its patch notes, is now out on Steam. With it, the update adds new enemies, upgrades, and fixes to the game.</p>



<p>Released earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/repos-next-major-update-features-lots-of-disgusting-new-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">R.E.P.O</a> took the world by storm with its horror multiplayer fun. It went viral with several big-name YouTubers and Twitch streamers played the game, leading to high player counts after release. Now coming to Fortnite, the title has now updated with a patch fit for Halloween.</p>



<p>The 0.30 update, the game’s Monster Update, is now on Steam and acts as the next major patch for R.E.P.O. Ten new enemies join the fray but new upgrades like Tumble Climb and Death Head Battery will make it a lot easier. Also, new valuables in multiple stages like McJannek Station and Headman Manor are available. In terms of fixes, the C.A.R.T and items have been fine tuned and rid of bugs.</p>
