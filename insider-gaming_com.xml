<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket has warned against ‘inappropriate conduct’, which includes ‘real money trading’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-warns-players-not-to-trade-for-real-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, Pokemon TCG Pocket players have been warned against using real money to trade, and the devs could even suspend the player’s account for doing so. Today, players received a new notification in the ‘Messages’ section of the application. Here, instead of a new announcement, they were issued a warning for players violating their Terms of Use, which includes data tampering, real money trading and other behaviour. Check out the full warning below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are aware that some players have engaged in data tampering, real money trading, and other behaviours that violate the Terms of Use. If we confirm that a player has engaged in behaviour that violates the Terms of Use, we will warn them, suspend their account, or take other action. We will continue to strive to provide an environment where everyone can safely and comfortably enjoy their experience”. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s trading feature will be released on January 29, 2025. The new feature will include some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">limitations</a>, such as only being able to trade between friends, not all rarities being included, items having to be consumed to trade them, a new currency being introduced, and more. It is believed that all these limitations have been introduced to restrict the use of real money trading in TCG Pocket.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pokemon TCG Pocket recently revealed their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-space-time-smackdown-expansion-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space-Time Smackdown Expansion</a>, which includes over 140 cards from the Sinnoh region featuring the legendary Pokemon Dialga and Palkia. Also, players can grab rewards for the game when purchasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mcdonalds-promotion-happy-meals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Happy Meals at McDonalds</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sniper Elite Resistance’s game length and how many hours are required to beat it keeps coming up. This is because previous games have a consistent model, so let’s see if Resistance deviates, or if you can expect the usual-length adventure.</p>



<p>Sniper Elite games are not known for having a ton of missions and chapters. Instead, it’s quality over quantity with a select palette of levels deep enough to fill in the Grand Canyon. Most entries feature an array of playgrounds giving you freedom and flexibility in how you approach them. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> is a lot more of the classic action fans have come to love.</p>



<p>If you want to know how much bang you’re getting for your buck, I can tell you using my hands-on experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-sniper-elite-resistance">How Many Hours to Beat Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A beautiful beginning. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>My first playthrough of Sniper Elite Resistance took just over eight hours to complete.</strong></p>



<p>By this, I mean the main Campaign. No Propaganda missions, Invasion distractions to deal with, or replaying missions. It was a chronological playthrough of each level in the main story.</p>



<p>The first level is more of an introduction to the game’s mechanics, and the epilogue is over in a couple of minutes. The bulk of the content lies in the main missions. <strong>I had some levels last 45 minutes to an hour</strong>, whereas one had me in the palm of its hands as I easily racked up <strong>over 90 minutes of playtime</strong>.</p>



<p>Each person’s logged hours depend on your goals. I enjoy exploring the full map, completing every objective, and looking for collectibles. You might be more fixated on completing the main objective and that’s it. You’re looking at closer to six hours if you approach <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite</a> Resistance this way.</p>



<p>Furthermore, <strong>the difficulty you play on has a huge bearing on the hours logged too</strong>. I opted for the middle of the three, meaning I got a fair amount of assistance lining up shots, but enemies still proved to be stern opposition and used me for target practice quite regularly.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-sniper-elite-resistance-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Sniper Elite Resistance Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>Sniper Elite Resistance is likely to take you 30-40 hours if you want to see and do everything.</strong></p>



<p>I’d consider the multiplayer aspects of the game optional. So, to complete every mission with full stars on Authentic Difficulty, along with the Propaganda side content, and find all Workbenches, Posters, and collectibles, my timeframe feels accurate.</p>



<p>Your experience with Sniper Elite games, your ability, and your time and patience all factor into the total time-to-beat estimation. If you’re a veteran, you could maybe attempt Authentic Difficulty right away. If this is your first Sniper Elite purchase, expect 40 hours—and maybe more—for full completion. </p>

<p>Check out our full guide to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-sniper-elite-games-in-release-order-release-dates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all Sniper Elite games</a> and detailed chronology of the series. Plus, we have the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy list</a> for you to browse.</p>



<p>Let me know how you get on with Resistance. How long did your first playthrough take you? Is Authentic Difficulty something you’re even going to bother with?</p>

<p>A loaded Sniper Elite Resistance Trophy and Achievements list awaits hungry hunters. But I hope you’ve got plenty of spare ammo because there are a lot of optional objectives to go around.</p>



<p>Rebellion’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> is the next shooter in the long-running, sniper-centric series. In it, we’re once again tasked with sneakily (but not always) chopping down Germans during wartime. Many missions await, along with fun challenges, and the Trophy and Achievement list goes one step further and challenges all facets of your sniping abilities.</p>



<p>This is an extensive list and one that demands respect. It features offline play, online play, and much more in between.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-sniper-elite-resistance-trophies-amp-achievements-are-there">How Many Sniper Elite Resistance Trophies &amp; Achievements Are There?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can you give me a second, please? Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 62 PlayStation Trophies in Sniper Elite Resistance and 61 Xbox Achievements if you want to do everything.</strong></p>



<p>Xbox continues to use Gamerscore as its reward for Achievements, whereas PlayStation users always get a bonus courtesy of Platinum Trophies. This is the key difference between Trophies and Gamescore. <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> still has a ton of additional tasks for you to do, whichever console you choose to play. Just know that going for total completion will sap your time, energy, and patience.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-sniper-elite-resistance-achievement-amp-trophy">Every Sniper Elite Resistance Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<p>Get ready to complete the campaign, master a bunch of skills and talents, and battle opponents online. Also, be prepared to land an unbelievably precise shot on one unfortunate enemy’s crotch!</p>



<p>Now I’ve piqued your interest, check out the non-hidden list.</p>

<p>Sniper Elite Resistance has quite a few hidden Trophies and Achievements. I wouldn’t say they’re the most spoiler-heavy tasks, but they’re initially hidden nonetheless.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-sniper-elite-resistance-dlc-trophies-amp-achievements">All Sniper Elite Resistance DLC Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>



<p>There are at least eight <strong>extra DLC Trophies and Achievements for Sniper Elite Resistance</strong>. This is due to the Lights, Camera, ACHTUNG! content which you can buy separately. Be warned: Some incredible puns beckon in this list.</p>



<p>If you do obtain Lights, Camera, ACHTUNG!, here’s what you need to do.</p>

<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-trophies-amp-achievements-difficulty-rating">Sniper Elite Resistance Trophies &amp; Achievements Difficulty Rating</h2>



<p><strong>Many Sniper Elite Resistance Trophies and Achievements need you to prevail on Authentic Difficulty and achieve Three-Star Ratings—which is why this gets an 8 out of 10 for toughness.</strong></p>



<p>This is a very skill-based list, and your mileage will depend on <em>you</em>. Completing missions and Propaganda quests without assistance is the bulk of the list’s difficulty. Take your time, understand the game’s mechanics, harness patience, and you might walk away with everything.</p>

<p>Game developers are responsible for creating a game that is playable by the most players. However, this duty doesn’t end when the number of platforms on which the game is released increases. One priority of game development is accessibility, which means making the game more accessible for all types of players by creating unique tools that allow everyone to experience it. Today, we will discuss Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Accessibility Features.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-accessibility-features-does-assassin-s-creed-shadows-include">What Accessibility Features Does Assassin’s Creed Shadows Include?</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows UX Director Jonathan Bedard recently discussed the game’s accessibility features in a new <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/1Y0Q8goho9gJzCV2UBjyUJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. Bedard explained how they “have more and more people interested and invested in the different topics related to accessibility” whenever a new project arrives. Every team pitches in with their ideas “to innovate and push the boundaries of what we do in accessibility.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bedard also stated that “Audio descriptions for cinematics” is the accessibility feature he is most proud of for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The UX director also relayed an instance where the development team was “really impressed by how many emotions and actions were transposed through” audio descriptions for cinematics.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-accessibility-features-list">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Accessibility Features List</h2>
