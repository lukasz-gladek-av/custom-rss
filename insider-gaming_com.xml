<p>A new announcement for the devs has revealed that Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition has been delayed indefinitely, with no new release date announced. </p>



<p>Back in September 2025, Koei Temco surprised fans with an announcement trailer revealing the return of a beloved 2001 title: Dynasty Warriors 3. The Remastered edition is recreated in Unreal Engine 5, with striking new visuals and other significant upgrades. However, it seems that the developers will need more time to bring it to the level the fans deserve. </p>







<h2 id="h-dynasty-warriors-3-complete-edition-delayed-with-no-new-release-date">Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Delayed With No New Release Date</h2>



<p>A new <a href="https://x.com/KoeiTecmoUS/status/2015726489149276652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter) from the official Koei Tecmo America account announces the delay of Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition. It was earlier scheduled to arrive on March 19, 2026, and now a new release date will be announced at a later date. The producer of the upcoming title has revealed that, as this is the first remaster of the series, they would like more time to “fully satisfy” the fans and “improve the quality of the game”. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered includes the original game and the Xtreme Legends expansion. The upcoming title will feature a cast of more than 40 officers, with iconic 1 vs 1,000 action sequences all redone for modern systems. Additionally, the Xtreme Legends comes with new stories, bodyguard customization, new weapons, and four types of challenge modes. Check out the announcement trailer below: </p>

<p>Bandai dips its hands into various action games and Soulslikes. So it’s good to see the studio hasn’t overlooked how popular and successful the first Code Vein was, which is why so many of you are looking for the Code Vein 2 release date and times—which is covered here.</p>



<p>The original Code Vein is one of the wackier <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-non-fromsoftware-soulslike-games-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulslikes</a> in recent memory. It didn’t hit all the high notes with critics, but fans saw through the game’s flaws enough to help the game ship a few million copies, making a sequel a no-brainer. You asked for it, you got it, and here’s everything you need to know about the Code Vein 2 launch.</p>







<h2 id="h-code-vein-2-release-date">Code Vein 2 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Even wackier and weirder, please. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Bandai’s Code Vein 2 has a January 29 release date, making it the first big Soulslike</strong> <strong>launch of the year.</strong></p>



<p>If you want to lay down a marker for the rest of the year, this is how you do it. Code Vein 2 has crept in front of Nioh 3 and is taking the first step for Soulslikes in 2026.</p>



<p>The difficulty of this (not the game’s inevitable difficulty) is that it needs to be memorable enough to be talked about come the end of the year. If Code Vein 2 is anything like the first game, this shouldn’t be an issue.</p>



<p>With a more open world to explore and a motorcycle to help you do so, expect a wider and wilder experience this time around.</p>







<h2 id="h-code-vein-2-release-times-explained">Code Vein 2 Release Times, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Code Vein 2 should be launching for all players on January 29 at 3 PM PT, with other regions releasing slightly at different times.</strong></p>



<p>Start your Code Vein 2 preparations now with the table below, showing key regions and time zones around the world for the game’s launch.</p>



<p>Let IG know if you want more time zones added.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon is shaping up for a March release after a tumultuous 2025 that uncovered controversies, scepticism, and doubt. The game’s launch was delayed, and Bungie had to right a few wrongs before preparing to push out what could be the next generation of extraction shooters, challenging the paradigm set by the likes of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>One sizeable piece of news to emerge in recent weeks was the departure of Joseph Cross, the game’s art director. After more than a decade at Bungie, the developer departed the project, mere months ahead of the game’s launch, and in a new interview, he has opened up on the situation.</p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-s-future-is-a-tentative-one">Marathon’s Future is a Tentative One</h2>



<p>Nobody can accurately predict how Marathon will perform when it launches on March 5th. It’s a tentative time for Bungie, as they’ve put a lot of eggs (and hope) in this basket, and should it fail, it could spell the beginning of a downward spiral for the studio.</p>



<p>Marathon is an extraction shooter, emerging into a genre popularized by the likes of Escape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders. It takes players and plants them into a unique, fictional world populated with AI enemies, other players, and environmental threats. Players must load into a game, loot, shoot, resolve quests, and get out again without succumbing to the violence within.</p>



<p>That’s the core gameplay loop, and it’s hopefully going to be enough to give Marathon a strong start out of the gate.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/exit-interview-joseph-cross-marathon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent interview</a>, Joseph Cross, the former art director working on Marathon, spoke about his contributions to the project. He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I believe in what we’ve done. I think we did something really cool, and I think it will pan out. I can’t control the way the game plays. I’m not a designer. I’m not the game director. I can only control what I can control, and what I could control, I feel really good about. </p>



<p>And you can’t take that away from me, as much as the haters try online or wherever, and whether someone doesn’t happen to like the art direction personally, whether they don’t agree with some political thing Bungie did, or whatever the animosity du jour is, you can’t take the thing I care about the most away.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(<em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/former-marathon-art-director-says-what-i-could-control-i-feel-really-good-about-in-the-face-of-pre-release-animosity-you-cant-take-that-away-from-me/">PCGamer</a> for the spot</em>)</p>



<p>He explained that he feels ‘bummed’ about the debate regarding Marathon’s art style and whether it makes sense in the extraction shooter space, which typically focuses on realism (except for the likes of Escape from Duckov).</p>



<p>Marathon will be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on March 5th, and it’s hard to tell right now how much of a success it will be.</p>

<p>Behaviour Interactive recently invited Dead by Daylight fans to help shape the game’s future by voting on the next survivor and killer character models. Right now, you can head to the Dead by Daylight website and piece together your votes on the next major characters to appear in the game.</p>



<p>There are four options for the survivors, and three for the killers, and while the survivors are mostly run-of-the-mill characters, the killers are much more intriguing. You can see all the options below.</p>







<h2 id="h-who-will-you-choose-in-dbd">Who Will You Choose in DBD?</h2>



<p>Dead by Daylight remains a popular survival title, even a decade after launch. If you venture into the game now, you’ll still see fresh collaborations, content updates, and a strong community backing the game as it approaches its ten-year anniversary.</p>



<p>For instance, in January, a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-devs-announce-second-collab-with-stranger-things/">Stranger Things crossover</a> surfaced, introducing fresh characters to the game based on the most recent season of the hit television show.</p>



<p>When you head to the <a href="https://thegrimoire.deadbydaylight.com/?utm_campaign=grimoire-voting-page&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dead by Daylight website</a>, you’ll find that you’re presented with ‘The Grimoire’, a book that allows you to vote and shape the game’s future.</p>



<p>It starts with four options for the game’s next survivor:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Once you’ve voted, you’re presented with three options for the killer’s ‘silhouette’:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s difficult to tell what the resulting killer will look like, but the silhouettes are imposing enough, so that’s nice.</p>



<p>Based on the Stranger Things collaboration, the most recent killer added to Dead by Daylight is <strong>Vecna</strong>, otherwise known as The First. He was added recently after The Krasue, a Southeast Asian spirit with a gory appearance.</p>







<p>What kind of survivor and killer do you want to see added to Dead by Daylight next? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Creator Claims They Were Paid ‘A Sandwich’ For Attending Highguard Event]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-event-creator-paid-a-sandwich/</link>
            <guid>1415803</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Highguard is being released today after several weeks of near radio silence following a sudden unveiling at The Game Awards. It has proven to be a troublesome period for Wildlight, the game’s developer, owing to <strong>many </strong>doubting the validity of the game itself. It has received almost <strong>zero </strong>marketing beyond the initial trailer drop.</p>



<p>Recently, an invite-only event was held in Los Angeles for creators and industry personalities to get hands-on with the title. Naturally, doubters have pushed the rhetoric that they’re only hyping the game up because they were invited to this all-expenses-paid event and handed a bag of cash.</p>



<p>It seems that wasn’t the case, at least for some.</p>







<h2 id="h-were-creators-paid-to-play-highguard">Were Creators Paid to Play Highguard?</h2>



<p>It might not be the case for <strong>every creator</strong>, but in a post on social media, TheMacroShow revealed that they weren’t paid a dime to attend the Highguard event in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>Further, Macro stated they were <strong>offered money </strong>to make a video on the game, but ‘refused because I wanted my audience to have my real opinion on the game.’</p>



<p>It was then claimed that Wildlight didn’t provide a flight, hotel, or ‘even an Uber’ for the event, and that the only ‘compensation’ received was a ‘sandwich during the lunch break.’</p>



<p>Macro wrapped up his statement by stressing that he ‘genuinely had fun playing this game.’</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Unfortunately, his comment was mostly lost in a gargantuan sea of messages from creators far and wide, all pledging their allegiance to Highguard and declaring it a phenomenal game. It echoes Geoff Keighley, who has been a one-man marketing team for Highguard since he hosted the game’s first trailer at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>Wildlight has chosen to take one of the more controversial, inorganic approaches to marketing Highguard. It’s something that’s fast becoming despised by gamers worldwide, and it’s focused entirely on hosting <strong>creator-backed events </strong>and campaigns to promote a game at launch.</p>



<p>In one comment, user ‘KingdumbHD’ wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>All the random online influencers and game journalists suddenly praising and trying to hype up <strong>Highguard</strong> really does feel like the most unnatural, fake ass marketing Ive seen in a long while. Like why would I trust any of their opinions when you’ve obviously <strong>paid</strong> them to say it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In another, a response to a creator hyping the game, Vurkkz wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>dude is absolutely being <strong>paid</strong> to promote the game. there’s also a few content creators out there that are “super excited for <strong>highguard</strong>” I truly hate how bought modern multiplayer games are. Absolutely no organic growth at all anymore.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Highguard will be released later today.</p>

<p>The head of Xbox Games Studio, Craig Duncan, has commented on the current state of development for State of Decay 3.</p>



<p>State of Decay 3 was first announced back in July 2020. The last time any public movement indicating development was in 2024, when a trailer dropped with brief gameplay clips. Now, Craig Duncan is confirming that he’s played the game and that Xbox Games Studio remains optimistic about the franchise.</p>

He did not give a straightforward answer, but he noted that he’s visited the studio several times in the past year and remains excited about the potential of the next State of Decay.</p>

<p>Here’s what I’ll say: I have done a number of visits to that studio in the last six to eight months. I have sat and played the game with the team a bunch of times. It’s coming on really well.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following the Xbox Developer Direct, Craig Duncan was much more focused on the Fable reboot and the immediate future of Xbox in 2026. </p>







<p>He stated that he knows they have been inconsistent about which of their games head to other platforms as they continue to move forward with their new marketing strategy that encourages players to play Xbox games on all platforms.

<p>The head of Sonic Team has commented on potentially adding “deep-cut” Sonic characters to the game’s roster in future Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds DLC.</p>



<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds was released in 2025 to critical acclaim. As part of the game’s hook, several crossover characters from other universes were added to the roster and the possibilities. These characters include SpongeBob, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Minecraft characters, and more.</p>



<p>However, there is a catalog of Sonic characters lost to time that could also have their moment in the new racing game.</p>







<h2 id="h-sonic-racing-crossworlds-should-represent-all-eras-of-sonic">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Should Represent All Eras of Sonic</h2>



<p>Takashi Iizuka was recently interviewed by <a href="https://mcvuk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MCV Magazine </a>(<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonic-boss-says-hes-open-to-adding-deep-cut-sonic-characters-as-crossworlds-dlc/">h/t: Video Games Chronicle</a>). In the interview, he was asked about seeing deeper cuts from Sonic lore coming to the game as possible downloadable content, specifically characters from the ’90s animated TV series or the IDW comics.</p>



<p>Takashi Iizuka noted that he sees the passion around the extended universe and wants all eras of Sonic represented, so anything’s possible with the opportunity feels right.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There’s a lot of passion around the extended Sonic universe, and we’re open to including the ‘deep cut’ characters if the opportunity feels right,” Iizuka replied. “We want Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds to represent all eras of Sonic.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While this doesn’t confirm the return of fan-favorite characters like Sally Acorn, it does leave the door open for that level of surprising additions in the future.</p>







<p>Speaking of Sonic’s deep history, the franchise is currently celebrating its 35th anniversary. As part of that celebration, a new audio drama is coming to podcast platforms based around the Chaotix.

<p>Kota Furushima, the game director of Beast of Reincarnation, has commented on Game Freak’s history of criticism for how its 3D open-world games look and run.</p>



<p>Game Freak is best known for its work on the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon, while a beloved IP, does not feature 3D games that fully maximize hardware potential in 2026. Sometimes, recent Pokémon games have struggled to function properly. However, Beast of Reincarnation, the new game from Game Freak, looks to be a game on par with most.</p>







<h2 id="h-game-freak-prioritizes-creating-experiences">Game Freak Prioritizes Creating Experiences</h2>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-game-director-answers-all-our-burning-questions-about-the-pokemon-developers-upcoming-action-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Kota Furushima addressed these criticisms. He noted that, overall, they’re always striving to create a unique experience rather than hyper-fixating on reaching a certain quality Benchmark.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our focus is on that gameplay experience. Part of that, of course, is making sure that it performs really well, but our attention is more on getting the experience over to you and making sure that our vision can get to your hands and your hearts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, he spoke about the game being centered on natural environments and very rooted in Japanese inspiration. He also noted that the video game’s score was rooted in themes of loneliness and isolation, while also emphasizing the importance of learning to rely on others.</p>







<p>Beast of Reincarnation is slated to release this summer.
