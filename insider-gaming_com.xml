<p>A new job listing suggests that developers could be working on a proper online multiplayer infrastructure for Hogwarts Legacy 2. </p>



<p>Details about Hogwarts Legacy’s highly anticipated sequel have been scarce, with the only thing we know is that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-in-production-at-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game is in production</a>. With the amount of success Hogwarts Legacy has witnessed, it would be foolish not to provide it with a sequel. Additionally, with a new game, developers can add features the original game didn’t have, and it seems exactly what they are doing with the online multiplayer. </p>







<h2 id="h-hogwarts-legacy-2-could-be-an-online-multiplayer-rpg">Hogwarts Legacy 2 Could be an ‘Online Multiplayer RPG’</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-competitive-online-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, the suggestion that Hogwarts Legacy 2 could feature online multiplayer comes from a new <a href="https://careers.wbd.com/global/en/job/R000101535/Senior-Software-Engineer-Backend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job listing</a> for a Senior Software Engineer at Avalanche Studios. The listing states that they will be welcoming the employee to the team “behind the blockbuster open world, action RPG Hogwarts Legacy.” Additionally, the job description section states that the developer will be working on an “online multiplayer RPG.”</p>



<p>Coming to the requirements section, the listing states that the Senior Software Engineer will be responsible for “Design, implement, and maintain scalable and secure backend services, including player data persistence, matchmaking, lobbies, and server infrastructure.” Some questions remain unanswered, such as whether the whole game features online multiplayer from start to finish or only in some game modes, such as Quidditch. </p>







<p>In other news, Hogwarts Legacy has now sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-has-sold-40-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 40 million copies</a> across all platforms. Additionally, the game received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-mods-support-arrives-with-new-pc-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official mod support</a> earlier this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>KRAFTON has officially closed the first alpha test for PUBG Black Budget, the upcoming extraction shooter with some mystical, ethereal elements. It’s a perfect combination between a typical extraction title and the battle royale mechanics that the universe is so often associated with, but if you want to play it again, you’ll need to wait a while.</p>



<p>It was said in a recent blog post that the alpha test ‘saw more interest and participation than anticipated’, which is good news for KRAFTON and great news for anyone seeking a new extraction shooter in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-budget-s-alpha-was-a-success">Black Budget’s Alpha Was a Success</h2>



<p>In the post on Steam, the KRAFTON team wrote about the shutdown of the recent closed alpha:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This Closed Alpha Test saw more interest and participation than anticipated, allowing us to gather a wide range of feedback from players.</p>



<p>Through the feedback shared by those who took part, we were able to assess the potential of the game’s atmosphere, visuals, and overall system design.</p>



<p>At the same time, feedback consistently highlighted issues related to combat perception, situational clarity, and fatigue during repeated runs.</p>



<p>In addition, concerns and reports related to unauthorized programs continued to surface during the test period, leading us to progressively strengthen security measures and anti-cheat responses throughout the test.</p>



<p>Some players also experienced technical issues such as game stability problems and crashes. These factors had a noticeable impact on the overall testing experience.</p>



<p>All feedback submitted by players is currently under internal review and analysis.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In our preview piece, penned during the alpha, we predicted that ‘Black Budget will at least enjoy a solid launch, if not a lengthy lifecycle in the extraction shooter space.’</p>



<p>It’s a great extraction title, but it’s very similar to what already exists and might not innovate enough to be a real contender in the genre. That said, it played well, looked good, and presented itself as a more accessible alternative to a game like Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>At the end of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4077740/allnews?snr=1_620_4_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, the team announced a return to Coli Island and Black Budget when the game is ‘in a more refined state’.</p>

            <guid>1390063</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Listen up, extraction fans. Battlestate Games has just announced the commencement of a new Escape from Tarkov Twitch Drops event, set to run from today, December 22, to January 4. The action kicks off today at 3 PM GMT / 10 AM EST, and it’s set to award viewers with all kinds of in-game items.</p>



<p>In a blog post, the team at Battlestate Games confirmed that in-game items and unlockable containers are <strong>guaranteed </strong>to be secured by <strong>all </strong>viewers watching <strong>any </strong>Tarkov streamer.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-the-tarkov-drops-event-end">When Does The Tarkov Drops Event End?</h2>



<p>You’ll have plenty of time over the festive window and into the new year to unlock the latest round of rewards in Escape from Tarkov. The <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">all-new blog post</a> confirmed that the event <strong>ends </strong>at 3 PM GMT / 10 AM EST on January 4.</p>



<p>Here’s the need-to-know:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Drops will be activated on the channels of ALL Twitch streamers without exception who will be broadcasting in the Escape from Tarkov category.</p>



<p>Drops – in-game items</p>



<p>During the campaign, at certain intervals, you will be guaranteed to receive an unlockable container, which are categorized by the rarity of the contents – Common, Rare and Epic.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What’s more important is that this Drops event is accessible to <strong>all players</strong>, even those on the PvE platform. This has been a point of contention in recent months, with users exclusive to the PvE mode feeling ‘cheated’ by PvP players getting more bang for their buck.</p>



<p>But the developers at Battlestate Games have stressed that they’ll be ‘doing more’ for PvE players moving forward, especially as they make up a fair portion of the game’s player base.</p>



<p>Here are the rules for the Twitch Drops campaign:</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Drops can be earned by users who have an active copy of the game</li>



<li>To receive or enable Drops, both the viewer and the streamer need to attach their Twitch account to their game profile on the project’s website. You can do this&nbsp;<a href="https://profile.tarkov.com/profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></li>



<li>You can watch one or more broadcasts, but viewing time for rewards will only count if those broadcasts are participating in the event</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[PIONER Review—An Apocalyptic MMO with Ambition]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-review-early-access-mmo-ambition/</link>
            <guid>1390030</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PIONER is one of my most surprising titles of 2025. It’s a post-apocalyptic MMO that’s reminiscent of STALKER, Fallout 76, and in some ways, Escape from Tarkov. There’s plenty of potential wrapped up in a very ambitious package, which has been assembled by GFA Games, a small studio presenting this inaugural title to an eager audience.</p>



<p>I’ve been playing PIONER for some time, having participated in the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-open-beta-launches-again-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous playtests</a> through 2025. I wasn’t sure what to expect from the game’s early access release, but now that it’s here, I’m having a blast, racking up the hours, and finding myself <strong>very excited </strong>to see where this game goes.</p>



<p>Read on to scope out my full PIONER review and learn why this is one of my must-watch titles going into 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-pioner-all-about">What’s PIONER All About?</h2>



<p>In PIONER, players find themselves waking up on the island of Tartarus, a post-apocalyptic wasteland overrun by mutated enemies, mystical anomalies, and warring factions. It’s a bit overwhelming at first, but there’s a neat tutorial that adjusts your expectations accordingly within a couple of hours.</p>



<p>You’ll come to learn that PIONER is spread across several maps that constitute the full island. Each one represents a ‘biome’ that is drastically different from those that came before, and you can travel between them at will.</p>



<p>As you explore this game, you’ll meet faction leaders, build relationships, level up your character, assign skill points, and take part in a wealth of events. There are boss fights, raids, world events, PvP arenas, and a core story to follow.</p>



<p>It’s easy for me to say there’s plenty of meat on PIONER’s bones, and it doesn’t end with the base game, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-roadmap-revealed-ambitious-few-months/">GFA plans to expand</a> the title <strong>very soon </strong>via a live-service operating model.</p>



<p>There’s a pretty tough difficulty curve in the game, which boasts some light survival mechanics, but once you’ve found your groove and secured some good equipment, you’ll be much more comfortable.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-thing-about-pioner-is-the-depth">The Best Thing About PIONER is the DEPTH</h2>



<figure><figcaption>PIONER looks brilliant, and the STALKER influences are very obvious</figcaption></figure>







<p>PIONER has so much to see and do, despite being on the smaller side of what you might expect from an MMO. It’s important to stress that this is an evolving game that has launched in early access; don’t come here if you’re expecting perfection.</p>



<p>With that being said, there are some optimization issues. I’ve had network problems, some inventory-related blips, issues with hit registration, and some clipping, but it’s nothing game-breaking, and the team <strong>always </strong>seems to be aware of what’s going on. This is a very community-led thing, and that’s immediately made obvious if you spend any time at all in the game’s Discord server.</p>



<p>Anyway, back to the depth.</p>



<p>As I explored PIONER’s varied environments, I found side quests popping up ad hoc, and uncovering the new locations highlighted on the map with question marks yielded even more content every time. There’s a great looter-shooter loop that allows you to fill your boots with resources quite easily, which will keep you occupied for some time.</p>



<p>There’s a regular rotation of world events, daily challenges keep you in quick rewards, and there’s a noticeboard in the game’s central hub that allows you to unlock time-bound missions at the press of a button.</p>



<p>That’s in addition to the core story, achievements, challenges, and general open-endedness of the game.</p>



<p>Oh, and there’s a PvP function built on a session-based, arena-driven model that means you can get a taste of PvP without worrying about being griefed in the main world. <strong>But </strong>with that being said, GFA <strong>does plan </strong>to introduce PvP-based maps to accommodate the more bloodthirsty players out there.</p>



<p><strong>And if that wasn’t enough</strong>…</p>



<p>There are puzzle challenges, speedrun courses, minigames, and collectibles to uncover all over the world. Nothing feels like a waste of time, which is really nice.</p>



<h2 id="h-now-to-see-how-long-it-lasts">Now to See How Long it Lasts</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fans of Fallout will LOVE PIONER</figcaption></figure>







<p>PIONER is an MMO, and that means it relies solely on players to remain fuelled and in development. It has a premium price point that’s a bit more accessible than most games, plus there’s a microtransaction-backed economy baked into the game.</p>



<p>But without players feeding the flow, PIONER might struggle to leave early access.</p>



<p>GFA Games has planned a console release for the game, which would broaden the title’s horizons, but there’s no indication of when that’ll drop.</p>



<p>This might sound negative, but it’s more pragmatic. I’m already a fan of PIONER and everything it wants to accomplish, and I believe the developers have the chops to get it done. There’s a phenomenal post-apocalyptic palette within PIONER, and the groundwork has been laid for expansions, which is brilliant.</p>



<p>Sure, some of the animations are a little janky, there are bugs present that might make your experience a little skewed, and it’s not fully optimized for all builds, but if you know what you’re getting into, you can’t be surprised. For an early access game from a small studio that has never released a thing, this is a <strong>hugely ambitious MMO with bite</strong>.</p>



<p>I needed a new Fallout 76 to occupy my time after spending 500 hours in that title’s endgame, and along came PIONER.</p>







<h2 id="h-verdict-4-great">Verdict: 4 – Great</h2>



<p>PIONER represents something special. It’s a refreshing, honest attempt to build something extremely ambitious in a world dominated by some immense entities. If GFA Games can iron out the kinks and keep on a steady course out of early access, this could be a hidden gem of the post-apocalyptic space.</p>



<p>I was surprised by how good this game is, and beyond this review, I can guarantee I’ll spend <strong>a lot of time </strong>grinding away at it. This MMO has untold potential, and I’m truly hopeful it stands the test of time.</p>



<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you intend to give PIONER a try. The game is available <strong>exclusively </strong>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam in early access</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Second Expedition Window Confirmed by Countdown]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-second-expedition-window-confirmed/</link>
            <guid>1389976</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has pushed live the Expedition Project window in ARC Raiders <strong>today</strong>, which means that players can finally make good on their efforts over the last few weeks and <strong>leave Speranza</strong>. This is effectively the game’s global reset mechanic, only unlike other extraction games, it’s an optional step.</p>



<p>Users have spotted that the <strong>next </strong>Expedition window should arrive in ARC Raiders from February 22 onwards, if the countdown is anything to go by.</p>







<h2 id="h-one-finished-and-into-another">One Finished and Into Another</h2>



<p>If you’ve completed your Expedition Project today, you’ll be faced with the daunting task of starting from scratch. That means you’ll find yourself at level one with an empty stash, no skills, and empty workbenches, amongst other things.</p>



<p>It also means you’ll be taking advantage of certain temporary buffs, a small stash boost, and an exclusive new skin, <strong>Patchwork</strong>.</p>



<p>Those completing the Expedition Project have noticed that you can start building your <strong>next </strong>Expedition caravan <strong>instantly</strong>. As soon as you’ve reset that event, you start moving on to the next one. That means that you’ll work through the phases all over again, collecting the resources required to go a second time around.</p>



<p>Now to what’s next.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders players on PC can use a trick to manipulate the game. They do this by changing their system date while <strong>in the game,</strong> forcing the state forward and tricking the game’s internal calendar. By doing this, some users have revealed future map conditions, trials, and other additions.</p>



<p>Those completing the Expedition have been given a fresh timer, but if you just manipulate the game in this way, you could have seen that timer anyway.</p>



<p>Given that each Expedition loop, or ‘season’, lasts two months, this was hardly rocket science.</p>



<p>Unlike the Expedition itself. That’s rocket science.</p>



<p>So, if you’re wondering when the next Expedition hits in ARC Raiders, you’ve got something of an answer. It’s worth stressing that these things are subject to change until the update is firmly delivered, as <strong>the current Expedition </strong>was delayed by Embark Studios.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re going to be hitting the wipe in ARC Raiders.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Debunks That It Sets a 30% Profit Margin Goal for Xbox Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-30-percent-debunk/</link>
            <guid>1389952</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft has debunked past claims that it has told its gaming division Xbox that it must target a 30% profit margin.</p>







<p>The debunking came as part of a new <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/21/xbox-console-war-playstation-switch.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNBC report</a> that spoke with Microsoft about multiple issues and reports the company has seen over the past year.</p>



<p>CNBC acknowledges that a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg report</a> said Microsoft has set its gaming division, Xbox, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ambitious goal of achieving a 30% profit margin</a>, which has led to layoffs and cancelled projects. </p>



<p>According to Bloomberg, the target was set by Microsoft’s Chief Financial Officer, Amy Hood, who said that the 30% target was “accountability margins” across the company, including Xbox. The report was subsequently backed up by other industry figures, who said that they had heard similar news of the ambitious targets.</p>



<p>The 30% target is much higher than the industry standard, which averages 17-22%.</p>



<p>In response to the rumor, Microsoft reportedly told CNBC that while the company does set ambitious goals, the reported 30% profit margin target was incorrect.</p>







<div><p>Xbox has had a tough year, with thousands of jobs impacted and several projects cancelled, including The Initiative’s Perfect Dark, Rare’s Everwild, and ZeniMax’s MMO under the codename Blackbird.
