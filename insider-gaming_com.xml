<p>On November 20, Stellar Blade will receive its first major expansion in the form of a Nier Automata crossover. This will bring new characters and missions to the game, and it’ll come hand-in-hand with photomode and several new outfits. In this snapshot guide, we’re walking through all the new Stellar Blade outfits being added alongside the Nier Automata DLC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-eve-s-new-outfits-in-stellar-blade">Eve’s New Outfits in Stellar Blade</h2>



<p>To usher in Stellar Blade’s first major expansion, Eve will get four new outfits:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>FourSeconds Black</strong></li>



<li><strong>FourSeconds Everyday Wear</strong></li>



<li><strong>War Dress</strong></li>



<li><strong>Neurolink Skin</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>That’s in addition to the four outfits introduced with the Nier Automata crossover: 2B, A2, YoRHa, and 2B Black. Eve will also pick up a stylish new accessory – the Symbol of Legacy. When you use this item, it’ll change how Tachy Mode appears in the game. </p>



<p>Here’s a glance at the new Stellar Blade outfits coming with the Nier Automata DLC:</p>

<p>It hasn’t yet been revealed how to unlock the Nier Automata outfits in Stellar Blade, but that will inevitably be confirmed when the DLC is released on November 20. Most likely, users will be able to purchase the new skins from ‘Emil’s Shop’, a fresh trader interface introduced with the Nier Automata DLC. </p>



<p>The most exciting element of the update is the arrival of photomode, which fans have been eagerly waiting for since the game was released in April. The team at Shift Up has also added further lip-synching support for additional languages, better options for customisation (such as Eve’s hair), and various quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p>Hideaki Itsuno, the name behind the Devil May Cry and Dragon’s Dogma franchises, has a new home. The director has taken up a leadership position at <strong>LightSpeed Studios Japan</strong>, a subsidiary of the giant Tencent.</p>



<p>Itsuno will use all his expertise to develop new AAA action games. Hideaki spoke about his new challenge in a <a href="https://www.lightspeed-studios.com/news/Japan-Game-Development-Studio.html">statement to the press</a>.</p>



<p>“<em>Joining LIGHTSPEED STUDIOS is an exciting new chapter for me.</em> <em>With LightSpeed’s strong development capabilities and global network, I’m looking forward to creating original AAA action games together with the amazing team and building innovative and beautiful experiences for the global community of gamers.</em> <em>We welcome all talented and passionate game developers from around the world to join our vision</em>.”</p>



<p>Based in Osaka and Tokyo, the studio’s idea is to build experiences that reach global audiences. Jerry Chen, president of LightSpeed Studios, had this to say:</p>



<p>“<em>The creation of LightSpeed Japan Studio is a significant step in the expansion of LIGHTSPEED STUDIOS and demonstrates our commitment to bringing the best possible games to our players.</em>”</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that the initiative isn’t messing around, signing one of Japan’s leading game developers. Obviously, we don’t have any more details about Hideaki Itsuno’s next adventure. Knowing the director’s style, we can at least hope for addictive combat.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-do-perks-and-wildcards-work-in-warzone">How do Perks and Wildcards work in Warzone?</h2>



<p>Warzone has a “Pick 3 System,” which means you can <strong>pick one Perk from each category</strong> (blue, red, and yellow.) You can then pick <strong>one Wildcard</strong> to compliment your loadout. These Perks will drop on the floor so that they can be looted again upon death.</p>



<p>Players will need to choose one Perk for each slot to make a combination of 3. Most of the Perks can be unlocked through leveling up, while the new ones added in Season 1 (Veteran and Reflexes) are unlocked via Season 1 event rewards. There’s no Combat Specialty. Wildcards are also earned through leveling.</p>



<p>There are also lootable Perks in Warzone that players can find to further fortify their loadout. These include four options from the Pick 3 System and two that are exclusive to loot – Shrouded and Irradiated. Lootable Perks will vanish upon death.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-get-specialist-perk-package-in-warzone">Can you get Specialist Perk Package in Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes</strong>, Specialist Perk Package is back in Warzone x Black Ops 6, and it can be found as a <strong>rare loot drop or via the Care Package Killstreak</strong>. It will give the player all 18 Perks plus the two bootable Perks for a total of 20. Upon death, the Specialist Perk Package will drop and can be looted by anyone.</p>
