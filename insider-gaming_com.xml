<p>The head of studio at Crystal Dynamics has revealed that players don’t need to do homework with previous games before jumping into Tomb Raider: The Catalyst. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Game Awards 2025 made dreams come true for Tomb Raider fans with not one, but two new game announcements. The first is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remake of the original 1996&nbsp;title</a>, arriving during the franchise’s 30th anniversary. The other is a brand new chapter that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-catalyst-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">takes Lara Croft to northern India</a>. We have now received some new details for the latest chapter. </p>







<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-catalyst-is-the-largest-game-for-the-franchise-to-date">Tomb Raider: Catalyst is the ‘Largest Game’ for the Franchise To Date</h2>



<p>During a virtual Q&amp;A session attended by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/tomb-raider-catalyst-is-crystal-dynamics-largest-lara-croft-game-yet-and-theres-no-homework-required-to-jump-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Crystal Dynamics Head of Studio, Scot Amos, provided more details about Tomb Raider: Catalyst. Amos first spoke about the timeline, revealing that the game is set in “the furthest point in [Lara Croft’s] career”. This is where the character is right now, and “everything else is her history”. However, even though this is the furthest point, new players don’t need to play the previous games before Catalyst. </p>



<p>Amos explains that Tomb Raider Catalyst has been designed in a way where new players “can jump in right now and pick up with her adventures as is, like I say, there’s no homework required.” Players who try the new game will feel “this [is a] complete adventure top to bottom, and understand the story and the characters without having to know any of that pre-history.”</p>



<p>The head of studio also revealed that this is “the largest Tomb Raider” that they have ever created, and they are excited about bringing this experience to everyone. The game also features “really vast and varied landscapes as well that are just begging to be explored.”</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Z Kakarot devs have just revealed the release window for Daima Pack Part 2, along with details on the new content. </p>



<p>Back in February 2025, developers revealed that Dragon Ball Z Kakarot will receive Daima—Adventure Through The Demon Realm Pack as additional DLC <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-daima-dlc-part-1-and-2-dates-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">across two packs</a>. The first pack was released in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-has-revealed-new-daima-dlc-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">July 2025</a>. The release window for the second pack has now been announced, and it is arriving early next year. </p>







<h2 id="h-dragon-ball-z-kakarot-daima-pack-part-2-arrives-in-early-2026-with-mini-vegeta">Dragon Ball Z Kakarot Daima Pack Part 2 Arrives in Early 2026 with Mini Vegeta</h2>



<p>A new <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/news/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-daima-pack-part-2-arrives-early-2026-new-character-and-fresh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> by Bandai Namco reveals that Dragon Ball Z Kakarot Adventure Through The Demon Realm Pack part 2 will release in 2026. This new pack will add Vegeta (mini) as a new playable character, along with a new boss fight against Tamagami Number Two, and new enemies from the demon realm. The announcement also came with a new trailer showcasing Mini Vegeta’s moveset and Super Saiyan 3 transformations. They also revealed Tamagami Number Two’s Skills along with the other enemies. </p>

<p>Players will also face two new enemy types as they explore the First Demon World. The first enemy type is the Gendarmerie Tank, known for its heavy hitting and powerful ranged and charged attacks. The other enemy type is Gendarmerie Officers, strong enemies that can summon reinforcements and attack from every angle. </p>



<p>From the looks of it, the Daima DLC might not end with the second part, as we are yet to see Goku’s glorious Super Saiyan 4 transformation arrive for the game, which was teased at the very end of the new trailer. </p>

<p>At The Game Awards 2025, Larian Studios announced the next game in the long-running Divinity franchise. And with the new game on the mind of players, Larian has decided to give owners of Divinity: Original Sin 2—the last game in the series—a free update.</p>



<p>Available starting today, Larian has released a Divinity: Original Sin 2 – Definitive Edition upgrade for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2.</p>







<p>Details on what the free update entails from a technology standpoint haven’t been revealed just yet. The only thing certainly known is that, for PlayStation players, the game it’s PS5 Pro optimized. When more details become available on what the optimizations are and differences from the base version, they’ll be added to this story.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Released originally in 2017, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a sequel to 2014’s Original Sin. While the games are intertwined a bit, Larian has said that Original Sin 2 is a “standalone game and can be experienced on its own.” However, they “ecommend trying out Divinity: Original Sin for the best experience!”</p>



<p>The premise of the second game in the Original Sin subseries is you playing in a world where the Gods are dead. Your player holds powers of a “forbidden magic”, and you find yourself quarantined because of it.</p>







<p>“The Magisters of the Divine Order want to “cure” you of your powers,” the description reads. “But the Order has secrets of its own. Secrets that threaten everyone. If the world remains godless, chaos will rule.”</p>



<p>What do you think of Larian giving a free update for Divinity: Original Sin 2 on current-gen consoles?
