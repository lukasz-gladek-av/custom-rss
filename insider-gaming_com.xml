            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fareeha, a content creator and actor, recently announced on social media that <strong>she’s </strong>the voice of Anran in Overwatch. The newly-added character has been making impressions of late, but Fareeha wanted to take the profile of her addition and go a different way entirely with her feedback.</p>



<p>In a three-minute video uploaded on social media, Fareeha revealed that she’s disappointed with her character’s design and that her vision wasn’t anything close to what Blizzard ultimately produced. She insinuated it falls within the realms of ‘Ozempic Chic’, with developers adhering to unrealistic body standards and producing only slim, traditionally attractive female characters.</p>







<p>Fareeha’s three-minute video has been met with a mixed reception on social media, with some aligning with her values while others have accused the creator of spreading a rhetoric that doesn’t belong in gaming.</p>



<p>She explained her stance on Anran’s design, stating that she had to address the ‘elephant in the room’ but didn’t want to ‘step on the devs’ toes’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I got to mourn Anran between the design I had hoped for and the design we ended up with. Because I think in her comic and the cinematic element, there was a precedent set by it. There was an unspoken promise that said, ‘We’re going to challenge the beauty standards plaguing, ransacking media these days.’</p>



<p>The ‘Ozempic Chic’, the ‘contour your nose, you have no nose, the tiniest nose!’ And I think because of that precedent, people feel, understandably, let down.</p>



<p>Overwatch is a trailblazer at challenging that, right? Trying to break those moulds, trying to explore the bounds of what it means to be good, what it looks like to be heroic. And I think the result we got says something else.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fareeha went on to suggest that Anran’s design ‘leaves a bad taste’ in the mouths of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch</a> fans. She suggests that the model’s design doesn’t match the character’s energy and personality because she’s ‘too docile’ and looks like ‘the younger sister’.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm the voice of Anran in Overwatch!!! 🧡</p><p>I held off on posting about this because I wanted to make sure I could do this discussion justice. Here's a shot at that! </p><p>Let's keep rooting for the version of her that could be. I hope you have so much fun playing her!! 🔥🪭 <a href="https://t.co/jbFbKHPVpb">pic.twitter.com/jbFbKHPVpb</a></p></div>— Fareeha (@AskFareeha) <a href="https://twitter.com/AskFareeha/status/2020291256279089431?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Admittedly, the difference between Anran’s design in the game’s cinematics and in <strong>the game </strong>is pretty obvious, which is a huge sticking point for fans. But some took her words to mean that she’s angry that her character is ‘attractive and thin’.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that the average gamer has taken a hugely judgmental approach to gauging the success of a game based on how its characters look. Just days ago, we saw similar comments surface regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-announces-new-horizon-multiplayer-game/">reveal of Hunter’s Gathering</a>, a multiplayer game set in the Horizon world, which features a heavy-set female character that instantly became the subject of ridicule.</p>



<p>It was the same thing with Concord in 2024.</p>



<p>Do you think Fareeha is right to be concerned about her character’s design, or is it not that deep? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[XboxEra Rebrands as ‘DayOne’ and Promises Busy Year Ahead]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xboxera-rebrands-dayone-busy-year-ahead/</link>
            <guid>1429720</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Our friends at XboxEra have today unveiled a rebrand that pivots the platform away from a focused identity to a wider, more general gaming perspective. Going forward, XboxEra will be known as ‘DayOne’, a rebrand that goes hand-in-hand with a new website, membership service, and a teaser for an upcoming video game backed by the team.</p>



<p>The team at DayOne explained that this monumental shift <em>‘refocuses (them) on what this is ultimately all about – playing great video games.’</em></p>



<h2 id="h-one-xbox-era-ends-another-begins">One (Xbox)Era Ends, Another Begins</h2>



<p>The team at XboxEra has performed a major rebrand, taking the popular news platform and turning it <a href="https://xboxera.com/2026/02/08/xboxera-is-changing-welcome-to-dayone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">into DayOne</a>, a multi-faceted brand aimed at representing the wider gaming market. In a statement issued to Insider Gaming, DayOne’s Jon Clarke explained the need for the change after many years in the business:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When XboxEra launched, the name made a lot of sense. We wanted to build a website focused on Xbox, built by people that actually played there. It was just before the dawn of a new generation and it’s been a pretty crazy time – and it’s fair to say a lot has changed!</p>



<p>Ultimately as time went on, we found ourselves covering – and wanting to cover – more than just Xbox. PC, VR, Nintendo and PlayStation – and all of the industry turbulence, news and culture that came with it. </p>



<p>Beyond all of that though, DayOne refocuses us on what this is ultimately all about – playing great video games, and bringing our readers the best in news, reviews and previews – on day one. It’s a name that we feel ultimately honours our roots and where we came from, but gives us complete freedom to make our corner of the internet even more awesome. </p>



<p>We’re looking to have our new site and membership service live after testing with our community over the course of this month. <strong>It’s going to be a very busy year</strong>!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The rebrand coincides with the team’s <a href="https://xboxera.com/2026/02/08/the-xboxera-podcast-episode-300-celebration-brings-in-some-big-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">300th podcast episode</a>, furthering the cause for celebration. That same podcast will now also be rebranded, adopting the name ‘DayOne Podcast’.</p>



<p>Since 2019, XboxEra has existed in one form or another, starting as that podcast that evolved into a wider news platform. The team reported that 2025 was their biggest year yet for readership, growth, and milestones.</p>



<p>Also, in the most recent episode of the podcast, the team teased the upcoming launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/console-wars-the-card-game-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Console Wars: The Card Game</a> in <strong>video game </strong>form, expanding on the TCG that they developed and released last year.</p>

<p>The 30th anniversary of Pokemon took center stage for a brief moment during Super Bowl 60.</p>



<p>An entire generation of kids who wanted to be the “very best like no one ever was” has grown into a population of adults who have taken different paths but share a love of Pokemon and fond memories of it.</p>



<p>That love was on display in a Super Bowl 60 commercial. Trevor Noah, Lady Gaga, Blackpink’s Jisoo, and more all named their favorites and spoke about why they have a love for the franchise.</p>







<h2 id="h-lady-gaga-s-favorite-is-jigglypuff">Lady Gaga’s Favorite Is Jigglypuff</h2>



<p>It should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga is a fan of Jigglypuff. The Grammy Award-winning Superstar praised the fairy-type Pokemon for using her voice as a means of protection and self-defense. Gaga even noted that Jigglypuff has a 12-octave vocal range.</p>



<p>Trevor Noah remarked that his favorite is Psyduck. Noah praised Psyduck for its ability to change the world with its mind. He also said that every time you met a new one, it was like meeting a new part of yourself.</p>



<p>Charles Leclerc, Lamine Yamal, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, and Young Miko also appeared in the ad, which ran for just over a minute.</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-turns-30">Pokemon Turns 30</h2>



<p>2026 is a big year for Pokemon. It has been 30 years since Pokemon Red and Blue launched on the original Nintendo Game Boy. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-day-2026-pokemon-presents/">Pokemon Day</a> falls on February 27 every year. </p>



<p>Each year, a stream hosted by The Pokemon Company sets the stage for the franchise’s immediate future. This year, fans expect the launch of the 10th generation of everyone’s favorite friendly monsters.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Still Plans First-Party Xbox Handheld, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-still-plans-first-party-xbox-handheld-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>1429477</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As Microsoft continues to shape its vision for the future of the Xbox brand, it still plans to develop a first-party handheld device, even if “everything is an Xbox.”</p>



<p>In 2025, ASUS launched the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-ally/" id="2725">ROG Xbox Ally series </a>of handheld gaming devices. The two new devices were more powerful versions of the previously launched <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/asus-rog-ally/" id="629">ROG Ally systems,</a> designed to make it easier to access PC game launchers, including<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/" id="1075"> Xbox Game Pass.</a></p>



<p>Still, a new <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-the-next-gen-xbox-2027-locked-in-most-ambitious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report from Jez Corden </a>notes that plans remain in place for a first-party Xbox handheld, even if the next mainline Xbox console is the primary focus for now. </p>



<p>The next-generation <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" id="131">Xbox </a>platform is touted as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/microsoft/" id="189">Microsoft’s </a>boldest effort in the gaming space to date, even after a game-changing quarter-century. As such, they’re not committing to a firm launch date for the next home console yet.</p>







<h2 id="h-major-changes-coming-soon-to-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally">Major Changes Coming Soon to the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally</h2>



<p>The report from Corden notes that Microsoft is testing a new NPU-driven highlights feature for the Xbox Ally X that automatically transforms gameplay clips into shareable videos. This feature is slated for a March 2026 release.</p>



<p>The next Xbox console is also set to take notes from the Ally X handheld by bringing multiple launchers, such as the Epic Games launcher and Steam, to the platform. Regardless of the hardware, the overall message remains the same: make Xbox accessible anywhere and everywhere.</p>
