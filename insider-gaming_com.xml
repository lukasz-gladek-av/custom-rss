<p>REANIMAL constantly has you on the edge of your seat, and while you fight for survival and ways to escape, there’s a wealth of collectables to hunt down, including all the Masks to earn the Beneath The Mask Achievement.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tarsier-studios/" id="1858">Tarsier Studios</a>‘ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/reanimal/" id="170941">REANIMAL</a> is split into nine chapters, and Masks can be found in almost every chapter. Additionally, they’re easy to miss, as there is no way to return to a specific section. Instead, the game must be started from scratch if you fail to find everything the first time around.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for the Beneath the Mask achievement in REANIMAL, Insider Gaming has the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-reanimal-mask-locations-listed">All REANIMAL Mask Locations, Listed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to collect. Image via Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-chapter-1-mask-locations">Chapter 1 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Bird Head</strong></p>



<p>The first Mask to collect in REANIMAL is found in the Mill section of Chapter 1, after you have passed through the giant fan. The mask is available soon after your first encounter with The Sniffer.</p>



<p>When the Sniffer appears, run past the big door he closes and turn left, then interact with the wall to hoist your companion up to the platform. Continue to climb the platform, using the companion’s help, until you reach the top of the ladder.</p>



<p>Head left until you reach a door and follow the platform to a crack in the wall. Then collect the Bird Head inside.</p>



<p><strong>Worm Head</strong></p>



<p>The Worm Head mask is again found in the Mill, once you have stopped the boiler from spinning. Once that has been completed, go through the door to continue your progression.</p>



<p>Inside the room, open the locker on the right side to unlock a secret room, and head inside. The Worm Head is waiting inside.</p>



<p><strong>Conch Head</strong></p>



<p>The Conch Head is the final mask in Chapter 1, and is found near the train tracks. When standing alongside the draisine, head to the right-hand side, and enter the second door (the first one is a restroom).</p>



<p>Follow the platform up the stairs to reach a room with the Conch Head inside.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-2-mask-locations">Chapter 2 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Pig Head</strong></p>



<p>The Pig Head is the first mask in Chapter 1, available at the start of the village section.</p>



<p>Inside the Clothing Store, go to the left behind the counter. Here, crouch, and enter the hole in the wall found on the left-side. This leads to another secret room, where the Pig Head is found.</p>



<p><strong>Cone Head</strong></p>



<p>After surviving your close experience with the Sniffer, exit the cinema and go to the broken building on the right side of the main square. Keep an eye out for a citter that exits the broken building. It will enter a secret room on the right-hand side.</p>



<p>Using the crowbar, pull the planks off the door and enter. Hit the critter with the crowbar to kill it and collect the Cone Head.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-3-mask-locations">Chapter 3 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Deer Head</strong></p>



<p>The Deer Head is found soon after you kill the seagulls that are attacking you, using the crowbar. Once that’s done, climb to the top of both ladders to reach the flower field.</p>



<p>Go to the far left side of the flower field to find a scarecrow and hit it with the crowbar. Then, kill the critter that appears to collect the Deer Head from its dead body.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-4-mask-locations">Chapter 4 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Bucket Head</strong></p>



<p>In Chapter 4, the Bucket Head is found in the Orphanage section, and can be from the area with the petrified spider kids. While here, destroy them all to earn the Scared to Dust achievement. </p>



<p>In this room, head to the right-hand side of the room, crouch, and go through the bookshelf to reach a secret area. A critter will then run out of the room, into the area you were just in.</p>



<p>Exit the secret room back into the main room of the clock tower and kill the critter using the crowbar. Then, collect the Bucket Head from its body.</p>



<p><strong>Crown Head</strong></p>



<p>The Crown Head is found shortly after the Bucket Head, after the spider kids begin to attack you in the next area aftern the main room of the clock tower.</p>



<p>Inside the food hall, go into the middle of the room and kill all the spider kids that appear. When the spider kids climb down from the throne from the right side of the room, go behind the throne. One of the kids who appears is the spider king, identifiable by the crown on his head.</p>



<p>Using the crowbar, kill the spider king quickly, as he will leave the room if you don’t kill him quickly. Once he’s defeated, collect the Crown Head from the body.</p>



<p><strong>Plant Head</strong></p>



<p>The Plant Head is the final mask in Chapter 4 and is found just after you reach the point with the child wearing the bucket. Kill all of the spiders before advancing.</p>



<p>Once the spider kids are defeated, shimmy through the crack in the broken bed. Then, head through the door on the other side. Once through the door, walk back towards the camera and shimmy through a crack in the wall.</p>



<p>Pull out the Plant Head from the ground, then pick up the Plant Head.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-5-mask-locations">Chapter 5 Mask Locations</h3>



<p>There are no masks to find in Chapter 5 of REANIMAL.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-6-mask-locations">Chapter 6 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Fish Head</strong></p>



<p>Once you input the code on Cannon Island, the Fish Head is ready to claim. First, though, there’s a small cutscene to watch.</p>



<p>When it’s finished, go left and shimmy through the door of the bunker, and down the ladder to the bottom. From here, jump down to the beach below.</p>



<p>Head to the left-hand side of the beach to find a critter and kill it. Then, collect the Fish Head from the body.</p>



<p><strong>Package Head</strong></p>



<p>To get the Package Head, return to the boat after firing the cannon on Cannon Island, and enter the path that was previously protected by the Brook Horse until you reach a big opening.</p>



<p>Continue down the path, blowing up any mines by throwing the harpoon, and when you get to the end of the path, turn left and follow the cliffs until you reach the mines, which you need to blow up again using the harpoon.</p>



<p>Follow the path to reach a beach, drive the boat onto the beach, and collect the Package Head from the middle of the area.</p>



<p><strong>Diving Helmets</strong></p>



<p>There are two Diving Helmets to collect, both at the same point, which are found soon after the cutscene following the chase by Brook Horse.</p>



<p>Once the cutscene ends, wait for the characters to put down their costumes, and then pick up each of the Diving Helmets.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-7-mask-locations">Chapter 7 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Bush Head</strong></p>



<p>The Bush Head mask is obtainable right at the start of Chapter 7. After the cutscene ends, go forward into the next area, and head to the right-hand side to find a small metallic door.</p>



<p>Crouch to go under the door into the secret area, and pick up the Bush Head.</p>



<p><strong>Mine Head</strong></p>



<p>The Mine Head is obtained immediately after the Bush Head. Once you pick up the Bush Head, go down the ramp on the left and proceed forward past the two dead soldiers, then turn right and go past the shotrgun soldier.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the trench, turn right and shimmy through the broken wall, and collect the Mine Head in the area.</p>



<p><strong>Rabbit Head</strong></p>



<p>Once the Mine Head is collected, go further into the trench until you reach a soldier blocking the way. Approach the soldier to trigger an animation, run a safe distance away from the soldier, and then go past the exploding soldier to the opening.</p>



<p>Now, head left and shimmy through the broken wall to collect the Rabbit Head.</p>



<p><strong>Amphibian Head</strong></p>



<p>The Amphibian Head is the penultimate mask to collect in REANIMAL and can be collected once you reach the surgery room in the hospital in Chapter 8.</p>



<p>Find the desk on the right-hand side of the room, crouch, and go under the desk into the next room, then pick up the Amphibian Head.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-8-mask-locations">Chapter 8 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Gas Head</strong></p>



<p>The Gas Head is the final mask to find in REANIMAL, and is available to obtain once you have shot the hanging soldier, who drops a key.</p>



<p>Use this key to unlock the door on the right-hand side of the area and go through it, then look for the oven and interact with it to open the door with a crowbar. No, head back into the shooting range, and shoot the critter with a gun or rifle, and pick up the Gas Head.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-9-mask-locations">Chapter 9 Mask Locations</h3>



<p>There are no masks or any other collectables to find in Chapter 9.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega </a>has big plans for the immediate future.</p>



<p>On February 13, 2026, <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_q3_presentation_e.pdf">Sega announced its third-quarter earnings</a> for the fiscal year 2026. When outlining their business initiatives for the upcoming fiscal year, Sega stated that they planned to release four major new titles for their mainstay properties.</p>







<h2 id="h-sega-has-a-wealth-of-classic-properties-to-choose-from">Sega Has A Wealth of Classic Properties to Choose From</h2>



<p>Sega was once a titan of the gaming industry. At one time, they had even knocked Nintendo out of the number one spot during the Golden Age of the console wars of the 1990s. For most of the last three decades, however, they have focused on third-party software development, continuing the legacy of their popular gaming IPs on other platforms.</p>



<p>Several years ago, Sega announced it was developing new games in its classic series. The rollout schedule in Sega’s earnings presentation reaffirms this. Not only did they say they plan to release at least four major games across mainstay properties, but the release schedule also lists new projects in the Virtua Fighter, Golden Axe, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi franchises. Alien: Isolation is also listed. All six of those titles have TBD release dates.</p>







<p>With forthcoming releases in those classic properties, Sega could be hoping to return to a higher level of notoriety. Recently, Konami announced a return of one of its strongest franchises, Castlevania.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/santa-monica-developing-more-than-just-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>1435093</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new claim reveals that another title is in the works at Santa Monica Studios, alongside the God of War Trilogy Remake, which could be Cory Barlog’s game. </p>



<p>There were many God of War titles rumoured to be in development, including a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer title</a> and one set in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egyptian mythology</a>. Out of all the rumoured ones, the Trilogy Remake and Sons of Sparta got confirmed yesterday. However, there is one more title players have been curious about: Cory Barlog’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/santa-monica-studios-next-game-is-progressing-well-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next game</a>, for which we seem to have new details. </p>







<h2 id="h-cory-barlog-s-game-could-be-revealed-soon">Cory Barlog’s Game Could Be Revealed Soon</h2>



<p>During a new discussion on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot49-hunters-gathering-on-tau-ceti.1433161/page-22#post-151278571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>, shinobi602 replied ‘naw’ when asked “Please&nbsp;shinobi602&nbsp;tell us that the GoW remake is not the Cory Barlog project? The insider then added that the game is “Not that far (barring any delays of course).” He also added that the reveal of this project is expected to be this year, and “given the quarter they’re targeting,” it is likely the reveal could be at the May State of Play or Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, but Shinobi doesn’t know that for sure yet. </p>



<p>Shinobi added that if the reveal doesn’t come by then Santa Monica may have either pushed the game’s release, or kept a “shorter reveal to release” window. That’s all we know about the other Santa Monica game at the moment; however, readers should take this information with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>Santa Monica had some huge reveals planned for yesterday’s State of Play event, giving it a picture-perfect finale. They not only confirmed that a God of War Trilogy Remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was in development</a>, but also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadow-dropped</a> the 2D God of War title for players to try out now. </p>

Additionally, the live-action God of War series for Amazon Prime Video has cast&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ryan-hurst-comments-on-playing-kratos-in-prime-videos-god-of-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kratos</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-live-action-series-secures-atreus-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atreus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prime-video-casts-thor-and-odin-in-god-of-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thor, Odin</a>,&nbsp;and more.
