<p>Splitgate 2, which was recently rebranded as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, has been having a fairly tough time of late. The game was relaunched after being pulled back to beta following a hampered and relatively disastrous summer release, but the second wind has failed to generate much traction.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the Splitgate developers at 1047 Games addressed the ongoing discourse around the game’s lack of success, which typically relies on Steam player numbers to frame a picture of the game’s struggles.</p>



<p>The developers are saying, as many have before, that Steam’s player numbers aren’t indicative of the bigger picture.</p>







<h2 id="h-don-t-rely-on-steam-to-get-your-consensus">Don’t Rely on Steam to Get Your Consensus</h2>



<p>In a recent post on social media damning the discourse around Splitgate: Arena Reloaded’s inability to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-failed-secure-traction-fumbled-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generate any hype</a> the second time around, <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the team said</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Steam Charts don’t measure fun.</p>



<p>They show one number, one one platform, at one given moment. They don’t show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don’t capture the community that’s actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale).</p>



<p>Over the past six months, we rebuilt Splitgate from the ground up because we believe in the game, our team, and our community. The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of Splitgate possible.</p>



<p>To our amazing community: thank you. Your feedback and passion have helped make Arena Reloaded better every day.</p>



<p>And to everyone who hasn’t played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay’s the best it’s ever been, and we’d love for you to jump in and form your own opinion. A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For reference, here’s what the Steam Charts look like for Splitgate: Arena Reloaded at the time of writing:</p>

<p>This statement comes months after Splitgate 2’s sentiments plummeted around a miserable launch and a marketing campaign that fell flat in a pretty spectacular way. There were concerns about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-battle-royale-drops-fans-concerned-microtransactions/">microtransactions</a> and bold statements made by the 1047 leadership team, and on two occasions, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developer-holds-another-round-of-layoffs/">layoffs were made</a> that further damaged the company’s PR image.</p>



<p>Even the game’s paid influencer campaign came under fire, with one analyst labelling the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-analysis-condemns-tone-deaf-influencer-campaign/">effort ‘tone deaf’</a> and stressing that it ‘alienated its core audience in pursuit of mainstream appeal.’</p>
