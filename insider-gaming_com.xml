<p>Star Wars Galactic Racer was announced today with a new trailer and is set to arrive for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2026. </p>



<p>The Game Awards was a good day for Star Wars fans, as earlier in the event, Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-shockingly-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>. Now, it has been revealed that the event had not one but two Star Wars game announcements, and the new one falls surprisingly in the racing genre. </p>



<h2 id="h-star-wars-galactic-racer-releases-2026">Star Wars Galactic Racer Releases 2026</h2>

<p>The official description of Star Wars Galactic Racer states that it is “a runs-based, high-stakes reinvention of racing born in the lawless Outer Rim of the Star Wars galaxy.” The Empire is gone, and the galaxy is rebuilding, leading to the creation of the Galactic League. This league is an “underground, unsanctioned circuit where syndicates bankroll chaos and champions are forged.” The game will be available to wishlist from today. </p>



<p>In other news, a full remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-2-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly in development</a>. Additionally, Quantic Dream has stated that Star Wars Eclipse development “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quantic-dream-says-star-wars-eclipse-development-continues-alongside-a-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continues</a>” alongside a new game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Phantom Blade Zero is finally coming out in September 2026. The news comes from a new trailer shown during The Game Awards, which showcases thrilling gameplay</p>



<p>Revealed in 2023, Phantom Blade Zero follows an assassin tasked with locating the killer of The Order’s patriarch. Mixing the gameplay of Soulsborne titles and RPGs, its combat system and graphics look top-notch. Insider Gaming even went <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on with the title</a> earlier this year, calling it a ‘day-one purchase’ and ‘a great time’. It was announced that a date would be announced for the title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-release-date-announcement-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier last week</a> for The Game Awards. Now, fans can mark their calendars for September 2026.</p>







<p>This story is currently in development and will be updated once more information is available.</p>

<p>In the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhxdG_-e1zM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above at The Game Awards 2025</a>, fans get a sneak peak at the intense combat and visuals. It certainly rings familiar to other titles like Black Myth: Wukong. Many story elements also come to pass, sporting an origin story of sorts for the protagonist. However, at the end, the official release date for Phantom Blade Zero is shown: September 9th, 2026.</p>



<p>It’s clear the team at S-Game is fairly confident in the final product. In many previews, the wuxia-inspired combat system and stunning visuals were a highlight. If it can live up to other Chinese games like Black Myth: Wukong and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Phantom Blade Zero has the chance to hit it big. Soulslike or not, it’s sure to gain some traction when it releases in September 2026.</p>
