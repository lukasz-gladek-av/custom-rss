<p>After nine years, Rainbow Six Siege is finally getting crossplay between PC and Console players. The news was announced as part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4tB2kOgWqs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Operation Collision Point</a> reveal on Sunday.</p>



<p>When playing online, players on console will have three different pools to choose from when looking for a match. There will be platform-specific pools to keep you against those on the same system, a consoles-only pool to allow crossplay between PlayStation and Xbox, and a PC crossplay pool. The pool can be set in the general settings under “Crossplay Matchmaking”.</p>



<p>As far as the players are concerned, they’ll be able to invite anyone to a match through Ubisoft Connect. Those on console who decide they want to play with PC players will have a separate PC rank from their traditional console rank for ranked playlists.</p>







<p>With the addition of crossplay between the platforms, the team knows that cheating is a concern. It’s something that the developers have been working on handling before the feature became available.</p>



<p>“We are excited to confirm that MouseTrap V2 will be a part of this feature to keep things balanced,” UX Designer Abhishek Agarwal said. </p>



<p>Creative Director Alexander Karpazis added that the system will allow detection if someone is trying to play with a mouse and keyboard against just console players that will move players to the PC pool if they are detected. Regarding cheating, there is a new “Cheater Match Cancellation” system that will remove a cheater from the game and cancel the entire match if one is detected.</p>



<p>What do you think of Rainbow Six Siege getting full crossplay support? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Knowing firsthand whether you can run an upcoming simulator is step number one in immersing yourself in the experience wholly. With a game like Microsoft Flight Simulator 2025, the system requirements determine everything, down to your enjoyment of the game. If your computer can’t run the title, you’ll find it a jarring experience that runs the risk of leading to motion sickness. Thankfully, we have the info you need!</p>



<h2 id="h-here-s-the-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-pc-requirements">Here’s the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PC Requirements</h2>



<p>In a simulation game that somehow manages to span the entire planet, albeit in minimal detail in some locations, one would assume the system requirements would be exceptional. They’re pretty high in some spots. Previously, there were rumors that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-on-pc-wants-64gb-ram-to-run-at-its-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MFS 2024 would require 64 GB of RAM</a> to run on the high-end. However, that doesn’t appear to be the case any longer, as the recommended amount of RAM sits at 32 GB currently. </p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-requirements">Minimum Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X / Intel Core i7-6800K</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Radeon RX 5700 / GeForce GTX 970</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 50 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>



<li><strong>Network</strong>: Broadband – Network Speed of 10 Mbps Bandwidth</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-requirements">Recommended Requirements</h3>

</ul>







<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-releasing-on">What Platforms is Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Releasing On?</h2>



<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will be released on November 19 and immediately available to play on PC and Xbox Series X|S. Unfortunately, the flight simulator that spans the globe isn’t coming to PlayStation 5. There’s no word on whether this might change, but with past Microsoft console-exclusive titles, like Grounded and Sea of Thieves, launching on PS5, it’s not outside the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>It’s becoming the norm for an upcoming game to launch with two, three, or sometimes even four unique editions that vary in price and content. The more you spend, the more in-game content you receive. It’s a shame. But if you’re the type of gamer who only plays a handful of titles throughout the year, especially if you have a favorite franchise, paying a little extra for one game makes more sense. Regarding the many airplanes in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, paying for the most expensive edition is how you’ll unlock everything at launch.</p>

<p>FromSoftware is set to bring back its best-selling Dark Souls game for a new audience. According to a new claim, Dark Souls 3 is getting the remaster treatment from the studio.</p>



<p>The report comes from known leaker “<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shpeshalnick.xboxera.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shpeshal Nick</a>” Nick Baker, who made the reveal during the latest episode of his Xbox Era podcast.</p>



<p>“A lot of people will probably file this under ‘this was obvious’,” he said. “What I have heard is that we are getting a Dark Souls 3 remaster.”</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-nbsp-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>Baker hinted that he had more information on the remaster, but wasn’t “allowed to pass that on”. One aspect was regarding resolution and framerate that Nick believes “will be more” than the 1080p 60FPS that the original game features.</p>



<p>First released in 2016, Dark Souls 3 is the best-selling Dark Souls game with over 10 million copies sold. As a franchise, Dark Souls has sold over 35 million units since its debut in September 2011. It also helped fully establish the Souls-like genre that a number of games have utilized in recent years  like the Nioh series, Lords of the Fallen, and more.</p>
