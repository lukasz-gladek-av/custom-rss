<p>Updates have been announced for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6 </a>in version 1.2.1.5</p>



<p>The Battlefield Communications team announced the next update to the game. This next update focuses on quality-of-life improvements, stability fixes, and the resolution of issues across a wide variety of game modes and overall gameplay.</p>







<h2 id="h-touted-quality-of-life-updates-coming-to-battlefield-6">Touted Quality-of-Life Updates Coming to Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>The new update is scheduled to go live on March 3. Among the major updates are additional stability improvements to prevent crashes. Also, the team says they have improved the front-end for a smoother experience.</p>



<p>Plus, they say they’ve restored missing Store items to player inventory. These items are from the Bountiful Harvest, Pax Vanguard, and Devil Dogs bundles.</p>







<h2 id="h-additional-improvements-coming-in-new-update">Additional Improvements Coming in New Update</h2>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-access-outpost-zone-in-marathon-server-slam-playtest/</link>
            <guid>1448833</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Marathon Server Slam Playtest is finally here, and it gives players a huge glimpse into what the full game will be like at launch. From early quests to the full roster of guns, there’s plenty for fans to dip their feet into, but there does seem to be one major point of confusion.</p>



<p>The maps. When you load up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> Server Slam Playtest and prepare for a run, you’ll see three maps available: Perimeter, Dire Marsh, and Outpost. There’s no trouble accessing the first two, but Outpost seems to be causing some problems.</p>







<p>If you’re confused, then don’t worry, you’re in the right place. Here’s whether you can access the Outpost map during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-dates-times-platforms-content/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-dates-times-platforms-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon Server Slam Playtest</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-access-the-outpost-zone-in-the-marathon-server-slam-playtest">Can You Access The Outpost Zone In The Marathon Server Slam Playtest?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Take your pick. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, despite it appearing on the map selection screen, you cannot play on the Outpost map during the Marathon Server Slam Playtest. </strong></p>



<p>It might come as a disappointment to some fans out there, especially since it’s teased for all to see, but Bungie did warn players which maps will be playable during the Playtest—and Outpost didn’t make the cut. </p>

</ul>



<p>Still, it does pose a new question for fans of the Server Slam: When will Outpost be playable? </p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-outpost-be-playable-in-marathon">When Will Outpost Be Playable In Marathon?</h2>



<p><strong>The Outpost map will be fully playable when Marathon releases on March 5, 2026. It will be one of the three maps available at launch, alongside both Perimeter and Dire Marsh.</strong></p>



<p>With that in mind, it’s honestly quite crazy that Bungie made two of the three maps playable during what is essentially a glorified beta test for the game. That doesn’t leave a whole lot left to uncover when the game officially releases, but there is still the largely unknown endgame map—the Cryo Archive. </p>

</ul>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a> have described this as the ultimate endgame for Marathon, and it should be playable just a few weeks after launch. Fingers crossed that it’s worth the wait, and that Outpost is just as fun to explore as the other two maps.</p>

<p>If you can’t get enough of the real-life Pokémon Trading Card Game, then you need to get ready for a Pokémon 30th Anniversary TCG Set, and early release period details are out for it.</p>



<p>Collectors everywhere don’t care how many new Pokémon sets are released in the TCG; packs will be bought, cards will be pulled, and binders will be stacked. We learned so much from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2026-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon&nbsp;Presents&nbsp;February 2026 showcase</a>, and one of the biggest surprises was the announcement of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-30th-anniversary-tcg-set-revealed-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30th anniversary set</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-pokemon-s-30th-anniversary-tcg-set-coming-out-release-period-explained">When Is Pokémon’s 30th Anniversary TCG Set Coming Out? Release Period, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pokémon Company has indicated that the set is arriving at some point in 2026, but based on historical data, it’s believed the set is destined for a Fall 2026 release—between September and November.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone hates vague release windows, especially ones that span a full year!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-things-we-learned-from-pokemon-winds-pokemon-waves-first-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 Things Learned From Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves Trailer</a></li>
</ul>



<p>But a closer look at dedicated Pokémon TCG social media pages might give more useful insight into when it’s arriving. Pokemon TCG Restocks &amp; News said: “If it follows the past Celebrations set, it will likely release in the fall!”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If it follows the past Celebrations set, it will likely release in the fall!</p>— Pokemon TCG Restocks &amp; News (@PokemonRestocks) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonRestocks/status/2027388937170268503?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Furthermore, Pokémon Deals, Stock &amp; News UK offered a similar sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“They just said 2026. I expect around September/October.”<a href="https://x.com/pokemondealsuk/status/2027387540752237017"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Obviously, this doesn’t mean it’s guaranteed, but with Perfect Order and Chaos Rising arriving next, we know the 30th Anniversary set isn’t releasing anytime soon. A Fall 2026 window looks very likely, so it would be wise to assume it’s another few months off yet.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Inject it into our veins. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pokémon 30th Anniversary TCG Set is expected to be a reprint of many of the TCG’s most iconic cards over the last three decades, immortalized with a special 30th anniversary logo or stamp.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-winds-and-waves-gen-10-starters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves Starters</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s every card shown in the set reveal trailer to give you an idea of what’s coming:</p>



<ul>
<li>Charizard (Base Set)</li>



<li>Lugia (e-Series Crystal)</li>



<li>Palkia Lv. X</li>



<li>Uxie (Diamond &amp; Pearl)</li>



<li>Giratina &amp; Darkrai (Legends)</li>



<li>Genesect EX</li>



<li>Solgaleo GX</li>



<li>Zacian V</li>



<li>Pikachu &amp; Zekrom GX (Tag Team)</li>



<li>Raikou (Amazing Rare)</li>



<li>Arceus VStar</li>
</ul>



<p>This is merely a taster of what’s likely to be a full 200-300 card set, littered with Holos, Full Arts, and many more insanely valuable rares—there’s got to be some Charizards, right?</p>
