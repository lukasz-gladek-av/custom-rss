<p>Stellar Blade has been stellar in every sense of the word. The hit action title has been universally well-received, and much more Stellar Blade content is on the way. Much of this was already known. However, what isn’t as evident is that the iconic PlayStation veteran had a huge say in the franchise coming to PlayStation 5 first.</p>



<p>Many consider <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shuehei-yoshida-thinks-dangerous-subscription-models-wont-advance-the-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shuhei Yoshida</a> a godfather of gaming and a bona fide PlayStation guru. Yoshida assumed various roles within PlayStation over the course of his 30-plus-year career there. We’ve since learned that one of his final contributions to the company was recommending and securing Stellar Blade.</p>

<p>Through <a href="https://minimap.net/magazine/Shuhei-Yoshida-Interview-en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Minimap</a>, we’ve learned that Shuhei Yoshida visited Shift Up’s Korean studio during the game’s development. He’d gotten wind of an “outstanding console game” being worked on and decided to visit the team and try it out.</p>



<p>Yoshida was immediately impressed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“To my surprise, the new project had exceptional quality across the board-3D modeling, realism, graphics, and action. When I played it myself, it felt stylish, polished, and genuinely fun. What impressed me most was the way the team designed characters. Their process of creating digital figures from physical models was detailed and artistic.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stellar Blade has made an indelible impression as Yoshida and one of his associates agreed on the title’s potential:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“‘We absolutely want this game on PlayStation [said Yoshida’s colleague],’ and I completely agreed. When I returned to the office, I told the team, “This is a truly remarkable game.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And that was it! With Yoshisa’s blessing, Sony Interactive Entertainment handled the game’s publishing. The seal of approval has worked out well for all parties. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-quietly-revealed-by-developer-shift-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade sequel was quietly revealed by Shift Up</a>.</p>



<p>The game went on to receive a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-pc-system-requirements-minimum-recommended-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC port</a>, and it’s also gotten <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-receives-3-new-epilogues-with-the-latest-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3 new epilogues with a new update</a>. It feels like Shift Up has a special franchise-in-the-making on its hands. Let us know if you’ve played Stellar Blade. How does it compare to other intense action games?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This weekend, it wasn’t just League of Legends that enjoyed a masterful tournament final. Honor of King’s biggest event, the King Pro League, enjoyed a grand final stage that broke records and made history. In China, an astonishing 62,196 esports fans descended upon the National Stadium, surpassing the esports spectator record set in 2016 by <strong>almost 20,000</strong> people.</p>



<p>The record of around 45,000 spectators was previously secured by PES 2016 UEFA Euro, an event held in Paris. Honor of Kings has decimated that record, and even ahead of the event taking place, there were signs that it would do just that.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-king-pro-league-smashes-records">The King Pro League Smashes Records</h2>



<p>Honor of Kings now holds the Guinness World Record for the largest live audience ever in attendance at an esports match. In the grand final of the recent King Pro League in China, 61,196 fans watched the action unfold, proving unequivocally that mobile esports is extremely powerful.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This triumph is important for a few reasons.</p>



<p>Firstly, it’s proving that the accessibility and diversity of mobile games are drawing in a stunning audience. Honor of Kings boasts 260 <strong>million </strong>monthly users, playing across a network that covers 200+ countries. It’s a massively popular game in China, which is where the majority of the game’s market resides.</p>



<p>That’s an indicator of how it was so successful at China’s National Stadium.</p>



<p>Further, mobile gaming is coming up and becoming a more international concept. It has done drastically well in Asian markets but is quickly expanding across LATAM and Africa. While Europe and North America are typically focused more on PC-based esports titles, it’s only a matter of time before the mobile boom hits those regions too.</p>



<p>This redefinition of esports spectatorship has set a new bar for mobile esports.</p>

<p>Steam could be getting ready to reveal the first details of its new VR headset. According to known Valve insider Brad Lynch, the company could be ready to announce its new device, expected to be called the Steam Frame, sometime this week.</p>



<p>He’s even been told a specific day to keep an eye on.</p>



<p><strong>“I’m just going to flat out say it,”</strong> Lynch said in his Discord. <strong>“I was told by a few sources, across a few weeks, to keep an eye out for this week. More specifically on Wednesday.”</strong></p>



<p>He added that it <strong>“doesn’t seem to be out of the question”</strong> for Valve to announce the device. Lynch says that he feels the company will <strong>“need a week or two to explain the device to people before opening orders anyway.”</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Valve for comment on these claims.</p>



<p>Rumors and reports about the new Steam VR headset have been out for months. Earlier this year, it was claimed that the plan was for Valve to release the headset <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-vr-headset-1200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the end of 2025</a> with a price of $1,200. In September, the likely name for the device was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steams-new-vr-headset-might-have-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered via a trademark filing</a> and datamining. Finally, in early October, it was reported that the Steam Frame had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valves-next-steamvr-headset-has-reportedly-entered-mass-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entered mass production</a> with initial production plans to call for 400,000-600,000 units. </p>



<p>Of the mass production claims, Lynch said that the SteamVR Beta included Deckard, the device’s codename, DV1 and DV2 models. He said that <strong>“DV units are the final stages before the model (PV) that consumers will buy.”</strong></p>



<p>The Steam Frame is expected to launch alongside the new “Roy” controllers for the device as well. But that’s not all. Steam is reportedly working on a new Steam Controller 2 and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new SteamOS console</a> of some sort.</p>
