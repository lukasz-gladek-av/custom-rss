<h2 id="h-best-christmas-gifts-for-those-who-love-gaming">Best Christmas Gifts for Those Who Love Gaming</h2>



<p>When making a list of items to get people who love to game, many different thoughts come to mind. However, some may end up being a bit pricier, like a new PC or console. Assuming that every one this list is for already has something to play video games on, we are going to make this list dedicated more towards accessories and more.</p>



<p>Here are the best Christmas gifts for gamers. </p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-gift-cards">Gift Cards</h3>

<hr>



<h3 id="h-gaming-headset">Gaming Headset</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Is your favorite gamer in need of a new headset? Luckily, there are quite a few on the market that work for both PC and console. Brands such as HyperX, Logitech and Turtle Beach all make extremely affordable headsets that come equipped with decent mics.</p>



<p>Not only do headsets look great as an accessory, but they can really make or break a gamer’s gaming experience. Having a good headset is essential for all gamers.</p>



<p>Headsets can be found online at Amazon, Best Buy and any other major retailer.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-controller-charger">Controller Charger</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Is your favorite gaming enthusiast a controller gamer? Well, no one enjoys having to plug in their wireless controller or change the batteries frequently. That is why having a controller charger is a must for a gamer.</p>



<p>In fact, many of these chargers can work as a dock station, charging multiple controllers at once. This allows people to never worry about their battery running out.</p>



<p>Controller chargers can be found on almost any major retailer’s website or in-store.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-gaming-chair">Gaming Chair</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Having a good gaming chair is essential. The truth is, many of those who game up close to a monitor have already begun to develop terrible posture and back issues. Having the right chair to prevent this could really help with any future health issues.</p>



<p>However, good gaming chairs can be quite expensive. While Amazon and Walmart do have some decent ones for cheap, if you are willing to spend a lot of money, then <a href="https://secretlab.co/collections/promotions?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=secretlab&amp;utm_campaign=us-s-brand-exact&amp;stop_redirect=true&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAudG5BhAREiwAWMlSjISSPn-XXGekcKL3Za2Bhr-sR7kap-eGnI8V7m8FztnoYEfcHDvISxoCAgUQAvD_BwE">Secretlabs</a> would be a great purchase.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-mouse-pad">Mouse Pad</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>We have already discussed controller accessories, but what about mouse and keyboard accessories? While having a full-desk mouse pad is great for gaming on a PC, it is also fun to have one with a unique design.</p>



<p>Whether it’s anime or other fantasy worlds, shops like <a href="https://higround.co/?tw_source=google&amp;tw_adid=645614658202&amp;tw_campaign=20950847950&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAudG5BhAREiwAWMlSjPiGrbC5QxGYaDGGAZm4CDm-ZRYFwE-xc3PgODY-c5phDlKumWeBlxoCaWEQAvD_BwE">Higround</a> have some of the most unique and impressive mouse pad designs on the market. </p>



<p>Help deck your gamer’s setup by getting him one of these top-of-the-market mouse pads. </p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-lighting">Lighting</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>RGB lighting is huge within the gaming world. Whether you are getting strips to put around your favorite gamer’s desk or buying Philips Hue lights to put behind their TV, lighting helps really immerse a gamer into the gaming experience.</p>



<p>Every major retailer sells lighting and you can even find special smart lights at stores like Home Depot and Lowes.</p>



<p>What will you be buying your favorite gamer for Christmas this year?</p>

<p>I’m as much of a sucker for a physical collector’s edition of my favorite video games as anyone else, and you can bet I have my eye on the Stalker 2 Ultimate Edition. It’s expensive, though.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-cracking-down-on-call-of-duty-vpn-users.1035228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/activision-cracking-down-on-call-of-duty-vpn-users/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Activision’s Team RICOCHET has published changes on Black Ops 6 and Warzone to combat account boosting and VPN users. For the longest time, gamers worldwide have accused streamers of abusing ‘VPN lobbies’ to get better clips while playing in regions with a less talented pool of players.</p>



<p>In the latest round of changes, RICOCHET has confirmed how it’s tackling that practice, and while it’s not eradicating the use of VPNs, it’s ‘cutting down’ VPN abuse.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-wherever-you-will-go">Wherever You Will Go</h2>



<p>Using a VPN in Call of Duty has been a thing for several years. Typically, players will use a VPN to get away from highly competitive regions like the United Kingdom, North America, and some European countries. It reached a point where some VPN providers were marketing their products directly at Call of Duty players trying to circumvent ‘tougher lobbies’.</p>



<p>In a recent update, it was confirmed that Team RICOCHET (and Treyarch) has deployed two new changes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enhanced AFK detections to battle against account boosting</li>



<li>Adjusting ping thresholds to require players to play matches in their region to cut down on VPN abuse</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’ve got awful internet, then the latter change might impact you regardless of whether you have a VPN active or not. One thing that users insist Activision needs to address is the number of players taking part in the practice of ‘2 boxing’.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is yet to have a serious issue with cheaters, so something is being done right at Team RICOCHET. In the latter months of its lifecycle, Modern Warfare III was plagued by cheaters, particularly the Ranked Play platform. In the coming days, Ranked Play will hit Black Ops 6, so it could just be a matter of time before this game also suffers.</p>

<p>In a rather surprising turn of events, in celebration of Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, Blizzard unveiled and surprise launched remasters of Warcraft 1 and Warcraft 2, which are available on Battle.net at this very moment. If you want to purchase the entire collection, you can score Warcraft Remastered, Warcraft 2 Remastered, and Warcraft 3 Reforged for $39.99 in a unique Battle Chest. Oh, and if you buy now, you’ll also receive Warcraft Orcs &amp; Humans, Warcraft 3 Reforged multiplayer hero skins, and the World of Warcraft Meat Wagon mount, akin to a siege weapon with massive, bloody spikes on its front, rear, and wheels.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ryZ2jiW95qo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The surprise shadow drop of both Warcraft remasters occurs alongside the announcement that, after two decades, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/after-20-years-world-of-warcraft-is-getting-player-housing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Warcraft is finally getting player housing</a> in its upcoming expansion, Midnight. However, it’s still a year or two away from launch. But for now, if you pick up the Warcraft Battle Chest, you’ll find yourself with plenty of real-time strategy goodness to sift through before then.</p>



<p>For now, let’s focus on Warcraft Remastered and Warcraft 2 Remastered. For starters, Brad Chan, senior manager of Warcraft RTS, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>These remasters have brand new hand drawn visuals that capture the original art style from each game, and you’ll be able to swap between the original graphics and the remastered versions in real time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The remasters feature UI and UX improvements, making both real-time strategy games more accessible to modern audiences. Alongside the remasters, Warcraft 3: Reforged Patch 2.0 is on its way, featuring an environment and lighting overhaul, and improvements to the user interface. Oh, and there are uprezzed HD assets.</p>



<p>Is Warcraft a little too old for your tastes? Let us know if you’re hopping into the remastered RTS trilogy this week with the Battle Chest by visiting us on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>It wasn’t long ago that Blizzard took the stage at BlizzCon 2023 to announce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-worldsoul-saga-warcraft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20 more years of World of Warcraft with the Worldsoul Saga</a>!</p>
