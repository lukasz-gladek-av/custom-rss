            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will integrate the campaign’s final mission into a 32-player multiplayer experience for the first time ever in the series.</p>



<p>According to sources who wished to remain anonymous as they couldn’t talk about the game’s plans, Black Ops 7’s hotly rumored ‘Avalon’ map, which was initially planned as a Battle Royale map, will be the title’s 12th and final mission in the Black Ops 7 campaign.</p>



<p>It’s said that although some POIs in Avalon will be present as a part of the game’s campaign (which can be played in up to 4-player co-op), the fully fledged map will be the game’s ‘final mission’.</p>



<p>The final mission sounds awfully like an extraction-based shooter, where players will need to complete objectives and extract, but we’ll have to wait and see exactly what that means.</p>



<p>It was said that the mission will be ‘hardcore’ and similar to other extraction shooters on the market; if you’re killed and your squad is wiped, you will lose all your character’s progress.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-full-integration">Black Ops 7 Full Integration</h2>



<p>It’s said that the somewhat bizarre move for the multiplayer and campaign merge in Black Ops 7 is a part of the game’s full progression integration across all three game modes (campaign, multiplayer, and zombies). Where, no matter where or what you play, you’ll still progress.</p>



<p>That means that even during a campaign mission, players will still be able to level up their weapons, characters, and even the Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Personally, I find it a bit odd that Avalon is being used for the mode, and if this experience is connected to only the premium, perhaps the goal is to offer free-to-play weekends to entice paying players? But does Call of Duty really need that? </p>



<p>More information surrounding the campaign, multiplayer, and zombies will be released on August 19, with the announcement of multiplayer happening at Gamescom Opening Night Live.</p>



<p>Whether Black Ops 7’s Avalon will be a future Warzone map is currently unclear. Let me know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>&nbsp;what you think.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-moving-forward-targeted-cost-initiatives-ai-use/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embracer-moving-forward-with-%E2%80%9Ctargeted-cost-initiatives%E2%80%9D-and-ai-use.1270311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embracer is, well, embracing more AI use moving forward as part of the company’s future. </p>



<p>In statements made during it’s latest earnings report, CEO Phil Rogers called AI an “increasingly supportive force”. He said that AI use, “smarter collaboration” and “increased streamlining” will “be key to unlocking value and expanding margins.”</p>



<p><strong>“Our ambition is simple and focused: lead with distinctive IP; deliver with clarity and discipline; and realize our full potential,”</strong> he said. <strong>“The choices we make now will determine not just what we achieve, but who we become.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding streamlining, Embracer, as it moves forward to becoming Fellowship Entertainment, <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q1-april-june-2025-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-75-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">says that its focus will remain</a> on <strong>“continuous improvement as well as targeted cost initiatives.”</strong></p>



<p>These initiatives will target underperforming businesses that will allow them to <strong>“free up capital to deploy with better returns.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“These initiatives could potentially include divestments,”</strong> Rogers said without mentioning if it also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-let-go-nearly-2000-employees-in-the-last-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">means more layoffs</a> could come.</p>



<p>Right now, Rogers said, the company is facing what he calls a <strong>“pivotal moment”</strong> where Embracer needs to “sharpen [its] focus”. He said that the company will “double down” on what he believes is its greatest strength: <strong>“empowering talented teams to deliver unforgettable experiences based on globally loved IP.”</strong></p>



<p>Those IP include franchises like The Lord of the Rings,&nbsp;Tomb Raider,&nbsp;Kingdom Come Deliverance,&nbsp;Metro, and Dead Island, to name a few. Rogers says that the company is “laying the groundwork” for a better development environment for its titles that he believes is <strong>“one of the most exciting IP portfolios in the industry.”</strong></p>



<p>Embracer has nine AAA games in development and set for release without counting any projects financed by partners. A couple of those games, however, might slip into fiscal year 2028/29.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for Embracer/Fellowship Entertainment, especially when it comes to AI use and these “targeted cost initiatives”? Let us know in the comments down below.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-rad-eus-trqstme-says-marvel-rivals-regular-patches-make-esports-insanely-difficult/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-rad-eu%E2%80%99s-trqstme-says-marvel-rivals%E2%80%99-regular-patches-make-esports-%E2%80%98insanely-difficult%E2%80%99.1270239/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rad EU star TrqstMe believes it’s “insanely difficult” for Esports teams to compete in Marvel Rivals due to the regularity of patches, but hard work paid off after success in the Ignite Mid-Season Finals in Guangzhou.</p>



<p>The EMEA fought back against the odds in the Grand Final to overcome Envy, a team that had already defeated them twice at the event, to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ignite-mid-season-finals-complete-scores-standings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secure a 4-2 triumph</a>, a grand prize of $160k, and a place in history.</p>



<p>Rad EU’s victory was made even more impressive by the team’s uncertain future, with requests for the entire team to be signed by a new organisation <a href="https://x.com/fate_gb/status/1954738412893987073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared the day after their triumph</a>, giving the team even more challenges to overcome. The biggest of them all, according to TrqstMe, is Rivals’ regular patch schedule.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-is-unapproachable-for-new-players">Marvel Rivals is ‘Unapproachable’ For New Players</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Champions. Image via Marvel Rivals/Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking to Insider Gaming after the final, TrqstMe described dealing with the regular patches, which now see a new hero releasing every four weeks, as “insanely difficult” and “a full-time job.”</p>



<p>Not only does each major patch bring a new hero, who teams must quickly test out to see how they fit into the meta, but it also brings a range of buffs and nerfs to existing heroes. All this, along with the complexity of the banning system at high ranks, makes it difficult for new players to join the game.</p>



<p>“It’s unapproachable for a newcomer because a lot is going on, especially with the bans and stuff. There needs to be someone who explains it. In the future, more people will be there to analyse and explain it to the casual audience.”</p>



<p>Despite the complexities of the game, TrqstMe is adamant that Marvel Rivals is here to stay and declared that “everyone who hasn’t tried it needs to.”</p>



<p>For TrqstMe and his teammates, the future of the team may be somewhat up in the air ahead of the EMEA Ignite Stage 2 later this year, where the team will battle for a spot in the Grand Finals that offers a whopping $1m prize pool, but it’s clear he will be pivotal to any future success.</p>



<p>“All the effort I spent over the year paid off. I think I was one of the hardest-working players in the world. We did everything for the team, outside of the game and inside, I was leading the team a lot. I’m very happy it contributed to my success.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is rapidly approaching and the full list of Achievements and Trophies to earn in the title can now be shared.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Releasing August 28</a>, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a remake of the original 2004 title, and there’s plenty to dig your teeth into while you wait for the release of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-fox-hunt-mode-wont-be-available-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox Hunt mode in Fall 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Whether you’re new to the Metal Gear franchise or have already achieved Platinum on the original game, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is certainly not short on tasks to tick off if you’re a completionist. In fact, there’s enough to keep you busy for hours on end, as we’ve detailed here.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Dig in. Image via Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has 45 Trophies and Achievements</strong> <strong>to earn, with the customary additional Platinum Trophy on PlayStation</strong>.</p>



<p>Earning all the available Trophies and Achievements will require regular playthroughs and completing specific challenges, some of which will be significantly harder than others. Some are also amusing, like throwing a poisonous animal at an enemy, which seems a bit mean.</p>



<p>A full breakdown of all the Achievements and Trophies in <a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/eu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is shown in the table below.

<p><strong>There are several changes to the Achievements &amp; Trophy list, including the removal of some previous Trophies and the addition of new ones.</strong></p>



<p>Objectives to CQC slit an enemy’s throat and poison a guard have been removed, though the biggest changes come in the addition of 13 new Trophies and Achievements.</p>



<p>These include Gastronome, awarded for achieving 100% in your Food Collection, which was previously split into different Trophies and Achievements for various levels of progress. The same approach has been made with the A Snake Has Many Skins trophy, awarded for obtaining every camouflage uniform and face paint.</p>



<p>Minor adjustments include tweaking the name and description of some of the Achievements and Trophies, while on PlayStation, the rarity of some Trophies has been adjusted.</p>
