            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony has confirmed that Bungie’s Marathon will still release by the end of its current fiscal year, which ends on March 31, 2026.</p>



<p>The news came following Sony’s latest earnings report during its Q&amp;A section, where one investor asked for an update on the game and its management, as well as if the game could be canceled entirely.</p>



<p>Sony’s Chief Financial Officer, Lin Tao, responded to say that Bungie’s Marathon is still slated to release this current financial year. The statement comes just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-marathon-fy25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two months after a previous statement</a> saying the same thing.</p>



<p>“We are now fixing the problems. So we believe this launch will happen. And if this launch is canceled, we need to do a revision of the valuation. However, as of now, this is not expected,” Tao said.</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon was delayed following a lukewarm reception to its reveal and playtests, with additional issues stemming from a huge <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/artist-accuses-bungie-of-plagiarizing-work-for-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagiarism accusation from a concept artist</a>, to which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie responded</a>.</p>



<p>On its delay, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-delayed-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie said</a> that the community’s messages have been “strong and clear”.</p>



<p>“The Alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling—survival under pressure, mystery and lore around every corner, raid-like endgame challenges, and Bungie’s genre-defining FPS combat,” the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post reads</a>. “We’re using this time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like&nbsp;Marathon&nbsp;is built around. This means deepening the relationship between the developers and the game’s most important voices: our players.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s unlikely that Marathon will do well if it releases this fiscal year, or to be honest, ever. Nonetheless, Bungie seems determined to get the game out of the door and in at least some kind of playable and engaging fashion.</p>



<p>Do you think Marathon will succeed if released by March 2026? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sony-sales-figures-reveal-growth-80-million-ps5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony%E2%80%99s-sales-figures-reveal-growth-as-80-million-ps5s-are-sold.1264104/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony Group has published a financial update for Q1 FY25, the period ending June 30, 2025. In the report, the company reported substantial growth in the PlayStation space, with digital sales, customer retention, monthly active users, and hardware sales showing strong trends.</p>



<p>It was noted that, thanks to 2.5 million PS5 units being sold in the financial quarter, the total count has now exceeded <strong>80 million units </strong>so far in the PlayStation 5’s lifecycle, which commenced in 2020.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-strong-momentum">‘Strong Momentum’</h2>



<p>The report filed <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_sonypre.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Sony Group</a> tells a positive story for the tech titan, especially where the PlayStation arm of the corporation is concerned. In a line pulled from the report, it was revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>User engagement continued its<strong> strong momentum</strong>, with Monthly Active Users in June and total gameplay hours across PlayStation during Q1 FY25 both increasing 6% year-on-year.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This has been enough for Sony to ‘upwardly revise’ its operating income forecast.</p>



<p>It was remarked that a strong window for new titles helped fuel the performance of the PlayStation platform in Q1 FY25. In the period, 72 million games were sold across PlayStation’s ecosystem, 83% of which were purchased digitally.</p>



<p>The only core negative to take away from the report referenced an incoming impact from ‘a delay in the launch timing of a first-party title’, which wasn’t named but is assumed to be Bungie’s Marathon, the plagued extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Player counts were also up over the last period, with 123 million active users logging in during Q1 FY25, up 8 million from the number recorded in the previous period. Again, the slate of games launched in the window (Oblivion Remastered, Clair Obscur, Death Stranding 2, Forza Horizon 5) contributed to that greatly.</p>



<p>Recently, the PlayStation brand was in the news when Sony Group’s CEO stressed that the future of the platform, with the PlayStation 6 at the heart of it, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-is-top-of-sonys-priorities-right-now-says-sony-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company’s top priority</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/complete-madden-26-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies/</link>

<p>For all of the completionists out there, here is everything you need to know about getting every trophy and achievement in Madden 26.</p>



<p>Earning achievements and trophies in sports games is much different than single-player narrative titles. Usually, they spoil story elements or give away secret easter eggs. But with&nbsp;Madden 26, for example, all you need to do is progress in different game modes and pull off miraculous performances on the field.</p>



<p>So without any further ado, let’s jump right into what you should expect.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-every-madden-26-achievement-amp-trophy">How to Get Every Madden 26 Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Playing as Josh Allen will make achievements easier. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although there aren’t many trophies in Madden 26, it will still be a challenge for players looking to complete 100% of the game. Regardless of what game mode you prefer, getting every achievement and trophy requires you to master every phase of the game.</p>



<p>With that in mind, here is everything you need to know about earning every achievement and trophy—credit to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/game/Madden-NFL-26/trophies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TrueTrophies</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-secret-trophies">All Secret Trophies </h2>



<p>There is only one secret achievement in Madden 26, and it is earned by forcing a fumble using the strip ball mechanic. </p>



<p>To use the strip button defense, it is R1 on PlayStation and RB on Xbox. For the best results, you should use this button when you are near the ball carrier and have an opportunity to knock the ball out of their hands. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-amp-trophies-in-madden-26">How Many Achievements &amp; Trophies in Madden 26?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 28 regular trophies and achievements in Madden 26 and one secret achievement. </strong></p>



<p>Most of the achievements should be easy to complete because there aren’t any restrictions on what difficulty you have to earn the trophy on, meaning you can adjust the settings to the easiest options and breeze through some of the challenges, such as finishing a game with at least 300 yards passing and no interceptions.</p>



<p>That being said, reaching max level with every Superstar position will take time and dedication. Additionally, it will be challenging to break the single-season passing and rushing records, regardless of how good you are at Madden. </p>
