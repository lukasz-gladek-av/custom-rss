<p>A possible trademark registration from Remedy may hint at a new Control project. Furthermore, its timing is coincidentally near <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>, set to go live on December 11th.</p>



<p>The Control series is a fairly new series, starting in 2019. The first sci-fi mind-bending title follows new Director, Jesse Faden, as she travels the mysterious Oldest House. When it released, Remedy Entertainment and the game were praised immensely, receiving multiple year-end awards and nominations. While not a direct sequel, the multiplayer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-still-underperforming-remedy-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC: Firebreak </a>does take place in the Oldest House and ties into Control. The series is connected to the wider world of Remedy, including Alan Wake and it’s sequel’s DLC. However, a new trademark may hint at an even bigger expansion to the universe, if done by Remedy.</p>







<h2 id="h-a-new-control-project-may-be-in-the-works-at-remedy-trademark-hints">A New Control Project May Be In The Works at Remedy, Trademark Hints</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A trademark for CONTROL Resonant was filed by Remedy today ahead of The Game Awards on the EUIPO site.</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the European Union Intellectual Property Office website, the title <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019282647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“CONTROL Resonant”</a> has been filed for trademark. In addition, it’s been done by Nordia Attorneys at Law LTD. Interestingly enough, Remedy Entertainment uses those lawyers, making it seem like this is, indeed, a new Control title.</p>



<p>However, it’s important to note that Remedy has not announced a new title or project for Control, so take it with a grain of salt for the time being. As to what it could be, there are a few different ways. The most obvious is a sequel to the 2019 original, possibly continuing Jesse Faden’s narrative. However, Remedy has stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-partner-annapurna-control-alan-wake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s been exploring film and TV</a>, so maybe Control: Resonant is a TV series.</p>



<p>Of course, the timing is rather convenient, as The Game Awards 2025 are just around the corner on December 11th. Remedy is no stranger to the Geoff Keighley-hosted show, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2023-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a> and Control had huge presences there, both as nominees/winners and reveals. Sam Lake, the face of the studio, is a frequent presenter at the awards and it wouldn’t be surprising if the company decides to reveal Control Resonant, if true. Either way, it’s more Control and fans are sure to enjoy that.</p>







<p>What do you think of the new Control trademark? Think it’s a sequel? TV show? Something else? Leave a comment below or on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>
