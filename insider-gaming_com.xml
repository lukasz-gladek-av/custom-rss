            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-review-embargo-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-is-the-ninja-gaiden-4-review-embargo-date.1327621/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is a big deal for a lot of people. The franchise as a whole is one of the most iconic in the hack ‘n’ slash genre, and Ninja Gaiden is the first mainline game in 13 years—making the review embargo date a huge milestone for players itching to see what Ryu is up to this time.</p>



<p>We still have memories of being destroyed in 2004’s Ninja Gaiden growing up. As a youngster, that game was punishing, but it naturally increases your resolve and helps to reduce the tears experienced in later life via Souls games and other torturous franchises. But Ninja Gaiden’s carried a reputation for years for being ruthlessly difficult.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-trailer-shows-off-disgusting-levels-of-difficulty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4 offers difficulty settings</a>, making it something almost anyone can hop into. Be warned, though, the standard difficulty is relentless, so let’s see if the gameplay, systems, and design make it all worth it.</p>



<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-review-embargo-date-explained">Ninja Gaiden 4 Review Embargo Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s not anger anyone, eh? Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to multiple sources, the Ninja Gaiden 4 review embargo lifts on October 20, and it’s alleged that the embargo time is 4 PM PT.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, various outlets and content creators have indicated that the review embargo date is October 20. If you’re keeping up with Ninja Gaiden 4’s launch, you’ll know why this is so significant—it’s the day before the game’s official release date!</p>



<p>Game Informer has said to expect their review on October 20, and David Jagneaux of GamesBeat has also indicated an October 20 review embargo date. However, specific review time details have been outed by <a href="https://x.com/GoodGameKofi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@GoodGameKofi</a>.</p>



<p>The content creator said: “<strong>I completed Ninja GAIDEN 4 a couple of days ago. Currently cooking a video review dropping October 20th @ 7pm EST. Look out for it.”</strong></p>



<p>Now, it could be the case that video reviews arrive later than written reviews, or this could be the universal review embargo time for written and video content. Take this information with a pinch of salt, just in case. </p>



<p>At the very least, we should expect Ninja Giaden 4 reviews to start flooding in on October 20.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-review-scores-prediction">Ninja Gaiden 4 Review Scores Prediction</h2>



<p><strong>We think a low-80s score is probably likely for Ninja Gaiden 4, based on previous NG titles and how it’s been received so far.</strong></p>



<p>There feels like a million Ninja Gaiden games, from remakes to spin-offs. Let’s dissect recent Ninja Gaiden games via their Metacritic scores to see where we might stand.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 3 was a disaster, scoring 58/100. Older Ninja Gaiden games were in the low-to-mid 90s, whereas recent entries like Ninja Gaiden 2 Black and Ragebound have comfortably been in the 80s. This is the first new mainline game in over a decade, and its reception at Gamescom has been positive. There have been some doubters and dissension, too, so we think an <strong>82 or an 83</strong> is a likely final score.</p>



<p>Hopefully, Ninja Gaiden 4 does <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-dead-or-alive-ninja-gaiden-director-tomonobu-itagaki-has-passed-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former Team Ninja leader Tomonobu Itagaki</a> proud.</p>

Tell us what you’ve made of its gameplay so far through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals has a brand new surprise for the players, arriving in the form of the first-ever PvE Zombies mode on October 23, 2025.</p>



<p>Season 5 of Marvel Rivals is scheduled to arrive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on November 14</a>, bringing Gambit and Rogue into the mix. Ahead of that, the developers have one last new update for players in season 4.5, bringing some PvE fun into the mix. The upcoming game mode is inspired by the animated series Marvel Zombies. </p>



<h2 id="h-slay-zombies-in-marvel-rivals-from-october-23">Slay Zombies in Marvel Rivals From October 23</h2>



<p>Through a new post on the official Marvel Rivals <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1979053687340408847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the executive producer at Marvel Games, Danny Koo, spoke more about the upcoming PvE Zombies mode. The new Marvel Zombies-inspired mode lets players embody one of 5 playable characters —Thor, Blade, Magik, Jeff, or The Punisher —as they face off against endless hordes of zombies. Surviving is the goal until you can test your might against the two bosses, Zombie Namor and Queen of the Dead. </p>



<p>To take on this new threat, the developers have also granted each of the five heroes new abilities. Jeff can charge through the hordes, Blade can slice and dice through the bouncing Moon Blades, Thor gets a persistent Awakened State to shock more zombies, and Magik is getting an unlimited Darkchild form. The post also included a sneak peek of the Marvel Rivals PvE Zombies mode gameplay, featuring the 5-hero squad being ambushed by zombies from every angle, but still holding their ground. </p>

<p>Battlefield 6 is receiving a new update within the next week, which will address progression pace and XP Leveling. </p>



<p>The launch of Battlefield 6 has shaken the gaming industry, with the new title rivalling the likes of Call of Duty launches. The game sold 7 million copies in the first 3 days, making it the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest launch in series history</a>. However, there have been some minor issues at launch, such as progression and XP leveling, and fortunately, the developers are already addressing them in the next update. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-devs-acknowledge-progression-pace-issues">Battlefield 6 Devs Acknowledge Progression Pace Issues </h2>



<p>In a lengthy new post on the BattlefieldComms account on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979107918185157116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the developers acknowledged the progression issues in Battlefield 6 and revealed how they will be addressing them. The developers understand that it’s taking way longer to unlock hardware, such as gadgets and weapon adjustments, and are making changes accordingly. </p>



<ul>
<li>Match completely and daily bonuses, XP has been increased by 10% and 40% respectively.</li>



<li>The XP a players need to unlock the first 20 attachment ranks has been reduced, with useful attachments arriving twice as fast.</li>



<li>Players should note that the UI for weapons that are already being progressed might show something “abnormal at first”, but will be resolved once players use that weapon in a match. </li>



<li>The assignments that required career ranks 20, 23, and 26 to begin will now require career ranks 10, 15, and 20, respectively.</li>



<li>The developers are aware of the “frustrations regarding the challenges themselves and are actively working on reviewing them.” However, this change will take longer to develop, test, and implement. </li>
</ul>



<p>The goal of Battlefield 6’s progression changes is to make the experience feel smoother and more rewarding while retaining the sense of achievement of fully mastering a weapon. The new update will go live within the next week or sooner, depending on testing and verification. The developers are also aware of concerns about visibility, weapon bloom, vehicles not spawning, and more, and will share more details when possible. </p>

<p>Battlefield Studios has announced that it will soon be making changes to the Battlefield 6 Portal to reduce the amount of ‘XP farms’ in the game that have been taking up server capacity.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979107918185157116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> on the official Battlefield Communication channel, it was stated that since the launch of Battlefield 6, the maximum capacity of the Battlefield 6 Portal servers has been consistently reached, which has been attributed to XP farms.</p>



<p>They said, “After reviewing the data, we found that a large number of these servers were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots. We completely understand the motivation behind this, like faster progression and a way to test setups without pressure, but it’s led to some unintended side effects. With so many servers focused on farming XP rather than active play, it’s become noticeably harder for players to create and find experiences to play with other people.”</p>



<p>As such, changes will soon be coming to Battlefield Portal, including changes to “diminish the number of XP farms taking up server space while further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences.”</p>

<p>It’s not entirely clear what the changes will be, but it’s likely to be an adjustment to the rate at which people earn XP in Battlefield Portal, meaning that they will be less likely to be used for XP farmers. </p>



<p>One change, though, could be the change that stats and accolades will no longer count towards your player stats, which has seen players artificially inflate their stats with absurd K/D ratios and more.</p>



<p>Presumably, however, the changes will be intended to incentivize people to transition to the core multiplayer experiences, as there will also be some progression updates to the game in this regard.</p>



<p>So for now, you should probably grind your weapons in Battlefield Portal before the changes coming in the coming days.</p>



<p>What do you think about the leveling system in Battlefield 6 at the moment? Do you think it’s too slow? Let us know over on the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>
