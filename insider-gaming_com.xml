            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-kilo-141-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Warzone Season 3 marks the long-awaited return of the Kilo 141 to cause chaos in Verdansk. Our Loadout will make the iconic AR dominate just as much as it did back in 2021.</p>



<p>Longtime series veterans will feel right at home on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> in Season 3. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CR-56 AMAX</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-hdr-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout/">HDR</a>, Grau, and Kilo 141 are all back, giving players access to the four weapons that initially reigned supreme on the map.</p>



<p>In addition, Verdansk has a fresh coat of paint, as Raven Software improved the beloved map with enhanced visuals, lighting, and new textures. As players return and try to determine which AR is the best in Season 3, the Kilo 141 stands out as a clear contender.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Which Optic you use comes down to personal preference, but the other attachments are a must. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.truegamedata.com/#/weapon_builder/wz3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TrueGameData</a>, The <strong>AK-74 and CR-56 AMAX</strong> have the <strong>two fastest time-to-kill speeds</strong> among long-range meta weapons. In saying that, the Kilo 141 isn’t too far behind, and the AR is easier to control due to its forgiving recoil pattern and steady fire rate.</p>



<p>Although you won’t get the same damage output from the Kilo 141 as with the CR-56 AMAX or AK-74, the reliable AR has a faster fire rate and bullet velocity than other top choices and shines even brighter with this set of attachments. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic: </strong>Willis 3X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Monolithic Suppressor </li>



<li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Reinforced Barrel </li>



<li><strong>UnderBarrel: </strong>Vertical Foregrip </li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Extended Mag II </li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>Be aware that this SMG does have some kick despite the attachments. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>Since the Kilo 141 is better suited for medium and long-range engagements, the best sidekick for this AR is an SMG to support short-range gunfights between 0 and 10 meters. </p>



<p>After having its maximum, medium, and minimum damage ranges buffed in Season 3 and its upper torso damage multiplier, the Kompakt 92 has the fastest time-to-kill of 550 milliseconds up to 13 meters away. A difficult-to-reign-in recoil pattern means using this SMG requires significant skill, but it’s lethal in the right hands. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic: </strong>Volzhskiy Reflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Compensator </li>



<li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Reinforced Barrel </li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>Vertical Foregrip </li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Infiltrator Stockn</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>Scavenger</strong>, <strong>Tracker</strong>, and <strong>Alertness</strong> are the best trio of Perks in Season 3.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1: </strong>Scavenger (Start equipped with maximum reserve ammo for your primary weapon. Resupply ammo equipment and plates from dead enemies)&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2: </strong>Tracker (See enemy footsteps. Bullets you fire briefly outline an enemy for you and your squad)</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3: </strong>Alertness (Sense enemies when enemies are nearby. Tell when you are being aimed at by the enemy)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Since armor plates are so hard to come by, <strong>Scavenger</strong> is a must-use Perk for every loadout because you can get more armor off dead enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, losing enemies while chasing after them on Verdansk is easy, so <strong>Tracker </strong>allows you to see their recent footsteps. Also, hitting an enemy further away increases the time they are outlined. And even though Raven Software added new objects on the map to provide cover in open areas, there is always the danger of getting taken out by a one-shot sniper or an enemy with better positioning than you. <strong>Alertness</strong> alleviates this issue by pinging your screen when someone sees you.</p>







<p><strong>Overkill</strong> is the best Wildcard to use. In Season 3, Raven Software removed the ability to purchase loadout weapons from the Buy Station. As a result, the only way to acquire loadout weapons is through loadout drops. </p>



<p>So, while having three extra attachments on a weapon with the Gunfighter Wildcard would be nice, we recommend using Overkill to give you a second primary weapon because acquiring one will otherwise be difficult. </p>

<p><strong>The Kilo 141 is a reward in Warzone’s return to Verdansk event, meaning all you have to do is log in to the battle royale to unlock the AR instantly.</strong></p>
