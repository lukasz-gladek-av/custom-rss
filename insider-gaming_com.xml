<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 has almost reached its climax, with the semi-finals promising some of the most intense action of the season thus far. The $1.25 million tournament has already delivered some unforgettable clashes, but the best is yet ot come.</p>



<p>The first semi-final fixture will see Team Spirit face Team Vitality, while the second pits FaZe Clan against Natus Vincere. These stellar match-ups are almost impossible to predict, but that’s just what we’re doing below.</p>



<p>If you want to place a bet on the Budapest semi-finals, Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a>&nbsp;to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>

<p>Vitality, led by the legendary ZywOo, remains one of the most consistent forces in Counter-Strike after a stunning season. Team Spirit, surfacing in the opener of the semi-finals, will need to pull off something remarkable to push Vitality out of the tournament, but it’s by no means impossible.</p>



<p>Faze Clan versus Natus Vincere is an interesting fixture. The former team has had a tough run through the tournament thus far, producing a rocky streak that has had many surprised they’ve made it this far. The team recently eliminated MOUZ to get into the semi-finals, and they’re mere steps away from that $500,000 grand prize.</p>



<p>In terms of honest predictions, GG.bet has Vitality in the best spot to win the Major, while Spirit follows close behind. If you’re playing the outright markets, this is a relatively safe route to follow. If you want a bigger return, back FaZe Clan, the outsider at this point in the tournament.</p>



<p>However, my prediction is that we’re looking at a Vitality vs. NAVI grand final, with Vitality taking the trophy this time around.</p>

<p>Friday evening in Budapest has proven to be chaos incarnate, with two favorites falling out of the StarLadder Major. In two fell swoops, MOUZ and FURIA were eliminated from the running by FaZe Clan and NAVI, respectively. These upsets have blown the Major wide open, and the handful of teams remaining will now prepare for a weekend that will end with a trophy being lifted.</p>



<p>Find out how today’s action unfolded below.</p>

<p>FURIA arrived in top form, but Natus Vincere managed to stay resilient, dismantling the top-tier pick in a three-map thriller. It was the only series thus far in the playoffs bracket to go beyond a two-map sweep, with FURIA at least doing <strong>something </strong>to try and stay in the running.</p>



<p>The fixture gave way to some stunning moments, such as a scenario that unfolded to allow w0nderful to secure a massive quad-kill accolade.</p>



<p>In the MOUZ vs. FaZe Clan space, a two-point sweep that wasn’t even close was all that was needed to eliminate MOUZ from the tournament. The second map, Inferno, was a whitewash, with FaZe producing a staggering 13-2 scoreline and drowning MOUZ out in a short series.</p>



<p>In the post-match coverage, FaZe Clan’s broky was praised for putting up some big numbers.</p>



<p>The bracket goes forward with two huge matches airing tomorrow:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team Spirit vs. Team Vitality</li>



<li>Natus Vincere vs. FaZe Clan</li>
</ul>
