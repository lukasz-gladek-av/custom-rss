            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has been released and is being enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of gamers worldwide. It’s a gritty, post-apocalyptic extraction shooter with a beautiful aesthetic, rooted in retro-futurism and boasting sumptuous, semi-open-world environments. It also has extensive customization options, including skin bundles and outfits.</p>



<p>That opens the door to potentially introducing some bizarre costumes, but Embark Studios has firmly shut down that suggestion. Following the reluctance of EA DICE to add kooky skins to Battlefield 6, Embark has stressed that ‘Call of Duty’ style skins won’t find their way into ARC Raiders.</p>



<h2 id="h-no-ridiculous-skin-packs-for-arc-raiders">No Ridiculous Skin Packs for ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>Call of Duty faces regular ridicule for the skins and outfit bundles it offers players everywhere. From Nicki Minaj to a literal pigeon, and from Beavis and Butthead to Wubz, Call of Duty has featured some borderline bizarre skins over the years.</p>



<p>One of the leading concerns from fans of Battlefield 6 was that EA DICE (and associated studios) would follow a similar monetization path in the newly released first-person shooter. For now, the team is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-skins-are-being-adjusted-after-community-backlash/">keeping the creativity confined</a> to mostly realistic outfits, but fans are skeptical whether it’ll stay that way forever.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/skins-cosmetics-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent interview</a>, Embark Studios confirmed that ARC Raiders will follow a similar operating model, with the team avoiding the addition of inane skins that don’t match the game’s vibe.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What I believe to be true is that we will maintain the current aesthetic that we have. It will fit within our sensibilities of how these things look and fit within the world and inside the fiction.</p>



<p>I think it was said a little while ago in a meeting that we would never, say, make a Santa Claus outfit, but we may make something that is of our own tone and our own aesthetic that evokes a Santa Claus. That’s not even a statement that we will have a Santa Claus outfit, but I think that’s kind of the line you can draw.</p>



<p>I think because so much of our game is strong around that element, it would be really unfortunate to upset that by injecting, I don’t know, a T-Rex costume running around suddenly – <strong>I don’t think the novelty is worth the trade</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Black Ops 7 will be released in just two weeks, and the stranger skins have already started stacking up for the game. It’s part and parcel of the Call of Duty ecosystem these days, but that doesn’t mean fans aren’t actively complaining about all the silly skins being added to the games.</p>



<p>Hopefully, games like Battlefield 6 and ARC Raiders will steer clear of irrelevant crossovers and celebrity skins.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Halo 2 and 3 Campaign Remakes in Development, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/halo-2-and-3-campaign-remakes-development-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-2-and-3-campaign-remakes-in-development-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1340080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed by a Halo leaker that both Halo 2 and Halo 3 are getting the remake treatment after Halo: Campaign Evolved drops. In a post on social media, ‘leaks_infinite’ claimed that a source informed them that both games are being remade and that they ‘will have sprint’.</p>



<p>It was also noted that the next Halo game to feature multiplayer will be Halo 7, but nothing more was shared on that front, aside from a note that the campaign and multiplayer will launch separately, as they did in Halo Infinite.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-halo-remakes-could-be-coming">More Halo Remakes Could Be Coming</h2>



<p>It was recently revealed by Halo Studios that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> is on the way. The news dropped as the Halo Championship Series came to a close for 2025, marking the end of Halo Infinite’s competitive lifecycle.</p>



<p>The team also revealed that, for the first time, Halo will come to PlayStation, with Campaign Evolved being released on PS5.</p>



<p>In a new post on social media, a Halo leaker has made a fresh claim that both Halo 2 and Halo 3 are being remade, but neither will have multiplayer. It’s a claim that has been met with disappointment by some, as Halo 3’s multiplayer is where many gamers were introduced to the series, being as it was one of the most popular games on Xbox 360.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Halo 2 &amp; Halo 3 are being remade, yes they will have sprint. No multiplayer, only campaign. Full remakes.<br>Multiplayer is going to be Halo 7. <a href="https://t.co/gD8DNKLT3V">pic.twitter.com/gD8DNKLT3V</a></p>— Halo Leaks (@leaks_infinite) <a href="https://twitter.com/leaks_infinite/status/1983941972311339311?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The leaker then threw in a little conjecture, suggesting that Halo Studios will use the performance of Halo: Campaign Evolved to ‘judge whether a Halo 2 and 3 remake would be viable’, which is a fair comment.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that all planned remakes will be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p>



<p>Do you think Halo 2 and Halo 3 should be remade <strong>with </strong>multiplayer? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
