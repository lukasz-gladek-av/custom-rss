<p>Dead Drop’s Workbenches in Sniper Elite Resistance Mission 2 represents a big step up. The hand-holding is gone, and you need to go on a serious expedition to find all the Collectibles if you don’t know where to look.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-workbenches-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-1-behind-enemy-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mission 1’s Workbench Collectible</a> is child’s play compared to the rest of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>. Dead Drop is the first big, open map to explore. It has 19 Collectibles to find—including three Workbenches. Finding these is imperative to give Harry the best chance of surviving the never-ending onslaught of German troops.</p>



<p>I’ve provided a simple and easy-to-use map showing you the locations of every Workbench, but if you need a few extra details with more specifics, we have that too.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-workbench-location-in-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-2-dead-drop">Every Workbench Location in Sniper Elite Resistance Mission 2 Dead Drop</h2>

<p><strong>The little Cog symbol represents a Workbench</strong>—and I’ve circled them for you anyway. Each one is equidistant from the other and they’re spread fairly well around the map. There’s no necessary route to take to find all of <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite</a> Resistance’s Mission 2 Workbench locations, but I’ll provide my experience and how I found them.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-drop-mission-2-workbench-location-1-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Dead Drop Mission 2 Workbench Location 1 in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s just behind this door. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Start Dead Drop and head to the broken stone bridge. Go left, and climb up the vines to get into a broken tower. Climb the tower, kill the guard, and head through the castle doorway. Pick up the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-propaganda-posters-locations-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Propaganda Poster</a> on the stairs to your left if you haven’t already, carry on up, and go into the house. </p>



<p>Charge down both sets of stairs and exit the house left. Head West through the streets—doing your best to avoid becoming a human bullet sponge. <strong>Using the screenshot “Every Workbench Location” screenshot earlier</strong>, you can see the Workbench is found in a big building in the very Southwest quadrant of the level. Reach the building, and the Workbench is up the stairs and behind a locked door—after you pass through a mini-courtyard area.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-drop-mission-2-workbench-location-2-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Dead Drop Mission 2 Workbench Location 2 in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Go up to the courtyard and look left. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s time to head North from this building. Head left past the “<strong>Find Vertigo’s Dead Drop at the Balisca” Main Objective</strong> building. Pass through the gardens and keep running in a straight line—<strong>watch out for the Sniper ahead up high</strong> who can easily spot you. You should eventually reach a small flight of stairs to go down, situated next to a barbed-wire fence and locked door. </p>



<p>Go between the houses and run around to the entrance of <strong>the “Locate Vertigo’s Office” building</strong>. Head up to the main gate and into the courtyard. Immediately on your left is a locked door. Either open it manually or use Bolt Cutters. Inside is the second Workbench.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-drop-mission-2-workbench-location-3-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Dead Drop Mission 2 Workbench Location 3 in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Go through to the other side, and down the stairs. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>I find the easiest way to reach Workbench three is to follow the natural road around the top of the map, sticking to the outside parts of the map and using walls for cover. <strong>Go past the “Find Stolen Resistance Files”</strong> area, and opposite it is a building with open doors.</p>



<p>Go through this doorway and the other open doors round the back. Turn right, and go down the stairs. Go right again, and you should see a locked door. Once more, either pick the lock, or use Bolt Cutters, go inside, and the Workbench is right there!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-patch-8-arrives-early-on-ps5-by-accident.1093575/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-arrives-early-on-ps5-by-accident/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Larian Studios recently informed players that the Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 stress test began on PS5 earlier than intended by accident.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, Larian Studio released a <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1883903199687631144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet</a> confirming that some PS5 users accidentally received early access to Baldur’s Gate 3 patch 8 before the stress test’s intended date. If you see version 01.800.000 or 4.1.1.6583053 on your main menu, you are also one of the users who received the automatic update. Moreover, the unintentional update on your PS5 doesn’t guarantee access to Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 Stress Test when it officially arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Larian <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1883957300123349467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that some regions in Europe and Asia mistakenly received the new patch early “as an update to their live game version in preparation for the Patch 8 stress test.” Players should know that this version of Baldur’s Gate 3 patch 8 is unsupported, and the developers have suggested revert to patch 7. Players will face compatibility issues with save games, mods, and multiplayer if they continue to play Patch 8. If you have already updated Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8, here’s how to return to Patch 7.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-return-to-baldur-s-gate-patch-7-after-unintentional-ps5-update">How to Return to Baldur’s Gate Patch 7 After Unintentional PS5 Update</h2>



<p>To know if your PS5 has received the unintentional Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 updates, head to the Main Menu and read your version number. If it is 01.800.000 or 4.1.1.6583053, you have fallen victim to the unintentional update. However, there is a straightforward way to get rid of the issue. Just uninstall the Baldur’s Gate 3 application from your console and then reinstall it to be reverted to patch 7.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-workbenches-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-1-behind-enemy-lines/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-workbenches-in-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-1-behind-enemy-lines.1093560/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-workbenches-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-1-behind-enemy-lines/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Sniper Elite Resistance’s Behind Enemy Lines is Mission 1 and has the first Workbench in the game. The level lacks the depth and complexity of later maps, but it serves as an adequate introductory mission, and you can still miss the first Workbench if you’re not thorough.</p>



<p>Behind Enemy Lines ticks all the right boxes to start a Campaign: Introduces us to Harry Hawker, has tutorials showing us the ropes of the gameplay, and its fairly linear structure prepares us for the more open levels. Plus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> Mission 1 features the Workbench Collectible.</p>



<p>So let’s get the first mission done as easily as possible and get you on the board.</p>



<h2 id="h-behind-enemy-lines-mission-1-workbench-location-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Behind Enemy Lines Mission 1 Workbench Location in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure>

</figure>



<p><strong>The Behind Enemy Lines Workbench is hidden behind a boarded-up door in Sniper Elite Resistance’s Mission 1.</strong></p>



<p>Using the two screenshots I’ve provided above, you can see how to get to the Workbench. Thankfully, unlike later levels, there’s <strong>only one to find</strong> this time around. However, due to <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite</a>‘s gameplay and openness, you can easily finish the level and miss it.</p>



<p>From the start of the level, you can only follow one linear path to reach the Workbench area. It requires you to go under the bridge, shoot the Dam, and climb up. Once you get to the top, <strong>the Workbench is in the house in front of you</strong>.</p>



<p>Inside, on the left, you find a boarded-up door. There are three ways to deal with boarded-up doorways in Sniper Elite Resistance: </p>



<ul>
<li>Use a found Crowbar.</li>



<li>Dismantle them using your hands.</li>



<li>Shoot the boards.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each solution depends on the situation. Here, a Crowbar is found next to the door, making this the easiest and quietest solution. </p>



<p>Pull the boards off the door, head inside, and the Workbench is here. Walk up to it and interact with it to register the Collectible, putting the Collectible’s location on the map for any subsequent playthroughs of the mission. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-workbenches-do-in-sniper-elite-resistance">What Do Workbenches Do in Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<p><strong>Workbenches are used to acquire new weapons and part upgrades and have been featured in Sniper Elite before.</strong></p>



<p>To unlock new Suppressors, recoil-reducing parts, and much more, you need to find Workbenches and use them. It makes the game easier for you and makes the daunting task of completing missions on Authentic Difficulty more palatable—making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resistance’s Trophies and Achievements list</a> easier as well.</p>



<hr>



<p>This is one of the easier Workbenches to find in Sniper Elite Resistance. Do you plan to find them all? Are you enjoying your Sniper Elite Resistance? Let us know below.</p>

<p>EA could be re-releasing The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 with all their expansions to celebrate its 25 anniversary.</p>



<p>The new claims come courtesy of <a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-1-2-remaster-pc-buy-ea-maxis-steam-1851748658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, who say that a source familiar with EA plans have said that EA plans to re-release The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 on PC.</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/TheSims/status/1883938087446995432
</p></figure>



<p>Its report comes as a flurry of activity has hit the official Sims X (formerly Twitter) account, with the page posting cryptic teases. The latest showed The Sims 2 menu, with the caption “BRB” (be right back).</p>



<p>According to Kotaku, the Celebrate 25 years of The Sims video posted on January 14, which should are “Nostalgia Now” announcement between January 27 to January 31 is the announcement, and release, of The Sims 1 and The Sims 2. So for those excited by the announcement, only have a few days to wait.</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/TheSims/status/1879218365430182064
</p></figure>



<p>Also pointed out by the report is that both games will launch with all of their original expansion packs.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on if EA plans to re-release The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 on consoles at a later date.</p>



<p>Regardless, the news will be a warm-welcome to The Sims players, who have been stuck with The Sims 4 for over a decade. While most players are seemingly happy with the games constant updates, a nostalgia trip is almost certainly welcome too. </p>



<p>As of October 2019, The Sims games have generated over $5 billion in revenue and have sold 200 million units across all of its games. In March 2024, it was announced that a Sims film is in development.</p>



<p>Are you excited to replay both games? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>The creative director of Helldivers 2 and Arrowhead Games has announced that he is taking a sabbatical before starting work on the studio’s next game.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2’s CCO, Johan Pilestedt, recently took to <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1884015181895983223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to announce that he is taking some time off. Pilestedt explained that while players started enjoying Helldivers 2 last year, he has worked on the game since 2016 and the Helldivers franchise since 2013. As he worked for 11 years “around the clock” on the same IP, Pilestedt had to sacrifice time with his family, friends, wife, and himself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, the Helldivers 2 CCO will take some time off to “redeem what was lost” from those who have been supporting him for more than 10 years. Pilestedt has ensured the community that all the developers at Arrowhead Game Studios will be hard at work to deliver amazing Helldivers 2 content to the players while he’s on sabbatical. And once he returns, work “on the next Arrowhead Game” will begin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pilestedt has also posted an <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1884016859676303815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update</a> since beginning his sabbatical, revealing that the first thing he did was start “a game jam with the most senior devs/founders” at Arrowhead Game Studios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Helldivers 2 CEO wants <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-ceo-wants-a-list-to-be-violently-killed-in-the-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A-listers to be violently killed</a> in the upcoming movie, as the director talks about Arrowhead’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-director-talks-about-their-involvement-with-the-upcoming-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">involvement with the adaptation</a>.

<p>Many secrets lurk throughout Sniper Elite Resistance, including Propaganda Posters to track down. Although optional, they serve a great benefit if you find each one in Resistance, and I’ve pinpointed the location of each Poster in the main Campaign.</p>



<p>The sheer scale of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>‘s levels means there’s a lot to do. On top of main objectives and optional side tasks, you can do specific actions related to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophies and Achievements</a> list and also track down the countless Collectibles most levels contain.</p>



<p>One of the most important though—other than Workbenches—are Propaganda Posters. This guide has the location of each Propaganda Poster, where to find them, and what they do in Sniper Elite Resistance.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-propaganda-posters-do-in-sniper-elite-resistance">What Do Propaganda Posters Do in Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fresh gameplay awaits. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Obtaining Propaganda Posters unlocks special Propaganda Challenges in Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>You can see different gameplay options on <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>‘s main menu. You’ve got the Campaign, Invasion, and Multiplayer, and it also mentions Propaganda Challenges. When you start Resistance, the Propaganda Challenge sub-menu looks uninviting and unreceptive.</p>



<p>This is because all seven challenges are locked from the get-go. <strong>You must find a Poster hidden in seven of the nine levels</strong> in the entire <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resistance Mission List</a>. Each one unlocks a brand-new challenge, but they can be serious time sappers to locate. This is where I step in to save your day.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-propaganda-poster-location-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Every Propaganda Poster Location in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<p><strong>I’ve provided my location on each mission’s map below, and this is where the Sniper Elite Resistance Propaganda Poster is.</strong></p>



<p>Each Poster has a <strong>distinct gloss and shine</strong> which makes it obvious it’s the Collectible. Posters are scattered throughout the levels, but only a specific one is needed. If you want to skip the text, head to my player marker on the map screenshot to quickly and easily find the Posters.</p>



<h3 id="h-dead-drop-propaganda-poster-location">Dead Drop Propaganda Poster Location</h3>

</figure>



<p>Start the level, carry on forward, follow the natural path to the castle, and get to the broken stone bridge. Take the wooden bridge to the left of it that takes you to the river, and <strong>break the planks covering the underground doorway</strong>. Head inside, move ahead, and lockpick the door ahead. Climb the ladder, lock pick the door directly in front of you once you get to the top, and the Poster is on the right on some stairs.</p>



<h3 id="h-sonderzuge-sabotage-propaganda-poster-location">Sonderzüge Sabotage Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>

<p>The Poster is on the building right next to the “<strong>Find the missing Resistance Cell” Optional Objective</strong>. Simply, head to this location, and go to my marker on the Map Location screenshot above. You can’t miss the Propaganda Poster.</p>



<h3 id="h-collision-course-propaganda-poster-location">Collision Course Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>

<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Make your way through Collision Course until you reach the train tracks—you can’t miss them. I’m giving you the fastest route to the Poster, <strong>but it is a dangerous one</strong>. If you follow the tracks across the bridge, you <strong>unfortunately come face-on with a tank</strong>. Either take it out or run past it. Follow the tracks around the curved track, and the Poster is on a tunnel’s wall on the right-hand side.</p>



<h3 id="h-devil-s-cauldron-propaganda-poster-location">Devil’s Cauldron Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Devil’s Cauldron Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Another simple Poster to find in Devil’s Cauldron. Go to my map marker indicated above. It’s a relatively easy path to get there, and the Propaganda Poster is on the <strong>side of a church with a big watch tower at the top</strong>—fixed with a zip line.</p>



<h3 id="h-assault-on-fort-rouge-propaganda-poster-location">Assault On Fort Rouge Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Assault On Fort Rouge Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>This is probably the furthest Poster when it comes to travel distance from the start point. Cross the starting bridge, turn left, and go to the area I’ve highlighted. The Assault On Fort Rouge Poster is tucked away in alleys deep in the bottom-left corner of the level.</p>



<h3 id="h-lock-stock-and-barrels-propaganda-poster-location">Lock, Stock And Barrels Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Lock, Stock And Barrels Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>

</figure>



<p>When Harry spawns, go forward, and immediately take the left path taking you <strong>down a hill and toward a wooden bridge crossing water</strong>. You can either go left or right, <strong>it doesn’t matter</strong>, as either one has Germans to get past. I went right, demonstrated my expert-killing skills (raising the alarm in the process), and went through an open wooden gate to the house the Poster is on. Use my reference point, as the <strong>Poster is hidden behind a decent amount of foliage</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-end-of-the-line-propaganda-poster-location">End Of The Line Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>

<p>This Poster gave the most trouble of all, despite the fact all Posters are found near the beginning of the level. I searched everywhere, but it was <strong>sneakily hidden at the top of a ladder!</strong> From the default starting location, head down the ladder on the left taking you to the East side of the level. You should be in the train yard now, and there’s a big, open hangar. Either climb the ladder on the side of the building, or head inside and go up a flight of stairs, and head to the platform that takes you outside. The seventh and final Poster is on the side of the wall.  </p>



<hr>



<p>You should now have all seven Sniper Elite Resistance Propaganda Posters and access to every Propaganda Challenge. Good luck trying to get Gold on every mini-mission, it’s not easy! Let me know how you get on and if you’re chasing all Collectibles.</p>
