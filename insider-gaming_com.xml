<p>Call of Duty: Warzone players are screaming out for the return of their first love—Verdansk. The iconic battle royale map birthed friendships, laughs, and intense victories during a difficult time in the world. Verdansk is coming back to Warzone, and its release period is interesting.</p>



<p>“Verdansk” is a stimulus word for many, with CoD smartly priming this feeling many years ago in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beginners-tips-and-tricks-for-winning-big-in-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a>. Activision had no right to drop a free-to-play battle royale so compelling. Its smart tactical gameplay was outshined by frantic firefights as you desperately sought cover under the shelter of Stadium’s sunlight-blocking presence. </p>



<p>Verdansk was the source of comfort for frustrated players emotionally bettered by the plight of the world in 2020 and beyond. With Warzone not quite what it once was, it’s time for the fictional city to return to Call of Duty.</p>

<p>Yes, to be clear, <strong>Verdansk is returning</strong>, and there are no debates or rumors here. Warzone is officially bringing back Verdansk to console CoD, and I’m not talking about Warzone Mobile.</p>



<p>The handheld spin-off marked the first appearance of Verdansk since it was removed. However, Verdansk deserves a bigger stage, and it’s getting one.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-warzone-s-verdansk-release-date">Do we Know Warzone’s Verdansk Release Date?</h2>



<p>There isn’t a precise date, but <strong>Verdansk returns to Warzone sometime in 2025</strong>—we know this is the case as it was confirmed at 2024’s COD NEXT event.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1828873802551271432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1828873802551271432%7Ctwgr%5E78cbc24b0e3ac71fc9db6351227985dd8fa46544%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Fverdansk-return-warzone-2025%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD’s official X account</a> echoed the news with a message sure to get the blood pumping, “Run it back. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-warzone-2025/">Verdansk will return to Call of Duty Warzone in 2025</a>.”</p>



<p>Before you ask, there aren’t any leaks or general indicators as to when in 2025. It could be midway through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> lifecycle, or Activision can choose to wait until the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty 2025</a> for a joint integration.</p>



<p>We’ll update this when we have an exact release date for Verdansk’s reintroduction.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-was-verdansk-removed-from-warzone">When Was Verdansk Removed From Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>Verdansk was removed in December 2021</strong> when it was replaced with the tropical Caldera map for the launch of Call of Duty: Vanguard and Warzone Caldera.</p>



<p>The original Verdansk changed from its debut, from opening up Bunkers to The Destruction of Vedansk—eventually leading to things starting anew with Verdansk ’84. I’m sure we all have our first and last experiences of the legendary map (mine being a win!) and 2025 is ready to hit you in the nostalgia and create new memories and matches.</p>



<hr>



<p>On a scale of 1-10, how excited are you to see Verdansk return? Are you excited to drop into Dam, Train Station, and Superstore? Or will the novelty wear off quicker than a 1v1 in the OG Gulag?

<p>A new rumor has circulated online that the next-gen Xbox called ‘Xbox Prime’ is targeting a 2026 release date.</p>



<p>The news comes from X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1876099668482085289?s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope</a>, who has a history of posting primarily Call of Duty leaks. According to Hope, he says that he’s heard the next Xbox console “is still coming in 2026 and will be called Xbox Prime.”</p>



<p>He continues to say that it’s unclear if the console’s name is the codename or not and that Infinity Ward’s next Call of Duty title, presumably Modern Warfare 4, will be a Day 1 release.</p>



<p>Hope later continues that the Xbox next-gen release is “pretty much an open secret within the industry.”</p>



<p>If the rumor proves to be true, it could suggest that we could be hearing about the next generation Xbox sooner rather than later, possibly by the end of the year.</p>



<p>As for whether the rumor is true, Hope has had a history of posting Call of Duty leaks and is known to have sources within Activision and Call of Duty development teams, and with the company now owned by Microsoft, it’s entirely plausible that he’s been given the information from a developer working on a next-gen version of Call of Duty 2026. </p>



<p>As Hope points out, hopefully, the rumor leads to others with knowledge of the console speaking out to other leakers or journalists to confirm or deny the rumors.</p>



<p>As of September 2024, the Xbox Series S|X has sold 29.64 million units, half of that of the PlayStation 5’s 60 million.</p>



<p>What do you think of a next-generation Xbox console releasing in 2026? Do you think the next-gen Xbox is called Xbox Prime? Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 release date flings itself onto PC bringing New York’s web-swinging protectors to a new format. The PS5 launch was a summer blockbuster in its own right, but new life is breathing into this sleeping symbiote.</p>



<p>Insomniac Games don’t make bad games. It’s spent 30 years crafting one compelling adventure after another: Spyro, Ratchet &amp; Clank, and Resistance. 2018’s Spider-Man elevated the developer’s status to new heights (literally), Miles Morales kickstarted the PS5 generation off in the right way, and 2024’s Spider-Man 2 is a technical marvel—pun intended.</p>



<p>PlayStation 5 was fortunate enough to get the exclusive launch of the third mainline sequel. However, a Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 PC release date is looking to kick some criminal butt, and it’s a crime for you to not know the launch date of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-million-copy-selling sequel</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 release date on PC is locked in for Jan. 30, 2025</strong>, and it is available to purchase from two different storefronts: Epic Games Store and Steam.</p>



<p>Sony users are accustomed to PS4 and PS5 exclusives releasing under a timed window. The early days saw 2018’s God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn eventually get ported to PC, and now most releases follow suit: God of War Ragnarok, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-release-date-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, and the original Spider-Man, for instance.</p>



<p>Now, it’s the turn of Spider-Man 2 to arrive on PC. 2024’s New York Comic Con fittingly played host to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Release Date announcement</a>. The “Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 Announce Trailer” is a chance to revisit some of the open-world title’s most epic battles and emotional, gut-punching scenes, and is sure to whet the appetite of Spidey fans everywhere.</p>

<p>So far, <strong>Enhanced ray-tracing options</strong> is the headline maker when it comes to Spider-Man 2 on PC.</p>



<p>Through a dedicated Oct. 18, 2024, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/18/marvels-spider-man-2-arrives-on-pc-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spider-Man 2 PlayStation Blog</a>, we learned details on the PC launch. “We are excited to continue this collaboration and bring Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 to PC with a suite of enhanced features, including enhanced ray-tracing options, to take full advantage of a variety of setups and configurations. Stay tuned for more details on features and recommended specs closer to launch.”</p>



<p>Furthermore, Spider-Man 2 on PC gets all the cool features introduced to PS5 after launch: New Game Plus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-spider-man-2-will-receive-8-new-suits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new suits</a>, free cosmetic packs, and more.</p>



<p>PC users are going to get the most complete Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 product possible.
