<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 23, 2026, Quordle is the #1491 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 24</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>

<li>Animal</li>



<li>Work</li>



<li>Nature</li>

<li>Food</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s a whole new week, and hopefully you’re looking forward to what’s coming. What’s coming <strong>today</strong> is a brand-new NYT Connections puzzle, and I’m here to give you the hints and solutions you need. Get your Monday started the right way with today’s NYT Connections hints and answers as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Scroll down to get the information you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-23">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 23)</h2>

<p>WWE 2K26’s new MyFACTION Team Chemistry will be influenced by, and change with, WWE TV feuds, alliances, and faction changes.</p>



<p>Team Chemistry is one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-myfaction-adds-team-chemistry-and-quickswap/" id="178385">new features coming to MyFACTION in WWE 2K26</a>. Team Chemistry scores are influenced by both positive and negative reactions from factions. Scores can also be lowered by specific traits. There are 60 traits across 10 categories, with 30 positive and 30 negative to work with.</p>



<p>While it was presumed that current factions would gel together well in the game, it is now confirmed that as characters change on WWE television, their alliances will change in MYFACTION as well.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-show-never-stops-in-wwe-2k26-myfaction">The Show Never Stops in WWE 2K26 MyFACTION</h2>



<p>In a new interview with Richard Breslin of <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/wwe-2k26-confirms-world-tour-returns-856247-20260220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GAMINGbible</a>, MyFACTION associate designer Brian Mazique explains how storylines on TV can change MyFACTION. When factions break up on current WWE TV, new cards featuring former stablemates will have bad chemistry with one another.</p>



<p>For example, he mentioned Raquel Rodriguez and Liv Morgan. While the Judgment Day stablemates are friendly right now, Morgan eliminated Rodriguez from the WWE Royal Rumble. Should that rift widen, future cards of Morgan and Rodriguez will have bad chemistry. Furthermore, he notes that players can mix and match to find the right chemistry cards to achieve different actions and traits.</p>



<p>“It’s a bit safe using positive chemistry with legendary factions like DX or the nWo, and things can change with current roster talent. But there will be other ways for players to experiment with cards and find the right chemistry combo for them to achieve different actions and traits, especially when creating unique factions,” said Brian.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Windrose has surpassed a major milestone pertaining to Steam wishlists.</p>



<p>Windrose is an upcoming pirate-themed survival, crafting, open-world PvE game. A demo was released during Steam Next Fest on February 17, where the game reached 22,000 concurrent players. Following that public demo, the game has been wishlisted by over 1 million Steam accounts.</p>



<p>The development team commented on the milestone with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3041230/view/498346952550778886?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a message on Steam.</a></p>



<p>“This past week has been a real whirlwind for our team with all the attention the game has been getting. And as the spotlight grows, so do expectations. We’re working hard every day to live up to them,” they wrote. ” Our biggest goal is to ship a great game and let you be the judge. It may take time, but with your support, this journey becomes a lot easier (and a bit more swashbuckling, too).”</p>



<p>The game was announced back in December during the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted Showcase. There’s no set release date or price point for the game at this time. It is currently scheduled to release in 2026.</p>
