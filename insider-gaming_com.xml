<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" id="52204">Electronic Arts </a>has unfortunately announced layoffs for the makers of Skate.</p>



<p>On February 25, 2026, <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Electronic Arts issued a statement </a>announcing that it is reshaping the studio behind Skate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/full-circle/" id="96165">Full Circle</a>. In their statement, they announced that they are changing the team structure and “some roles will be impacted.” The company’s statement does not specify how widespread the restructuring will be or how many roles will be affected.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/skate/" id="352">Skate </a>launched in Early Access in September 2025.</p>



<p>The Full Circle statement, however, states that the decision is not a reflection on those affected and that they will support them through their transition.</p>



<p>“Our work on skate. continues. We look forward to working with you as we move faster, listen more closely, and deliver consistently for all of you. Our commitment to skate., and to the millions of players who believe in it, remains strong.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, several studios have been making similar statements about layoffs and major restructurings lately. Riot Games recently severely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">downsized to restructure the team around 2XKO</a>. Highguard’s development team was also<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Why-Highguard-Failed-Highguard-Layoffs-Explained-guide.jpg" id="176090"> heavily restructured</a> less than a month after the game’s release.</p>



<p>Ubisoft continues to make major changes and is restructuring its teams moving forward. Several game projects were canceled, including the much-anticipated remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Learn more about those canceled projects <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" id="176792">here</a>.</p>







<p>Microsoft Gaming and Xbox are also in the midst of a massive restructuring, following Phil Spencer’s retirement and Sarah Bond’s resignation. However, while there have been major changes to the Xbox executive team, no major in-house studio shakeups are planned.
