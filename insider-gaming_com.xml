<p>Crimson Desert looks fabulous, meaning Crimson Desert character creation tools are a given, a certainty. But you already know it isn’t necessarily the case because you’re here right now, so read on for a full explainer and information on other playable characters.</p>



<p>You only have to look around most outlets in the world to see how much hype and praise there is for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/crimson-desert/" id="888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crimson Desert</a>. It has that <em>something</em> extra that other open-world RPGs are missing. From the outside, it seems to have everything, which is where the topic of character creation tools comes in.</p>











<figure><figcaption>Not much room for tweaking. Credit to Pearl Abyss</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s been confirmed that Crimson Desert does not have any sort of character creation tools or setup at the start of the game, which means you pretty much need to stick to Kliff’s default appearance.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crimson-desert-sequel-black-desert-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crimson Desert Sequel or Prequel Status, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>You won’t be seeing any humorous Crimson Desert creations online on social media. There won’t be Kliffs with giant heads, wonky noses, or hilariously oversized ears. Pearl Abyss has decided to keep the main character’s features intact, and it does mean you won’t spend your first hour of the game in a menu fiddling with sliding bars, buttons, and other customization features.</p>



<p>However, Crimson Desert doesn’t completely remove all creative liberties and freedom. In-depth looks at the game and interviews show that the RPG has Barbers and other world amenities to slightly tweak the appearance of Kliff and even your horse.</p>







<h2 id="h-every-playable-character-in-crimson-desert">Every Playable Character In Crimson Desert</h2>



<p><strong>Crimson Desert has three playable characters throughout your journey: Kliff, Damiane, and Oongka.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kliff </strong>is the starting playable character, and can use all sorts of weapons and skills to inflict damage. He’s the most well-rounded of the three, and probably the one people will gravitate to the most out of familiarity. </p>

</ul>



<p>Another one of the Greymanes is <strong>Damiane</strong>, and she is the agile warrior of the trio—expect ranged combat and strategic repositioning to be her forte.</p>



<p>Finally, <strong>Oongka </strong>is the brute, the powerhouse, the metaphorical bull of the group. You already know how he’s going to play: Big weapons, heavy hits, tank-like movement, and an emphasis on see enemy hurt enemy!</p>



<p>This will be disappointing news to some, but if it’s not the end of the world, then please head to the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a> to let everyone know what you’re hoping for in Crimson Desert.</p>

<p>Crimson Desert is the long-awaited successor to Black Desert Online, and if you played the first one, it’s only natural that you want to know if Crimson Desert is a sequel, a prequel, or something else entirely.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-desert-online/" id="1332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Desert Online</a> was an immediate hit, selling several hundred thousand copies. Now, in 2026, millions of players have registered, and the MMO has grossed billions. There’s a lot of love for Black Desert Online, which is why its direct connections to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/crimson-desert/" id="888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crimson Desert</a> are fascinating for both old and new players.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-crimson-desert-a-prequel-to-black-desert-online">Is Crimson Desert A Prequel To Black Desert Online?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New world. Credit to Pearl Abyss</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, despite being initially conceived as a prequel to Black Desert Online, Crimson Desert has dropped any notion of this idea.</strong></p>



<p>There’s your first big question about this story answered: Crimson Desert is not a prequel. Pearl Abyss has mentioned in interviews that the goal was to have Crimson Desert be another MMO, serving as a precursor to Black Desert Online.</p>

</ul>



<p>Abyss’ vision and scope for the project quickly expanded, which is why Crimson Desert is not a prequel.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-crimson-desert-a-sequel-to-black-desert-online">Is Crimson Desert A Sequel To Black Desert Online?</h2>



<p><strong>Crimson Desert is also not a direct sequel to Black Desert Online, and it’s closer to a spiritual successor than having any direct ties to the original game.</strong></p>



<p>There are many key differences between Crimson Desert and Black Desert Online—including its single-player and multiplayer focus—but the world itself is another big one.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>Crimson Desert is set in Pywel, whereas Black Desert Online was separated into several key and distinct regions. Aside from the setting being new, there are also new characters and a fresh narrative—underlining that while the game remains grounded in the same universe, this is a whole new game, and isn’t a sequel or prequel!</p>



<p>The main positive about this creative decision is that if you haven’t played Black Desert Online, you won’t need to play catch-up and can jump right in.</p>



<p>But if you have played Black Desert Online at any point, share your thoughts on the game and what you’re hoping for in Crimson Desert. You can do so via the usual place: The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re worried about delays or anything similar, you should be reassured by the news that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crimson-desert-goes-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crimson Desert went Gold two months before release</a>.</p>
