<p>A Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 player has figured out that Tactical Sprint Assist can cause a significant delay while aiming, and changing this setting can make the gameplay much faster for players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Lightsfire_/status/1849520566715228207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lightsfire</a> on X (via <a href="https://www.vg247.com/this-one-setting-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-messing-up-players-aim-and-the-community-is-rushing-to-change-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VG247</a>), enabling Tactical Sprint Assist on Black Ops 6 increases the time it takes for players to pull up their ADS. His video includes gameplay comparisons of when Sprint Assist is toggled as ‘Tactical Sprint Assist’ or set as ‘On’. You can see a visible delay when using the former, while just setting Sprint Assist as ‘On’ makes players pull up their guns much faster.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>*BLACK OPS 6 IMPORTANT SETTINGS* </p><p>Tactical sprint assist is causing a massive delay when aiming down sights this is what you should change it to</p><p>Retweet to help someone out! <a href="https://t.co/6JP6LYRpPl">pic.twitter.com/6JP6LYRpPl</a></p></div>— Lightsfire (@Lightsfire_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lightsfire_/status/1849520566715228207?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>To change this setting in Black Ops 6, players should open the ‘Settings’ menu and select the ‘Movement’ tab. Here, they will find a ‘Sprint Assist’ option under ‘Intelligent Movement’. They should open it and select ‘On’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If players still want to use Tactical Sprint while having faster ADS, there’s a way to do that, too. Players should head to ‘Movement Advanced Settings’, and under the ‘Movement Behaviours Tab’, they will find an option called ‘Tactical Sprint Activation’. The player should open it and select ‘Single Tap Run’. Now, players can have faster ADS while using Tactical Sprint.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’re after a devastating one-hit Sniper Rifle that delivers a single crushing blow to almost anywhere on the body, the best LW3A1 Black Ops 6 Sniper Rifle class is what you’re after, and we have the best way to maximize its strengths.</p>



<p>The LW3A1 Frostline reminds me of many, classic one-hit Sniper Rifles from CoD games down the years: The M40A3 from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, the Intervention from 2009’s Modern Warfare 2, and the KATT-AMR is a recent favorite of mine. Now, it’s the turn of the LW3A1 in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>—designed to honor the legacy of previous Sniper stalwarts.</p>



<p>When you start Black Ops 6, the LW3A1 is probably going to be your main multiplayer Sniper Rifle for a while, so let’s make the most of it, and turn it into your opponent’s living nightmare.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-lw3a1-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best LW3A1 Attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a beauty. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Stock Pad:</strong> Lightweight Pad</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Extended Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Comb:</strong> Quickdraw Riser</li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Heavy Stock</li>
</ul>



<p>To start the best LW3A1 Sniper Rifle Class in Black Ops 6, I’ve gone for a tasty <strong>Long Barrel</strong> as it gives the LW3A1 a bit more range, allowing the gun a better chance to one-shot from miles away. The <strong>Lightweight Pad</strong> reduces sway, making our stability firmer and aiming tighter, whereas the <strong>Extended Mag I</strong> is a staple of a single-shot class in need of some extra shots in reserve.</p>



<p>The <strong>Quickdraw Riser</strong> Comb drastically decreases ADS speed, allowing us to zap an enemy quicker—which is extremely useful for a big brute such as the LW3A1. Finally, the <strong>Heavy Stoc</strong>k boosts our Flinch Resistance, meaning if we’re lining up a shot and our opponent lands a couple of lucky shots, our aim should be fairly steady, and make it easier to pop their head in the hunt for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-black-ops-6-mastery-camo-in-multiplayer-zombies-warzone-all-camos-listed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Camos</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-lw3a1-frostline">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for LW3A1 Frostline</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Vigilance</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Overkill</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Blast Trap</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>Recon Perks are the direction we’ve gone for with the LW3A1 Sniper Rifle as you want to be covert and have all the intelligence. <strong>Ghost</strong> naturally keeps you obscured as much as possible—protecting your position—<strong>Forward Intel</strong> makes the minimap bigger and gives us a handy look at where our targets are, and <strong>Vigilance </strong>produces a warning indicator if you are spotted—allowing you a split-second to take action.</p>



<p><strong>Overkill </strong>is the ideal Wildcard as we can pair our LW3A1 with something rapid for close quarters such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-tanto-22-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tanto .22</a>. The <strong>Blast Trap</strong> is another piece of explosive insurance to fortify our position, the Stim Shot is a perfect pick-me-up to tank a few hits, and I’ve picked the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> to add another layer of defense.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-lw3a1-frostline">Best Secondary for LW3A1 Frostline</h2>



<p>If for some reason you disagree with our Overkill Wildcard pick, that’s fine, we still like you. But if you decide to do this, go for the <strong>Grekhova</strong> fully automatic Pistol because once you unlock it, you’ll never go back. It becomes available at <strong>Level 13</strong> (unlucky for your enemies!) and should become a mainstay in your loadout.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-lw3a1-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock LW3A1 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Good news, the LW3A1 is unlocked from the beginning of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. It’s the only one of the Sniper Rifles to be available from the get-go, so reach Level 4 to unlock Loadouts, add it to a class, and start accumulating all the attachments I’ve listed in our best setup.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-lw3a1-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the LW3A1 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p><strong>The LW3A1 is most certainly a very good gun</strong> as its one-hit-kill potential means it’s an extremely deadly weapon in even the most <em>average </em>of hands—and I mean this respectfully. If you can get to grips with the LW3A1, learn to keep your distance, and pick your shots, decent Killstreaks are mere fingertips away.</p>



<p>You have to be <strong>Level 25 to unlock the Dragunov</strong> as the next Sniper Rifle anyway, so you have plenty of time to become intimately acquainted with the LW3A1.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-lw3a1-frostline-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the LW3A1 Frostline in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Currently, Black Ops 6 only has three Sniper Rifles—with more likely to arrive as part of seasonal updates. That being said, once you unlock them, the <strong>SVD Dragunov</strong> and <strong>LR 7.62</strong> need to be on your radar if you love engaging at long-range, or desire one-shot one-kill firepower.</p>

<p>Among all the other guns in the SMG category, the Tanto .22 stands out with a slow rate of fire but hard-hitting capabilities in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>. To get the best out of the gun, you must use the ideal attachments, perks, and equipment to support your gameplay.</p>



<ul>

<h2 id="h-best-tanto-22-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best Tanto .22 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Compensator</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Short Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Under Barrel</strong>: Ranger Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: CQB Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Balanced Stock</li>
</ul>



<p>The mentioned attachments will give you the best mobility while using the Tanto .22 in multiplayer lobbies. The <strong>Compensator</strong> will reduce the vertical recoil to improve accuracy while the <strong>Short Barrel</strong> will enhance in-air handling by improving Jumping Aim Down Sight and Jumping Sprint to Fire speeds.</p>



<p><strong>Ranger Foregrip</strong> will greatly improve Horizontal Recoil Control and slightly improve Sprinting Movement Speed. Use the <strong>CQB Grip</strong> to dominate in close-range combat as it significantly boosts Dive To Fire, Slide to Fire, and Sprint to Fire Speeds, making it a perfect attachment to use Omnimovement in the best way possible.</p>



<p>Lastly, use the <strong>Balanced Stock</strong> for maximum mobility as it will improve Aim Walking, Hipfire, and Strafing Movement speeds.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-tanto-22">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for Tanto .22</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Enforcer</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>Use <strong>Dexterity</strong> to reduce weapon motion while jumping, sliding, and diving while taking less fall damage. The <strong>Assassin</strong> perk will mark enemies with kill streaks on the minimap.</p>



<p><strong>Double Time</strong> significantly increases the Tactical Sprint, which is essential when multiple enemies are nearby. These three perks will activate the <strong>Enforcer</strong> specialty which grants a temporary buff to your movement speed and health regeneration rate upon killing enemies.</p>



<p>Coming to the Wildcard, during the initial levels you can use Tactical Expert (it gives you two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/#h-all-equipment-in-black-ops-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tactical equi</a>pment) but once you level up, get the <strong>Perk Greed</strong> to equip an extra Perk.</p>



<p><strong>Semtex</strong> and <strong>Stim Shots</strong> are a must when you’re running the Tanto .22 for quick damage and heal-up. I’d say the Field Upgrade is a personal choice. For me, I find the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> useful as it grants me free kills from time to time.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-tanto-22">Best Secondary for Tanto .22</h2>



<p>The <strong>Stryder .22</strong> is one of the best secondary weapons for the submachine gun. Want to finish off enemies when they are at one HP, use the Stryder to get the job done.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-tanto-22-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock Tanto .22 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Reach <strong>player level 16</strong> to unlock the Tanto .22 SMG in Black Ops 6. This is easy to achieve – all you need to do is play the game. You can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">level up fast</a> by playing some multiplayer matches and fulfilling all the objectives.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-tanto-22-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the Tanto .22 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, despite being an SMG with a slow rate of fire, it’s an excellent choice for close and medium-range combat. You don’t have empty half of its magazine on a single enemy and is easy to control as well.</p>



<p>With the attachments mentioned above, you can achieve great mobility with the Tanto .22, making it hard for the enemies to knock you down.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-tanto-22-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the Tanto .22 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If the slow fire rate bothers you, go with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-jackal-pdw-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jackal PDW</a> SMG. It dominated lobbies during the beta and is equally impressive after the full release of the game.</p>



<p>And if you want to ditch the SMG route and choose hard-hitting Assault Rifles instead, then the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AK-74</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/">XMR</a> are two of the best guns to use.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-game-franchises/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Microsoft is a powerhouse of the gaming industry, and that much is certain. Most of that value has come from lucrative acquisitions that the company has made over the years, such as the snapping up of ZeniMax Media and, more recently, Activision Blizzard King. In a recent financial report, it was stressed that the tech titan now owns 20 franchises that have each exceeded <strong>$1 BILLION </strong>in revenue.</p>



<p>The ‘Annual Report 2024’ that was published by the firm recently outlines just how staggering Microsoft’s gaming portfolio has been – and continues to be. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-over-time">Over Time</h2>



<p>It’s worth stressing that many of the franchises Microsoft is referring to are decades old and have pieced together their lifetime revenue over <strong>many years</strong>. For instance, Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, Gears of War, Diablo, and Halo. Microsoft has little in the way of new IP under that umbrella, and even the gem of the collection – Call of Duty – was acquired after being on the market for more than 20 years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are bringing great games to more people on more devices. With our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, which closed October 2023, we’ve added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem. </p>



<p>We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1 billion in lifetime revenue—from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love—where, when, and how they want.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The financial update gassed up the Xbox Game Pass subscription service to no end, singing the praises of the paid-for platform that boasts ‘over 400 first- and third-party console and PC titles’. It’s not the be-all and end-all, though – the ecosystem’s cloud gaming platform was also spotlighted, even if competition is running rampant.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a dog-eat-dog world, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>This year, Microsoft’s gaming revenue increased by 39% – $6 billion – thanks to growth in Xbox content and services, it was revealed. Microsoft is putting a lot of faith in the recent ABK acquisition to further bolster growth going forward: <em>‘The acquisition will accelerate the growth in our gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud gaming.’</em></p>

<p>Undisputed, the first boxing game to be a smash hit in more than a decade, has just passed one million sales. It entered early access last year but was released in full on October 11, being scooped up and praised by boxing fans worldwide. In a recent interview, one of the founders of the developer, Steel City Interactive, spoke about this milestone and what’s coming next.</p>



<p>Esports has always been on the table for Undisputed, and it’s about time to realise that vision.;</p>

<h2 id="h-new-opportunities">New Opportunities</h2>



<p>The esports industry is dominated by shooters, MOBA games, and the FGC. Typically, sports-based titles aren’t all that popular where esports are concerned, and that’s mostly because the real-world examples of these sports are there and readily available. It’s not possible to watch <strong>real-world shootouts </strong>unfold on a competitive level now, is it?</p>



<p>Despite that, Steel City Interactive is ready and willing to make Undisputed one of the next best esports games.</p>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/undisputed-hit-an-indie-made-boxing-game-featuring-real-fighters-has-just-sold-1m-copies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Ash Habib, one of Steel City’s founders, spoke about the competitive future of Undisputed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Esports was part of the original vision for the game. </p>



<p>I didn’t want the esport element to feel like a bolt-on or something that needed doing separately. With that in mind, we partnered with the WBC, where there will be an esport element where you can actually win a physical WBC belt, given by Mauricio Sulaimán, who is the president himself. So esports is in our plans, and will form a big part of Undisputed.</p>

<p>Recently, we sat down with Ash Habib to learn about the ins and outs of this marvellous new boxing game that has been turning heads for years.</p>

<p>One million sales are just the start for Undisputed. If the game can generate a popular enough esports ecosystem, it’ll be in a league of its own, as there’s nothing else to compete with it at present.</p>
