<p>Palworld developers PocketPair have announced that Palworld will be getting one of its most extensive updates yet in December, with a new island around six times bigger than Sakurajima.</p>



<p>The announcement came earlier today on Palworld’s <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861922963936923656/photo/4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official X account</a>, where the new map was described as “the largest, harshest, and most mysterious new island in Palworld!”</p>



<p>“The size of the new island is about six times more than Sakurajima,” they said.</p>

<p>PocketPair is currently in a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal battle with Nintendo and The Pokemon Company over Palworl</a>d. Nintendo is seeking damages of 10 million yen (around $66,000 USD) for alleged patent infringement.</p>



<p>PocketPair says that they “will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings” on the lawsuit.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the lawsuit hasn’t stopped the company’s ongoing success and drive to keep the game fresh. Earlier this week, the company also announced a Palworld X Terraria collaboration that would happen sometime in 2025.</p>



<p>Palworld sold eight million units in the first six days since its January 19, 2024 release date, and, as of February 2024, announced that the game had sold 15 million copies on Steam and reached a further 10 million players on Xbox. </p>



<p>What do you think of Palworld and its future expansion coming this December? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Xbox has brought back its 14-day PC Game Pass for $1, which gives access to games including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>The deal was removed prior to the release of Black Ops 6 on October 27, 2024, however, the publisher has just brought back the deal for those wanting to try the service.</p>



<p>As pointed out on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass/pc-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">xbox.com</a>, the subscription will automatically renew at $9.99 a month unless the user opts to cancel it manually via their Microsoft account.</p>



<p>Despite arguably being one of the best deals in gaming, some users online have criticised the deal as it means that cheaters will now be able to get access to Black Ops 6 for a much cheaper price. </p>



<p>In recent weeks, Call of Duty’s Richochet anti-cheat has been heavily criticized for not keeping cheaters at bay. Yesterday, one <a href="https://x.com/ItsGamerDoc/status/1860094492956606555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Riot Games’ anti-cheat developer even took to X</a> (formerly Twitter) to point out its serious flaws.</p>



<p>As for if the PC Game Pass deal will cause an increase in cheaters in Call of Duty remains to be seen, but for those uninterested in Call of Duty, the PC Game Pass deal is still exceptional value for money to try out the service and the games that it has to offer.</p>



<p>What do you think of the PC Game Pass deal? Do you think Microsoft should have addressed the Call of Duty Richochet problem before rolling out its PC Game Pass deal again? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
