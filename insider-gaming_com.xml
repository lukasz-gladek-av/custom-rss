<p>Another major union is forming in the video game space as over 450 developers of Blizzard’s Diablo franchise have voted to unionize. </p>



<p>The Communication Workers of America (CWA) has announced that the developers will be a member of one of three available unions—CWA Local 9510 in Irvine, Calif.; CWA Local 1118 in Albany, N.Y.; and CWA Local 6215 in Austin, Texas. The employees joining include developers, artists, engineers, designers and support staffs.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/hundreds-diablo-game-developers-join-communications-workers-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to the CWA,</a> the new union is <strong>“one of the largest wall-to-wall unions at a Microsoft-owned studio.”</strong> It also comes just weeks after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blizzard-story-and-franchise-developers-vote-to-unionize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development teams</a> voted to unionize.</p>



<p><strong>“I grew up playing Diablo, and I feel lucky that I get to work at Blizzard on a game that’s very special to me and the gaming community,”</strong>&nbsp;Diablo software engineer Skye Hoefling said.&nbsp;<strong>“But passion can’t protect us from job instability. Our union allows us to focus on making magical experiences for our players instead of worrying about the unstable job industry.”</strong></p>



<p>Designer Ryan Littleton added that the last round of Microsoft layoffs had him more determined to make sure employees are taken care of.</p>



<p><strong>“[None] of us should have to live with that constant worry that we might be let go at the drop of a hat,”</strong> he said. <strong>“A union allows us to organize across the industry to make great games and protect the developers who create them from the constant pressures of layoffs, passion tax, and crunch.”</strong></p>



<p>CWA says Microsoft has recognized the union’s formation. Since July 2024, CWA says that over 3,500 Microsoft employees have unionized with the group.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts has unveiled an all-new trailer for Battlefield 6, this one focused on the game’s PC ecosystem. It was highlighted that the PC version of Battlefield 6 represents the ‘most advanced PC experience in franchise history’, with a list of attributes longer than my arm. </p>



<p>The recent open beta for Battlefield 6 was a monumental success on PC especially, with Steam player counts skyrocketing to monumental levels. The hopes for the full launch on October 10 are still soaring as wishlist counts grow inexorably.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-6-pc-features-confirmed">All Battlefield 6 PC Features Confirmed</h2>



<p>The kickass new trailer for Battlefield 6 showcases the game’s PC accolades and attributes, including ultrawide support, uncapped frame rates, and 4K visuals. They’re elements that you’d expect from the highly anticipated Battlefield game, but it’s nice to see them rounded up in a specific trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official PC Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nMBBXqu0OLE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Beyond those elements, Battlefield 6 will also have support for DLSS, Intel XeSS, and AMD FSR’s latest versions.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end there, as the team at Electronic Arts also stressed that Battlefield 6 on PC will have <strong>over 600 customization options</strong>. I assume that expanse covers everything from keybinds and color palettes to iconography and audio mechanics. Battlefield has always been a highly customizable game, but the team is going above and beyond this time around.</p>



<p>In the most recent Battlefield 6 news, an analyst came out to declare that this year’s<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-already-beaten-battlefield-6-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Call of Duty title has already ‘beaten’</a> the imminent resurgence of Battlefield. Thanks to what he dubbed ‘autopilot purchasing’, there’s no way that Battlefield 6 will overcome Call of Duty this year.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/techland-explains-kyle-crane-thirst-dying-light/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/techland-explains-why-kyle-crane-is-a-thirst-trap-in-dying-light-the-beast.1283178/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re mere weeks away from the (delayed) release of Dying Light: The Beast. This long-awaited game has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-techland-dying-light-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dubbed ‘Dying Light 3’</a> by many, including Techland’s franchise director. It’s an almighty iteration of the ten-year-old zombie apocalypse series that welcomes back Kyle Crane, who hasn’t been seen since the first game debuted in 2015.</p>



<p>Recently, Techland published a blog post diving into the evolution of Kyle Crane between Dying Light (2015) and Dying Light: The Beast. Time hasn’t been kind to Crane, and he’s been brought back to the players in a twisted,<strong> </strong>animalistic state – but he’s also a hunk and a complete thirst trap.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<h2 id="h-crane-is-no-old-man">Crane Is No Old Man</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dev-blog-they-tried-to-break-him" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post published</a> on the Pilgrim Outpost, Techland explained that they didn’t want Kyle Crane to resemble an old man in Dying Light: The Beast:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We experimented with different approaches, and quickly discovered that details like graying hair or baldness are not an option as they made him feel like someone else or not as heroic as we envisioned him.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While that’s a kick in the gut for any graying or balding folks out there, it’s indicative of the desire to keep Kyle Crane young-ish and virile. That’s easily represented in the recent screenshots posted by the team, which could have been pulled straight out of a pin-up calendar featuring our man Kyle Crane:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>According to Techland’s artistic experts, designing the new Kyle Crane was all about reflecting the decade-plus of abuse he’s suffered at the hands of his captors:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>His model went through multiple refreshes, until we reached a look that felt authentic.&nbsp; The goal was to show, in his face and body, what over a decade of imprisonment and torture did to him. His body carries scars and marks left by experiments. We didn’t just design random wounds – we thought carefully about what kinds of experiments he might have been subjected to, and what kind of traces they would leave behind.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Everything from the hue of Crane’s eyes to the veins on his arms has been painstakingly crafted to reflect the new era of this legendary character, played perfectly in The Beast <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Roger Craig Smith</a>. The character model features a ‘duality’ that shows players there’s still something human inside the brute that is Kyle Crane.</p>



<p>Techland revealed that Kyle Crane will evolve as the game unravels, becoming less of a monster as the story unfolds and he finds something of his former self after breaking free from his torturers and exacting revenge.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast will be released worldwide on September 19. Are you picking up a copy? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
