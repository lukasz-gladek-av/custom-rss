            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-could-make-1-billion-before-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been estimated by a gaming research group that Grand Theft Auto 6, the world’s most anticipated game, could secure $1 billion in pre-orders before it hits the market later this year. This monumental figure was expanded by the agency suggesting that GTA 6 could go on to make more than $3 billion in under a year.</p>



<p>It has been predicted that GTA 6 will make around $3.2 billion in 12 months once it launches this year – expectations are currently sitting at an October release date.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>In a report published in the Financial Times, the stability of the games industry was explored. It all began with a deep dive into how much GTA 6 is expected to make when it’s finally released later this year. Per an estimation from DFC Intelligence, GTA 6 could make $1 billion in pre-orders alone. </p>



<p>Ultimately, it has been predicted that GTA 6 will go on to decimate the numbers secured by GTA 5 in 2013.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1413cdb1-aee9-422f-8b78-15aa0bf40dca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Financial Times</a>, Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two (Rockstar Games’ parent company) said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I never claim victory before it occurs. That said, I think Rockstar Games will once again deliver something absolutely phenomenal. Certainly the anticipation is high.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zelnick also contributed to the discussion about the health of the current gaming generation and consumer spending habits:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s way too early to believe that this [console] generation is maturing or has reached its apex.</p>



<p>You’re seeing more consumer demand broadly. And the industry, frankly led by us, has an amazing release schedule coming in 2025 and beyond. A hit coming from one company tends to benefit the entire industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GTA 6 has already broken viewership records on YouTube. From the moment the first trailer was released in December 2023, fans turned feral, scouring every frame for secrets and hints. Today, it’s still one of the most talked-about videos in the world, and that’s aided by the fact that a high-res version of the trailer recently surfaced online.</p>



<p>How do you think GTA 6 will perform in the pre-order stakes? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arrowhead-studios-cco-dei-comments/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arrowhead-studios%E2%80%99-cco-speaks-out-against-forcing-%E2%80%98dei%E2%80%99-into-games.1072617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/arrowhead-studios-cco-dei-comments/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent social media post, Arrowhead Studios’ CCO and the creative director of Helldivers 2, Johan Pilestedt, revealed he’s working on the high concept for the studio’s next game. Under the post, he engaged in a brief discussion regarding ‘DEI’ and the act of ‘shoehorning’ it into a game <em>just to have it there</em>.</p>



<p>The comments drew a mix of feedback from the community, with some praising Pilestedt’s transparency while others pointed out some potential flaws with what he said.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pure-pursuit-of-amazing-moments">‘Pure Pursuit of Amazing Moments’</h2>



<p>Helldivers 2 turned heads when it was released in February 2024, with the game going on to sell millions of copies with ease. It had a rocky moment when it was review-bombed following a change on PC that required users to have and link a PSN account to play the game, but that wrong was righted quickly enough.</p>



<p>Now, Arrowhead Studios is preparing to piece together something new, and Johan Pilestedt is working on the concept for whatever comes next.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the CCO revealed just that, and in the comments, he engaged with the community. One user made a bold statement: ‘Never add DEI to your games.’</p>



<p>Instead of ignoring the comment, <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1874271801146302738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pilestedt went in with solid responses</a> that kickstarted a wave of comments:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If it doesnt add to the game experience, it detracts. And games should be a pure pursuit of amazing moments.</p>



<p>I don’t like labels. But mankind is united in its extreme xenophobia on Super Earth. #Inclusion so, maybe that’s DEI? I really don’t care. </p>



<p>Make good games, don’t make a contemporary political statement.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some users were quick to point out that Helldivers 2’s ‘entire setting is a political statement’, while others maintained the stance that Helldivers 2 is more satirical and rooted in absurdism than anything else.</p>



<p>What we can take away from Pilestedt’s comments is that adding DEI elements to a game just to ‘tick a box’ is wrong if it doesn’t add value to the game. In that case, it’s <strong>detracting </strong>value and serves no purpose, potentially spoiling the ‘pure pursuit of amazing moments’. </p>



<p>His latter comment suggests that games with these ‘contemporary political statements’ are inherently ‘not good’.</p>



<p>One game that was heavily criticised under topics like this in recent years was The Last of Us Part II. That game featured two lead female characters, one of whom was outwardly gay, and had a relatively major storyline concerning a trans character. These topics were targeted quite severely by review bombers angry at the game being ‘woke’ and forcing these elements on players.</p>



<p>But The Last of Us Part II is one of the most highly awarded games in history, so perhaps you can make a good game that also makes contemporary political or cultural statements.</p>

<p>A recent social media post confirmed that Helldivers 2’s developer, Arrowhead Studios, is fleshing out the concept for its next game. On Twitter, Johan Pilestedt, the creative director behind Helldivers 2, mentioned that he’s ‘working on the high concept’ and invited community speculation about the project.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 was released almost a year ago to an overwhelmingly positive reception. The game went on to sell millions of copies and win awards throughout the year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-arrowhead">What’s Next for Arrowhead?</h2>



<p>Arrowhead Studios is busying itself with whatever comes next after Helldivers 2, with the firm’s CCO drawing up plans for an all-new project.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://x.com/pilestedt/status/1874226763913715938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on social media</a>, Pilestedt wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With 10 minutes to 2025. What are your expectations and desires for what the next Arrowhead game will be? I am working on the high concept, but I would love to hear your speculation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pilestedt went on to engage with the community in the comments under the post, many of whom were eagerly pitching their own ideas to the creative director of one of 2024’s most surprising smash hits.</p>



<p>One user wrote, ‘I would absolutely love to see what Arrowhead could do with a remake of the retro twin-stick shooter “Smash TV”. So much atmosphere in that game!’</p>



<p>By way of a response, Pilestedt revealed that such a game was pitched ‘a long time ago’, sharing an image that contained a blurb for a proposed game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Smash-TV is a top-down reiminaging of the classic arcade game of 1990. The game pits up to four contestants in a violent game show set in the distant future of 1999. The game focuses on the source inspiration for Smash TV to create a game filled with brutal action, death traps, and gladiator-inspired game-shows.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also revealed that Arrowhead pieced together a concept for a first-person, on-rails game akin to Star Fox.</p>

<p>Game Science’s CEO and Founder has confirmed that the Xbox port for Black Myth Wukong didn’t arrive due to optimization issues on the Series S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hrajzb/black_myth_wukongs_game_director_confirms_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, Yocar-Feng ji, CEO and Founder of Game Science, recently took to the Chinese social media app, <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Weibo</a>, to express his views on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2024-steam-awards-winners-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Awards 2024</a>, stating that he felt “a little emotional” after winning three awards. He also elaborated on the Series S optimisation issues, which led to Black Myth Wukong not releasing for Xbox.</p>



<p>Feng-Ji stated that the only thing missing for Black Myth Wukong in 2024 is the Xbox port. The reason for that is “10G of shared memory,” which is “really impossible to get” on the Series S “without several years of optimization experience.”</p>



<p>Black Myth Wukong’s delay on Xbox due to memory issues on the Series S is not surprising, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukongs-xbox-release-is-indefinitely-delayed-due-to-memory-leak-bug-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> about this started emerging earlier last year. A Microsoft representative also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-isnt-delayed-due-to-xbox-platform-limitations-microsoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refuted this claim</a>, stating that the game was not delayed “due to the Xbox platform limitations.” However, the CEO has officially confirmed that the Series S optimization issues were why the game didn’t make it on the platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kanye West, the popular rapper, producer and fashion designer, has stated on social media that The Last of Us 2 is the best game ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kanye West, or Ye, took to his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/ye/3536393017760655041/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram Stories</a> earlier today to express his love for Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us Part 2. Ye stated, “Last of us 2 on Survivor + mode got me spending all day on one board. By faaaaaaarrrr the best game ever made so far. This is not a sponsored post.” The popular rapper posted a small clip of his gaming display along with this caption to his story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kanye’s beloved survivor mode for The Last of Us 2 is called No Return. It was introduced with the remastered release on January 19, 2024. No Return is a single-player rouge-like survival mode in which players decide their path while encountering randomised encounters in known locations in The Last of Us Part 2’s universe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, The Last of Us 2 survivor mode features perma-death, adding more challenge to the experience. Once you die, all weapons, items and upgrades acquired during the previous run are lost. The new mode allows you to play with more characters, each with unique traits and play styles. The playable characters include Ellie, Abby, Dina, Joel, Tommy, Jesse Lev, Yara, Mel, and Manny.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MultiVersus open beta feels like a distant memory and a complete shift from its full release. Warner Bros. and Player First Games had a bonafide winner on their hands; one with a ton of popularity, players, and potential. Fast forward to 2024, and its future is looking bleaker than being knocked off a map at 200% damage. </p>



<p>The prospect of Bugs Bunny and Superman taking on the duplicitous duo of Rick Sanchez and The Joker sounds ridiculous. But this is one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MultiVersus</a>‘ shining qualities—making the ridiculous and impossible seem normal and tangible. Tom &amp; Jerry versus LeBron James, Jake the Dog squaring off with The Iron Giant, and the list goes on.</p>



<p>MultiVersus has an incredibly diverse roster of fighters, and I’d argue it’s as spectacular as any other in the genre. I sank many hours into the open beta, and I closely followed MultiVersus game director—Tony Hyunh—on X to see how he addressed feedback. I felt confident in the full game’s launch, but a string of questionable decisions and design choices have left the live-service title fighting for its life.</p>



<h2 id="h-an-open-beta-to-remember">An Open Beta to Remember</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There can only be one. Credit to Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure>



<p>July 26, 2022, is the day MultiVersus burst onto the scene. It launched its open beta / Early Access period to test the waters. It had a few characters available at launch, a season pass (more on this later), and a handful of modes. There wasn’t much, but it was enough. I can proudly say Bugs Bunny became my main very quickly—before the burrowing bunny became the meta. I had a blast yeeting enemies to the top of the map with Bugs’ bat, and kicking safes to send foes careening to oblivion.</p>



<p>The gameplay was outstanding, but one thing I noticed early on was <strong>how slow progress was</strong>. You needed a <em>lot </em>of Gold to unlock characters, and it felt very intentional. The Battle Pass was extremely grindy too, you could already smell the stink of microtransactions being pushed. Regardless, I enjoyed the MultiVersus beta, but the lack of content couldn’t be ignored as the months wore on. </p>



<p>Incredibly strong player count numbers were dwindling, and by early 2023, it was reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-player-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MultiVersus lost 99% of its players</a>. On Mar. 27, 2023, MultiVersus ended its beta period. This annoyed many players who were now unable to access the characters and cosmetics they had paid for.</p>



<p>Overall, <strong>I’d say the open beta was actually a success</strong>, and it more than adequately showcased MultiVersus’ frantic and focused fighting mechanics. A Super Smash Bros. clone it may be, it was an extremely good one. Myself, and the community waited patiently until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-release-date-announced-for-may-28th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May 28, 2024, for the full launch</a>. Giving Player First Games plenty of time to right the wrongs.</p>



<p>The day came, MultiVersus was back, but it was quickly evident there was only one agenda for Warner Bros.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-launch-to-forget">A Launch to Forget</h2>



<p>MultiVersus’ relaunch was met with scratching criticism toward its predatory microtransactions, lack of content, and the paywall nature of existing content. Apparently, both <strong>developer and publisher learned nothing from the open beta</strong>—ironic, as that’s what it’s for.</p>



<p>Using <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Charts</a> to extrapolate basic data, we can see how quickly support for MultiVersus dissipated. For the fighter’s full release, <strong>114, 515 players</strong> hopped back into MultiVersus to try it out. This doesn’t quite hit its all-time peak of <strong>153,433</strong>, but it was a great starting point. Unfortunately, numbers dropped off faster than the Flash going for a light jog. </p>



<p>Within two weeks, the daily count was already down to about <strong>20,000 players</strong>. By mid-July, MultiVersus could barely scrape together 5,000 players, and if we zoom to December, the figures reached as low as <strong>363 players in a single day</strong>. As of writing, MultiVersus is quite dead, and worse still, <strong>it could soon be literally dead</strong>. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/multiversus-might-be-in-big-trouble-and-that-bums-me-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vice</a> reported that Warner Bros. lost hundreds of millions in 2024—thanks to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and MultiVersus. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-updates-will-end-with-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suicide Squad’s content is wrapping up after one year</a>, and MultiVersus might not be far behind on the chopping block.</p>



<p>Player First Games is attempting to make late changes such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-makes-changes-to-how-players-unlock-fighters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changing how to unlock fighters</a>. This is presumably a desperate act to make MultiVersus more accessible and rely less on microtransactions. Only time will tell if it can bounce back, but one thing’s for sure, MultiVersus squandered its potential because of the allure of microtransactions, and companies need to learn to remember its players are the heartbeat of a game, not exploitable cash cows. </p>



<hr>



<p>Were you a hardened MultiVersus player sucked by the addictiveness of the beta? Are you sad to see what’s become of the once-promising fighter? I am and thought it had a chance of competing with Nintendo’s long-time franchise. Let me know what you’re thinking below.</p>

<p>FaZe Clan’s representatives have taken to social media to reveal a rebrand that includes giving the organisation a new logo for the first time in years. It’s not a <strong>huge </strong>change, but it’s a reworking of one of the most recognisable images in content creation and competitive gaming.</p>



<p>Along with the new logo is a fresh ‘FaZe Camo’, a new stylisation of the name, and a fresh colour palette.</p>

<h2 id="h-new-year-new-faze">New Year, New FaZe</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/FaZeClan/status/1874532461608411160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On social media</a>, the FaZe team posted a series of images uncovering the new organisation’s iconography, including a gaudy ‘distorted’ camouflage that will be applied to everything from company branding to merchandise:</p>

<p>In a short video uploaded by FaZe Banks, the organisation’s CEO, the reasoning behind the overhaul was explained. He showcased a transparent, behind-the-scenes look at group chats established to discuss and plan the rebrand, highlighting why certain creative decisions were made.</p>



<p>To ring in the new year, the organisation, which has been through many tribulations of late, posted a video looking back on the recent history of the brand, stating: ‘New Year, New FaZe. Bigger Than Ever.’</p>

<p>Beyond the rebrand, nothing else has been confirmed for 2025. There are high expectations for the organisation, which has taken some huge leaps forward in the last few months since the control of the company was handed back to the ‘OGs’ that founded it.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has rolled out a sudden update in Escape from Tarkov, patching a few issues in the game. One of the most major changes is a fix for the bug that was causing players to ‘transition’ between maps with enemy players, understandably causing quite a stressful situation upon loading into the next raid.</p>



<p>To answer the issue, BSG temporarily switched off transitions, blocking a few tasks and longer raids from taking place. Now, in a snapshot update, the team has fixed this issue – and a dozen others.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-free-to-move">Free to Move</h2>



<p>The ability to transition in Escape from Tarkov is a relatively new feature. It was added a few months back, and it allows players to jump between maps almost seamlessly, logically continuing their raid and pushing into a new environment to keep up the action. It’s the foundation for many of the game’s newest tasks, too.</p>



<p>When the latest wipe hit Tarkov, transitions went awry, with many players encountering a bug that saw them transition with enemy players. The moment they loaded in, all hell broke loose and they started gunning each other down, prompting Battlestate Games to lock the feature down.</p>



<p>In a recent post <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1874583477141536818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a>, the team at BSG confirmed that the following fix has been applied to Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed all known issues where players transitioning between locations could enter a raid with players outside their group</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, the following adjustments have been made:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player has been teleporting in place without being able to move in any direction on various locations</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where kills from Aklys Defence Velociraptor .300 Blackout did not count towards progress of Punisher. Part 2 quest</li>



<li>Reduced the sales limit for 7.62x51mm BCP FMJ rounds to 100 (120 for owners of The Unheard Edition) per restock</li>



<li>Harris “S-BRM 6-9” bipods moved to Skier LL2</li>



<li>BT10 V8 Atlas Bipods moved to Mechanic LL2</li>



<li>NVG-57E night vision device added to Prapor LL1</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates for barter items in the pockets on Scavs and player Scavs</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates and conditions for armour and armoured rigs on Scavs and player Scavs</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates for ammunition on player Scavs</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates for backpacks on Scavs.</li>
</ul>



<p>The changes have been coming thick and fast since Escape from Tarkov wiped just under a week ago. Many have attributed this cadence to the Unity engine upgrade performed by Battlestate Games alongside the global reset event.</p>
