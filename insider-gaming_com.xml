<p>The last couple of years in the games industry have been rocky, to say the least. From thousands of layoffs to studio closures and from the cancellation of dozens of projects to controversies left, right, and centre, it has been a tumultuous time for gamers and industry workers worldwide.</p>



<p>One organisation that’s thinking positively about the immediate future is G2A, the <strong>world’s largest marketplace for digital gaming products</strong>. Recently, I had the opportunity to catch up again with the company’s CEO and Co-founder, Bartosz Skwarczek, to talk about his optimism for the year ahead.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-gearing-up-for-a-breakthrough">‘Gearing Up For a Breakthrough’</h2>



<p>Following the struggles of the last 24 months or so, I was eager to see what Bartosz thought about the state of play for the games industry in 2025. This could be one of the most lucrative years on record, with some new hardware and <strong>massive </strong>titles set to hit the shelves.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>After the challenges of the past few years, 2025 holds significant growth potential, with innovation driving us forward. <strong>The reset button has been hit</strong>, and the industry is <strong>gearing up for a breakthrough</strong>. I believe we’re about to see a rebound in the gaming industry. </em></p>



<p><em>With exciting new hardware like the Nintendo Switch 2, game releases such as Death Stranding 2, Ghost of Yotei, Monster Hunter Wilds, Last Sentinel, and the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI on the horizon, the gaming sector is on the brink of a major breakthrough.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>One area that’s expected to shine and continue to grow over the next twelve months is <strong>AI in gaming</strong>. It’s no big secret that plenty of developers have integrated AI-driven processes and protocols into their operating models, but Bartosz believes this is only the beginning.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>While there is much anticipation for upcoming game releases, an equally significant development is <strong>the growing integration of AI</strong> in game creation. A recent report from CVL Economics highlights that the gaming industry has embraced generative AI more extensively than other creative sectors, such as television, film, or music.</em></p>



<p><em>This technology offers transformative opportunities, enabling faster asset creation, dynamic content and story generation, and improved financial stability for developers. However, <strong>it also presents challenges</strong>, particularly concerning employees’ roles in the gaming industry, as automation reshapes traditional workflows and raises questions about the future of creative jobs. Balancing innovation with workforce sustainability will be key as the industry evolves.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>I was also keen to get Bartosz’s thoughts about the layoffs that have been commonplace and widespread across the industry over the last couple of years. It feels as though nobody is safe these days, and the impact that these vast waves of redundancies have had on the wider industry has marred the face of the market.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>The layoffs we’ve seen <strong>have left a sense of uncertainty</strong> that won’t fade overnight—and while confidence may take time to rebuild, this reset is creating opportunities to rethink how we develop, play, and connect through games.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The developers behind Balatro have announced that the game has sold an impressive 5 million units to date.</p>



<p>The announcement came from the games X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1881728578712474019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account</a>, where it was said that the game had sold 5 million units. To put that in perspective, at its $15 price tag, the game has generated roughly $75 million in-game sales alone. </p>



<p>Taking to X, the developers behind Balatro, LocalThunk, said, “The last few weeks have been pretty wild. To everyone who picked up Balatro after seeing it at</p>



<p>@thegameawards, we hope you’re having an amazing time with it! If this is your first time picking up an indie title, try to make it a habit!”</p>



<p>LocalThunk announced that the game had sold 3.5 million units before The Game Awards, a 1.5 million increase since it won at the event.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/"><strong>RELATED – Balatro Trophy Guide—All Achievements &amp; Trophies<br></strong></a><br>Balatro has quickly become one of the best Indie games of not only the year, but arguably of all time and has been praised immensely due to its art style and fantastic gameplay loop.</p>



<p>Its success hasn’t been without problems, though. In December 2024, Balatro received an 18+ rating from PEGI because of “links to gambling”. Following the news, LocalThunk took to X to say, “maybe I should add microtransactions/loot boxes/real gambling to lower that rating to 3+ like EA sports FC” – A honestly hilarious dig to the rating board.</p>
