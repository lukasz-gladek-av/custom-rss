<p>Stage Tour is the official name of the rhythm game revival attempt from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/redoctane-games/" id="2851">RedOctane Games</a>. A reveal trailer states that the game will be out later this year.</p>



<p>There was a time when rhythm games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band ruled the industry, and living rooms were shapeshifted into grand stages. Now, RedOctane is ready for you to get the band back together with their upcoming game, and they’re not doing it alone.</p>



<p><a href="https://stagetour.com/blogs/news/redoctane-games-announces-stage-tour" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A press release</a> states that the development studio reached a multi-year agreement with Gibson to bring more authenticity to the stage.</p>



<p>“For a generation of players, rhythm games transformed music from something you listened to into something you lived—inspiring countless people to pick up real instruments and explore their creativity,” says Taylor Berryman, Sr. Manager, Lifestyle &amp; Licensing at Gibson. “Stage Tour is the next evolution of that influence. We’re thrilled to partner with RedOctane to reimagine what rhythm gaming can be and to spark deeper connection, creativity, and a lifelong love of music for generations to come.”</p>



<p>RedOctane has also partnered with Epiphone and Kramer. The studio has already confirmed that a Gibson Kramer guitar controller will be part of the purchasable bundle when the game is released later this year.</p>

<h2 id="h-more-details-on-stage-tour">More Details on Stage Tour</h2>



<p><a href="https://stagetour.com/pages/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">An FAQ </a>on the official website for the video game notes that it will largely focus on Rock and Metal music. However, other genres may show up at a later time. Aspiring and established artists who want to be featured in the game can contact them and use a form to license their music. “Terminator Oscillator” by Static-X was featured in the trailer.</p>



<p>Stage Tour is also giving players the chance to create the band lineup of their dreams. The game can be played with up to four players. Players can mix any lineup of Lead, Groove, Drums, and Vocals. Each role has its own dedicated peripherals, and it’s fully compatible with gamepads and keyboards.</p>







<h2 id="h-redoctane-s-rhythm-game-roots">RedOctane’s Rhythm Game Roots</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/redoctane-games-launches-to-revive-rhythm-game-genre-with-guitar-hero-devs/">News of this project first surfaced in August 2025.</a> Major names tied to past rhythm game franchises are working on this project. Notably, Simon Ebejer, the Production Director on several Guitar Hero titles during his time at Neversoft, is tied to the project. </p>



<p>Also, Charles and Kai Huang, the original founders of the Guitar Hero franchise, have joined RedOctane’s special advisory board.</p>



<p>The game is currently scheduled to come to PC and a wide variety of platforms. No specific platforms have been announced, however. Insider Gaming will continue to monitor everything surrounding the release of the upcoming rhythm game and report any and all updates.</p>

<p>The new beat ’em up game set in the world of He-Man now has a release date. Get ready to battle across Eternia when He-Man &amp; the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction releases on April 28, 2026.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/limited-run-games/" id="3641">Limited Run Games </a>announced the release date in a new gameplay trailer during IGN Fan Fest. The trailer’s description noted that there would be 12 stages in the game. Players can choose between four playable characters: He-Man, She-Ra, Man-At-Arms, and Teela. Also, local co-op mode is advertised.</p>



<p>Check out the full trailer, which feels like it stepped right out of the ’80s, below:</p>

<h2 id="h-beat-em-ups-featuring-nostalgic-ips-are-all-the-rage">Beat ‘Em Ups Featuring Nostalgic IPs Are All the Rage</h2>



<p>He-Man &amp; the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction attempts to capture the gaming style of the late 80s and early 90s through its sprite work and mechanics. However, it is far from the only game resurrecting nostalgic IP with such a video game. Marvel Cosmic Invasion gave new life to Marvel Comics’ heroes with this game style in 2025. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind and G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra all take a similar approach.</p>



<p>Limited Run Games is also responsible for bringing back a lot of classic beat ’em up games. They recently released the Fighting Force Collection, revitalizing that PS1-era classic duology. Also, they recently announced the Marvel MaXimum Collection. </p>



<p>This forthcoming collection of games will allow players to purchase classic titles from the 16-bit era, such as X-Men: The Arcade Game and Spider-Man &amp; Venom: Maximum Carnage. Learn more about the upcoming collection <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-maximum-collection-includes-x-men-arcade-and-more/" id="180260">here</a>.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming will continue to provide any information regarding He-Man &amp; the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction leading up to its release. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/factions-in-marathon-explained-how-to-unlock-new-factions-increase-rank/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The latest entry into extraction shooters is here, as Marathon has broken onto the scene at long last. As fun as it is to loot and shoot your way through Tau Ceti, some direction is always nice, and for that, you’ll need to familiarise yourself with Factions. </p>



<p>There are six of them to work with in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a>, but you’ll only have access to one of them out of the gates. If you’re looking to make some progress, you’ll want to unlock them all as soon as possible, as they each have unique offerings you’ll want to take advantage of.</p>







<p>Here’s how to unlock each of the six Factions in Marathon, as well as how to increase their Rank. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-factions-in-marathon">What Are Factions In Marathon?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One of your contacts. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Factions are essential to your progression whilst playing Marathon, with each one offering you selections of gear to purchase and Contracts to complete in return for a variety of rewards. </strong></p>



<p>As you work your way through Marathon, you’ll quickly realise that Contracts are the biggest source of progression in the game, and there appear to be two varieties of them to complete, which are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Standard Contracts: Repeatable missions you can complete for the given Faction, which vary in difficulty and rewards</li>



<li>Priority Contracts: One-time missions that are essential to the faction. These are tied to progression and help boost your Faction Rank, as well as offering significant story relevance</li>
</ul>



<p>You can only have one Contract active at a time, and you must select which one you’d like to work on before going out on your next run. That means no multitasking—you’ll have to think about the purpose of every run you go out on. </p>

</ul>



<p>Each Faction offers a unique set of Contracts, but frustratingly, you won’t have access to them all out of the gate. You’ll need to unlock them all if you want to truly progress through Marathon, so here’s how you can get that done.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-factions-in-marathon">How To Unlock Factions In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will they unlock? Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>If you want to unlock the other five Factions in Marathon, you’ll need to complete a special type of contract—the Liaison Contract.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll begin to unlock these pretty early into the game; you’ll just need to complete the tutorial and the Welcome To Tau Ceti Contract. </p>







<p>Once they’re finished, you’ll unlock Liaison Contracts. These are unique Contracts that get you in touch with a new Faction, with each one having its own Liaison to complete. You’ll only have to do these once, as a Faction is unlocked permanently upon Contract completion. </p>



<p>That being said, it’s one thing to unlock the Faction, but you’ll want to rank up with them, too. The higher their Rank, the more useful they’ll be to you, so that should be your next priority.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-factions-in-marathon">How To Rank Up Factions In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What it’s all for. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>To rank up Factions in Marathon, you’ll need to complete Contracts for each of the Factions, with different Contracts offering varying amounts of Rep.</strong></p>



<p>Rep is the currency used to rank up Factions, though it’s utilised automatically. It’s important to rank the Factions up, as the higher the rank they are, the better gear you’ll have access to. Also, at certain milestones, you’ll unlock various reward packages, as well as new Standard Contracts. </p>

</ul>



<p>That’s not all, though, as each Faction has its own selection of Upgrades for you to invest in. These vary drastically between Factions, with some offering improved Vault Space, whilst others offer various permanent Stat upgrades for your Runner. You’ll want to look into these thoroughly, as they’re crucial to building your Runner to suit your playstyle, and you’ll need to know which resources to keep an eye out for on your next run.</p>
