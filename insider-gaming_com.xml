<p>A long-time <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> employee has taken to social media to claim that he has been placed on an unpaid disciplinary suspension for comments regarding the recent return-to-office mandates.</p>







<p>Posting on LinkedIn, David Michaud-Cromp, who has worked at Ubisoft for more than 13 years, says the company notified him that he would receive a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension.</p>



<p>According to Michaud-Cromp, the suspension, which is set to start tomorrow, was issued in response to public comments he made about Ubisoft’s return-to-office policy and an “alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.”</p>



<p>Following the announcement of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-forcing-full-return-office-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5-day return-to-office mandate</a>, which Insider Gaming understands has proven to be an extremely unpopular move with employees, David took to LinkedIn to say:</p>



<p>“So… Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office… because they “believe in collaboration”… but c’mon, we’re not completely stupid… we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office…”</p>



<p>Michaud-Cromp alleges that these comments led to the three-day suspension.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment, and should one be received, we will update this article.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[US Congress Members Want FTC To Review EA Sale To Saudi Arabia]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Over three dozen United States (US) lawmakers want the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to dive deeper into the pending sale of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electronic Arts</a> (EA).</p>



<p>In a press release recently shared online, the leaders of the Labor Caucus along with over 40 members of US Congress are asking FTC chair Andrew Ferguson to take another look at the sale. In the letter, the Labor Caucus chairs say they have “serious concerns” regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sale of EA to the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund</a> (PIF). </p>







<p><strong>“We are committed to preserving fair, competitive labor markets and safeguarding American jobs, and given the impact of this acquisition on workers, labor market concentration, and the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. video game industry, we urge you to thoroughly review this transaction,”</strong> <a href="https://laborcaucus.house.gov/media/press-releases/labor-caucus-calls-for-review-of-electronic-arts-acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the letter reads</a>. </p>



<p><strong>“Workers in the video game industry are already navigating an environment marked by instability, shrinking opportunities, and repeated rounds of layoffs. EA is one of the largest employers of video game workers in the United States, and evidence suggests the company already wields significant wage-setting power.”</strong></p>











<h2 id="h-congress-worried-ea-sale-could-lead-to-more-layoffs">Congress Worried EA Sale Could Lead To More Layoffs</h2>



<p>The lawmakers add that with the deal including $20 billion in debt being added to EA after the sale, the new owners would be incentivized to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-employees-publicly-oppose-sale-saudi-arabia-equity-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hold more layoffs</a> in order to recoup money. They also express worry that more offshoring, restructuring, and studio closures could come after the closing of the deal.</p>



<p><strong>“These actions would not only jeopardize thousands of high-skilled American jobs, but also further concentrate already fragile labor<br>markets for software engineers, artists, writers, testers, and other professionals whose skills are essential to the industry,”</strong> they said.</p>



<p>The Labor Caucus chairs say that FTC’s 2023 merger guidelines explicitly state that any mergers that harm workers or allow firms to reduce labor demand “may violate antitrust laws”. Due to the size of the deal—$55 billion—the group feels that extra scrutiny is essential to protecting the rights of American workers that are involved. </p>



<p>They are asking the FTC to <strong>“conduct a thorough investigation into the labor market consequences of this proposed acquisition, including EA’s existing wage-setting power, the likelihood of post-transaction layoffs, the degree of labor-market concentration in relevant geographic and occupational markets, and the role of cross-ownership in shaping labor outcomes.”&nbsp;</strong></p>
