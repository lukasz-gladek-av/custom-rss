<p>Developer Splash Damage has announced that the online co-op game Transformers: Reactivate has been cancelled just over two years after it was first announced. Alongside the game’s cancellation, the studio is also set to lay off an unknown number of developers.</p>



<p>The studio made the announcement in a post on social media on Wednesday while saying they are going to “refocus” on other projects.</p>



<p>“Today, we have some very difficult news to share, the decision has been made to end development of Transformers: Reactivate,” the statement reads. “This means we will be scaling down to refocus our efforts on other projects. Unfortunately, despite every effort, a number of roles across the studio are now potentially at risk of redundancy.”</p>



<p>The statement continues to say that the “decision did not come lightly”, and that it’s a “difficult” time for everyone at the studio. They then went on to thank Hasbro for their support before talking about the short term future.</p>



<p>“While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more,” they said. “We’re now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Splash Damage for clarification on the number of roles that will be impacted by the layoffs. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>



<p>Last year saw <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 15,000 known jobs</a> lost in the games industry. In just the first eight days of 2025, there have been a least four known layoffs, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-suffers-more-layoffs-as-suicide-squad-support-winds-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocksteady</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-gaming-layoffs-of-2025-have-happened/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netmarble F&amp;C</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-down-answered/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cs2-server-status-is-counter-strike-2-down-answered.1077192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-down-answered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With more than a million people playing Counter-Strike 2 on any given day, server status is an important factor to monitor. While it doesn’t happen often, CS2 has been down in the past due to a variety of reasons.</p>



<p>There’s nothing more frustrating (other than a costly missed smoke) than not being able to play CS2 at all. Here’s all the tools you need to be able to check on CS2’s server status and see if it’s down.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-cs2-server-status">How to Check CS2 Server Status</h2>



<p>There are a number of third-party websites that can relay Steam and Counter-Strike 2 server information to you. <a href="https://www.csgodatabase.com/csgo-steam-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CSGO Database</a> appears to be the most complete by our judgment. It provides the status of CS2 services like the API, player inventories and the matchmaking scheduler, as well as the status of all the regional servers. Additionally, CSGO Database provides current metrics for online players, active servers, and the total number of players searching for a match.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: CSGO Database</figcaption></figure>



<p>If there are any issues affecting server availability, <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/counter-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DownDetector</a> might provide some more insight. This website tracks the number of problems reported with CS2’s servers, showing spikes in reports over the past 24 hours and a “live outage” report. There’s also an option to switch to one of dozens of other countries. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-cs2-down">Why is CS2 Down?</h2>



<p>CS2 is subject to regular maintenance like any other persistent online multiplayer game. Problems with Steam servers routinely happen on Tuesdays when servers are taken down for maintenance. CS2 itself will go down for a small amount of time when new updates go live, and many players attempt to sign in right away after these updates, so the number of reported outages will spike.</p>



<p>On rare occasions, a larger issue that needs to be addressed by the developers will force CS2 down for a long time. In that case, Valve will typically post directly to <a href="https://x.com/CounterStrike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@CounterStrike on X</a> informing players of what’s going on.</p>



<p>What’s the longest that Counter-Strike has ever been down for you? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Player Count – How Many People Play Fortnite?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-player-count-confirmed/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-player-count-confirmed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fortnite is nothing short of sensational. It’s the world’s most popular battle royale game, and since 2024, it has become a titanic title of epic proportions, featuring many ‘smaller’ games within its ecosystem. There’s a racing game, a Guitar Hero-style game, and an infinite suite of UGC for players to enjoy.</p>



<p>On the subject of ‘players’, how many people play Fortnite? Is the Fortnite player count as strong as it was a couple of years ago? In this short guide, I’m diving into that very topic and answering the question.</p>



<p>Read on to find out how many people are playing Fortnite.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-player-count-confirmed">Fortnite Player Count Confirmed</h2>



<p><strong>At the time of writing, a whopping 1.81 million people were playing Fortnite</strong>, with a 24-hour peak of 2.45 million users. That number is typical for Fortnite, which remains one of the most-played games in the world, even almost a decade after it first hit the market. </p>



<p>On <a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite.gg</a>, users can see exactly how many people play Fortnite and find out statistics such as gain percentage and average rates, plus player peaks – it’s very interesting stuff.</p>



<p>The site also lists various other stats, which I’ll cover now.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-the-most-played-fortnite-map">What is the Most Played Fortnite Map?</h3>



<p><strong>‘Battle Royale’ is the most-played Fortnite map</strong>, boasting an all-time peak of 6.53 million players.</p>



<h3 id="h-who-is-the-top-fortnite-creator">Who is the Top Fortnite Creator?</h3>



<p><strong>Epic is the top Fortnite creator</strong>, boasting control of some of the most popular maps ever made in the Fortnite world. Epic has accrued 959 billion minutes played. Behind Epic sits ‘bullseye’, with 25.6 billion minutes played.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-the-most-played-fortnite-genre">What is the Most Played Fortnite Genre?</h3>



<p><strong>Most players prefer PvP</strong> – there are 65,787 PvP maps in the Fortnite universe, and at the time of writing, 410,000 players were dedicating their time to PvP. </p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-the-all-time-highest-fortnite-player-count">What is the All-Time Highest Fortnite Player Count?</h3>



<p><strong>The most players ever in Fortnite at the same time was 14,343,880</strong>, and that number was recorded in December 2024.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fortnite-dying">Is Fortnite Dying?</h2>



<p>It seems bizarre to suggest that Fortnite is dying when you look at how many people play the game, but here we are. There are always those who will oppose the game and suggest it’s ‘dead’ or ‘dying’, regardless of how many people play Fortnite. That’s just a fact of life.</p>



<p>The reality is, Fortnite is only becoming more powerful over time. It’s still the world’s most popular game, and it drives competitive and creative ecosystems like no other game ever made.</p>



<p>It’s not dying, and it probably won’t for many years to come.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Player Count – How Many People Play Marvel Rivals?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-player-count-confirmed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-player-count-%E2%80%93-how-many-people-play-marvel-rivals.1077144/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-player-count-confirmed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Marvel Rivals is a showstopper of a game. It was released by NetEase on December 6, 2024, skyrocketing up the charts and becoming known as a powerhouse title that quickly pulled in more than 20 million players – in just a few weeks. As we all know, time impacts the popularity of a game like nothing else, so what does the Marvel Rivals player count look like now?</p>



<p>I’ve taken a look at how many people play Marvel Rivals, breaking down the player data that we can see to determine the health of the game.</p>



<p>Is Marvel Rivals already dying, or is the player count soaring? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-player-count-confirmed">Marvel Rivals Player Count Confirmed</h2>



<p>It’s not possible to get accurate Marvel Rivals player count data from all the platforms it’s available on, but we can get a representative figure from Steam and simply extrapolate from there.</p>



<p><strong>At the time of writing, 231,346 people were playing Marvel Rivals on PC</strong>, and the 24-hour peak sat at 437,541 users. Amazingly, more users flooded Marvel Rivals in January than in December, with the game gaining momentum as 2025 kicked off.</p>



<p>This might only be data for PC gamers, but it’s a solid indication that the game is performing very strongly on all platforms, given that it’s free to play and highly accessible.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-already-dead">Is Marvel Rivals Already Dead?</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals has suffered slightly with some teething issues, particularly some concerns regarding network stability, unbalanced heroes, and of course, cheaters. However, none of these topics have been powerful enough to prevent the game from growing, such is proven by the Marvel Rivals player count.</p>



<p>This is a solid and substantial alternative to hero shooters like Overwatch, and it’s already proving to be a thorn in the side of those supporting Valve’s Deadlock, which is yet to be released. As there’s a fantastic roster of characters that gamers love and find familiar, the fanbase for the title was ready and waiting on the day the game was released.</p>



<p>If you haven’t played Marvel Rivals, you’re missing out. As the player count proves, it’s a success with gamers worldwide.</p>

<p>The next Pokemon Presents date has seemingly been leaked, and it comes from an unexpected source. </p>



<p>A keen-eyed <a href="https://x.com/mattyoukhana_/status/1876988464878567879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">user on Twitter</a> spotted metadata from Niantic that hints at the next Pokemon Presents taking place on February 27, 2025. In the data it shows a title of “Pokemon Presents 2025 x GO Tour: Unova Timed Research”. </p>



<p>The leaked date shouldn’t come as a surprise. Since 2021, there has been a Pokemon Presents on February 27 every year to coincide with Pokemon Day. If we are looking at when each of the last four events were announced, they usually didn’t come until just days prior. That means fans shouldn’t expect an official announcement on the next Pokemon Presents until around February 20 or so. </p>







<p>As far as what to expect during the showcase, it’s clear based on the title that a new timed research event for Pokemon Go will be shown. Also, with Pokemon Legends Z-A scheduled to launch this year, it could be assumed that the game will be shown in some way.  Elsewhere, Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket is likely to see a solid presence after it’s successful launch late last year. There’s also a good chance The Pokemon Company has a surprise or two up its sleeve in honor of the 29th Anniversary of Pokemon’s 1996 launch.</p>



<p>Whatever The Pokemon Company has in store for fans, Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the broadcast.</p>



<p>What do you think we see during the Pokemon Presents on Pokemon Day 2025? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>
