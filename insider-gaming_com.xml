<p>The Two Point series has long been known for its quirky humor, engaging management mechanics, and distinct art style. Two Point Museum is no exception. Following in the footsteps of Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus, this new entry takes the tried-and-true formula to a fresh setting. If you couldn’t guess by the title, that setting is museums. While it doesn’t break the mold from what Two Point has offered players in the past, the additions it brings to the series—like expeditions and collections—make it a standout title that keeps players hooked.</p>



<h2 id="h-two-point-museum-review"><strong>Two Point Museum Review</strong></h2>



<p>Visually, Two Point Museum retains the same charming aesthetic as its predecessors. Upon your first load into the game, it immediately feels familiar, making it easy for veterans of the series to jump in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At its core, the gameplay loop also remains simple yet satisfying:</p>



<ol>
<li>Build out your museum with exhibits.</li>



<li>Attract visitors who pay for entry, gift shop items, and leave ratings on your museum.</li>



<li>Use their feedback and earnings to improve and expand.</li>



<li>Rinse and repeat.</li>
</ol>



<p>The campaign offers a well-paced introduction to the game, easing the sense of being overwhelmed with a structured progression. Each level introduces different environments and museum themes, ensuring variety and keeping things fresh. Whether you’re setting up a traditional city museum, converting a haunted hotel into a set of spooky exhibits, or building a marine-themed waterfront attraction, each setting presents unique challenges and opportunities.</p>



<p>One of Two Point Museum’s standout new features is the ability to send staff on expeditions to retrieve artifacts and exhibits. These can range from fossilized floppy disks to full dinosaur skeletons. Some exhibits require multiple trips to different regions to complete a full display, adding an extra layer of depth to the collection process. However, danger lurks&nbsp; as staff may encounter dilemmas, such as whether to retrieve an artifact teetering on the edge of a cliff, where the wrong decision could result in a lost team member. Occasionally, staff can even go missing entirely, forcing you to hire, train, and build up a replacement.</p>



<p>Adding to the fun, the game mocks loot boxes with an obnoxious animation when expeditions return, reinforcing that signature humor.</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-managing-the-madness"><strong>Managing the Madness</strong></h3>



<p>Beyond collecting artifacts, keeping the museum running smoothly presents its own set of challenges. Managing staff is key, as employees tend to wander off or take seemingly endless breaks if not properly supervised. Visitors also present their own set of problems—families with kids need entertainment, which can mean setting up play areas with oddly positioned ladders, while mischievous guests might climb exhibits when you’d really prefer they didn’t.</p>



<p>Security plays a role, but theft, even on higher difficulty settings, doesn’t feel like as big of a threat as it could have been. Running the museum can get expensive, but (mostly) thanks to grants, finances never feel overly restrictive, even on harder difficulties. The real challenge comes in dealing with Kudosh—the game’s “premium” currency—, which can sometimes be frustrating to earn but never to the point of breaking the experience.</p>



<p>For those who prefer more creative freedom, Two Point Museum includes a robust sandbox mode. Players can choose between creative, career, or hardcore modes, with the latter increasing difficulty through limited cash, a higher chance of theft, and other obstacles. The Steam Workshop integration also opens the door for endless customization, allowing players to add new exhibits, museum themes, and more.</p>



<p>The campaign progression carries over across locations, meaning unlocks and inventory persist as you expand your museum empire. This incentivizes returning to previous museums to complete special exhibits, like one requiring both a marine and prehistory expert, or to integrate newly unlocked features like museum tours and small aquarium exhibits.</p>

<h3 id="h-areas-for-improvement"><strong>Areas for Improvement</strong></h3>



<p>While Two Point Museum delivers an overall enjoyable experience, there are a few areas where it could be refined. The inability to expand or adjust the layout of existing buildings is a bit frustrating, especially as space becomes limited. Although adjacent buildings can be added, the lack of flexibility in modifying layouts feels restrictive. Sure, you can build interior walls, but it’s not the same.</p>



<p>Additionally, the game’s user interface could be more intuitive, particularly when unlocking new areas of the map. For instance, progressing in the campaign requires reaching Level 5 Enlightenment, but the game does not clearly explain how to achieve this milestone, which can be confusing for players. Another missed opportunity lies in the security mechanics. While theft is present, even at higher difficulty settings, as mentioned earlier, it never truly feels like a significant challenge. A more dynamic security system could have added another engaging layer of management. These minor issues don’t detract from the overall enjoyment, but refining these aspects could elevate the game even further.</p>



<h3 id="h-two-point-museum-review-verdict"><strong>Two Point Museum Review Verdict</strong></h3>



<p>Two Point Museum doesn’t revolutionize the series, but it successfully adapts the beloved formula to a new and entertaining setting. Expeditions and collections inject fresh gameplay elements, while the humor and accessible mechanics make it enjoyable for both newcomers and seasoned players. Despite a few minor frustrations with building expansion and UI clarity, the game’s charm, depth, and variety make it an easy recommendation.</p>



<p>Whether you’re uncovering ancient artifacts, dealing with frozen bees and cavemen (who, if thawed, cause chaos on your guests), or wondering why Yetis and vampires are visiting your museum, Two Point Museum has that special something that hooks you.</p>



<p>In my time with the game, it became way too easy to find myself sitting down to play only to realize five hours have passed and it’s now 2am with a baby who wakes up at 6am. Still, Two Point Museum is a one of those games well worth the sleep deprivation.</p>



<p><strong>VERDICT: BUY</strong></p>

<p>Delta Force and its Black Hawk Down Campaign gameplay need a console release. The title is having great success on PC, but a lack of console presence can be a killer. Let’s see what developer Team Jade has planned for the shooter’s future.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Hawk Down Campaign</a> kickstarted a new wave of interest in Delta Force. The military shooter has gained a sizable following due to its no-nonsense first-person shooter gameplay. Bullets and bombs are all part and parcel of the deadly Delta Force experience. 2025 saw the game’s official launch, and Black Hawk Down is a piece of free, single-player Campaign DLC.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-mostly-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Hawk Down has been perceived as too difficult</a> in some corners of the internet. But console players are desperate to judge this for themself. Let’s find out the latest on Delta Force coming to consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-delta-force-black-hawk-console-release">Do we Know The Delta Force Black Hawk Console Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Imagine this on the PS5 and Xbox Series X. Credit to Team Jade</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Jade has postponed Delta Force’s original console release date, meaning the Black Hawk Down content has also been delayed. There is no new revised released window for the first-person shooter title on either PlayStation or Xbox for now.</strong></p>



<p>A video featuring one of <a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Delta Force</a>‘s devs talked about the game’s release on console. They said “The release date may have to be postponed” and cited “input fairness” and controller/aiming as a problem the team was having a tough time translating to console.</p>

<p>But they were quick to indicate “development of the console version is going well,” meaning we, hopefully, shouldn’t have to wait too long. We should learn more soon enough as the official Delta Force X account has indicated a “<strong>console roadmap</strong>” is gearing up to be shared with the community.</p>







<p>For the time being Delta Force—and the Black Hawk Down content—is only playable on PC until a new announcement is made. Be sure to check in with the guide as we anticipate an update from Team Jade.</p>
