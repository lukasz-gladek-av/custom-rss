<li><strong>Yellow letters</strong> are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>



<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>

<p>It turns out that while Capcom was working on its litany of scares for Resi 8, the developer was already working on Resident Evil Requiem, and it will be an inclusive entry.</p>



<p>The Ethan Winters journey is over in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-live-2026-showcase-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. We move on, and Grace Ashcroft heads up the mantle this time around. While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-makes-interesting-comment-on-leon-kennedy-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors about Leon Kennedy</a> continue to swirl, Capcom has clearly had Grace’s chapter in mind for some time.</p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-is-over-6-years-in-the-making">Resident Evil Requiem Is Over 6 Years In The Making</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hands up (or out) if you’re excited. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’ve learned a lot about <a href="https://press-start.com.au/features/2025/11/15/resident-evil-requiem-interview-putting-the-horror-in-survival-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Press Start</a>‘s interview with Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa. One of the big takeaways is how long Capcom has worked on Resident Evil Requiem, and how its development coincided with Village’s creation.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Looking back, I understand how&nbsp;Resident Evil 4&nbsp;and Village became more action-heavy. Yes, that we have to admit. Looking back at the feedback, we understand how fans prefer more horror. Requiem was in development way before Village. We just wanted to make sure in this game, we wanted to focus on the horror and horror be the main part.&nbsp;I am not sure if all development teams are doing this, but I personally try to read as much or all the comments on social media.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kumazawa also elaborated further on Requiem’s journey: “So looking back on the online multiplayer game, <strong>it’s been in development for around six years or so.</strong>“</p>







<p>Despite the franchise being around for over 30 years, Capcom is still looking to attract new players. Kumazawa explained how Resident Evil Requiem’s development is looking to make it an accessible title:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I guess the one thing I want to let people know is that because Resident Evil is a long-running series, I want people to know they can still play Requiem and enjoy it. There are no prerequisites for the game or prior knowledge required. If this is a new game for them or their entry into the series, I want them also to enjoy this, and that any player can play thanks to difficulties like Casual. Please don’t think there are entry barriers to this game. But by saying that, I am not ignoring series fans. There are elements I have put in this that are very familiar, in the demo you can see leads and links that series fans will enjoy.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, whether you’re an old-school player or a newcomer, it will be inclusive for everyone.

<p>New images of Link and Zelda have been revealed for the upcoming The Legend of Zelda live-action movie. </p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda live-action movie has been in development for some time, and it appears that things are finally moving forward after the previous delay. Earlier this year, Shigeru Miyamoto had already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/link-and-zelda-actors-confirmed-nintendo-legend-of-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> which actors would be playing the roles of Link and Zelda, and now new images have showcased how they look in these costumes. </p>



<h2 id="h-official-images-of-link-and-zelda-were-revealed-through-the-nintendo-today-app">Official Images of Link and Zelda were Revealed through the Nintendo Today App</h2>



<p>The new images of Link and Zelda in costume from the live-action adaptation of The Legend of Zelda were revealed by Nintendo itself through the Nintendo Today app (via <a href="https://www.vooks.net/first-photos-of-link-and-zelda-in-the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vooks</a>). Three official images were revealed: the first was a close-up of Bo Bragason, who is playing Zelda; the second image was a close shot of Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, who will be playing Link in the upcoming movie; the third image was of both of them looking over the horizon, with some of the movie’s world shown in the background. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Legend of Zelda live-action filming has already begun, and these images finally confirm that news. A couple of days ago, we saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-footage-has-reportedly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several videos circulating</a>, leaking images from the movie’s set, including actors, and other content. We already knew Link would be wearing a green tunic and Zelda would be wearing something blue, which is similar to her looks in BOTW and TOTK. The scene also seemingly included a horse with a patch featuring the classic Zelda logo. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zelda-movie-leak-impa-severance-actor-filming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Severance star</a> might be joining the upcoming live-action adaptation of The Legend of Zelda. Additionally, a new LEGO Zelda set is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to arrive in 2026</a>.
