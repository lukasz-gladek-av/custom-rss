<p>Wildlight Entertainment is working hard to address player concerns regarding some of the quality-of-life mechanics in Highguard. Or rather, some of the <strong>missing </strong>quality-of-life mechanics. The game came out just two days ago, and players quickly discovered that some settings they expected to be there simply weren’t.</p>



<p>The Highguard team posted a message on social media addressing the issue and stated that player feedback will be addressed with some rapid patching.</p>

<p>Highguard has already had a tough time since jumping onto the market on Monday. It was a bold experiment by Wildlight Entertainment to fuse multiple genres in a bid to create something innovative, but a lot of the effort appears to have been lost in the delivery of the thing.</p>



<p>The launch of Highguard followed more than a month of radio silence after the game’s first trailer landed at The Game Awards, hosted by Geoff Keighley, who is also being burned after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-was-meant-to-be-a-shadowdrop/">promoting the game at length</a>.</p>



<p>In a recent social media post, the team at Wildlight stressed that some quality-of-life improvements are coming to address what players are asking for the most:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been listening to feedback and working to add some highly requested features, including FoV sliders for consoles, toggle settings for ADS &amp; crouch, and more graphics scaling options for PC. We’re targeting to release a patch tomorrow, with full patch notes once it’s live.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For some, it’s bizarre that Highguard was released with some of these options missing. Regardless, Wildlight is going to right that wrong with a patch that promises to be pushed out today.</p>



<p>For those hanging around, Highguard has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-roadmap-reveals-year-of-content/">a year-long roadmap</a> stacked up and waiting to be delivered. Time will tell how many players are present to see all the content drops unravel this year, though.</p>

<p>A long-time <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> employee has taken to social media to claim that he has been placed on an unpaid disciplinary suspension for comments regarding the recent return-to-office mandates.</p>







<p>Posting on LinkedIn, David Michaud-Cromp, who has worked at Ubisoft for more than 13 years, says the company notified him that he would receive a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension.</p>



<p>According to Michaud-Cromp, the suspension, which is set to start tomorrow, was issued in response to public comments he made about Ubisoft’s return-to-office policy and an “alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.”</p>



<p>Following the announcement of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-forcing-full-return-office-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5-day return-to-office mandate</a>, which Insider Gaming understands has proven to be an extremely unpopular move with employees, David took to LinkedIn to say:</p>



<p>“So… Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office… because they “believe in collaboration”… but c’mon, we’re not completely stupid… we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office…”</p>



<p>Michaud-Cromp alleges that these comments led to the three-day suspension.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment, and should one be received, we will update this article.</p>
