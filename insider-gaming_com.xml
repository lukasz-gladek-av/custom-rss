            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Just in time for the holidays, the Epic Games Store is now allowing gifting on the storefront. The feature has been a highly requested addition from fans and couldn’t come at a better time.</p>







<p>Epic Games Store is a fairly new service, only launching in 2018. As a competitor to Steam, the storefront houses many popular releases like Battlefield 6, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-arc-raiders-maps-quests-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, and Epic Games’ own Fortnite. However, one factor that Steam had over Epic Games Store was gifting. On Steam, you can gift a code or a copy of a game to another user. Despite a large game selection, the Epic Games Store had yet to implement the system. Now, the joy of gifting has arrived and right before the Holiday season.</p>



<h2 id="h-gifting-now-available-to-users-on-epic-games-store">Gifting Now Available to Users on Epic Games Store</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gift games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 on Epic Games Store!</figcaption></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/gifting-now-available-on-egs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> on the Epic Games Store, the company revealed that gifting has been added to the storefront. To do the process, pick a game you want to buy for someone and choose “Buy as a Gift”. From there, choose who you’ll gift the game to from your Epic friends list, and you can pick to schedule it or do it ASAP, then purchase. From there, the recipient has two weeks to accept the game. If not or rejected, you’ll get a refund. </p>



<p>The gifting service extends to paid games (including certain editions), add-ons, and bundles. However, in-game currency, subscriptions, free games, and pre-purchase offers are not allowed. A more step-by-step guide can be found <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/features/gifting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>



<p>Now, you can surprise your friends with new games without any hassle. While it seems like something that should’ve been there since the start, it couldn’t have come at a better time of the year. Plus, with so many great games in 2025 like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you can gift the best of the best to friends and finally convince them to play it. </p>







<p>Are you happy to see gifting come to the Epic Games Store? Will you be gifting games to your friends? What games? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-not-releasing-f1-26-new-game-coming-2027/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-not-releasing-f1-26-next-new-game-coming-in-2027.1357099/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA Sports has announcemed that it’s not going to release F1 26 next year. </p>



<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://x.com/EASPORTSF1/status/1990813568325857352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it was revealed</a> that instead of releasing F1 2026 in 2026, EA Sports will release a paid expansion for F1 25. This expansion will represent <strong>“the 2026 FIA Formula One World Championship, including new cars, teams, and regulations.”</strong></p>







<p>The next game, then, is scheduled to release in 2027. EA says that the next game in franchise will be a “<strong>reimagined and more expansive EA Sports F1 game”</strong>. They said that the game will deliver a <strong>“deeply authentic and innovative Formula 1 experience.”</strong></p>



<p>Questions around the future of the F1 franchise at EA have been popping up ever since the launch of F1 25. That release was scheduled to be the last of the current contract, though there was an option to extend it for two years. </p>



<p>EA had initially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-ea-sports-f1-series-continues-with-two-year-option-pick-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed to Insider Gaming</a> that the option was picked up to keep the franchise going. However, just hours later, the company retracted that confirmation saying, <strong>“Apologies for the inconvenience, but we’ve been informed that the information we provided earlier today is inaccurate and we don’t have any information at this time.”</strong></p>



<p>Since then, it had been silent from EA and Formula 1 on the state of the series and F1 26. Until now, that is.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to EA and Formula 1 for added context on the decision to not release a game next year. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>







<p>What do you think of EA Sports releasing a paid update for F1 25 instead of F1 26 and waiting until 2027 to release the next game?
