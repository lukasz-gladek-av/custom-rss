            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Starting this Friday, Black Ops 7’s Endgame mode will be unlocked for everyone, regardless of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-endgame-multiplayer-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campaign completion</a> or not. Fortunately, those who beat the story will get some rewards.</p>







<p>Released earlier this month, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has had quite the rough patch. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI allegations</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-metacritic-user-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">negative feedback</a> have taken a lot of the airwaves for the game. Furthermore, its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwhelming player count</a> on opening weekend compared to Battlefield 6 are not the best. However, its multiplayer modes, especially Endgame, have been recieved well. It did require one to go through a ‘garbage’ campaign, so many haven’t gotten to try it yet. Now, not even a month since releasing, the mode will be available to all.</p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Co-Op Endgame mode will unlock for all Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 players starting this Friday, November 21. </p><p>Those who finished the campaign to get Endgame will receive 3x 1 hr 2XP Tokens, 2X Weapon XP Tokens, 2X Battle Pass XP Tokens, and 3x Perkaholic GobbleGums. <a href="https://t.co/i3z6j0pVll">pic.twitter.com/i3z6j0pVll</a></p></div>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1991221059119415675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post on Twitter/X, <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1991221059119415675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a> stated that, starting Friday, November 21st, Black Ops 7’s Endgame mode will be available for everyone. As mentioned before, the mode was previously locked behind beating the co-op campaign. If you were one of those who beat it to get Endgame, there are rewards you’ll be able to redeem. The list can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>3x 1-Hour 2XP Tokens</li>



<li>2x Weapon XP Tokens</li>



<li>2x Battle Pass XP Tokens</li>



<li>3x Perkaholic GobbleGums</li>
</ul>



<p>The mode is Call of Duty’s new answer to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dmz-is-officially-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DMZ from Modern Warfare 2</a>. With an open world, Avalon, you and four friends can take on missions, secure objectives, and explore. Other teams will be on the map and you’ll compete with them, as well. </p>



<p>With the mode now available to all, it’ll be interesting to see if it has an effect on the player count. Many fans do like the mode, so without having prerequisites, it may bring more people in. Either way, the move does feel a bit sudden, especially coming just two weeks after releasing. </p>







<p>What do you think of Endgame being fully available in Black Ops 7? Is it to boost engagement? Have you played the mode? Was it worth going through the campaign?

<p>Twitch, on Wednesday, announced changes to how the company will tracking views for clips in order to “better reflect genuine viewer engagement”.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1991208256614854719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the company is making five specific changes that will track more views more accurately. It also continues the company’s recent efforts to combat view botting that has plagued the site for a while. </p>







<p><strong>“While clip views may initially appear lower, you’ll now have cleaner and more consistent cross-platform clips data that will ultimately help provide you with better insights into clip performance,” </strong>Twitch said. </p>



<p>As far as the specific changes go, those include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixing a technical issue that was inadvertently inflating clip view counts</li>



<li>Including clip views from Stories in clip view totals</li>



<li>Making view counting more consistent across all platforms (web, iOS, Android)</li>



<li>Better filtering out of bot traffic</li>



<li>Enabling improved clip analytics and laying the groundwork for us to explore new analytics features</li>
</ul>



<p><strong> “Going forward, we’ll continue to fine-tune our clip view counting system on an ongoing basis,”</strong> they added. </p>
