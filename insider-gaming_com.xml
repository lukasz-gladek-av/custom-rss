<p>PlayStation isn’t giving up on live service games any time soon. In a recent interview with Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/26274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a>, PlayStation Co-CEO Herman Hulst said that the company still believes in the model despite recent hiccups like Concord.</p>



<p>“The game business is constantly changing due to various factors, including technological advances, new genres and ways of playing,” Hulst said via auto translation. “However, one thing that remains constant is people’s desire for great entertainment experiences, and attention to games continues to grow. However, this has also created competition, and like many companies in the industry, we have had to make changes to our business to solidify a more sustainable operating base.”</p>



<p>Hulst continued by saying PlayStation will “continue to focus on developing live service titles along with the story-driven single-player titles that our players want.”</p>







<p>As far as why a  continued effort towards live service games, Hulst pointed to Helldivers 2’s success as a reason. The co-op title from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-biggest-surprise-hit-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowhead Game Studios showed how</a> a live service game can succeed in the modern era, and it’s something that Sony and PlayStation are paying attention to.</p>



<p>“We are learning a lot as we establish the ability to develop high-quality live service titles within SIE,” he said.&nbsp;“Helldivers 2 attracted many players through continuous content provision, and achieved results that support the potential of live service titles.”</p>



<p>What do you think of PlayStation moving forward with more live service games? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-game-of-the-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When it comes to video games, 2024 wasn’t just another year. It truly was a standout year for games over the last decade. Yes, we’ve heard that sentiment before, but this time it felt different. This year brought a wave of incredible experiences, with something for everyone. From the smallest indie gems to blockbuster AAA titles, the gaming landscape was full of great titles.</p>



<p>Games like Helldivers 2, Balatro, Black Myth: Wukong, and STALKER 2 dominated conversations at various points throughout the year. But one game managed to capture the hearts of the Insider Gaming community above all others. That game, and the Insider Gaming Community’s 2024 Game of the Year, is Astro Bot. </p>



<p>In a tightly-contested vote on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>, the race came down to two favorites: Astro Bot and Balatro. In the end, Astro Bot edged out the poker-themed roguelike, claiming 37% of the vote compared to Balatro’s 33%.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-makes-astro-bot-so-special">What Makes Astro Bot So Special?</h3>



<p>This isn’t just another <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/astro-bot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">3D platformer</a>; it’s a love letter to PlayStation’s legacy. With stunning visuals steeped in nostalgia, Astro Bot takes you on a journey through PlayStation’s storied history. Its level designs are masterfully varied, ensuring that no two stages ever feel the same.</p>



<p>From a gameplay perspective, it’s pure fun and, arguably, the most enjoyable 3D platforming experience on PlayStation since the early days of Crash Bandicoot or Spyro. The game is packed with inventive mechanics, each one thoughtfully designed to keep things fresh. Whether you’re wielding Aloy’s bow or transforming into a sponge to soak up water and grow in size, every moment feels like a perfect fit for the worlds Team Asobi created. Importantly, nothing is overused, so the game always feels engaging and never overstays its welcome.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-return-to-gaming-s-roots">A Return to Gaming’s Roots</h3>



<p>But what truly sets Astro Bot apart is the way it makes you feel. It’s a throwback to the golden age of gaming—a traditional 3D platformer without the clutter of microtransactions or overwhelming bloat. It’s just long enough to satisfy, but never so drawn out that it becomes a slog. Playing Astro Bot feels like revisiting the essence of what made so many of us fall in love with video games in the first place. Even the game’s soundtrack evokes a feeling of yesteryear while still feeling fresh and modern.</p>



<p>Do you agree with Astro Bot as the Game of the Year, or is there another 2024 standout that stole your heart? Let us know down below, and join the conversation in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>!</p>

<p>The highly anticipated Half-Life 3 has moved to its next round of playtesting, it has been claimed.</p>



<p>That’s according to Gabe Follower, who has a history of leaking similar information on previous Valve titles, most notably Deadlock last year.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP9JgtJPzbI&amp;ab_channel=GabeFollower" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gabe Follower</a>, his sources have revealed that HLX (Half-Life 3) started playtests for Family and Friends of Valve developers in the past few months. </p>



<p>While the information doesn’t give us much information into what Half-Life 3 entails, it does tell us that the project is now at a fundamental stage of development and could see the game delayed further if it does not resonate well with the new playtests. </p>



<p>Previously, Valve delayed Half Life Alyx, its VR game, for one year to re-write the story. Deadlock, Valve’s upcoming team-based multiplayer shooter, also saw several delays due to feedback during these sessions. </p>



<p>The playtests do tell us that Half-Life 3 could be nearing its announcement soon, though, presumably sometime during 2025. If not, well, it’s entirely possible that the game could leak online due to the game now being accessed by more people.</p>



<p>As for when Half-Life 3 will be released, it remains to be seen, but Gabe Follower’s claims suggest that the game is progressing well.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/our-path-of-exile-2-class-tier-list-in-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-path-of-exile-2-class-tier-list-in-early-access.1071168/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/our-path-of-exile-2-class-tier-list-in-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Path of Exile 2 has six classes available, with another six coming as the game progresses. There will be 12 classes and 36 ascendancies in due time, making it a genuinely expansive game with countless hours of playtime available. But for now, you’re limited to a few starting classes. Here’s the thing, though. They rock! At least in our opinion. </p>



<p>So we decided to rank them all with a Path of Exile 2 class tier list for Early Access!</p>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-s-best-classes-ranked-this-is-totally-our-opinion">Path of Exile 2’s Best Classes Ranked (This is Totally Our Opinion!)</h2>



<p>First and foremost, let’s get this out of the way. Yes, you will have your own tier list, and we’d love to hear which classes you place in S-Tier in the comments below. Do you disagree with us? Let us know! We love discussing our favorite games, especially when you bring them to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>



<h3 id="h-s-tier-classes">S-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>The <strong>Mercenary </strong>is the big new class available in Path of Exile 2, and after playing through the entire campaign with one, I can attest to its strength. You can turn the crossbow into a close-quarters shotgun and lob grenades with reckless abandon. It’s a fun, powerful class capable of downing most bosses in the game.</p>



<p>Following that, we have the <strong>Witch </strong>with its powerful summons and the <strong>Monk </strong>with its creative abilities and fast, hard-hitting martial arts capable of making quick work of most enemies.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Mercenary</strong></li>



<li><strong>Witch</strong></li>



<li><strong>Monk</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-a-tier-classes">A-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>You can solo the entirety of Path of Exile 2 with the <strong>Ranger</strong>, so long as you have the proper equipment. A powerful bow will take you far. As for the <strong>Sorceress</strong>, the right build and an occasional helping hand in defeating some of the more challenging bosses in the game, which you can ask for in the global chat, push both classes into A-Tier.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ranger</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sorceress</strong></li>
</ul>







<h3 id="h-b-tier-classes">B-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>From firsthand experience, the <strong>Warrior</strong> has the potential to be potent against mobs and ranged bosses, but it’s a slow class to start with. If you have the patience to stick with the brute force of a club-wielding monster, you’ll find a powerful class capable of tanking enemies, but one that excels with a group, like a Sorceress or Ranger.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Warrior</strong></li>
</ul>
