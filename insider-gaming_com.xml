<p>PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes reward you for playing the game. It’s a nice feeling, in all honesty, and to make sure you don’t miss out on new rewards such as clothes and consumables, we’ve got the latest PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes for February 2025.</p>



<p>2K has a habit of including Codes and Keys across its games. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands</a> is known for using Shift Keys to give players in-game bonuses. Whereas most of 2K’s sports games use the Locker Codes feature. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> is the latest example of incorporating Locker Codes into the gameplay.</p>



<p>Codes can be hidden in the game or on social media. But they’re not so hidden when we’re around.</p>

<p><strong>You need to go to the Settings menu, find the Locker Code Redemption, and input the code to secure your free goodies in PGA Tour 2K25.</strong></p>



<p>Again, this is very straightforward, but here are the steps to follow:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to PGA Tour 2K25’s home menu screen.</li>



<li>Head to your <strong>Profile Menu</strong>.</li>



<li>Scroll across to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>



<li>Flick through the options until you get to <strong>Redeem Locker Code</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on it.</li>



<li>Enter one of the Active PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes.</li>



<li>Confirm your choice to receive the applicable bonus!</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-expired-locker-codes">PGA Tour 2K25 Expired Locker Codes</h2>



<p><strong>There are currently no expired Locker Codes in PGA Tour 2K25.</strong></p>



<p>As I write this, the game is still very new, so any active codes valid from its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a> launch are still going strong. You don’t have to miss out if you get on the codes above early enough. But don’t expect it to stay this way.</p>



<p>Make sure you keep checking back to see if any new codes are available. Plus, it’s always handy to know which no longer works.</p>



<hr>



<p>2K will likely add new PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes. The goodies likely vary from code to code, so ensure you’re not missing out on good stuff. Which rewards are you most desperate to be included as part of Locker Codes?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Twitch Thinks Cheating in Games is a ‘Low Severity Violation’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-thinks-cheating-in-games-is-a-%E2%80%98low-severity-violation%E2%80%99.1115289/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Twitch recently posted an update to its terms of service, outlining changes to the platform’s enforcement system. In this update, it was confirmed that violations will now ‘expire’, and the less severe the violation, the faster it’ll disappear from your account history. The most abhorrent violations will remain on your account for up to two years.</p>



<p>However, the policy update penned by Twitch Support also confirmed that the platform believes cheating in video games is an example of a ‘low severity violation’. As such, it will remove any trace of these incidents from your record, if you’ve faced punitive action, in as little as 90 days.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-getting-away-with-it">Getting Away With It</h2>



<p>Twitch’s <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/An-Update-to-our-Enforcement-System?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">enforcement update</a> came with a graphic that shows how things work on the platform.</p>



<p>Every account starts in ‘good standing’ with zero violations. If you’re caught cheating in a game, you’ll get a <strong>one-day </strong>suspension and the record will be marked against your account for 90 days. If you’re caught cheating <strong>again</strong>, you’ll get a <strong>three-day </strong>suspension and that 90-day threshold will reset and be pushed further out.</p>



<p>Following that 90-day window, you’ll be returned to ‘good standing’.</p>



<p>That means that you can be caught cheating multiple times, and as long as you serve your suspension, you’ll only have to wait three months before Twitch views you as a model citizen once again.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Is this justice?</figcaption></figure>







<p>Cheating is one of the most disruptive acts in modern gaming – and it has been a growing issue for years. Some games are borderline unplayable at times because of cheaters ruining everyone’s fun, and publishers and developers have taken ‘cheat makers’ to court and sought out damages in the tens of millions of dollars.</p>



<p>And many have been successful in their pursuits of justice.</p>



<p>In South Korea and China, you can face a fine or even jail time for manufacturing or using cheats in a game – but Twitch is banned in China and around a year ago, the company withdrew from South Korea.</p>



<p>As a lover of all things multiplayer, I find it bizarre that you can publicly cheat in a game on Twitch and a) face just a one-day suspension, and b) have your record scrubbed in 90 days.</p>



<p>What about those cheating in professional tournaments to win cash prizes? Should that just face a one-day suspension?</p>



<p>At the least, you’re standing firm as a testament to the slacking policies of the platform, but in the worst-case scenario, you’re letting others know where and how to cheat in popular multiplayer games. Many cheaters will use their streams to actively promote the sale of cheats, with some dastardly operators securing referral bonuses for pointing malicious gamers to cheating sites.</p>



<p>Do you think Twitch should come down harder on those caught cheating in games? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Neople’s The First Berserker Khazan has sleeper-hit potential, and its 2025 release isn’t one to miss. Whether you want to know which platforms it’s on, how much it costs, or how to play its exclusive demo, we have everything you need to know before you become a berserker yourself.</p>



<p>2024 smashed it in the Soulslike department. FromSoftware delivered its long-awaited Shadow of the Erdtree DLC—Radahn still gives me nightmares—and Stellar Blade was more than stellar. Now, it’s time to look ahead to 2025. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is the first hard-hitting heavyweight in the Soulslike division.</p>



<p>Khazan’s backstory is nearly as brutal and horrific as the punishing gameplay. But to see if this is the start of something special, I’m here to guide you through the title’s key tidbits before launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-first-berserker-khazan-come-out">When Does The First Berserker Khazan Come Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re hyped. Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Prepare yourself for The First Berserker Khazan’s March 27 release date.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, the vengeance-hungry warrior graces screens in March. Not content with battling those who wronged him, <a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The First Berserker Khazan</a> also has to stave off the presence of other March 2025 games including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-platforms">The First Berserker Khazan Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC users can prepare for The First Berserker Khazan launch.</strong></p>



<p>I’m afraid it’s bad news if I haven’t mentioned your platform. PS4 and Xbox One users have to miss out, as do Nintendo Switch owners. I keep questioning if any 2025 releases will get an eventual <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> port. The console is supposed to be a million times more powerful (might be an exaggeration) and a future Switch 2 launch might not be out of the question.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-the-first-berserker-khazan-demo">How to Play The First Berserker Khazan Demo</h2>



<p><strong>Search for The First Berserker Khazan demo on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC, download it, and get playing.</strong></p>



<p>It’s honestly this simple. But here are some handy instructions to follow precisely if you’re struggling:</p>



<ol>
<li>Choose which platform you want to play The First Berserker Khazan demo on.</li>



<li>Go to the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, or Steam.</li>



<li>Search for <strong>The First Berserker Khazan</strong>.</li>



<li>Select the free demo.</li>



<li>Click to download it.</li>



<li>Once it’s ready, you can jump straight into the The First Berserker Khazan demo.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-editions-amp-price">The First Berserker Khazan Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>The First Berserker Khazan has two editions: Standard Edition ($59.99/£49.99) and Deluxe Edition ($69.99/£54.99).</strong></p>



<p>Neople is dispensing with luxuriousness where The First Berserker Khazan is concerned. It’s just a Standard or Deluxe Edition to pick from. Most games release with several editions, so this is a more straightforward selection for once.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s not a full-price release, nor is it getting the hype of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> or even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, but don’t sleep on The First Berserker Khazan. It looks brutal and bold. Do you think it could be this year’s Shadow of the Erdtree? Or is it another Soulslike clone? Leave your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<p>Details about Cliffhanger’s upcoming Black Panther game have surfaced online thanks to a popular leaker, and it seems players will be able to try out characters like T’Challa, Killmonger, Shuri and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new information about Cliffhanger’s Black Panther game comes from the popular Call of Duty leaker TheGhostOfHope. Their latest post on <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1892746064505246088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) provides players with exclusive details on the upcoming game, such as character choice, combat details, POV, exploration, narrative aspects, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The details reveal that the upcoming Black Panther game will allow players to choose their protagonist, which varies from T’Challa to M’Baku, Azari, Shuri, Killmonger, and more. Each Black Panther will have unique weapons, armour, and gadgets. Regarding combat, players can expect “authentic African Martial Arts mixed with Superhuman strength/agility” along with tech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding exploration, the upcoming Black Panther game will feature cities, savannahs, and other locations where players will experience different cultures and interact with new characters. The game will feature an over-the-shoulder POV. Lastly, Black Panther’s story will react to your choices and actions, providing players with “unique stories, missions &amp; dynamics” in return.</p>



<p>The Black Panther game was announced by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-black-panther/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA in 2023</a>, with Cliffhanger Games developing the AAA title. Monolith’s Kevin Stephens is leading the project, and the team includes veterans from top franchises like Halo Infinite, God of War, Call of Duty, and others.&nbsp;A job listing from last year confirmed an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-panther-game-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world setting</a> for the game.</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals has crossed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-hits-40-million-players-within-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">40 million players</a> in three months.

            <title><![CDATA[Every Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Boss Fight, Ranked]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-boss-fights-ranked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-boss-fight-ranked.1115190/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-boss-fights-ranked/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is, without any doubt, one of the best games in the entire series. It debuted on PlayStation 2 way back in 2004, and since then, it has remained a cult classic title, the subject of many memes, and the target of re-releases and remasters. It features a collection of boss fights, each one as memorable as the other, and all of them unique in their way. </p>



<p>In this list, I’m breaking down all the Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fights, ranking them in order of how awesome they are to behold.</p>



<hr>







<p>It’s mostly subjective, right? For one man’s trash, there’s another man’s treasure – and that’s the same thing with these boss fights. They’re all special in their way, but some of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/metal-gear-solid/">Metal Gear Solid</a> 3 boss fights are so iconic that they’ll stick in our minds forever.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-the-pain">9. The Pain</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Pain is the first member of ‘Cobra’ that we get to fight in MGS3: Snake Eater. As such, his fight is relatively plain and easy to overcome, and his abilities are rather weak and not all that impressive. He can control bees – that’s about it. </p>



<h3 id="h-8-the-shagohod">8. The Shagohod</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>You wouldn’t think that going up against an enormous, nuclear-capable tank would be a boring boss fight, but that’s just what it is. It’s memorable because you’re fighting something so massive, but it’s an on-rails scene followed by a repetitive mechanism that sees you bring the behemoth to its knees relatively quickly.</p>







<h3 id="h-7-the-sorrow">7. The Sorrow</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Sorrow’s battle is one of the cleverest Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fights, as it’s built around how you’ve played the game up until that point. If you’ve killed lots of enemies, your battle here will be ‘longed out’, but if you’re on a no-kill run, it’ll be over quickly. It rewards users with a nice camo suit, but ultimately, this fight is a walking simulator – but a smart one.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-ocelot">6. Ocelot</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Ocelot is cool – he’s one of the best Metal Gear Solid characters of all time and a memorable one at that. He and Naked Snake clash three times in Snake Eater, but the most exciting fight with him is his first one, when he is using his dual revolvers across a crevice – it’s the scene from which a few memes surfaced over the years. </p>







<h3 id="h-5-the-end">5. The End</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fighting The End can either be an intense slog riddled with jumpscares or it can be the easiest battle in the world. Originally, users could trick the game, setting the time/date on their PlayStation 2 forward by a week once they’ve met The End, and he’d die in-game of old age… Clever, right? Otherwise, players could take part in a thrilling cat-and-mouse sniper battle across several regions of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-the-fear">4. The Fear</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Fear lives up to his name by basically offering up the creepiest Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fight in the game. He’s a strange, fork-tongued man who can dislocate his limbs at will, scramble up trees like a spider, and strike at Naked Snake with a crossbow in relative silence. With his remarkable camouflage, players are left to rely on sounds to track him, and he leaves traps everywhere to trip Snake up.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-the-fury">3. The Fury</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Fury is a phenomenal boss that fights the player in a suffocating battle backed up by an overwhelming flamethrower and a whole lot of anger. He’s not insanely difficult to kill, but he can devastate the player very quickly in the close-knit, phobia-inducing environment in which the fight takes place. At the end of the fight, he supernovates and explodes in a brutal, cataclysmic eruption.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-colonel-volgin">2. Colonel Volgin</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>As the big baddy in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Colonel Volgin makes for a fantastic opponent. There are plenty of secret tricks the player can use to turn the tide of battle, but his abilities alone make his face-off one of the best Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fights in the game. He’s a powerful fighter with electromagnetic and lightning powers, and visually, he’s one of the most impressive bosses in Metal Gear history.</p>







<h3 id="h-1-the-boss">1. The Boss</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>If there’s a more emotional boss battle in gaming, I don’t know what it is. At the very end of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Naked Snake must fight his mentor – The Boss. She means a huge amount to Snake, but still, he must do away with her, and that means an intense battle between the master and the apprentice must take place. It doesn’t help that the soundtrack to this fight is incredible and the setting is nothing short of beautiful. It’s such a dramatic battle, it’s the best Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fight on record.</p>
