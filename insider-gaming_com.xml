<p>Operators in the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> are the characters you can play as, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> offers multiple of them. You have the freedom to choose from any of them in the multiplayer mode, however, Zombies has four dedicated to determining a crew and providing story dialogue and context.</p>



<p>Not all of them come unlocked right from the start. Some require you to get the Black Ops 6 Vault Edition while others require you to reach a particular player level. With that said, here are all the Operators in the game and the ways to get them.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-all-operators-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock all Operators in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are a total of <strong>21 Operators</strong> present in Black Ops 6 divided between two Factions – Rogue Black Ops and Crimson One. Here’s how you can unlock them:</p>

<p>The AS VAL is one of the meta rifles you can use in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> right now. However, to get the best out of the AR, you must use the right attachments, Perks, and Equipment to make it a force to be reckoned with.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-as-val-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best AS VAL loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Vertical Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag II</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Assault Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Balanced Stock</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li>
</ul>



<p>Starting off with the <strong>Vertical Foregrip</strong>, this attachment will reduce the horizontal recoil of the weapon, making it easier to control. The base AS VAL comes with only 20 bullets so attaching the <strong>Extended Mag II</strong> is crucial to increase its magazine size. Although it will reduce your Sprint to Fire speed a little, The <strong>Assault Grip</strong> will compensate for it well.</p>



<p>Attach the <strong>Balanced Stock</strong> for maximum mobility as it enhances Aim Walking, Hipfire, and Strafing Movement speeds. Lastly, use <strong>Recoil Springs</strong> for an additional improvement in recoil control.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-equipment-for-as-val">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for AS VAL</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Tracker</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Cold-Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Tactical Insertion</li>
</ul>



<p>The Perks suggested above allow you to be a stealthy but fatal rifler in-game. <strong>Ghost</strong> perk will leave you undetected by Scout Pulse or UAV while moving, planting, defusing, or using Scorestreaks. <strong>Tracker</strong> will let you see enemy footsteps, which is useful for locating and hunting them down.</p>



<p><strong>Cold-Blooded</strong> also leaves you undetected under thermal optics. Using these perks will activate the Recon specialty which lets you see enemies through walls for a short duration.</p>



<p>By the time you unlock the AS VAL, you will also unlock the <strong>Perk Greed</strong> Wildcard at level 54. Use that to equip <strong>Gung-Ho</strong> in the fourth Perk slot to improve your normal and Tactical Sprinting speeds while reloading or using Equipment.</p>



<p>Keep the <strong>Semtex</strong> for guaranteed kills while playing Hardpoint or Search and Destroy and the <strong>Stim Shot</strong> will always come in handy for quick health top-ups. For the Field Upgrade, you can use the <strong>Tactical Insertion</strong> for custom spawn points in the map.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-as-val">Best Secondary for AS VAL</h2>



<p>The Stryder .22 and GS45 would be the ideal secondary weapon options for the AS VAL.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-as-val-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock AS VAL in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The AS VAL unlocks once you <strong>reach player level 55</strong>. This is not the fastest unlock in the game and will take some time, but it’s worth the effort and time you put in.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-as-val-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the AS VAL any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, the AS VAL is one of the meta Assault Rifles in Black Ops 6 that’s great for combat at all ranges. Although it comes with a higher recoil than most of the other guns in this class, its fast TTK and high mobility easily set it apart from the rest.</p>



<p>Use the attachments suggested above to reduce the recoil significantly and you’ll be good to dominate multiplayer lobbies.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-as-val-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the AS VAL in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/">XM4</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ames-85-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/">AMES 85</a> are two of the best alternatives to the AS VAL in BO6. While the XM4 is considered a meta weapon along with the AS VAL right now, the AMES 85 also packs a punch with low recoil and high bullet velocity.</p>
