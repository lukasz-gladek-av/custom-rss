<p>The FTC has announced that the ‘first wave’ of refunds resulting from a $245 million fine to Epic Games <span>is being distributed&nbsp;<strong>now</strong>. In March 2023, Epic Games was ordered to pay back players ‘duped’ into spending money by mistake, and the first round of refunds—totalling $72 million—has</span> started being handed out.</p>



<p>When the dust had settled in the FTC vs. Fortnite case, the gaming titan was found to have been promoting a ‘counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration’ that subsequently led to millions of players making purchases they didn’t want.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-are-you-owed-a-fortnite-refund">Are You Owed a Fortnite Refund?</h2>



<p>In recent years, the United States Federal Trade Commission has been hot on these tactics, which typically involve ‘clever placement’ of buttons and prompts to encourage users to buy things in digital stores without them necessarily meaning to.</p>



<p>The FTC claimed that Epic Games was knowingly allowing children to ‘rack up unauthorised charges without any parental involvement’. It’s not the first company to adopt these tactics, nor will it be the last, but it’s one of the firms hit the hardest by legal action pursued by the Federal Trade Commission.</p>



<p>By way of a resolution, Epic Games agreed to discontinue the use of these shady tactics, and it noted that it would put in place a prompt requesting consent from the consumer before making any purchase. </p>



<p>Next week, 629,344 customers will be refunded an average of $114 – and this is just the first stop of the refund train.</p>

<p>Shopify Rebellion has burst onto the Rainbow Six Siege scene after assuming control of the former Soniqs roster.</p>



<p>It was revealed three days ago by Seth ‘supr’ Hoffman that Soniqs ‘no longer wished to invest in Rainbow Six’ and that the whole team was being unceremoniously booted to the curb. This now means that Surf, Ambi, Rexen, Gryxr, and Canadian will represent Shopify Rebellion going forward.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-org-same-squad">New Org, Same Squad</h2>



<p>This is Shopify Rebellion’s first outing in Rainbow Six Siege, and it comes out of the blue after Soniqs was disbanded… Well, out of the blue. Here’s what supr had to say about the change:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I, along with the rest of the Rainbow Six Siege team, are no longer with Soniqs. I was told following the Montreal Major that Soniqs no longer wished to invest in Rainbow Six – a decision that I completely understand – and have decided that my passion for Siege and dedication to the team that I started six years ago is what is most important to me.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Supr also transitioned to Shopify Rebellion and will support the core roster as GM and head coach.</p>



<p>This is a new and powerful arrow in Shopify Rebellion’s quiver. The organisation has had a great year and covers a wide variety of esports titles, from League of Legends to Halo, and from Rocket League to VALORANT.</p>



<p>Heading into February’s Six Invitational in Boston, Shopify Rebellion will have a spot with this newly acquired squad, making the event something of a baptism by fire for the organisation.</p>



<p>Recently in the Rainbow Six space, a touch of bad news hit the Cloud9 Beastcoast roster. M80 acquired <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/m80-acquire-beastcoast-rainbow-six-team-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Beastcoast brand</a> and cast out the Major-winning squad, and now the team is org-less ahead of the Six Invitational.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-updates-will-end-with-season-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rocksteady is officially ending support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. In a post on the <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s official website</a>, it was announced that Season 4 will see the final updates for Suicide Squad moving forward. </p>



<p>Those updates include the addition of Deathstroke along with a new medieval-themed Elseworld, new gear, and an offline mode. The offline mode will be available on December 10 alongside the rest of Season 4 episode 7.</p>



<p>“Offline mode will allow you to experience content released for the game, including the main story campaign and all seasonal story mission content, without an internet connection,” Rocksteady said. “To access Offline mode, you can either create a new profile by starting from the beginning of the game or create a copy of your existing Online profile, allowing you to jump in with all of your progress.”</p>



<p>The final Suicide Squad update will come with Episode 8 in January 2025. That wraps up the promised full year of updates for the game from Rocksteady and Warner Bros. Games.</p>



<p>Despite the updates ending, Rocksteady says that all online features will remain available, including online co-op and all previous seasonal/episodic content. It’s unclear if critical support updates will still come after regular updates are over.</p>



<p>The ending of updates for Suicide Squad brings to a close a controversial era for Rocksteady and Warner Bros. Games. After being delayed into 2024, the game launched with issues that causes it to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-pulls-suicide-squad-just-one-hour-into-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temporarily pulled in early access</a>. From there, Warner Bros. Games revealed that not only did the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-reportedly-says-suicide-squad-fell-short-of-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perform below expectations</a>, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-cost-warner-bros-200-million-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost them $200 million</a> in revenue.</p>



<p>Rocksteady even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwent a round of layoffs</a> after the launch of the game.</p>
