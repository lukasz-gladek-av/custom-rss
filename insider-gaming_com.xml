<p>The promised Schedule 1 April 7 update has arrived. TVGS—the game’s solo developer—has added many new features, including handy new Pawn and Boutique shops as the game enters a new beta test. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> aptly has a lot of content logged in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> diary. Developer TVGS has lots of ideas and ways to keep its cornucopia of kingpins coming back for more. It’s probably for the best as they fend off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infringement claims</a> from rival title Drug Dealer Simulator—although it’s reported there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-rival-drug-dealer-simulator-says-there-is-no-lawsuit-amid-review-bombing-investigation-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no lawsuit</a>.</p>



<p>Either way, a new update has dropped. It expands on Schedule 1’s foundations and is only a snippet of what’s to come.</p>

<h3 id="h-pawn-shop-interior-and-functionality-added">Pawn Shop Interior and Functionality Added</h3>



<p>There are already a fair few buildings in Schedule 1. But they won’t stop being built as a new Pawn Shop is open where: “You can now <strong>sell pretty much anything (excluding product)</strong> to Mick at the pawn shop.”</p>



<p>Your <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-the-best-starter-weed-recipe-to-sell-in-schedule-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best weed</a> needs to wait for customers, unfortunately. But anything else you can get your hands on is fair game. It’s a good way to make extra cash to spend on new items.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-boujee-boutique-awaits">A Boujee Boutique Awaits</h3>



<p>Also included in the April 7 Schedule 1 update is the new “Bleuballs Boutique.” I’m choosing my words carefully here, but if you’re old enough to play Schedule 1, there’s already a good chance you know the meaning behind the store’s name.</p>



<p>I’ll avoid this topic like the plague and say it’s another fab addition to the game. You can find expensive jewelry watches here, and it’s best that you make some money at the Pawn Shop or by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-calculator-guide-how-to-maximise-profits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maximizing your profits</a> before buying anything!</p>

<p>Hades 2 fans desperate for the game’s full launch can only pick it up on Nintendo Switch 2 at release. It’s currently locked in as a Switch 2 console exclusive for the time being, with a PlayStation and Xbox launch coming later.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-nintendo-switch-2-release-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 exclusives</a> keep coming. We’re still reeling from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct where the bombshell dropped that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fromsoftwares-new-game-a-bloodborne-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FromSoftware’s next game</a>—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-will-feature-8-player-pvpve-multiplayer-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Duskbloods</a>—is a Switch 2 exclusive. Now, Supergiant Games has revealed Hades 2’s full release is closing in, and its first port of call on console is the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Again, it’s a timed exclusive, but this is still big for Hades 2 and Switch fans.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Shocking. Credit to Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo of America X channel</a> posted a video on April 8 about Hades 2 and its journey. The media clip is an interesting developer walkthrough, and an insight into the much-hyped sequel and its progress.</p>



<p>What you don’t expect is a message toward the end of the video saying: “<strong>Hades 2 Launching first for consoles on Nintendo Switch 2. More information coming later this year.</strong>“</p>







<p>Hades 2 has been in Early Access on PC since 2024. Supergiant Games has been honing the roguelike sequel, tightening up the mechanics, and making sure it lives up to the expectations of its Game-of-the-Year-winning predecessor. </p>



<p>You’re going to have to wait a bit longer to see how powerful Melinoe is if you’re on PlayStation or Xbox Series X|S.</p>
