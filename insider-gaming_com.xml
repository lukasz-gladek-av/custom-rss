<p>STALKER 2 has been on the market for three days, and it seems that for every person ranting about the game, there’s someone there singing the title’s praises. It’s a divisive game, that’s for sure – but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in my review</a>, I gave it a 9/10 and recommended gamers everywhere invest at least a little time in the post-apocalyptic epic.</p>



<p>GSC Game World is hard at work patching up the game, addressing the bugs that have caused some users to leave negative reviews or order refunds of the game that took more than a decade to piece together.</p>



<p>The next update is said to be a doozy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changes-incoming">Changes Incoming</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455843903878203415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on Steam</a>, GSC Game World revealed that the next STALKER 2 update is a hefty one. It’s going to target some of the stickiest issues players have been dealing with since the game was released on November 20 on Xbox and PC.</p>



<p>This includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Issue and memory allocation failures (PC)</li>



<li>Main quest progression fixes (game-breaking bugs)</li>



<li>Gameplay balancing and adjustments (trader prices and NPC behaviour)</li>



<li>Cutscene fixes (facial animations and clipping)</li>



<li>‘Softlock’ fixes (menu freezing)</li>



<li>UI improvements (quest notifications, interaction prompts)</li>
</ul>



<p>In a future update, the team will work on ironing out bugs in the ‘A-Life’ system that powers the game’s AI-driven NPCs. It has been a notorious issue since the game dropped, with the intelligent, realistic AI that was promised not having been delivered.</p>



<p>GSC will also work to address controller-based issues, such as dead zone bug fixes.</p>



<p>In a statement, the team said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want to reassure you once more that we will make every effort to constantly improve your S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl experience. We are truly grateful for your feedback and suggestions for improvement.</p>

<p>Dr Disrespect, the disgraced content creator who found himself at the centre of a dire scandal in recent months, has teased a departure from YouTube in favour of Rumble, a competing platform.</p>



<p>It all started with a new ‘DrDisrespect’ profile cropping up on Rumble, which according to <a href="https://streamscharts.com/platforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">StreamsCharts.com</a> is the sixth largest streaming site by viewer numbers. From there, Rumble’s CEO posted a cryptic message on social media that many saw as a connection to Dr Disrespect.</p>



<p>This move has come from Dr Disrespect’s failure to regain monetisation on YouTube, which he lost when he admitted to using Twitch to inappropriately message a minor in 2017.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-home-same-old-doc">New Home, Same Old Doc</h2>



<p>Rumble’s CEO has been flying in the face of controversy, refusing to acknowledge Dr Disrespect’s wrongdoing and seemingly teasing the scandalous creator’s impending arrival several times on social media. In a post on October 26, Chris Pavlovski, Rumble’s CEO, said that he’s securing the ‘biggest gaming streamer’ with a contract in 2025.</p>



<p>At the end of <a href="https://x.com/layer_cake/status/1860133482930094342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dr Disrespect’s most recent stream</a>, the veteran creator faded out with a cryptic sequence. His broadcast dropped to bars and tones before pivoting to a loading screen that read ‘Connection Redirected’. </p>



<p>Fans and critics alike have surmised that Dr Disrespect is about to announce a move to Rumble which could kickstart in 2025.</p>



<p>In June, the infamous streamer admitted to messaging a minor on Twitch several years ago but stressed that nothing criminal took place and that the business was long since settled. Regardless, he lost the support of hundreds of thousands of followers, had ties with other content creators cut, and was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-studio-cut-ties-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped by sponsorship partners</a>.</p>



<p>Despite the scandal, he returned to streaming in September and pulled in substantial numbers, with his core following standing firm in the face of blatant issues.</p>

<p>Intel is preparing to reveal its next generation of graphics cards, and it looks like some early specs have been leaked thanks to a, now removed, store listing.</p>



<p>Amazon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gxp8e0/amazon_has_leaked_a_few_intel_arc_b580_gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">accidently listed</a>, then removed, what appeared to be two Intel Battlemage GPUs from ASRock. According to the store listing, the Intel Arc B580 features 12GB of GDDR6 memory with a speed of 19Gbps. The card also features a 192-bit memory bus which would result in a 456 GB/s or so bandwidth.</p>







<p>A couple interesting bits from the listing were the cards being PCIe x8 only as opposed to x16. Regarding boost frequency, the listing suggested a 2.8 GHz boost frequency compared to a 2.0 GHz from the Arc A580.</p>



<p>When reached for comment in the past, Intel has declined to comment on any rumor or speculation. That said, a store listing adds credence to rumors that an announcement of their new graphics cards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was set to come in December</a>.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Intel Arc B580</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GPU</td><td>Battlemage BGM-G21</td></tr><tr><td>GPU Clock Speed</td><td>2.8 GHz</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>12GB GDDR6</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Bus</td><td>192-bit</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Speed</td><td>19 Gbps</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Bandwidth</td><td>456 GB/s</td></tr><tr><td>PCIe</td><td>5.0 x8</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
