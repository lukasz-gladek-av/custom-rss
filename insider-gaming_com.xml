<p>GOG’s Managing Director, Maciej Gołębiewski, has opened up about the current state of the gaming industry and the rise of always-online games, noting that it’s essential to discuss preservation and what a proper end-of-life cycle looks like in the current industry.</p>



<p>As more multiplayer games adopt always-online models, players are increasingly facing the reality that servers do not remain online forever. When games fail to meet developer expectations, some are shut down abruptly, even while they still have active communities. EA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/anthem-servers-to-be-shut-down-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently took Anthem’s servers offline</a> seven years after launch, and the company stated in its FAQ that because the game was designed to require an online connection, it is no longer playable.</p>



<h2 id="h-gog-s-managing-director-expresses-concern">GOG’s Managing Director Expresses Concern</h2>



<p>Digital storefront GOG is very dedicated to game preservation and launched a program in 2024 to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gog-launches-game-preservation-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">preserve classic titles.</a> Now, GOG’s Maciej Gołębiewski is weighing in on what preservation looks like in the modern age of always-online games, telling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-weighs-complicated-riddle-of-multiplayer-game-preservation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer </a>that he’s afraid there may be fewer games for gamers to play in the future because of the expectation of maintaining servers for decades.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“If we put too many barriers on game creators and what the end-of-life cycle looks like, we might get fewer games,” he said, “because people will be scared of ‘okay now I need to put up the funds to create it, promote it, and then upkeep it for 10 years, 20 years, because the regulator said so’. That might in turn cause there to be fewer cool games for gamers. I don’t have the perfect answer yet, but it’s good that the discussion is taking place.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>In one example of an attempt to address this problem, The Crew 2 recently received an update that introduced a hybrid mode and enabled offline play, hopefully ensuring long-term access to the game. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-crew-2-gets-offline-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Almost Copied Escape from Tarkov’s Flea Market]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-copy-tarkov-flea-market/</link>
            <guid>1409035</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has almost nothing in the way of peer-to-peer trading, unlike the leading extraction game in the space. At the top of the table sits Escape from Tarkov, but it’s fast being rivalled by Embark Studios’ new <strong>extraction adventure </strong>game that was released in October 2025.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, Embark Studios planned to closely rival Escape from Tarkov with one major mechanic: an in-game ‘auction house’. With this, players would have been able to buy and sell items for tokens, trading with other players as they saw fit. The feature was ultimately scrapped, but why?</p>







<h2 id="h-why-does-arc-raiders-not-have-trading">Why Does ARC Raiders Not Have Trading?</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders players are free to venture into Speranza’s storefronts and secure all kinds of items. They can buy explosives, weapons, crafting materials, augments, healing items, and <strong>much more</strong>. But that’s where the trading system in ARC Raiders ends, and for some, it’s to the detriment of the game.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction game that has been around for a decade, operates a ‘Flea Market’ that players can use to buy and sell almost anything to other players. It’s a core part of the game, and it makes some things, like building kits, completing quests, and securing rare items, <strong>much easier</strong>.</p>



<p>Fans of the all-new extraction game from Embark Studios have often wondered why there’s no Flea Market mechanic in ARC Raiders, and in a recent interview, it was revealed that <strong>it almost happened</strong>.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-almost-had-an-auction-house-like-escape-from-tarkov-but-embark-nixed-it-because-the-game-became-just-about-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>, Virgil Watkins, design lead on ARC Raiders, explained that an auction house <strong>nearly </strong>surfaced in the full game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re not building an auction house or anything like that. Currently, I think it’s more leaning into the aspect of social facilitation in that sense of our design.</p>



<p>We put a lot of very, very deliberate effort into making the game about the items. We previously explored and even partially built a trading system like an auction house. But what it ended up doing is it turned the game into just being about coins.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>ARC Raiders thrives on RNG loot, and that means that no two raids are guaranteed to be the same. Every new room, every box opened is a fresh opportunity, and that sense of finding something rare in a container offers a sizeable dopamine hit for players. The ability to saunter into a P2P trading platform and just <strong>buy that thing </strong>negates that feeling entirely.</p>



<p>There’s also a keen focus on building workbenches and crafting items in ARC Raiders, and while you can do that in Escape from Tarkov, and <strong>must </strong>to complete some tasks, having the Flea Market there takes away from the importance of crafting a little.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games, Escape from Tarkov’s developer, has spent <strong>years </strong>tuning the Flea Market and trying to balance it. When the game hit 1.0 in November, it came with an optimization that locked down much of the trading function until players reached certain level milestones.</p>



<p>For instance, you can’t trade <strong>keys </strong>until you’re at least level 25 in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Perhaps ARC Raiders can one day take on peer-to-peer trading as a way for players to lighten their load or spend an excess of cash on things they want but can’t find. For now, it remains an issue that kind of promotes RMT (real-money trading), and that’s another problem for ARC Raiders fans everywhere.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Teases Far Cry 60 FPS Update For THREE Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-teases-far-cry-60-fps-updates/</link>
            <guid>1409029</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s Far Cry team has posted an image on social media that clearly teases (and essentially confirms) the imminent arrival of 60 FPS updates for Far Cry 3, Far Cry: Blood Dragon, and Far Cry: Primal. While fans wait patiently for news about the next major Far Cry release, this is a welcome tidbit to surface, even if some of these updates are coming <strong>more than a decade </strong>after the games were released.</p>



<p>The newest game in the collection is Far Cry: Primal, a unique release that was released in February 2016. It puts players in control of a tribal warrior in a prehistoric era – ‘caveman times’.</p>







<h2 id="h-major-far-cry-updates-coming-soon">Major Far Cry Updates Coming Soon</h2>



<p>It’s not exactly hard to decode the image posted by the Far Cry social team recently. The strings of emojis aren’t enigmatic enough to require a code breaker. See for yourself:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you know Far Cry, it’s easy to decode the suggestions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Far Cry + Jungle + Six Tea + Frame Pair Time = ?</li>



<li>Far Cry + Blood Dragon + Six Tee + Film Pear Time = ?</li>



<li>Far Cry + Primate + Six Tea + Frame Purr Time = ?</li>
</ul>



<p>In the comments under the post, one user wrote, ‘Far Cry 3 60 FPS update PLEASE,’ to which Ubisoft’s team simply responded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I mean… it’s pretty clear what (it) is, no?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When one user decoded the messages, Ubisoft was pretty clear in their confirmation:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s not clear if the updates will come with any other tweaks or optimizations, but who knows? Far Cry is in a bit of a slump right now, with the last game, Far Cry 6, having been the worst-received game in the series. This year will mark the game’s fifth anniversary, and fans are hungry for more.</p>



<p>Early in 2025, it was reported exclusively by Insider Gaming that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/">Ubisoft’s extraction-based multiplayer</a> title set in the Far Cry universe had been <strong>rebooted</strong> after failing to impress in internal reviews. It was going to be set in Alaska and would put players against the harsh environment, wildlife, and enemy players, but that was all pulled back for an assessment.</p>



<p>That’s in addition to Far Cry 7, known as Project Blackbird, which remains in development.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-player-count-soar/</link>
            <guid>1409026</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s no big secret that Deadpool is one of the most beloved Marvel characters of all time. The loud-mouthed mercenary is a fan-favorite through and through, which is why there was so much buzz around his arrival in Marvel Rivals, the sensational hero shooter with a star-studded line-up.</p>



<p>On Friday, January 16, Marvel Rivals’ sixth season of content went live, introducing Deadpool as a playable hero. The move caused players to <strong>flock back </strong>to the game, pushing the player count higher than it has been in <strong>nine months</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-deadpool-pulls-in-players-in-marvel-rivals">Deadpool Pulls in Players in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>Yesterday, Marvel Rivals hit 200,027 players on Steam, the highest the count has risen since April 14, 2025, and the release of season two.  Every time a major update drops in Marvel Rivals, it’s accompanied by a small increase in player traffic, but nothing moved the ticker up quite like Deadpool has.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The sixth season of content in Marvel Rivals is more than just Deadpool, of course, including new controller settings, an improved photo mode, enhanced hero ‘Proficiency’, and a stack of new bundles in the store. With every new season also comes a fresh battle pass, so more reasons to dive back in and get to the Marvel Rivals grind.</p>



<p>This season brings a new limited-time event, some adjustments to existing modes, a fresh round of Twitch Drops for viewers watching their favorite streamers, and a whole host of fixes and optimizations.</p>



<p>The introduction to this season’s patch notes was ‘written by’ Deadpool himself:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Deadpool here, hijacking the patch notes because, let’s face it, nobody reads these unless you need to know if your main got nerfed. Then you whine that there are no balance updates here, and some random internet person tells you what you really want is the Balance Post, not the Patch Notes. I see you, internet people! </strong></p>



<p><strong>Well, guess what? Season 6 is almost here! (They took this long to add me!? Who came before, oh Gambit &amp; Rogue… together? #$%&amp; that!) Anyways, I’m here, I’m playable, and I’m ready to make the Collector’s Museum wilder than a taco truck at a biker rally.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>There are still plenty of adored characters for NetEase to lean on for Marvel Rivals, so the train is far from running out of steam. Deadpool might be the hottest new character yet in Marvel Rivals, but he’s nowhere near the last.</p>
