<p>Rogue is the next character set to arrive in Marvel Rivals on December 12 with Season 5.5, and the developers have provided the usual glimpse of her vanguard moves in a new trailer. </p>







<p>Anna Marie, or more commonly known as Rogue, is perhaps one of the most beloved members of the X-Men in the Marvel fandom. Partnered with her <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-gambit-voice-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved Gambit</a>, fans have been wanting to see her inclusion for a long time, and to see her as a vanguard is just the cherry on top. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>At first glance, Rogue looks poised to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-november-20-update-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shake up the meta</a> in a completely unique way. She’s built primarily as a close-quarters brawler, diving into the thick of the fight and dealing impressive damage up close. But she’s far from limited to melee—she can yank enemies toward her and chip away at anyone caught within her damaging aura.</p>



<p>The real show-stealer, though, is her ability to borrow powers from other heroes. Whoever she drains, she can temporarily wield their abilities as if they were her own. The trailer highlights just how versatile this can be: Psylocke’s invisibility, Thor’s lightning strikes—it all becomes part of Rogue’s toolkit, giving her the potential to dominate the battlefield like no other Vanguard.</p>







<p>Her Ultimate amplifies things even further, letting her batter nearby foes while shielding herself and unleashing heavy, punishing blows. A new Vanguard is always an exciting addition to Marvel Rivals, but Rogue looks ready to steal the spotlight in every sense.</p>



<p>It’s always been the season of Rogue and Gambit, and the notorious couple are finally paired together in-game. What do you think of Rogue’s vanguard abilities in Marvel Rivals?

<p>Cyberpunk Trading Card Game (TCG) has been officially announced, featuring characters from Cyberpunk 2077 and Edgerunners. </p>



<p>CD Projekt Red has been hard at work developing the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, even revealing its plans to expand the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-adds-50-new-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development foundation by 2027</a>. However, nobody knew they were working on a physical-only trading card game for the franchise, with an announcement popping up out of nowhere. </p>

<p>In Cyberpunk TCG, players will be tasked with putting together their ultimate edgerunner team by collecting characters from the franchise and putting them up against their friends. Players will receive “stunning custom artwork” with characters from both the base game, Cyberpunk 2077, and the anime adaptation, Edgerunners. The official announcement on <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1998407444121243803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) also arrived with a new trailer, showcasing the type of cards players should expect. </p>
