            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kick%E2%80%99s-streaming-performance-soared-in-2024-report-reveals.1057995/</guid>

<p>In a new breakdown published by StreamsCharts, it was revealed that Kick.com underwent monumental growth through 2024. It’s only the platform’s second year in the business, but it’s already making waves and proving that it could be a legitimate contender to both Twitch and YouTube.</p>



<p>As YouTube is seemingly moving away from supporting live streamers in favour of short-form content, could there be a hole for Kick to step into and truly rival Twitch?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers-in-2024">Big Numbers in 2024</h2>



<p>In 2024, Kick’s hours watched metric skyrocketed by 142% to <strong>2.1 billion</strong>. The platform’s peak viewer count also swelled, hitting lofty heights of <strong>1.75 million</strong>, a 79.7% improvement year-on-year.</p>



<p>These metrics were aggregated and revealed <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/kicks-second-year-recap-viewership-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by StreamsCharts recently</a>.</p>



<p>It has been a busy year for Kick.com, with the platform moving more into the esports space, expanding into fresh and key regions, and some more big names being signed to the site.</p>



<p>The year-end metrics published recently revealed that the site has 933,572 unique channels, which marks a 19% increase over 2023. The average online channel count at any one time is 3,035, up 52% from last year, which shows how many more users are jumping onto and actively using the site.</p>



<p>The average viewer count is the money-maker, though.</p>



<p>It was revealed that Kick’s average viewer count through 2024 sits at around 258,293. That’s a whopping 149% increase over last year’s figure, and it’s fully indicative of the platform’s ongoing success.</p>



<p>However, not <strong>everything </strong>is looking bright for Kick’s future. The site’s second-most popular streamer, Adin Ross, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-leaving-kick-ludwig-back-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently revealed he’s stepping away</a> from Kick indefinitely and trying to move back to Twitch. That’ll have a noticeable impact going into 2025, as this year, the controversial streamer was responsible for 60.5 million watch hours.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals and SVP go hand in hand like Spider-Man and Venom or Groot and Rocket Raccoon. It adds an extra dimension to Rivals’ gameplay—standing out from other hero shooters—but many in the community are unsure of what it means, or how it affects you.</p>



<p>I didn’t see how Marvel Rivals’ launch could fail, and it didn’t. It accumulated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million players in three days</a> and an early <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-first-post-launch-patch-is-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-launch patch</a> made significant improvements. The online shooter has a lot going for it—including a whopping <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-marvel-rivals-achievements-trophies-list-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy and Achievement list</a>—and one thing it adds is SVP.</p>



<p>SVP is something I’d never heard of in an online shooter, but it makes a lot of sense.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-svp-mean-in-marvel-rivals">What does SVP Mean in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>My Spidey senses are tingling on this one. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>SVP stands for Second Valuable Player in Marvel Rivals</strong> <strong>and gives recognition to the best player of the losing team.</strong></p>



<p>I presume you’ve heard the term MVP before, which most people know as “Most Valuable Player.” This applies to gaming, sports, and anything where the value of individuals is judged in a team-based environment. The top-performing participant, in terms of points or a graded display, is awarded the MVP—highlighting their contributions by awarding them for being the best player.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals also has an MVP award, and this is clearly marked at the end of a game where a victory screen indicates the MVP of the lobby by showing their name and most recently used character. Fairly standard stuff so far.</p>



<p>If you look at the final leaderboard at the end of a match though, as well as the winning team’s “MVP,” you should see “SVP” on the opposing side.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-you-get-svp-in-marvel-rivals">How do You Get SVP in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p><strong>To be SVP in Marvel Rivals, you need to be on the defeated team in a match and be the top-performing player of the losing side.</strong></p>



<p>There’s no clearly defined metric or quantitative data to suggest how SVP is measured. However, common sense suggests you need to contribute the most to your team’s effort: </p>



<ul>
<li>Assists</li>



<li>Earning objective points</li>



<li>Few (if any) deaths</li>



<li>Healing teammates</li>



<li>Kills</li>
</ul>



<p>If you consistently hit these five criteria, chances are, you’re in the running for SVP. Sitting at the back of the map and farming kills won’t get the job done. We all hate a teammate not contributing to the objective, so if you want to use Hawkeye with the only intention of padding your kill count and boosting your KD, don’t expect to be SVP.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-svp-do-in-marvel-rivals">What Does SVP do in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p><strong>If you are SVP, you don’t lose ranking points in Marvel Rivals—and this is a big boost to your rank and matchmaking.</strong></p>



<p>Ranked play is all about wins and points. The more wins you get, the more points you earn, and the higher up the leagues you climb. Losing a match is detrimental to ranked progress. On the other hand, if you earn SVP status on the defeated team, your ranking points stay the same. Again, this is a huge deterrent to negative play, and incentives players to get involved and be as useful as possible.</p>



<hr>



<p>Let us know how many times you’ve been SVP and if you think more online shooters should add this. Check out every Marvel Rivals <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-leaked-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked character</a> so far, along with the quickest ways to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-units-in-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get Units</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is CSGO and CS2 Skin Gambling Legal?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal.1057986/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>CSGO and CS2 skin gambling is still a prominent part of the wider Counter-Strike betting market. Instead of betting real money, players can wager the value of skins in their Steam inventory on professional match results and casino-like jackpot games.</p>



<p>The reputations and legitimacy of some of these sites have always been a major debate point within the Counter-Strike community. But is the act of skin gambling itself legal?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-you-gamble-using-cs-skins">Can You Gamble Using CS Skins?</h2>



<p>Gambling using CSGO and CS2 skins is legal, depending on the country or U.S. state you are in. You also have to be 18+ to gamble in any country or state where it is legal.</p>



<p>Up until 2018, it was illegal in the United States to gamble on sports using cash outside of the states of Oregon, Delaware, Montana, and Nevada, under the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992. </p>



<p>Because of this, several sites used skin gambling as a way to navigate around these laws, as virtual items were not prohibited. Even as gambling laws in the U.S. have changed, these laws don’t explicitly cover the gambling of virtual items like skins.</p>



<p>While skin gambling is not illegal, the skin gambling industry has been in the crosshairs of Valve since 2016. Valve was hit with a number of lawsuits in 2016 that were directly tied to various skin gambling sites. </p>



<p>Since then, Valve has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/30/12332802/counter-strike-gambling-crackdown-valve-cease-and-desist-csgo-shuffle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sent several cease and desist letters</a> to dozens of skin gambling sites and threatened them with legal action. The developer has also limited several features through Steam that contribute to skin gambling sites. As a result, many of these sites went dark or closed down completely.</p>



<p>Most sites now don’t let you wager skins directly. Instead, you can sell or trade in these skins for a site-specific currency. Then, you use that currency to either wager on matches or play casino-like games. If you win, you can use your currency to buy new skins or open cases on the site.</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on skin gambling? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>A player found a secret Balatro quest in Cyberpunk 2077, added in the game’s latest update 2.2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on r/balatro by user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1hb9o5d/new_cyberpunk_2077_update_adds_balatro_sidequest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dirtygoodking</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/cyberpunk-2077-2/221017/news/cyberpunk-2077-players-discover-secret-quest-based-on-hit-indie-game-added-with-patch-22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), the new Balatro quest for Cyberpunk 2077 will begin through a message from Jim B. This character will inform V about “a gang of rogue jokers” that have invaded Night City and are plotting and scheming to seize the city’s gambling scene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As soon as you get this message, the players are sent on a collection quest to round up all the Jokers across the city. Once you complete the hidden Balatro quest from Cyberpunk 2077’s patch 2.2, you will be rewarded with a new Joker shirt, and a set of Balatro cards will be displayed at your apartment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Radek Grabowski, the Global PR director at CD Projekt Red, provided <a href="https://x.com/gamebowski/status/1866824502988185901" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">additional information</a> on the quest. Grabowski stated that he had already discussed with the quest design team at CDPR about bringing Balatro cards to Cyberpunk 2077. This was made possible thanks to the help of quest designer Maria Mazur and in-house artist <a href="https://x.com/gamebowski/status/1866853584077459647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Olgierd Ciszak</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles developer Monolith Soft is now a wholly-owned subsidy of Nintendo. </p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-now-owns-100-of-monolith-soft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton Media</a>, Nintendo <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/company/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently acquired</a> the final outstanding shares of Monolith Soft. This comes 17 years after the company first purchased 80% of the shares from Bandai Namco.</p>



<p>Prior to the full share purchase, Nintendo owned 96% percent of the shares. The first 80% came in 2007 while another 16% was purchased from Bandai Namco in 2011. The outstanding 4% were owned by company founders Hirohide Sugiura, Tetsuya Takahashi and Yasuyuki Honne.</p>



<p>It’s unclear when this transaction took place. However, as of <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/media/2024/02/monolithsoft_brochure2024-01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">February 2024</a>, Sugiura, Takahashi, and Honne still owned 4% of the company. That means it clearly happened within the last handful of months.</p>



<p>As far as the future goes, it’s not expected that anything will change. Nintendo has had a controlling stake in the studio for years, and will likely continue on business as usual. What it means, though, is that for the first time since the company was founded in 1999, the original founders will have no official stake in it.</p>



<p>In addition to work on the Xenoblade Chronicles franchise, Monolith has provided support development to games such as Animal  Crossing: New Horizons and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p>
