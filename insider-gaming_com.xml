<p>Microsoft has apologised to users who were facing login issues during the Flight Simulators 2024 launch.</p>



<p>Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator, Jorg Neumann apologised during the Developer Launch Day Update video uploaded to their official YouTube channel.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, the excitement, we knew the excitement was high for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, but frankly, we completely underestimated how was high and it has really overwhelmed our infrastructure,” he said. </p>



<p>He later continued, “Again, while it was a great launch day, we know a lot of people are frustrated, we are really sorry, we want to apologise, this video, we made it to be as transparent and as honest as possible.”</p>



<p>Asobo’s Sebastian Wloch&nbsp;went into more detail on the issues, citing that the team had tested up to 200,000 concurrent players, but that launch day exceeded that player count. </p>



<p>“We are doing our best and going as fast as we can to make sure everybody can go in,” he said. Even players who do make it into the game may find that some content, such as specific planes, is missing and this is connected to the same server issues, Wloch continued.</p>



<p>You can watch the full explanation of the launch day issues on the official YouTube channel below.</p>

<p>Following reports that Sony was in talks to acquire FromSoftware’s parent company Kadokawa, Kadokawa has confirmed that Sony has expressed interest in acquiring the company.</p>



<p>The update comes following mass media reports, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-buy-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originated from Reuters</a>, that talks between the companies were ongoing. </p>



<p>The full statement reads, “There are some articles on the acquisition of KADOKAWA Corporation (hereinafter “the Company”) by Sony Group Inc. However, this information is not announced by the Company. The Company has received an initial letter of intent to acquire the Company’s shares, but no decision has been made at this time. If there are any facts that should be announced in the future, we will make an announcement in a timely and appropriate manner.”</p>



<p>Presently, Kadokawa owns a 70% stake in FromSoftware, and Sony has around a 14% share. Rolling it up, Sony already has a 2% stake in Kadokawa Corporation, but other gaming titans, like Tencent, also own a piece of the company.</p>



<p>It’s unclear at what stage the talks are currently at, so if the desire for the acquisition is successful, it could be a while before any announcement is made.</p>
