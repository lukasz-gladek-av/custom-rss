<p>Everyone has a one or a few personal favorite heroes they lock in to win in Marvel Rivals, but the win rate data says that some are just plain better than others. While a higher win rate doesn’t automatically mean they’re a better hero, it’s certainly nothing to scoff at or take likely.</p>



<p>So which heroes in Marvel Rivals win the most? Let’s take a look at the top performing heroes according to win rate.</p>



<h2 id="h-hero-win-rates-in-marvel-rivals-march-2025-season-1-5">Hero Win Rates in Marvel Rivals (March 2025, Season 1.5)</h2>



<p>Similar to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-popular-marvel-rivals-heroes-highest-pick-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our highest pick rates piece</a>, we’re taking into account competitive and quick play. For competitive play , we’re using current data from tracker sites&nbsp;<a href="https://rivalstracker.com/heroes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsTracker</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://rivalsmeta.com/characters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsMeta</a>. For quickplay, we’re using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hero Hot List</a>&nbsp;from the official Marvel Rivals website. Even though the Hero Hot List was last updated February 17th, it’s a better source of quickplay rates than the incomplete data on RivalsTracker and RivalsMeta.</p>

<p>The Human Torch and The Thing have not been included because the quickplay win rates for them are not available yet.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-strategists">Best Strategists</h3>



<h4 id="h-rocket-raccoon">Rocket Raccoon</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Rocket Raccoon’s sheer healing output and duelist-buffing teamup options establish him as the winningest strategist. He has a <strong>54.04% win rate in competitive, and a 55.23% win rate in quick play</strong>. His secondary fire healing can rapidly heal a group of allies stacked together, and both Punisher and Winter Soldier thrive when teamed with him. His damage amplifying ultimate also swings any teamfight in his side’s favor.</p>



<h4 id="h-mantis">Mantis</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mantis’ ability to provide healing and damage buffs, plus her individual firepower, make her on the same winning level as Rocket Raccoon. She has a <strong>53.99% win rate in competitive, and a 55.85% win rate in quick play</strong>. Mantis is especially strong at lower ranks, as her heals and buffs are easy to apply. She can also use her sleep and a personal damage boost to solo kill a squishy DPS that tries to challenge her.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-vanguards">Best Vanguards</h3>



<h4 id="h-peni-parker">Peni Parker</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Peni Parker is the winningest vanguard hero in Marvel Rivals. She has a <strong>52.44% win rate in competitive, and a 54.82% win rate in quick play</strong>. Peni has arguably the best ranged damage capabilities of any vanguard, and she’s an infuriating nuisance to dig out of an objective once they get their mines down.</p>



<h4 id="h-thor">Thor</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Thor has the second highest win rates of any vanguard in Marvel Rivals. He has a <strong>52.15% win rate in competitive, and a 54.71% win rate in quick play</strong>. Thor’s ability to close the distance and thrive in the chaos of a hectic teamfight translate into huge winning potential.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-duelists">Best Duelists</h3>



<h4 id="h-storm">Storm</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Storm is the winningest hero in all of Marvel Rivals. She has a <strong>54.29% win rate in competitive, and a 58.11% win rate in quick play</strong>. Storm is a mobile, hard-to-hit, damage-dealing menace that can lead a teamfight with her thunderous Goddess Boost. There’s virtually no escape from her Omega Hurricane ultimate, especially when she can combo it with The Human Torch.</p>



<h4 id="h-magik">Magik</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Magik is the second most winning duelist in Marvel Rivals. She has a <strong>52.60% win rate in competitive, and a 53.14% win rate in quick play</strong>. Magik is one of the few pure melee characters in the duelist class, dashing through portals and swinging her sword at anything in range.</p>

<p>Warhorse Studios has published patch 1.2 in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, the stellar open-world RPG that was released last month. This update is gargantuan, coming in at a whopping 62 GB on PC – and comparable sizes on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox. It adds a few nice touches to the game but, more importantly, addresses <strong>more than 1,000 bug fixes</strong>.</p>



<p>Check out the key inclusions of patch 1.2 in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kcd2-1-2-patch-notes">KCD2 1.2 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>I’m not going to list the <strong>full patch notes </strong>for the 1.2 patch for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, or we’d be here all day.</p>



<p>Instead, I’ll invite you to hop over to Warhorse Studios’ site to <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">check the full breakdown</a> of the 1,000+ bug fixes, improvements, and quality-of-life adjustments.</p>



<p>At the top of the table with patch 1.2 sits the addition of the barber mode, which players can take advantage of in Zhelejov and Kuttenberg. With this new feature, you can adjust Henry’s hair and beard, further customising him as you see fit. It’s purely a cosmetic upgrade, though – it doesn’t have any bearing on the game itself.</p>



<p>Here are some of the key bug fixes addressed in the 1.2 patch for Kingdom Come 2:</p>



<ul>
<li>Players no longer die randomly after exiting a cart (very important stuff)</li>



<li>Multi-hit combos will now do more damage</li>



<li>Difficulty has been balanced across pickpocketing, lockpicking, stealth, bartering, and more</li>



<li>NPC daily schedules have been improved across the entire game (including tweaking the <strong>sweeping </strong>animation!)</li>



<li>‘Generally improved’ environment across both maps, including improving the look of Trosky Castle from further away</li>



<li>Improved road magnetism when riding a horse</li>



<li>Improved frame rate and performance in battles and built-up areas like Kuttenberg’s marketplaces</li>



<li>Shops no longer sell cobwebs (damn)</li>



<li>DLSS 4 Super Resolution can be enabled</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, even the full patch notes stress that hundreds of other fixes aren’t mentioned in the report. This is one of the single biggest updates I’ve ever seen for the sheer number of issues it addresses. I can’t possibly think what might remain in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 that would need patching in the next update!</p>



<p>Have you played Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 yet? Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>
