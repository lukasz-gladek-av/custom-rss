<p>Konami officially confirmed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater at PlayStation’s State of Play event yesterday. As you wait for the game, here is a guide on the minimum and recommended system requirements for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater on PC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is a remake of the hit 2004 title, featuring the original story, characters, voice acting, gameplay, and music. The rest of the game has been built from the ground up for modern consoles, featuring cutscenes with new life, expansive stages, and new graphics for jungles, forests, and more. Characters also have better details, with even facial wrinkles, pores, and iris movements becoming visible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have also upgraded the MGS 3 remake’s battle system, so players will see wear and tear on Snake’s clothes, bruises and bullet wounds will appear on the body, and serious injuries will remain permanently.&nbsp;</p>







<p>To best experience Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eaters’ visual enhancements, the developers have revealed a set minimum and recommended PC system requirements. However, players should note that 16 GB of RAM, 100GB of SSD storage, and DirectX 12 are compulsory for both presets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Check out Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater PC’s minimum and recommended specifications, as listed on the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam listing</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-nbsp">Minimum&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The minimum requirements for MGS 3: Snake Eater are more demanding than those for recent games. As the bare minimum, players need an Intel i5-8600 or AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and RTX 2060 Super (8GB) GPU. These specifications will let players run Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater at 1080p/30fps.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Specifications</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Minimum Requirements </strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">Intel i5-8600 or AMD Ryzen 5 3600</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">RTX 2060 Super (8GB)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">RAM</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">100 GB SSD Storage</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">OS</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 id="h-recommended-nbsp">Recommended&nbsp;</h3>



<p>With the recommended specifications, players can run Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater at 1080p/60fps. However, they will need some upgrades, with the CPU increasing to Intel i7-8700K or AMD Ryzen 5 3600 and the GPU increasing to RTX 3080.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Specifications</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Minimum Requirements </strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">Intel i7-8700K or AMD Ryzen 5 3600</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">RTX 3080</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">RAM</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">100 GB SSD Storage</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">OS</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>After getting a new trailer during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play</a> on Wednesday, the launch roster for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has made its way online.</p>



<p>As first spotted by <a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/news/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds-to-have-largest-sonic-racer-roster-including-sage-will-have-sega-characters-r2817/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sonic Stadium</a>, the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds roster briefly appeared online before it was removed. The game will launch with 23 characters from the series’ history, including:</p>



<ul>

<p>There will also be 24 “main tracks” with 15 CrossWorlds that require Travel Rings to go to. Players will have 45 “unique original vehicles” to choose from for their races with 23 different power ups available to help you win the race.</p>







<p>A release date for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds hasn’t been announced, but when it releases, the game will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</p>



<p><a href="https://asia.sega.com/SonicRacingCrossWorlds/en/ClosedNetworkTest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A closed network test</a> is currently scheduled for February 21-23.</p>

<p>Embracer held its Q3 FY2025 earnings call on Thursday, and with it came high praise from CEO Lars Wingefors for the recently released Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. As part of his <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q3-october-december-2024-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-1175-million-above-management-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">prepared remarks</a> for the call, Wingefors said that the game’s launch success is a  “reminder” to the company about creating “great products”.</p>



<p>“The success of&nbsp;Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;is a reminder of our core – to bring great products to the market,” the Embracer CEO said. “High-quality teams need to have the resources and the time to execute their visions.</p>



<p>“When you have right teams, this trust benefits everyone, including gamers, employees and shareholders. I am convinced that we will remain among the industry leaders in our core business verticals in the future.”</p>







<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is one of the more successful titles from Embracer in recent memory. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over a million copies</a> in its first day, and, according to the publisher, is “fast approaching 2 million”.</p>



<p>Developer Warhorse Studios recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its post-launch plans</a> for the game, including free updates such as horse racing and hardcore mode. There are also three planned expansions coming to the game over the next year. Lastly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modding-coming-to-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official mod support</a> was confirmed as coming in the near future.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s official review</a>, Grant Taylor-Hill called Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 a “masterpiece” that was tough to “find one major fault” with.</p>



<p>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is beautiful in every aspect,” he wrote. “It’s deeply authentic and riddled with emotion and catharsis, and the way the story comes together is just perfection.”</p>
