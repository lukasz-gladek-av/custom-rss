<p>Rod Fergusson, who has served as general manager (GM) of Diablo for the last five years, is leaving Blizzard.</p>



<p>He announced the news via social media on Friday afternoon.</p>



<p><strong>“After five years of driving the Diablo franchise forward with four big launches, it’s time for me to step away from Blizzard/Microsoft, sword in hand, and see what’s next,”</strong> Fergusson <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rodfergusson.bsky.social/post/3lvvud767y223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in his post.</a> <strong>“The teams are set up for success, with an exciting slate of releases ahead. I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together and looking forward to what comes next for Diablo, and for me.”</strong></p>



<p>Fergusson joined Blizzard in 2020 after spending years working on the Gears of War franchise at The Coalition under Xbox and Epic Games previously.</p>



<p>After the move was announced, Blizzard president <a href="https://x.com/Joh_Burg/status/1953884570316943653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Johanna Faries said</a>, <strong>“Guiding a franchise like Diablo takes rare talent, vision, and collaboration. Thank you, Rod, for bringing all of those in spades. Sanctuary’s future is brighter because of the impact you’ve had!”</strong></p>



<p>Xbox head Phil Spencer added: <strong>“You brought strength, hellfire, and vision to one of gaming’s most iconic franchises. Playing Diablo IV with you was a blast—thanks for everything you gave to the game and the community.”</strong></p>



<p>As of publishing, no replacement has been named nor was a reason given for Fergusson’s departure.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-is-working-%E2%80%98all-by-himself%E2%80%99-on-physint.1265946/</guid>

<p>Hideo Kojima’s ‘spiritual successor’ to Metal Gear Solid (if Death Stranding 2 isn’t already that) has been floating around for a while, but beyond the name, we don’t know anything else about it. It’s named Physint, and it’s an all-new action espionage title, just like Metal Gear Solid was (and remains to be).</p>



<p>It’s set to be another cinematic epic from Kojima, further blurring the lines between cinematic production and traditional video game development. However, in a recent interview, the man himself confirmed he’s working solo at the moment.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-alone">All Alone</h2>



<p>Fans of Hideo Kojima’s work are nothing short of excited about the creator’s imminent return to the action espionage space, a decade after he left Konami and turned his back on Metal Gear Solid. It was a few days ago that he was grilled on the MGS series, and when asked if he plans to play the Snake Eater remake, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wont-play-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he just laughed</a>.</p>



<p>The expectation is that Physint, whatever form it takes, will emerge on whatever comes next for PlayStation, which right now is looking like the PlayStation 6. Did you really expect another naming convention to pop up?</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Indie Wire</a>, Hideo Kojima explained the lay of the land with Physint, mentioning that he’s working on a solo bid at the moment. It wasn’t much, but it was something:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;(I’m) also doing ‘Physint’ all by myself because that’s at the conceptual stage.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He’s planning Physint alongside the ongoing development of OD and the post-launch support of Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which dropped just a few weeks ago and has been turning heads ever since.</p>



<p>The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, and the single step here is good old Hideo, using that raw brain power to create a concept that only he can concoct.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In November, Fallout 4 will celebrate its tenth anniversary, having been released way back in 2015. As the best-selling game in the series (provided you don’t count the tens of millions of players passing through Fallout 76), it’s well placed to receive an Anniversary Edition. As we all know, Bethesda Game Studios loves any reason to re-release an old game.</p>



<p>However, the current-gen update introduced last year and already a busy slate at Bethesda Game Studios might have nipped any chance of Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition surfacing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-boston">Back to Boston</h2>



<p>Fallout 4 was released by Bethesda Game Studios on November 10, 2025, which means we’re mere months away from the game’s tenth anniversary. It’s one heck of a milestone, and as it’s still one of the most popular games in the series, particularly amongst <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-is-getting-a-paid-mods-system-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the modding community</a>, could we see it get a little more love this year from Bethesda?</p>



<p>Fans are hopeful that <strong>something </strong>will drop to celebrate the game’s milestone, but let’s be honest, it’ll probably be some kind of crossover bundle or event released in Fallout 76, which is where Bethesda’s sole focus sits right now for the post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<p>In 2017, Fallout 4 received a Game of the Year Edition, bundled with every one of the game’s stellar expansions and smaller pieces of downloadable content. Last year, shortly after the award-winning Fallout TV show debuted, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-fix-fallout-4-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 4 current-gen upgrade</a> was released, adding more content to the game and bringing it up to spec.</p>



<p>That’s enough to assume that there <strong>won’t </strong>be a re-release of Fallout 4, as it’s safe to say that there’s no appetite for anyone to purchase the game <strong>again </strong>unless there is a strong incentive to do so.</p>



<p>As a die-hard Fallout fan, I’d buy it just to own it. In any case, it’s the kind of thing that might launch on the Game Pass service, just like Oblivion Remastered did, which scrubs away <strong>even more </strong>sales (unless they rely heavily on other platforms).</p>



<p>They’re busy, similar products already exist, and there’s probably no real appetite for it. I think November will come and go without anything more than a fancy graphic released by Bethesda Game Studios to celebrate the milestone.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think about potentially getting a Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
