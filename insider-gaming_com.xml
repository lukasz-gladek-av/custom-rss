<p>If you’ve pre-ordered STALKER 2 or bought a higher edition, you’ll have learned that you’re able to unlock a series of unique weapons and outfits as you explore the game. However, it’s not immediately available where to find pre-order items in STALKER 2, which can leave you feeling confused.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll help you figure out where to get your pre-order bonus in STALKER 2.</p>



<p>Read on!</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-pre-order-items-in-stalker-2">How To Get Pre-Order Items in STALKER 2</h2>



<p>If you’re trying to figure out where to find your pre-order items in STALKER 2, you’ll need to follow a particular quest that’ll take you all over The Zone.</p>



<p>It’s called Seek, And You Shall Find, and it’s started after you complete ‘A Needle in a Haystack’ in Zalissya, the first major settlement you find in the Lesser Zone. The quest you need will be started once you’ve picked up a flash drive left in your stash by a mysterious individual.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can track down the white, single-storey building and find the PDA jammed between two beds to kickstart the quest.</p>



<p>Once you’ve activated Seek, And You Shall Find, you’ll notice that a string of stash locations have been added to the map on your PDA. If you head to each location, you’ll be rewarded with an exclusive weapon or outfit – these are the pre-order items in STALKER 2.</p>



<p>They’re also what you’ll receive for buying the Ultimate or Deluxe editions of the game.</p>



<p>There’s at least one Journalist Stash in each area of the map, and almost all of them require a little snooping to find. Perhaps you’ll need to find your way around a locked door or up onto a building, but they’re all relatively accessible and with a little common sense, you’ll have them tracked down in no time.</p>



<p>It’s not immediately obvious, but that’s where to get your pre-order bonus in STALKER 2. It takes a little work and a lot of walking, but as you’ll naturally explore The Zone on your travels, you can work passively to tick them off as and when you get near them.</p>



<p>That’s where to find pre-order items in STALKER 2 – happy hunting! Stop by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> if you want to chat about the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-2024-hit-50-million-peak-viewers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently revealed by Riot Games that the League of Legends Worlds final, which took place on November 2 in London, secured a whopping 50 million peak viewers worldwide. This number was driven mostly by esports fans in China.</p>



<p>That figure includes an all-time high for esports viewers outside of China, the company revealed. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-into-perspective">Into Perspective</h2>



<p>To put that figure into perspective, this year’s NBA Finals pulled in a peak viewer count of around 12.3 million users across the United States. The Super Bowl, which was held in February 2024, racked up a total unique viewer count of 120.2 million people, averaging a peak of 38.5 million.</p>



<p>The data was <a href="https://x.com/lolesports/status/1859295721956024521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">provided by Riot Games on social media</a> via Stream Hatchet.</p>



<p>This year’s League of Legends World Championship final is widely considered one of the best events in <strong>many years</strong>. It was a spectacle to behold, with live performances taking centre stage at the O2 Arena in London before T1 and Bilibili descended upon their stations to compete in front of a sold-out stadium.</p>



<p>The closing moments of the match were nothing short of legendary, and it marked a <strong>fifth </strong>Worlds win for both T1 and Faker.</p>



<p>In terms of numbers and buzz on social and streaming platforms, the grand final fixture was one of the most popular (if not <strong>the most</strong>) esports matches in the industry’s history. Nothing before has topped the grandiose profile of the full series, and it’s unlikely anything will again – for a long time, at least.</p>



<p>The League of Legends World Championship continues to grow. It’s the number-one esports event of the year, and it’s a perfect example of the ever-developing power of the esports market.</p>

<p>Another games studio is letting go of staff. Heart Machine, the developers behind Hyper Light Breaker and its predecessor Hyper Light Drifter, have confirmed that its holding layoffs.</p>



<p>First reported and confirmed by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hyper-light-breaker-developer-heart-machine-confirms-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, the Los Angeles-based studio didn’t give a specific reason for the layoffs, nor did they confirm how many people are being let go. However, it will be providing severance and healthcare to those being let go. </p>



<p>It was also affirmed that the upcoming launch of Hyper Light Breaker won’t be impacted by the layoffs.</p>



<p>“Hyper Light Breaker’s&nbsp;upcoming launch will not be impeded by this sad news–in fact, a strong and timely launch will rekindle opportunities for those affected as we look to evolve and grow the game throughout Early Access. Our other projects, including&nbsp;Possessor(s), will also remain unaffected,” studio community and PR manager Yiyi Zhang told Game Developer.</p>







<p>Zhang continued: “We really appreciate our communities who have rallied in support of our studio and others in similar positions, and are hopeful for what’s on the horizon for our upcoming games, our colleagues, and the industry as a whole.”</p>



<p>Though an exact date hasn’t been announced, Heart Machine is planning to launch Hyper Light Breaker in early access sometime in 2025. The game was originally scheduled to release in late 2024 before being delayed in August.</p>



<p>The games industry has seen more that 14,100 known jobs lost due to layoffs in 2024. The real number, according to some sources, could be as high as 16,000 to even 17,000.</p>
