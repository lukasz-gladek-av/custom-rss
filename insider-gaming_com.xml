<p>Prime Video has uncovered our first look at Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, ready and in costume for the upcoming live-action adaptation, the first since 2018’s reboot starring Alicia Vikander.</p>



<p>Fan feedback has been mixed so far, with the Tomb Raider community divided on whether they approve of the casting or not. The team at Prime Video has opted for a classic reimagination of the traditional Lara Croft from the original games, but not everyone is happy.</p>







<h2 id="h-sophie-turner-s-lara-croft-is-dividing-fans">Sophie Turner’s Lara Croft is Dividing Fans</h2>



<p>It was just a few days ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazons-tomb-raider-announces-multiple-castings/">Prime Video uncovered</a> an array of castings for the upcoming live-action Tomb Raider <strong>series</strong>. It has been several months since Sophie Turner was confirmed as playing the iconic lead, but others have since moved into the frame, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sigourney Weaver</li>



<li>Jason Isaacs</li>



<li>Martin Bobb-Semple</li>



<li>Jack Bannon</li>



<li>John Heffernan</li>



<li>Bill Paterson</li>



<li>Paterson Joseph</li>



<li>Sasha Luss</li>



<li>Juliette Motamed</li>



<li>Celia Imrie</li>



<li>August Wittgenstein</li>
</ul>



<p>The more recognizable characters among the roster are the likes of Zip, Atlas, and Winston, all of whom have previously appeared in the decades-old series.</p>



<p>Sophie Turner, who will assume the role of Lara Croft, recently underwent a wardrobe test, appearing in a shot posted on social media earlier today by Prime Video. While the outfit is very much on point, fans aren’t entirely sure if she fits the <strong>look</strong>. In recent months, Turner revealed a physical regime designed to get her in shape to play the adventurous archeologist, but that’s not enough for some.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In the comments under the post, one user wrote, ‘It’s difficult seeing anyone in this role besides Angelina Jolie.’ Another wrote, ‘I don’t see Lara anywhere. Sorry.’</p>



<p>The feedback is mixed but leaning in favor of the general acceptance of Turner’s portrayal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is many fans’ favorite in the series. The seamless blend of traditional AC gameplay and movement was woven beautifully with pillaging and pirate pilates. There have been endless talks about an Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake for an eternity, so here’s the latest on the rumored title.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flags-steam-page-adds-new-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</a> is a special game, and anyone who’s played it can sense this very quickly. You could argue that no other game has perfectly captured the feeling of being an exploring and exterminating pirate assassin. Nostalgia is kicking in even while writing about this—might need a lie down and a pint of grog to comfort the soul.</p>



<p>Before that, here’s a look at Black Flag Remake rumors and leaks.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-getting-a-remake">Is Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Getting A Remake?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It should be a whale of a time. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Insider Gaming can confirm that an Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is happening, and you can start preparing yourself for its inevitable launch.</strong></p>



<p>If you haven’t been following Insider Gaming’s coverage, you have missed out on a wild adventure so far. The first confirmation that an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake was in development</a> started in January 2024. A Tom Henderson exclusive then pulled back the curtain on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-further-details-on-the-assassins-creed-roadmap-and-what-games-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Roadmap, and what games to expect</a> over the next few years.</p>



<p>It revealed that the Black Flag Remake was happening. These suspicions grew stronger after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft reuploaded Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Soundtracks</a> in January 2026, </p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-remake-coming-out">When Is Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake Coming Out?</h2>



<p><strong>Insider Gaming exclusively confirmed that the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is coming out before March 31, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Given that it’s January 2026, you should start getting excited, if you aren’t already! The exclusive story said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is set to launch before March 31</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/33qBiRpCj1Z9Ib5bbfbg5r/d4ab539ca9edd1fa28ebc0aec5b1af27/Ubisoft_H1_FY26_Slideshow_vFinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft H1 FY26 EARNINGS</a> from November 21, 2025, mentioned several games for 2026, with one game listed as an “Unannounced Title.” This is expected to be the Black Flag Remake.</p>



<p>There’s still no exact launch date, but it’s getting closer than a pirate is to water after reaching the end of the plank.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-resynced">What Is Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced?</h2>



<p><strong>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced is reportedly the new title for the Black Flag Remake.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone has been referring to a reimagining of the fourth mainline game as the ‘Black Flag Remake’ for a while. Ubisoft has seemingly mooted this with the appearance of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-appears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced on the PEGI Ratings site</a>.</p>



<p>As long as it keeps ‘Assassin’s Creed Black Flag’ in the name, it could add ‘Reimagined Pirate Paradise’ on the end, and everyone would still buy it!</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-amp-leaks">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake Rumors &amp; Leaks</h2>



<p><strong>Some of the biggest Black Flag leaks and rumors include suggestions that the game will be more RPG-Heavy than its original incarnation.</strong></p>



<p>Surprisingly, we haven’t heard too many inner details about the actual gameplay, more its release window. Leaks have indicated that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-new-details-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remake is more RPG-Heavy</a>: “Similar to Origins and Shadows.”</p>



<p>Resynced will allegedly also get rid of the modern-day aspects that many dislike about Assassin’s Creed.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/runescape-rs25-project-most-ambitious-evolution/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new press release, the team at Jagex has confirmed that this year, which marks the 25th anniversary of <strong>RuneScape</strong>, will be the biggest yet in the game’s quarter-century on the market. It was promised that more investment and content development will be rolled out in 2026 than ever before, making for an ambitious roadmap for RuneScape fans everywhere.</p>



<p>The ‘RS25’ programme sets the stage for ‘the most ambitious evolution in RuneScape history.’ The pipeline includes the RuneFest event in the United Kingdom, an OSRS LAN event, better creator commitments, and a ‘reborn RuneScape.’</p>







<h2 id="h-runescape-is-evolving-more-than-ever-in-2026">RuneScape is Evolving More Than Ever in 2026</h2>



<p>RuneScape is turning 25 this year, and that’s not a milestone that many active games have ever managed to celebrate. As an MMORPG, RuneScape was part of the pioneering effort that eventually led to live-service games – titles that evolved over time and constantly provided fresh content and updates to players.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/runescape-membership-charge-tiers-online/">an entirely smooth journey</a> getting here, but the milestone year has finally arrived, and Jagex has a wealth of plans for 2026.</p>



<p>In October, RuneFest 2026 will be held in Birmingham, England, featuring live reveals, developer sessions, and ‘unforgettable community moments.’ RuneScape is taking to the stage in the US with the Deadman All-Stars Live production, and later in the year, a creator-backed LAN event will be held (location pending).</p>



<p>An all-new press release revealed what’s coming this year to the game ecosystem itself</p>



<blockquote>
<p>RuneScape will enter a new chapter with a comprehensive rejuvenation rooted in integrity, visual renewal, and a renewed focus on what makes the game special. Alongside a long-requested Player Avatar refresh and meaningful visual upgrades,&nbsp;and major improvements to player support,&nbsp;all designed to better serve the community at the heart of RuneScape.</p>



<p>This new era will also see the removal of RuneScape’s microtransaction system, Treasure Hunter, following the community vote in November 2025, marking a major step forward in player-first design and transparency.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-shadow-drops-runescape-dragonwilds-in-early-access/">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a> will also expand through 2026 after a successful launch last year.</p>



<p>Jagex was <strong>also </strong>promoting <a href="http://www.runescape.com/25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive merchandise line</a> produced to celebrate the substantial company milestone. As the year unravels, more merchandise will be released across the line.</p>



<p>In a statement, the CEO of Jagex, Jon Bellamy, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>It’s incredible to think a quarter century has passed since&nbsp;RuneScape’s&nbsp;beginnings as a Java-based browser game</em>. <em>Today we’re speaking to the largest and most active&nbsp;RuneScape&nbsp;community in our history, and this milestone is as much theirs as it is ours.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team at Jagex uploaded an 11-minute video looking back at the last 25 years of RuneScape history, which you can see below:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>This year promises to be absolutely insane for RuneScape fans. The game has had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-confirms-layoffs-pauses-key-runescape-project/">a few bumps in the road</a> in the last few years, but the community seems eager to receive what amounts to a bounty of content through 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new report, NVIDIA has stopped production of the RTX 5070 Ti GPU, and the 5060 Ti 16GB will soon follow. </p>



<p>The growth of AI has led to global memory shortages, impacting even the most prominent manufacturers. We were recently told that NVIDIA doesn’t plan to announce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-isnt-announcing-a-new-gpu-at-ces-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any new GPUs at CES 2026</a>. Now, another report has revealed that they might be halting production of one of their RTX 50 Series GPUs. </p>







<h2 id="h-nvidia-to-halt-production-of-rtx-5070-ti-and-5060-ti-16gb">NVIDIA to Halt Production of RTX 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB </h2>



<p>A recent YouTube video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hardware Unboxed</a> (thanks <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-reportedly-says-rtx-5070-ti-is-no-longer-being-produced-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-to-follow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>) suggests that NVIDIA is halting its production of the RTX 5070 Ti graphics cards. This information&nbsp;was provided by ASUS, NVIDIA’s largest add-in board (AIB) partner, who stated that the RTX 5070 Ti model has been “essentially killed off” and is now in an “end of life status.” ASUS has no plans to produce more 5070 Ti models, meaning that what is currently available in stores will be the last stock of this model offered by the company. <span>This information <span>aligns with an earlier report stating that NVIDIA will&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-cutting-rtx-50-series-production-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span><span>cut</span> RTX 50 series producti</span>on</a>&nbsp;in 2026. </p>



<p>NVIDIA’s RTX 5070 Ti isn’t the only model facing supply issues; the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB has also experienced a significant reduction in availability, effectively leading to its discontinuation. ASUS has reportedly confirmed that this model has been designated as “end of life” and will no longer be produced. Currently, retailers are only able to purchase the 8GB versions, including the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, in bulk. These shortages have resulted in increased prices for the models that remain available in stores.</p>

Additionally, <span>NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang called the constant negativity surrounding the AI industry “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-ceo-says-ai-doomer-narrative-is-hurtful/" target="_blank">extremely hurtfu</a></span>l.” What are your thoughts on NVIDIA halting production of RTX 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB models?

<p>Simon Collins-Laflamme is the mastermind behind Hytale and Hypixel Studios. The creator is very vocal on social media and has provided another big update on the game following its successful early access launch.</p>



<p>Hytale is the new kid on the block, and there are <em>many </em>blocks in Hytale: Wood, Stone, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-make-copper-ingots-in-hytale-copper-location-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Copper</a>, you name it. The Minecraft-like title is expected to undergo a significant period of early access before a 1.0 launch. The founder is keen to reward everyone who adopts Hytale early and has spoken out about the game’s Mining mechanic and other improvements on the way.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-needs-to-be-more-satisfying">Hytale Needs To Be ‘More Satisfying’</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Spooky. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Collins-Laflamme took to X to say that he and the team had “Gathered thousands of feedback inputs via social media and in-game feedback forms.”</p>







<p>Most of these issues and bits of feedback are being taken on board with a view to addressing “most of them.” Part of this includes “<strong>Lots of new avatar options.</strong>” If you thought your avatar looked cool now, wait until the character creation tools are expanded upon.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Gathered thousands of feedback inputs via social media and in-game feedback form, made plans to address most of them, lots of QoL/fixes/quick wins in the pipeline already! Staying busy.</p><p>I've also asked the art team for lots of new avatar options. Expanding the art team ASAP!</p></div>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2011670308076601766?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Another post talked specifically about Hytale’s Mining. Day-to-day Mining is vital for accumulating resources, giving you room to build structures, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-repair-in-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repair weapons and items</a>, and apply upgrades.</p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme himself has stated his personal dissatisfaction with this aspect of Hytale:</p>

<p>“I need suggestions to make mining in Hytale more satisfying / fun! I’m not happy with it, finding ores or strip mining is not good enough. I’m considering adding signature ability to pickaxes + improving the sounds / visuals of mining.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s nothing fundamentally wrong with Mining in Hytale, and anyone who’s played Minecraft—or other similar survival games—should feel right at home. But there’s room for improvement, so expect this to be addressed, and a whole lot more, as the weeks and months pass.</p>

<p>What have you enjoyed about Hytale in the early stages? Is it lacking something? What changes need to be enforced sooner rather than later to get the game anywhere near Minecraft’s level?

<p>A brand new season in Marvel Rivals has arrived with the launch of Season 6, and with it comes the usual balancing update full of fresh nerfs and buffs. </p>



<p>Season 6 of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-players-can-now-buy-gift-items-directly-from-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> features many tweaks fans have long called for, along with an update to Team-Up Abilities. Some new ones have been added, whilst a couple have instead been removed. </p>







<p>If you’re looking for the full breakdown of nerfs and buffs coming alongside Season 6 of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deadpool-is-marvel-rivals-most-versatile-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>, then you’re in the right place—it’s all available below.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A flurry of nerfs is coming. Image by NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Season 6 offers a large variety of balance changes, though the likes of Star-Lord and Hela manage to evade nerfs despite their OP nature.</strong></p>



<p>A handful of Vanguards have seen some notable buffs, including the likes of Doctor Strange, Hulk and Emma Frost. Hulk has received a variety of cooldown improvements, whilst Doctor Strange has been given some movement adjustments to his Cloak of Levitation. Meanwhile, Angela is slightly easier to deal with, now that her shield value has dropped from 350 to 300.</p>



<p>Duelists have seen some hefty changes, too, with Black Panther and Iron Fist both receiving buffs. Diving the backline should be slightly easier now, thanks to some damage increases to some of their abilities. Blade has seen some tweaks, as you’ll need to choose between your weapons more carefully. Sadly, though, Daredevil is the main target for nerfs, as the Devil of Hell’s Kitchen was running riot last season. </p>







<p>Finally, the Strategists have come out the worst with Season 6’s balance changes, as the likes of Rocket Raccoon, Invisible Woman, and Gambit have all been nerfed. Rocket Raccoon has been slowed down slightly during his Wild Crawl, whilst Sue Storm’s Guardian Shield has dropped from 250 to 200 health. Gambit’s overall healing output has been lowered, as NetEase look to weaken his cards.</p>
