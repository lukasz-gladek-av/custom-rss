            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a whole new week, and that means we can kickstart the next seven days by smashing today’s NYT Connections puzzle. Today’s trickery isn’t too tough to contend with, but that doesn’t mean you don’t want to walk away with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions, courtesy of Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>Read on to get the full list of NYT Connections hints and solutions for today’s puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-10">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 10)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #883:</p>



<ul>
<li>SINE</li>



<li>CLEAR</li>



<li>PRO</li>



<li>SQUARE</li>



<li>SAW</li>



<li>AB</li>



<li>I</li>



<li>TRIANGLE</li>



<li>BELL</li>



<li>CAME</li>



<li>DRUM</li>



<li>PAY</li>



<li>SUB</li>



<li>SETTLE</li>



<li>RATTLE</li>



<li>CONQUERED</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em><em>Strike up the band!</em> These make noise when hit, shaken, or rattled.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Financial closure.</em> These words all signal that what’s owed is no longer owed.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em><em>A swift conquest.</em> These four words form a legendary declaration of victory.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em><em>Prepositions from the past.</em> These short words helped Romans express direction, cause, and relation.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 10.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-10-883">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 10 (#883)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BELL, DRUM, RATTLE, TRIANGLE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CLEAR, PAY, SETTLE, SQUARE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CAME, CONQUERED, I, SAW</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – AB, PRO, SINE, SUB</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is a stunning, post-apocalyptic extraction shooter with immense potential. It has become one of 2025’s most successful games and is, by numbers, the best-received extraction shooter ever made. In this guide, we’re looking at a portion of the game’s post-launch support model and determining when the next ARC Raiders season and Raider Deck are set to arrive.</p>



<p>If you’re waiting for more free rewards in ARC Raiders via the Raider Deck, read on to find out when it’s coming to the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-new-raider-deck-coming-to-arc-raiders">When is the New Raider Deck Coming to ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>The next Raider Deck will unlock in ARC Raiders in December alongside the Cold Snap update</strong>. This update is set to bring a new map condition called Snowfall, introduce a special event called Flickering Flames, close the Expedition window, <strong>and </strong>introduce new quests.</p>



<p>This supersized update will be free to download and enjoy, with Embark Studios delivering on the promise to support this game for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>If the Raider Deck is anything like the current Raider Deck, it’ll be something special for players to chase.</p>



<p>To level up through the Raider Deck, you need to complete Feats to unlock ‘blue’ credits, which can then be applied to the pages bursting with rewards in the Raider Deck tab on the main menu. You’ll need to unlock a certain amount on one page before unlocking the next page, but it takes no time at all, as Feats are constantly refreshing as you complete them.</p>



<p>In the Raider Deck, you’ll find everything from hairstyles to outfits, and from boxes full of loot to Raider Credits. There’s a lot to unlock, which is brilliant, considering you’re not paying a penny for what’s contained in the Raider Deck.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re hoping for in the next Raider Deck in ARC Raiders.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Peaks Again, 10 Days After Launch, and Beats Some Insanely Popular Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-peaks-10-days-later-beats-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-peaks-again-10-days-after-launch-and-beats-some-insanely-popular-games.1348426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite ARC Raiders having been on the market for more than <strong>ten days</strong>, the game is still surpassing expectations and climbing on certain platforms. Hours ago, the post-apocalyptic extraction shooter managed to secure a new record on Steam, climbing to a peak of 462,488 players, beating the previous high of 416,517.</p>



<p>The constantly climbing peak is indicative of the quality of this game. The smash hit from Embark Studios continues to turn heads worldwide, and millions of players are flooding the accessible, welcoming platform.</p>







<p>ARC Raiders isn’t your typical extraction shooter. For starters, it’s a third-person shooter with heavy social aspects, and it’s designed to ideally be treated as a PvE game in <strong>many ways</strong>. It has been soaring up the charts since dropping on October 30, and it shows absolutely no signs of slowing down.</p>



<p>Yesterday, the game hit a peak user count of 416,517 on Steam, but in recent hours, that peak has climbed further to 462,488 players. It’s bucking trends, but this multiplayer-only shooter is getting stronger over time, rather than the player count inevitably dying out.</p>



<p>In terms of the record books, ARC Raiders has now beaten Helldivers 2, Sons of the Forest, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, GTA 5, and Starfield. It’s on the cusp of topping Call of Duty, Fallout 4, and Terraria.</p>



<p>This is likely because ARC Raiders still isn’t completely understood by the wider gaming community, and as these users are having their eyes opened to the game’s potential, they’re finding their way into the game.</p>



<p>Embark Studios recently revealed a stunning roadmap for ARC Raiders that promises to keep the game stoked for the time being, but the team has suggested it wants to support ARC Raiders for <strong>a decade</strong>, which is almost unheard of in this business.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s Valley of Memory update is a supersized overhaul that comes with a stack of Trophies and Achievements that you can unlock <strong>for free</strong>. It’s a sizeable expansion that takes players to an all-new region of the 2023 open-world title, presenting them with a splinter story that Ubisoft isn’t charging a penny for.</p>



<p>In this guide, learn how to unlock all Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory Trophies and Achievements.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-assassin-s-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-trophies-amp-achievements">All Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>



<p>Fans were surprised when Ubisoft announced Valley of Memory so far after launch, as Assassin’s Creed Mirage received very little in the way of updates after launch, save for the typical New Game+ kind of content.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of Trophies and Achievements in Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Trophy &amp; Achievement Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Lost and Found</strong></td><td>Return all stolen goods to Hind</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Once Upon a Time</strong></td><td>Listen to all folktales</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pro Musician</strong></td><td>Collect all Oud melodies</td></tr><tr><td><strong>If I Recall Correctly</strong></td><td>Replay an Animus Sequence</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Perfect Memory</strong></td><td>Complete all sequence challenges</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Playback</strong></td><td>Unlock all Animus Sequence rewards</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Taste Your Own Medicine</strong></td><td>Poison a Poisoner</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Like a Local</strong></td><td>Complete all the AlUla territories</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make a Break</strong></td><td>Escape the AlUla prison</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Turn the Page</strong></td><td>Say goodbye to Is’haq</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Give it the Slip</strong></td><td>Escape the AlUla prison undetected</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>It’s not a huge list, but considering Valley of Memory is a completely free expansion, it’s a decent list of Trophies and Achievements to chase. Fans were mostly surprised that Ubisoft decided to tack this expansion onto Assassin’s Creed Mirage, which is more than two years old at this point.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory will be released as a free-to-download update on all platforms on November 18. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ll be playing the new expansion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Our first look at Yoshi and Bowser Jr. from The Super Mario Galaxy Movie comes from, well, a grocery chain. The film, set to release April 3rd, 2026, has yet to get a full trailer, but the new listing may hint at it coming sooner than we thought.</p>



<p>Illumination and Universal Pictures went big with The Super Mario Bros. Movie back in 2022. The first film based on a Nintendo IP in decades, it became the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt6718170/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-grossing video game adaptation</a>&nbsp;of all time. A sequel was quickly greenlit and, earlier this year, was revealed to be called The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Story details were thin outside of using Super Mario Galaxy, but we now have some more content from an unlikely source: slice-and-bake cookies.</p>



<h2 id="h-first-look-at-yoshi-and-bowser-jr-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-leaked-online">First Look at Yoshi and Bowser Jr. from The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Leaked Online</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leak comes from an unlikely source: Tops Markets. The East Coast grocery chain put up a new listing for “Pillsbury The Super Mario Galaxy Shape Sugar Cookie Dough”. It’s still up, <a href="https://shop.topsmarkets.com/store/tops-markets/products/83425108-pillsbury-ready-to-bake-yoshi-egg-sugar-cookie-dough-9-1-oz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">linked here</a>, if you want to look at it, but it’s out of stock. On the box, we have the best look at Yoshi, who is at the end of The Super Mario Bros. Movie via a cracked sewer egg. His design differs a bit from his video-game counterpart with smoother texturing and flatter eyes. </p>



<p>On the back, there’s a fun little maze to fill out. We do get to see some of the worlds Mario and Yoshi will be traveling to, though it’s hard to tell if they come from Super Mario Galaxy or its sequel. However, one icon should be familiar to fans: Bowser Jr.’s graffiti tag. The character, the son of Bowser (played in-film by Jack Black), had yet to be revealed, so his inclusion here is all but confirming his appearance. </p>



<p>A trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to come out soon</a>, possibly with the upcoming Wicked: For Good film. With April 2026 almost here, marketing is set to start and, unfortunately for Nintendo, happened a bit too early. Regardless, we have yet to see Yoshi and Bowser Jr. in action, but it’s good to know some new faces are along for the intergalactic ride.</p>



<p>What do you think of Yoshi’s look in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie? Are you going to be picking up the Pillsbury cookies? When do you think the trailer will come out?
