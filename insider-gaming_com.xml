<p>The next Resident Evil remake is coming within the next 18 months. </p>



<p>In a post on social media, NateTheHate reaffirmed that not only is Resident Evil Code: Veronica being remade, but that it’s “deep in development”. He then went on the mention when Capcom is targeting a release.</p>







<p>“Target of release is first half 2027,” <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2014767509803512263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. </p>



<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve heard claims of Code: Veronica being remade. In fact, rumblings about the game have been going on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since at least 2024</a>. Rumors <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-remakes-scheduled-for-2027-2028-respectively-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest that the remake</a> of the 26-year-old game will be announced sometime this year ahead of the aforementioned 2027 launch.</p>







<p>Resident Evil Code: Veronica first launched in February 2000, exclusively for the Sega Dreamcast. After that console went under, the game was re-released as Resident Evil Code: Veronica X for the PlayStation 2 (2001) and Nintendo GameCube (2003). It even came to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2011. </p>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director has stated that Rebirth’s Switch 2 gameplay experience is “pretty much exactly the same as all the other platforms.”</p>



<p>The Xbox and Switch 2 versions of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade are already live, and players have already started thinking about the next instalments. Moving on to the next instalment, a reliable insider has reaffirmed that Rebirth should <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-still-coming-to-xbox-in-2026-insider-reaffirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrive for Xbox in 2026</a>. And now, we have been informed about the game’s performance on the Switch 2. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-gameplay-experience-could-be-the-same-as-ps5">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Switch 2 Gameplay Experience Could be the Same as PS5</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2026/January/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-Interview-Naoki-Hamaguchi-Director-3010151.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi spoke about Rebirth’s Switch 2 performance. The director was asked about the next instalments in the FF7 remake series, and Hamaguchi answered, stating that he can’t reveal too much information, but can confirm that Rebirth and the third instalment to the series are indeed in development for the Switch 2. </p>



<p>Development on both titles is progressing for Switch 2 and other platforms. Hamaguchi also stated that it’s his “personal policy” not to make any versions of a game different from one another, or “offer a different gameplay experience just because they’re on different hardware.” He has assured players that the Switch 2 version’s gameplay experience is “pretty much exactly the same as all the other&nbsp;platforms.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Highguard developers have finally announced a gameplay showcase for the title, which will arrive on launch day. </p>



<p>Since Highguard was announced during the finale slot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>, players have been eagerly waiting to learn more about the upcoming free-to-play shooter from the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall. However, close to the marketing or promotion for the title has been done, apart from the reveal trailer. It seems that we are finally going to get something, but it may be too close to launch. </p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-gameplay-showcase-arrives-on-launch-day">Highguard Gameplay Showcase Arrives on Launch Day</h2>



<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2014760310046085443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) of Highguard is finally showing signs of life, posting for the first time since December 12, 2025. The new announcement reveals that a Highguard Launch Showcase will be held on January 26, 2026, at 10 AM Pacific Time. The showcase will provide an in-depth look at the game, featuring year-one plans, a gameplay deep dive, and more. Players are speculating that the game could be dropped right after the showcase. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the Highguard Launch Showcase⚔️</p><p>Here, we'll share an in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more.</p><p>👉<a href="https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI">https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI</a> <a href="https://t.co/VlQ4qbCNA3">pic.twitter.com/VlQ4qbCNA3</a></p></div>— Highguard | Launching Jan 26 2026 (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2014760310046085443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Highguard marketing has been almost non-existent, with developers providing players absolutely no concrete information about their upcoming free-to-play raid shooter. Interestingly, the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-trophy-list-has-revealed-more-details-than-the-devs-have/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophy list leaked</a> recently, providing players with the most information we have received to date about the upcoming title. The information included details on the game’s mechanics, items, characters, and more. </p>







<p>In other news, a recent claim alleges that Highguard developers Wildlight Entertainment <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t pay for the spot</a> at The Game Awards finale. Additionally, here’s all you need to know about the upcoming shooter’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-platforms-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platforms</a>.
