<p>In a recent leak published on social media by eXtas1s, fresh references to the ‘new Xbox controller’ were uncovered. These details gel nicely with what we already know about the ‘Sebile’ controller that was leaked in the FTC vs. Microsoft documents almost two years ago. If nothing else, this new update is a testament to the controller <strong>still existing</strong>.</p>



<p>Per the update posted by eXtas1s, dataminers have uncovered references to the ‘Sebile’ controller in new XCloud files. It was originally thought that the upgraded, next-generation controller would be released alongside whatever console comes next, but these latest details suggest it could arrive sooner.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-sebile">What is Sebile?</h2>



<p>In September 2023, the FTC vs. Microsoft court case led to many documents being publicly revealed, with some outlining the future of Xbox hardware and peripherals. One such peripheral that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ftc-leak-new-xbox-controller/">was fully unveiled was ‘Sebile’</a>, otherwise dubbed ‘the new Xbox controller’ by Microsoft.</p>



<p>Back then, the documents suggested it would have a ‘lift to wake’ feature, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-could-be-bringing-haptic-motors-to-xbox-controllers/">precision haptic feedback</a>, better ergonomics, and a rechargeable battery as standard. It was also stressed it would have seamless connectivity mechanics, better accessibility for repair and disassembly, and an accelerometer.</p>



<p>In a recent post published on <a href="https://xcancel.com/extas1stv/status/1893094238549590287?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media by eXtas1s</a>, those very same features are discussed again. In recent XCloud files uncovered by dataminers, references to the following were found:</p>



<ul>
<li>Codenames: Sebile_Delgado, Sebile_EV1B, Actium_Duet, Actium_EVO</li>
</ul>



<p>EXtas1s expands on the codenames by reiterating the proposed technical specification:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Modular with improved haptics, similar to the DualSense. Goodbye to batteries, now with a rechargeable battery. Gesture to ‘wake up’ the controller. Part of the console renewal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the tech specs seem to be nothing more than a look back at what we already know, the modern references to the codenames in the XCloud files are new and are more or less confirmation that Microsoft is still working on Sebile.</p>
