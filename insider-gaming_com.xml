<p>It’s a tough time for new video game IPs. According to a new report, Wildgate, the new online PvP game from developer Dreamhaven, has struggled with sales since it’s release.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-22/blizzard-co-founder-s-game-startup-struggles-amid-industry-glut?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Cecilia D’Anastasio</a> reports that Wildgate has <strong>sold just 130,000 units</strong> in its first month plus. The data, which comes from a letter Dreamhaven co-founder Michael Morhaime sent to staff.</p>



<p>The Blizzard co-founder said that despite positive reviews from critics, the game performed below commercial expectations. It wasn’t just Wildgate that struggled, either. Dreamhaven’s other game, Sunderfolk, has sold just 62,000 copies since it released in April. Because of the struggles, he said, the company is looking for new financing. </p>



<p><strong>“Our monthly expenses are outpacing revenue,” </strong>Morhaime said in the letter, adding that Dreamhaven’s focus is to now <strong>“urgently”</strong> reduce costs. </p>



<p>He added that he is<strong> “committed”</strong> to making sure the studio survives its current financial turmoil.</p>



<p>Wildgate is currently available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. Through August 28, the game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504780/Wildgate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on sale on Steam</a> for under $20. In our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/preview-wildgate-could-be-the-multiplayer-game-of-the-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview of the game earlier this year</a>, we said that Wildgate showed potential for being the multiplayer game of the year. The main concern, however, was getting players to buy in and keep them engaged with the game. Based on the current state of things, it appears that concern remains.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for Wildgate and developer Dreamhaven? Let us know down below, and join this discussion and more in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: Hell Let Loose Isn’t Going to The Pacific Theatre Anytime Soon]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-pacific-theatre/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-hell-let-loose-isn%E2%80%99t-going-to-the-pacific-theatre-anytime-soon.1278600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following the announcement of Hell Let Loose: Vietnam, I had the opportunity to get <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on with the game for the very first time </a>and quiz the developers on the decision as to why they haven’t yet gone to the Pacific Theatre with the original game.</p>



<p>The Pacific Theatre, in my view, has been a highly requested setting by the community for a while now, but for whatever reason, the developers have yet to bring it to life. So, quite jokingly, and before I got hands-on with Vietnam, I quizzed the developers as to why the Pacific Theatre isn’t a direction they’ve yet gone in.</p>



<p>I was told that, for the most part, the idea of Hell Let Loose going to Vietnam as a separate title in the franchise has been a plan for some years. For those unaware, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will be developed in tandem with the original game, with no resources being moved away from the original. So if you’re a fan of the original game, it will continue to be developed at the same rate it is currently, with new content.</p>



<p>It was said that around 80 developers are currently working on Hell Let Loose: Vietnam, with around 30 developers on the original. However, in terms of resource allocation, I was told that some developers are working on both games, and these numbers will fluctuate based on the individual game’s requirements at any given time. </p>



<h2 id="h-hell-let-loose-pacific">Hell Let Loose: Pacific?</h2>



<p>Following my hands-on with Hell Let Loose: Vietnam, I circled back to the Pacific Theatre with the developers, where I was told that Hell Let Loose going to the Pacific Theatre isn’t out of the question, but what would that look like?</p>



<p>It was explained that although taking Hell Let Loose to the Pacific Theatre is something that the team would want to take the franchise to, it would likely mean a whole new game, instead of just adding a few maps into the original.</p>



<p>The explanation continued by highlighting that the Pacific Theatre is characterized by large naval battles involving carriers, planes, the Bushido code, and so on. It was noted that it presents an entirely different atmosphere compared to fairly grounded fighting in Europe and Russia, where the foundations of Hell Let Loose were laid.</p>



<p>So similar to Hell Let Loose: Vietnam, it was heavily implied to me that a Pacific Theatre entry would likely require a new game entirely, offering players new ways to play while continuing the expansion of the Hell Let Loose franchise. Transparently, I was also told that taking even the original Hell Let Loose to the Pacific Theatre with even just a few new maps, weapons, and factions would be very resource heavy, and that it would probably make a lot more sense to build an entirely new experience from the ground up, similar to what they have done with Vietnam.</p>



<p>But ultimately, I was told that it all depends on what the community wants.</p>



<p>So, who knows, maybe in 4-5 years, a highly immersive Hell Let Loose: Pacific Theatre title is something we can all look forward to playing – If players want it! </p>



<p>Would you like to see the series take that direction after the release of Hell Let Loose: Vietnam? Let me know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 might be the most talked-about game in the world, but that doesn’t stop Grand Theft Auto <strong>5 </strong>from still being extremely relevant. It remains one of the best-selling games right now, even though we’re a mere nine months (mere?) away from the launch of GTA 6, in May 2026.</p>



<p>At Gamescom, I was fortunate to run into GTA 5’s Ned Luke (Michael de Santa) and Shawn ‘Solo’ Fonteno (Franklin Clinton), and I took the opportunity to ask them about their expectations and excitement for Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-i-wanna-play-it-i-wanna-livestream-it">‘I Wanna Play It, I Wanna Livestream It!’</h2>



<p>Ned Luke and Shawn Fonteno were at Gamescom to promote the new ROG Xbox Ally as part of an ongoing partnership with Asus. The pair wasted no time revealing their handheld gaming devices to me and walking me through some of the key features before we took a dive into the world of Grand Theft Auto.</p>



<p>As Ned was hot off a popular stream of Grand Theft Auto 5 and had been vocal about the GTA 6 trailer, I was eager to ask him what he was most looking forward to:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m just excited <strong>for the game</strong>. I want to play. I want to play it, I want to <em>livestream </em>it, I want to enjoy it just like everybody enjoyed our game.</p>



<p>It’s going to be awesome.</p>



<p>You know, apart from the jiggle physics, which are going to be great, because of the <strong>big asses</strong>—Solo’s going to love it because he loves those big asses!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The mic was then passed to Fonteno:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s Miami, baby! You know what I’m saying?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the same interview, the pair let me know that Young Maylay, recognizable as the voice of Carl Johnson in 2006’s GTA San Andreas, is now touring conventions with them and meeting fans, and he’s loving every second.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>I tried to get a little information from Ned and Shawn about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-actors-gta-5-leads-advice-get-ready-for-it/">the lead actors in GTA 6</a>, but they remained tight-lipped. I had to try!</p>



<p>It might have been more than 12 years since Grand Theft Auto 5 was released, but these guys are still beloved by the wider community. Let me know which GTA 5 character was your favourite on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-randy-pitchford-admits-he%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98a-little-nervous%E2%80%99-about-the-more-challenging-parts-of-borderlands-4.1278552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Borderlands 4 boasts the biggest evolution of the series thus far. It’s the most ambitious game the team at Gearbox has ever created, boasting a seamless open-world map, numerous hours of exploration-based opportunities, and a core gameplay loop that facilitates endless playstyles.</p>



<p>I caught up with Randy Pitchford, Gearbox CEO, at Gamescom, and took a deep dive into the changes that will help to differentiate Borderlands 4 from Borderlands 3. He wasn’t afraid to admit he’s nervous about one key change that will alter the game’s difficulty rating.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-borderlands-4-hard">Is Borderlands 4 Hard?</h2>



<p>I played Borderlands 4 for an hour at Gamescom and can confirm that it’s not <strong>super tough</strong>. I <em>was </em>playing on a lower difficulty level, so it’s tough to give an accurate representation of how the game will feel when you’re playing with more users to push the challenges up and running the game at a higher difficulty grade.</p>



<p>Going into my interview with Randy Pitchford, I knew that the team at Gearbox had designed some of the toughest bosses in franchise history. I was curious why and how that challenge would be felt by even the most die-hard veterans of the series.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have lots of players that actually aren’t interested in deep, hard challenges; lots of people that love just exploring the Borderlands or spending time with the characters.</p>



<p><strong>I’m a little nervous because there are points of Borderlands 4 that are more challenging</strong>, but one of the coolest things about Borderlands 4, because of the nature of the RPG, is if anything is a little challenging for you, you can just grind somewhere and level up and become more powerful.</p>



<p>You will find that things that were hard when you were a little chump will become trivial when you become a badass.</p>



<p>But we definitely have pushed the challenges quite a lot, especially with bosses and boss fight mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans of the series will recognize this gameplay mechanic. If you can’t defeat an enemy, go away and level up, and you’ll do much better on your successive pass at that boss or objective.</p>



<p>In my exclusive Gamescom demo, I got to control Harlowe, one of the game’s more technical Vault Hunters, and I faced off against a fairly challenging boss, a ‘Spy Master’ of the game’s ‘Timekeeper’ big bad. It was innovative, enjoyable, and satisfying, even considering my hatred for intense challenges.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-cuts-prices-of-rtx-50-series-gpus-in-europe/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nvidia graphics cards are getting a bit cheaper in Europe as the company has lowered the prices of a number of RTX 50-series GPUs.</p>



<p>Cut by nearly 10% in some cases, the RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070 have seen their prices drop across the region. The move comes as the Euro contains to strengthen against the United States (US) dollar.</p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-cuts-geforce-rtx-50-prices-in-europe-as-eur-strengthens-against-us-dollar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>, the top-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 is retailing for €2,099, a 9.88% drop from the launch price of €2,329. The next-highest card, the RTX 5080, is now 9.4% lower at €1,059. The RTX 5070 has fallen 9.24% from €649 to €589. Lastly, the low-end RTX 5050 has a smaller drop, but still a drop nonetheless, of 6.7% to €251.</p>



<h6 id="h-more-tech-news-intel-giving-away-battlefield-6-with-cpu-or-gpu-purchase">More Tech News: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-giving-away-battlefield-6-with-cpu-or-gpu-purchase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intel Giving Away Battlefield 6 With CPU or GPU Purchase</a></h6>



<p>While the prices are lower in Europe, there’s been no sign that the US will see anything similar any time soon. Due to the state of global economics, companies are looking at ways they can continue to sell products while generating revenue. In this instance, it’s more of a case of adjusting for the aforementioned strength of the Euro against the US dollar than anything else.</p>



<p>With the prices a bit lower, are you going to pick up a new Nvidia GPU? Let us know down below, and take the discussion even further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Division 2 has revealed its Year 7 roadmap for 2025 and beyond at Gamescom. Furthermore, the next season of the title is only a few weeks away.</p>



<p>Developed by Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment, The Division 2 has been going steadily since its release in 2019. Taking over for the original, the game has expanded its boundaries, both in locations like Washington, DC and in modes like the roguelike Descent. Now, the future of the multiplayer shooter has been laid out, thanks to a new update from Gamescom.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Starting off the new content for Year 7 of The Division 2 is The Pact, a new season launching September 9th, 2025. We get a glimpse of what it will be like in the trailer above. As per <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/4235uGIN3QkbDq4iNQVlT1/the-division-2-at-gamescom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> on The Division 2’s website, The Pact focuses on the enemy factions, which have joined up. New to the season is Retaliation, a permanent open-world activity that adds Control Points mechanics.</p>



<p>After The Pact, the next season, titled Mutiny, will launch later this year. It plans on adding new modifiers, as well as a new companion mechanic. While details are scarce about Mutiny, the team promises that fans will hear more in the coming months. In the roadmap, there is mention of the franchise’s tenth-year anniversary, so there’s many reasons to look forward to that, whether it be The Division 3 or bigger expansions.</p>



<p>What do you think of the upcoming roadmap for The Division 2? Will you be joining in on The Pact and Mutiny? Let us know in the comments and on the forums!</p>
