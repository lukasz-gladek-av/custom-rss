<p>Jerk Gustafsson is the studio director at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/machinegames/" id="87686">MachineGames</a>. MachineGames has been developing Wolfenstein games since 2014, and Gustafsson says he still plans to finish the trilogy.</p>



<p>During a recent discussion with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/machinegames-on-being-part-of-microsoft-going-back-to-the-office-and-wolfenstein-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry</a>, Gustafsson admitted that, because of the time it takes to make video games in 2026, he may only have a few more projects in his career, about two or three to be more specific.</p>



<p>When asked if one of those games would be a third <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wolfenstein/" id="2953">Wolfenstein</a>, he remained coy, but expressed the intent to always return to the series, saying, “We wanted to finish the trilogy. And when we do that, that is something that I don’t want to comment on. It can be now, it can be later, but we’re not done with it. That’s what I can say.”</p>







<h2 id="h-machinegames-also-worked-on-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">MachineGames Also Worked on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2>



<p>While there hasn’t been a Wolfenstein game since 2019, Machine Games was hard at work for the release of 2024’s Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Released first on Xbox platforms, the game made its way to PlayStation 5 in 2025 and will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-avoids-game-key-card-on-nintendo-switch-2/" id="174746">arrive on the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.</a></p>



<p>Gustafson discussed the game’s development and its departure from Wolfenstein’s first-person action. He admitted that it’s the first game the team has ever made that’s rated T for teen rather than M for mature.</p>



<p>When discussing some of the challenges of working on the game, he admitted it was hard for him to convey the overall goal, noting that it took until the final year of production for things to click. </p>



<p>He noted that he is proud of the games they make, enjoys expanding his horizons, and even wants to test himself and his team by making a mobile game, saying, “It just requires a different skillset that we don’t have at MachineGames. Maybe sometime in the future, but who knows?”</p>







<p>For now, there’s no confirmation of a third Wolfenstein game from MachineGames, but the team’s goal is to make one more game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" id="54815">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is the only forthcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda-2/" id="3469">Bethesda </a>game for the Nintendo Switch 2 that will not be launched on a game key card.</p>



<p>As physical releases for video games become increasingly rare, developers and console manufacturers are working to bridge the gap between efficient ways to bring games to more players and the wants of players who prefer physical media. Nintendo, with the launch of its latest console, has introduced game key cards.</p>



<p>Game key cards enable physical releases; players must be connected to the internet to download the game. They must also keep the cartridge in the console to play the game, even though it is a glorified digital download. While developers have explained that this option makes physical releases more attainable, many players dislike game key cards because they require an internet connection and raise broader concerns about game preservation.</p>







<h2 id="h-bethesda-has-chosen-top-games-on-game-key-cards">Bethesda Has Chosen Top Games on Game Key Cards</h2>



<p>During the Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase on February 5, 2026, Bethesda announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/" id="2569">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a>, Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would all be making their way to the<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908"> Nintendo Switch 2</a> in 2026.</p>



<p>As it turns out, they would later reveal in a <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/17ZQE6BiOoEfIFRJJTtfz2/bethesda-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> that Fallout 4 and Oblivion would be released on game key cards. Additionally, the forthcoming Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Anniversary Edition will have a physical code-in-box launch in April.</p>



<p>This means Indiana Jones is the only game available in full on a physical cartridge.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/baldurs-gate-3/" id="1058">Baldur’s Gate</a> TV series is coming from the mind behind HBO’s The Last of Us series.</p>



<p>The world of video game-to-TV adaptations continues to expand, with news coming out of <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline </a>that Craig Mazin, co-creator of the aforementioned Last of Us series, is creating a series based on Baldur’s Gate 3 for HBO. Mazin will create, write, showrun, and executive produce the forthcoming series.</p>



<p>Jacqueline Lesko, Cecil O’Connor, and Gabriel Marano will also be attached as executive producers. Marano is representing Hasbro Entertainment, which owns the Baldur’s Gate franchise as an extension of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise. Speaking of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Chris Perkins, the longtime Head of Story at Wizards of the Coast, will serve as a consultant on the series.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-details-on-the-forthcoming-series">More Details on the Forthcoming Series</h2>



<p>The show is reportedly drawing from the source material of Baldur’s Gate 3, beginning how the game ends, but with no ties to the current game and development, Mazin has free rein over the direction of the story, which will reportedly be more of a traditional TV series than The Last of Us was. The series is expected to feature existing characters from the popular game, as well as new ones.</p>



<p>There’s also the expectation that the forthcoming TV series will keep the Dungeons &amp; Dragons tradition of leveling characters up through the journey. The series is being designed to coexist alongside another live-action D&amp;D series, Netflix’s The Forgotten Realms.</p>



<h2 id="h-hbo-s-baldur-s-gate-is-far-from-the-only-video-game-to-tv-adaptation-in-the-works">HBO’s Baldur’s Gate Is Far From the Only Video Game-To-TV Adaptation in the Works</h2>



<p>In addition to this series and the aforementioned Last of Us series, which is currently producing its final season, Prime Video is developing a series based on the God of War franchise. Ryan Hurst is slated to play Kratos, and many other casting decisions have been announced in recent weeks. Learn more about that series <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prime-video-casts-thor-and-odin-in-god-of-war/" id="172954">here</a>.</p>



<p>There are also series in development based on Tomb Raider, Life is Strange, and more.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/highguard/" id="3394">Highguard </a>is adding new heroes, a ranked mode, and more on February 6, with the launch of Episode 2.</p>



<p>Highguard has added a ranked mode via <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2019456108734324869" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new patch</a>. Ranked Mode is a 3v3 competitive playlist where all players start in Bronze 3 and climb through seven ranks (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, and Grandmaster), each with three divisions. Players will earn points based on match outcomes, kill bonuses, streaks, and more.</p>



<p>Each episode contains two “Ranked Splits.” Splits change maps and bases. They can also apply balance tweaks. At the episode’s end, players receive rewards based on their final rank, including new cosmetic Banner Frames that increase in prestige at higher tiers.</p>



<p>The first Split will have the following maps: Kingdom, Summit, and Rivermark. The bases included will be Hellmouth, Smuggler’s Den, King’s Lair, Soul Well, Frosthold, and Wellspring.</p>



<p>A new map has also been added to Highguard. In addition to the new ranked mode, they have also added a new location, Skydrift. Described as “uncharted lands of Highguard where maps go blank,” and “hollowed out caverns once home to great winged-beasts,” the new base has been added to the rotation in 3v3 and 5v5.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why.

<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>
