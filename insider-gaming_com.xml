            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6, the latest ambitious shooter in the legendary first-person franchise, is preparing to go free-to-play for a week, starting November 25. In a recent blog post, Electronic Arts (and associated studios) revealed the free trial period that’s opening up for Battlefield 6, which will likely be accompanied by a considerable discount on the game as Black Friday surfaces.</p>



<p>This limited-time, restricted-scope offering will allow players to experience a fair chunk of Battlefield 6 without investing a penny in the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-free-trial-coming-soon">Battlefield 6 Free Trial Coming Soon</h2>



<p>In a blog post on the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/season-1-california-resistance-mid-season-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA website</a>, the Battlefield 6 free trial period was revealed by the team. It was promised that ‘more information’ will be published soon, but for now, we have a description of what the free trial entails:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>From November 25 to December 2, ultimate all-out warfare is free** for everyone. Fight in intense urban combat on the streets of Cairo. Drop into iconic SoCal landscapes turned into battlegrounds on Eastwood and Blackwell Fields. Enter Battlefield’s iconic massive scale warfare in Conquest or Breakthrough. Go head-to-head destroying enemy cargo in Sabotage. Engage in pure high-intensity close-quarters combat in Team Deathmatch. This is your call to squad up. Make it count.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This free trial showcases Battlefield 6’s new mode, Sabotage, which was released in the latest update just days ago. Typically, first-person shooters like Call of Duty and anything else in that vein offer free trial <strong>weekends</strong>, so an entire week for Battlefield 6’s free trial window is obviously above and beyond.</p>



<p>It’s widely assumed that the progress you rack up during the free trial week will roll over into the full game, should you choose to upgrade at any point. In a week, you can grind the living daylights out of the game and unlock stacks of content, so you might be persuaded if a good enough sale goes live to accompany the trial.</p>







<p>In our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/">Battlefield 6 review</a>, we said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s plenty of juice in the tank where the multiplayer platform is concerned, and Electronic Arts’ studios will keep it plugged full of content for a while.</p>
</blockquote>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-game-awards-removes-nomination-for-the-first-time-ever.1357510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the first time ever, a nomination has been revoked from The Game Awards. The game in question, Megabonk, was disqualified with permission from the creator after a misunderstanding.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Since 2014,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-most-watched-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>&nbsp;have become a big celebration for the best of gaming each year. Hosted by Geoff Keighley, it’s become home to several big reveals and moments, especially for Game of the Year. With a year as big as 2025 was for games, the competition is sure to be worthy of watching. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nominations for the awards</a> came out earlier this week and had some snubs and surprises. However, it seems there’s already been a shakeup with one of the nominated games.</p>

<p>The situation unraveled after The Game Awards nominations earlier this week. Megabonk, one of the games’ up for Best Debut Indie Game, was a pretty popular title when it released. However, the creator, who, <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in the Tweets</a>, goes by John Megabonk, asked to be removed from the nominations. As for why, he said the following:</p>



<p>“<strong>I’m withdrawing from The Game Awards. It’s an honor and a dream for Megabonk to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately i don’t think it qualifies for the category ‘Debut Indie Game,’</strong>” the creator said. “<strong>I’ve made games in the past under different studio names, so Megabonk is not my debut game.</strong>“<a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603"></a></p>



<p>The category, Best Debut Indie Game, is reserved for those who’ve published their first-ever game as a studio, so those who have, even under a different name, shouldn’t count. Geoff Keighley <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990899068022005881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">later posted on Twitter</a> that, after the creator’s comments, that <strong>Megabonk would be taken off the list</strong>. This now leaves&nbsp;Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, Despolete, and Dispatch as the sole nominees. While it is shocking to see, at least the creator was honest about the situation. Unfortunately, Megabonk was only nominated for the one category so, while they won’t be going home with anything this year, at least it was on a good note.</p>







<p>What do you think of Megabonk being disqualified from The Game Awards? Do you agree with the withdrawal? Did you think it could’ve won the category?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twisted-metal-peacock-third-season-new-showrunner/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A third season of Peacock’s Twisted Metal, based on the PlayStation racing series, has been announced. However, the renewal does come with the news of a change in showrunners.</p>







<p>Debuting in 2023, Twisted Metal loosely adapts the games from the early PlayStation era. Featuring fan-favorite characters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sweet-tooth-is-a-violent-man-in-twisted-metal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sweet Tooth</a>, the show was a surprise success for Peacock. It helped that the show sported massive talent like Captain America’s Anthony Mackie and Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s Stephanie Beatriz. A second season was quickly greenlit and released earlier this year to decent reviews. Now, Peacock has revealed that the action show is coming back for another season, but not without some creative changes.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Variety first covered the news that Twisted Metal is being <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/twisted-metal-renewed-season-3-david-reed-showrunner-1236584674/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">renewed for a third season</a>. Apparently, the second season was a hit for Peacock, being the second returning original scripted season with 993 million minutes watched. However, it isn’t without changes, as show creator and showrunner Michael Jonathan Smith is exiting. The Cobra Kai creator’s reasons for leaving has not been discussed. In his stead, writer and director David Reed will join current showrunners Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. No other details, like casting or release, is available.</p>



<p>David’s resume is quite a good one, from a glance. His most notable project is as a writer for Prime Video’s The Boys, which is releasing its final season in 2026. Other titles he has worked on include Star Trek: Strange New Worlds and Supernatural, among others. While Michael Jonathan Smith’s departure is a sad one, Reed does seem like a great substitute. </p>
