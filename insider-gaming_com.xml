            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2 has received a brand new update today, patch 01.004.000, which introduces randomly-generated cave systems, new missions, enemies, and more. </p>



<p>Helldivers 2’s Discord was recently discussing co-op split-screen as a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-co-op-split-screen-is-technically-feasible-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technically feasible</a>” feature, with many players hoping it will arrive as one in a new update. We didn’t get split-screen, but Arrowhead has released a massive update, which will have players exploring Terminid Hive Worlds, exterminating abhorrent new enemy types, and completing new missions. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-update-adds-randomly-generated-cave-systems-new-enemies-and-more">Helldivers 2 Update Adds Randomly-Generated Cave Systems, New Enemies, and More</h2>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-hive-worlds">Hive Worlds</h3>



<p>As mentioned, Helldivers 2’s new update will have players exploring Hive Worlds, which are randomly-generated giant cave systems that pose a new tactical challenge. While exploring these caves, players will find new disgusting flora and fauna as well as advanced Terminid life. Players will discover acid lakes and advanced bug spires on the Hive World surface, and there will be hols in the room to use the stratagems. Walls are destructible, making it slightly easier to navigate in these caves, but they will surely be dark and scary. </p>



<h3 id="h-new-missions">New Missions</h3>



<p>The new update will task players with exploring the deepest corners of these caves and destroying the Spore Lung to stop its infectious Gloom from spreading. Players will need to take over the GATER mobile oil rig to extract the mysterious oily substance from these Hive Worlds. Lastly, many missions will require players to collect resources and destroy enemy threats to these caves. </p>



<h3 id="h-new-enemies">New Enemies</h3>



<p>Coming to the new enemies in the latest Helldivers 2 update 01.004.000, players will be faced against four new types: Rupture Spewer, Rupture Warrior, Rupture Charger, and Dragonroach. The Spewer emerges from the ground to “spew its undemocratic pestilence on the innocent”. The Warrior is a Gloom-induced mutation that prefers open-air movement. The Chargers tunnel through the ground at high speeds. Lastly, the Dragonroach is an oversized creature that flies and circles its prey and can also spew air-combustible acid. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Set coordinates for the Terminid Hive Worlds – and pack the extra-strength bug spray. We’re exterminating the galaxy’s most disgusting infestation in a patriotic payback mission of no mercy.</p><p>Abhorrent new enemy types, thrilling missions, strange worlds and spectacular beasts… <a href="https://t.co/WDD7qFeWro">pic.twitter.com/WDD7qFeWro</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1962802722517786694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h3 id="h-balancing-and-fixes">Balancing and Fixes</h3>



<p>Several new balancing changes have been made, including buffs to the Orbital Smoke, Orbital E.M.S., and Mortar E.M.S. stratagems. Moreover, stratagems, throwables, and Boosters like Mortar E.M.S., Orbital E.M.S., Stun Grenade, Urchin, and Stun Hellpod have had their stagger strength increase. Conversely, all of their stagger impulse have been reduced to zero. </p>



<p>A plethora of fixes have been implemented across various aspects of the game, including Crashes, soft locks, weapons, stratagems, enemies, missions, and miscellaneous areas. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-patch-notes-in-helldivers-2-01-004-000-september-2-update">All Patch Notes in Helldivers 2 01.004.000 September 2 Update</h2>



<h3><strong>New Additions</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Hive Worlds</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Randomly-generated giant cave systems</li>



<li>A new tactical challenge</li>



<li>Discover disgusting flora and fauna and advanced Terminid life</li>



<li>Hive World surface – acid lakes and advanced bug spires</li>



<li>Holes in the cave roof will allow stratagems to be called down</li>



<li>Destructible walls within the caves to navigate</li>



<li>Bring a flashlight!</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Missions</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Delve deep into the caves to destroy the Spore Lung and stop its infectious Gloom spread</li>



<li>Take control of the GATER mobile oil rig and siphon the mysterious oily substance from the surface of Hive Worlds</li>



<li>Undertake more missions to extract resources and destroy the enemy threat on Hive Worlds</li>



<li>Have Super Earth approved levels of fun!</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>New Enemies</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Rupture Spewer; The foul Rupture Spewer bursts from the ground only to spew its undemocratic pestilence on the innocent. Upon returning to its dark warrens, it is believed to consume its own dead in order to generate more of its corrosive acid.</li>



<li>Rupture Warrior; A product of Gloom-induced mutation, the Rupture Warrior has lost the UV-insulating chitin layer that would protect its internal organs from solar radiation damage. Captured specimens prefer burrowing to open-air movement, a pattern indicative of subconscious shame at their own undemocratic ways.</li>



<li>Rupture Charger; When this armored beast senses the presence of Liberty, it buries itself underground to escape its light. Its Charger instincts compel it to tunnel through the ground at high speeds, emerging only to attack those who represent the Liberty that blinds it so.</li>



<li>Dragonroach; This oversized affront to Free skies everywhere circles its would-be prey, swooping down intermittently to bespew them with air-combustible acid. A spineless tactic befitting an exoskeletal monstrosity. </li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-balancing"><strong>Balancing</strong></h3>



<p>Unified “non-explosive Orbitals” so they have the same projectile damage and destruction values as the Orbital gas. This effects:</p>



<p><strong><br>Orbital smoke</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Increased Projectile Damage&nbsp; 0 → 300&nbsp;</li>



<li>Increased Projectile AP 0 → 7</li>



<li>Increased Projectile Demolition strength 30 → 50</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Orbital E.M.S</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Increased Projectile Damage 250 → 300&nbsp;</li>



<li>Increased Projectile AP 3 → 7</li>



<li>Increased Projectile Demolition strength 30 → 50</li>
</ul>



<p>Unified Stun explosions work. They all apply the stun effect on the explosion and not only on the status effect volume. This effects:</p>



<ul>
<li>Orbital E.M.S</li>



<li>Mortar E.M.S</li>
</ul>



<p>Changed how all stun explosions work in that they now initially stagger the enemy they stun but also without ragdolling the player if hit by such an explosion</p>



<p><strong>Throwables</strong></p>



<p>Stun grenade</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased stagger strength 0 -&gt; 50</li>
</ul>



<p>Urchin</p>



<ul>
<li>Decreased stagger impulse 15 -&gt; 0&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Stratagems</strong></p>



<p>Orbital E.M.S</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased stagger strength 10 -&gt; 50</li>



<li>Decreased stagger impulse 40 → 0</li>
</ul>



<p>Mortar E.M.S</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased stagger strength 10 -&gt; 50</li>



<li>Decreased stagger impulse 40 → 0&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Booster</strong></p>



<p>Stun Hellpod</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased stagger strength 10 -&gt; 50</li>



<li>Decreased stagger impulse 20 → 0</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-fixes"><strong>Fixes</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Crash Fixes &amp; Softlocks</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed a rare crash caused by multiple players having the MA5C AR equipped on the super destroyer</li>



<li>Fixed crash that could occur during hot-joining</li>



<li>Fixed a rare crash that could occur when dropping backpacks</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Weapons &amp; Stratagem Fixes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixes for mute AX/LAS-5 ‘GUARD DOG’ ROVER audio</li>



<li>Audio fixes for multiple weapons not having reverb applied to them</li>



<li>Fixed Hellpod payloads being targetable by guidance system</li>



<li>GL-52 De-Escalator stratagem input code now begins with a down arrow, inline with other support weapon stratagems</li>



<li>Motivational Shocks Booster no longer applies to enemies</li>



<li>Fixed the StA X3 WASP Launcher firemode – it will no longer fire in Semi-Auto mode after switching from Artillery firing mode</li>



<li>Fixed guidance system targeting Tanks incorrectly</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fix flickering VFX shadows in some areas.</li>

<li>Fixed chat typing animations – Helldivers no longer suffer from fat fingers and will use their writing pads when typing chat messages.</li>



<li>Fixed the Adreno-Defibrillator status effect not affecting Helldivers inside combat walkers</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the planetary hazard damaged Hellbombs will visually appear to explode twice when shot by GL-21 Grenade Launcher, from the shooter’s POV</li>
</ul>

<p>No Man’s Sky is enjoying a huge resurgence on Steam following the anniversary update released last week, reaching heights it has not been at in years.</p>



<p>Initially released in 2016, No Man’s Sky endured a troubled launch, but has established itself as one of gaming’s biggest comebacks in the years since, following a wealth of free updates.</p>



<p>The most recent, the Anniversary Update, launched on August 28 and in the days since, the playerbase on Steam has seen a huge spike in its playerbase.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/275850/charts/#max" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB data</a>, No Man’s Sky hit a peak of 98,285 concurrent players yesterday, September 1, the highest total that the game has seen since it’s release nine years ago.</p>



<p>The numbers are narrowly ahead of July 2018, the previously post-release high that saw 97,000 concurrent players, but have edged past that number to set a new post-launch record.</p>



<p>Although still some way off the all-time peak of over 212,000 players on Steam from launch, it shows that the dedicated work from Hello Games has not gone unnoticed, with players still keen to enjoy the massive adventure across the stars.</p>



<p>The signs are certainly promising for Hello Games ahead of the release of Light No Fire, the upcoming title for the studio that has been teased, with a release date yet to be set.</p>



<p>Light No Fire is the sixth most wishlisted game on Steam, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, beneath only Hollow Knight: Silksong, Subnautica 2, Deadlock, Borderlands 4, and Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>With many of those games due to be released in the coming months, Light No Fire could rise further up the charts.</p>
