<p>Assassinâ€™s Creed Shadows is Ubisoftâ€™s second-biggest launch to date, just behind Assassinâ€™s Creed Valhalla.</p>



<p>Thatâ€™s according to Insider Gaming sources, who have provided data for the last three mainline Assassinâ€™s Creed titles. The information was <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1904177799419634137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted public on my ow</a><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1904177799419634137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">n</a><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1904177799419634137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> X</a> (formerly Twitter) account a few hours ago. </p>



<p>According to our sources, who have obtained the information via Ubisoftâ€™s own tracking tools (and have provided such data on past titles), it shows that Assassinâ€™s Creed Shadows is behind that of Valhalla, but ahead of Odyssey.</p>



<p>Last week, Ubisoft announced that Assassinâ€™s Creed Shadows had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-surpasses-odyssey-and-origins-launch-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">past two million players just two days after launch</a> and one million players one day after launch.</p>



<p>According to the data, Assassinâ€™s Creed Valhalla achieved 2.55 million players on its first day, whereas Odyssey achieved just shy of 1M (roughly 430,00 during early access).</p>



<p>At the time of writing (March 24), Shadows is tracking to hit three million players in the coming days. According to its trajectory, Shadows could hit roughly six million players within its first month, but its worth pointing out that the game has released in Q1, compared to other successful Assassinâ€™s Creed games that release in the holiday season.</p>



<p>Assassinâ€™s Creed Valhalla did 8M in its first month, whereas Odyssey did 3.4 million. </p>



<p>At the time of writing, Odyssey currently has the most unique players of any Assassinâ€™s Creed title sitting at over 40 million.</p>



<p>As always pointed out online, these are <strong>player numbers and not sales</strong>, but we should here more on the games performance from Ubisoft themselves in the coming months. </p>

<p>Activision has revealed the evolution of Verdansk, which was first released in March 2020 as the first Call of Duty: Warzone map. Itâ€™s coming back in just a few days, and fans are excitedâ€¦ Mostly.</p>



<p>In a new video published online, Activisionâ€™s teams uncovered everything that went into creating Verdansk all over again, breaking down the technical upgrades made to make it feel like an all-new game while retaining the classic feel of Warzone. Of course, the game will use the new movement engine, so that wonâ€™t feel the same as it did five years ago.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-s-new-about-verdansk-2025">Whatâ€™s New About Verdansk 2025?</h2>



<p>Verdansk has been rebuilt for 2025, five years after it first surfaced.</p>



<p>The team has upgraded the technology powering Verdansk in Warzone. It has better quality overall and better rendering, and things like grass, foliage, mud, and water are more accurate, realistic, and have better physics.</p>



<div><article><p><span>The map that started it all, rebuilt from the ground up ðŸ’¥

Take a deep dive with </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BeenoxTeam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@BeenoxTeam</a><span> at this first look at Verdansk â€“ returning April 3 ðŸª‚ </span></p></article></div>







<p>Lighting has had a boost as well, with the global lighting ambience undergoing several changes. The team has added a new high-resolution sky box, upgraded bounces, light-map quality, and better transitions between interiors and exteriors. Shadows, backlighting, and indoor lighting have all undergone substantial enhancements.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-studio-is-making-verdansk-2025">Which Studio Is Making Verdansk 2025?</h2>



<p>It was noted that Beenox, Raven, and High Moon Studios all worked collaboratively on Verdansk 2025, bringing together the â€˜best technology available todayâ€™ to ensure the map is â€˜better than everâ€™. At the same time, it was stressed that it remains â€˜faithfulâ€™ to Infinity Wardâ€™s 2020 creation which changed the face of the battle royale genre forever.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-verdansk-come-back-to-warzone">When Does Verdansk Come Back to Warzone?</h2>



<p>The Verdansk release date will arrive with Season 03 on April 3, 2025. Itâ€™s almost five years to the day since Warzone first launched, when COVID-19 was driving millions of people into their homes and onto Call of Duty.</p>



<p>It was a different world back then, and Warzone would come to make content creators overnight sensations and turn average gamers into battle royale beasts with the hottest meta weapons on the block. I have fond memories of Verdansk, but it helps that I had a great crew to play with and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-vibes-warzone/">the vibes were immense</a>.</p>



<p>All thatâ€™s left now is to kick off your Verdansk countdown and start deciding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-tac-map-reveal-pois/">where youâ€™ll land</a> when the map comes back to Warzone on April 3.</p>
