<p>Obbe Vermeij, former Rockstar developer and sharer of secrets, has revealed an intriguing tidbit about Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on the game’s 20th anniversary. The developer – who still works in the industry today – is known far and wide across social media for his insights and behind-the-scenes glimpses at the development of many Grand Theft Auto games.</p>



<p>His latest factoid about San Andreas is pretty interesting, and it comes as the game celebrates a major milestone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-20-years-as-the-goat">20 Years as the GOAT</h2>



<p>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is considered one of the best games of all time. It’s a memorable, expansive adventure that took players across a series of cities that made up ‘San Andreas’. It was one of the games that defined a generation, and for Rockstar, it was a dizzying success that served as a benchmark for things to come.</p>



<p>Recently, Obbe Vermeij, who worked on GTA 3, GTA Vice City, San Andreas, and GTA IV, took to social media to reflect on twenty years of San Andreas history.</p>



<p>He wrote that the original plan was to have the game map split up into three separate portions, only reachable by inter-city travel made up of trains and planes. This would enable the team to circumvent ‘tight’ memory restrictions, and it would be easier to differentiate between separate assets needed to make each city feel unique.</p>



<p>In the end, an executive meeting at Rockstar North changed the path of history and settled on one huge map that was tougher to develop but much more impressive overall.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>20 years ago we released Grand Theft Auto – San Andreas.</p><p>The original plan was for the 3 cities to be on separate maps. The player would travel between the cities using trains and planes.<br>(Gta 1 and 2 also had three cities on separate maps)</p><p>Memory was very tight on the ps2 and… <a href="https://t.co/kUMxR9Kt96">pic.twitter.com/kUMxR9Kt96</a></p></div>— Obbe Vermeij (@ObbeVermeij) <a href="https://twitter.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1849940437596787037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Vermeij then went on to reminisce about midnight launches and how impressive it was that San Andreas pulled in such massive crowds before the internet and social media allowed developers and publishers to generate much of a buzz.</p>



<p>Back then, it would have been a couple of TV spots, a trailer or two, and perhaps an article here and there in a magazine or one of the few websites around at the time:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The internet was crap and apart from a couple of trailers, gamers didn’t know too much about the game. </p>



<p>I went to the biggest store near the R*North offices, which was HMV on Princess Street, Edinburgh. Even though it was a drizzly night, the line meandered all through the store and spilled out onto the street.</p>



<p>It was mind-blowing to see all those people so excited, going home to play the game all through the night.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GTA: San Andreas was my first ‘launch day game’ back in 2004, and I poured thousands of hours into it over the years that followed. It’s a masterpiece, and it’ll always have a place in my heart.</p>

<p>The US Copyright Office has determined that it <strong>will not </strong>alter existing DMCA rules to allow for the preservation of video games in repositories and archives across the country. This news comes following a three-year battle by the Video Game History Foundation to desperately find a path to preservation for games that are in danger of being lost forever.</p>



<p>Previously, the organisation revealed that around 87% of all games released before 2010 are ‘virtually inaccessible’ owing to changes in technology, consumer habits, retail operating models, and the simple passing of time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-remember-them">Remember Them</h2>



<p>Many gamers appreciate a blast from the past – it’s why some games do so well when they are remade, or when modern variants introduce elements from past releases.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG, I’m looking at you.</p>



<p>If we go beyond that and look at <strong>true </strong>nostalgia – retro gaming – we enter a vast world filled with consoles, games, and peripherals from yesteryear, all of which are steadily falling into an abyss due to a lack of <strong>official preservation practices</strong>. While books, movies, music, and the like are all preserved under DMCA law, video games have never fallen into a legitimate category.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-24563.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the retort</a> published by the US Copyright Office, which leant on comments made by the Entertainment Software Association, it was said that the petition from the VGHF was kicked because they:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>… did not propose a clear requirement to know who the users are or why they want to access a game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier, the ESA said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Enabling widespread remote access to preserved games with minimal supervision would present a serious risk to an important market.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Video Game History Foundation insists it’s not finished with its crusade, but the rules are relatively black and white right now. In an ideal world, a digital repository of archived games would exist for users to check them out and access their contents through emulation platforms, but it admittedly becomes quite hard to police who is accessing them, and when, and <strong>where</strong>.</p>



<p>Do you think video games need to be preserved in this way, or should the retro collector market be enough to suffice? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The Season One Battle Pass for Black Ops 6 is sure to be a momentous occasion, bringing with it a ton of exciting Operator Skins, Emblems, Calling Cards, and new Weapons. We’re here to take a look at the latest details on the Black Ops 6 Season One Battle Pass and its potential release date.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> is continuing on with the successful live-service, seasonal model of its predecessors. Battle Passes aren’t going anywhere anytime soon: They add to the longevity of each CoD season, give you more to grind for, and if you’re thorough and play enough to earn all the CoD Points, you can pretty much pay for your next pass—<em>for free</em>.</p>



<p>Details have already leaked regarding Black Ops and Warzone Season 1, so delve into Battle Pass talk.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-black-ops-6-season-one-battle-pass-release-date">Do we Know the Black Ops 6 Season One Battle Pass Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Our home for the next year. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Activision has yet to formally announce the Black Ops 6 Season 1 Battle Pass date; however, based on a Call of Duty and Caesers Pizza promotional crossover, <strong>Nov. 14</strong> looks to be the date Activision has penciled in for the Season One Battle Pass.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season One date</a> was spotted by X user <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@BobBetworkUK_</a> on Oct. 21, and they provided a screenshot, with a caption saying, “<strong>Black Ops 6 x Warzone Season 1 starts November 14th</strong>.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Caesers Pizza has already proven to be a great partner for Call of Duty fans by offering players the chance to grab <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-double-xp-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Double XP</a>. Now, you can start planning for Nov. 14, and get some pizza in for the start of Season One.</p>



<p>Naturally, the Season One Battle Pass is expected to go live at the same time as the new seasonal content. Long-story short, brace yourselves for the likely debut of the Black Ops 6 Battle Pass on Nov. 14!</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-what-s-in-the-black-ops-6-season-one-battle-pass">Do we know what’s in the Black Ops 6 Season One Battle Pass?</h2>



<p>Due to there being no official release date for Black Ops 6, we don’t know any of the content Activison has in store for Season One.</p>



<p>We do know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-nuketown-in-black-ops-6-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown is coming to Black Ops 6</a>, <strong>but it won’t be part of the Season One content drop</strong>—the legendary map is returning on Nov. 1 to broaden the multiplayer’s large pool of maps.</p>



<p>For now, we anticipate the usual slew of contents usually seen in a mainline CoD content drop: New maps, new playlist game modes, new Operator Skins and cosmetics, new weapons, and of course, the Season One Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we’ll be sure to update you once Activision does finally announce the Season one roadmap for BLOPS 6 and Warzone Season One.</p>
