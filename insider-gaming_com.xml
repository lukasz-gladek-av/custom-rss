<p>The popular Roblox game Grow a Garden is becoming a film from Story Kitchen. Even more so, the original developers are playing a big part in its production.</p>



<p>As part of the massively popular Roblox game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-square-enix-boss-calls-roblox-grow-a-garden-somewhat-evil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grow a Garden</a> is an idle multiplayer farming simulator. Players would buy and plant many types of crops and see their garden grow, hence the game. Despite the simple concept, it reached insane player counts in 2025, even beating out Fortnite. There’s clearly demand for more Grow a Garden and, now, it’ll be met on the big screen.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/grow-a-garden-movie-story-kitchen-in-development-1236608058/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exclusive article from Deadline</a>, the outlet confirmed that <strong>Roblox’s Grow a Garden is being adapted into a film. </strong>The movie is being produced by Story Kitchen, a well-known name in the adaptation landscape. Furthermore, <strong>the original creators</strong> will join the project to help with its development, acting as producers. A statement from Story Kitchen co-founders Dmitri M. Johnson and Michael Lawrence Goldberg is available on Deadline, saying,</p>



<p>“<strong><em>Grow a Garden</em>&nbsp;is exactly the kind of imaginative, heartfelt world we love to adapt</strong>,” said the duo in the statement, “<strong>an uplifting story-world rooted in play, creativity, and community</strong>.”</p>



<p>Plot details and release information is not available at this time. However, a brief description of the film <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/grow-a-garden-movie-story-kitchen-in-development-1236608058/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">is available on Deadline</a>. The film, currently in early development, will maintain the whimsical spirit of Grow a Garden and focus on nurturing and friendship. Given the simple concept, there’s a lot of room to experiment and craft something. Story Kitchen is producing almost a dozen game adaptations like Shinobi, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-getting-a-movie-in-case-you-missed-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, Split Fiction, and Tomb Raider. Hopefully, the fruits of its labor will result in something, well, fruitful.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Unbeatable Delayed To December Within Hours of Launch]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a shocking move, D-CELL GAMES’ Unbeatable has been delayed to early December, with less than 12 hours until its planned launch. As to why the last-minute delay happened, it seems an unreleaseable bug was found and needs to be fixed urgently.</p>



<p>Announced via Kickstarter in 2021, Unbeatable is an anime-inspired rhythm game releasing on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. As vocalist Beat, you’ll resist a tyrannical government that outlawed music. With the help of your band, you’ll bring music back to the world via engaging rhythm gameplay. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">demo for the game</a> was released on PC and PlayStation 5 and was well-received by fans. The game was originally set to release on November 6th, but according to the developer, it won’t launch until December.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a developer post on Steam</a>, RJ Lake, one of the game’s directors, announced that <strong>Unbeatable is now coming out on December 9th</strong>, <strong>2025</strong>. The game was <strong>expected to launch in less than 12 hours</strong>, so the delay is very last-minute. As to why, the team cites a <strong>low-repro progression blocker</strong> that would require pushing the console release date back if fixed. To that end, to ensure the game releases on all platforms simultaneously, it has been pushed to December.</p>



<p>Delays for games are a rare occurrence, much <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less at the last minute</a>. Given the popularity of Unbeatable, it’s sure to be disappointing. However, D-CELL GAMES does mention that, with the extra time, it’ll be able to work on some pre-launch content it couldn’t get to. So, while it’ll be a month before we get to play it, the version we’ll get will hopefully be the best possible one.</p>
