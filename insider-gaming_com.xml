<p>Call of Duty is arguably the most impactful first-person shooter series ever made. What started as a World War II experiment turned out to be one of the best-selling franchises ever concocted, and today, the yearly Call of Duty release still nets tens of millions of sales. In this breakdown, we’re looking at all Call of Duty games, ranked by their impact and how good they were.</p>



<p>I’m aware that’s one of the most inflammatory things I’ll ever say and that this is mostly subjective, but take a look through and see how you feel about this Call of Duty ranking.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-call-of-duty-games-ranked">All Call of Duty Games Ranked</h2>



<h3 id="h-21-call-of-duty-vanguard">21. Call of Duty: Vanguard</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Vanguard looked great on the surface but it was a paltry game that disappointed fans everywhere when it was released in 2021. It boasted one of the weakest competitive ecosystems in years and everything from the short-lived campaign to the multiplayer platform lacked something. </p>



<p>Sledgehammer Games tried to save Vanguard by weaving in maps from older games, but it wasn’t enough. It also heralded the arrival of Caldera, a Warzone map that pulled players away from Verdansk, and that’s often seen as the biggest mistake Activision has ever made.</p>



<h3 id="h-20-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023">20. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Ah, Modern Warfare III. The ‘DLC’ Call of Duty game.</p>



<p>When Modern Warfare III was released in 2023, fans were dismayed at the 3-hour campaign and the fact that it felt more like an expansion to 2022’s Modern Warfare II. In many ways, it was, and despite Activision’s attempts to placate fans by saying it was a premium release, everyone who invested in it felt conned.</p>



<p>Not good.</p>







<h3 id="h-19-call-of-duty-black-ops-4">19. Call Of Duty: Black Ops 4</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 took the unusual route of being the only mainline entry in the series to completely bypass the campaign, opting for the traditional multiplayer modes and the series’ first foray into the world of Battle Royale with its Blackout mode. </p>



<p>This served as a precursor to the popular Warzone mode that would be released in 2020. Overall, it was a fun iteration of Call of Duty, but not having a campaign hindered any long-term replayability once Warzone and the next entry in the series were released.</p>



<p>Black Ops 4 came out in 2018, and to this day, it was Activision’s last attempt at a futuristic Call of Duty game. Make of that what you will.</p>



<h3 id="h-18-call-of-duty-3">18. Call of Duty 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty 3 is likely the game you haven’t played and you aren’t really missing much. This entry is the only one never to be released on PC, and with consoles being multiple generations ahead now, being able to go back and replay it is difficult, so it’s best to skip this and just start your <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-games-like-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> journey with the next entry.</p>



<h3 id="h-17-call-of-duty-infinite-warfare">17. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Infinite Warfare was Activision’s final attempt at taking Call of Duty into the future before going back to its roots with WWII. It would flip back into the near future with Black Ops 4 in 2018, but you’ve seen where that ended up on this list of all Call of Duty games ranked.</p>



<p>This is a game that often divides fans as it receives both praise and criticism depending on who you ask, but this marks the end of a dark period in the franchise and I think we can all agree that Call of Duty has seen much better entries in the years since.</p>



<h3 id="h-16-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-2022">16. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Modern Warfare II was a short, forgettable experience that players didn’t gel with. It marked an all-time low for the series, and the game’s competitive ecosystem didn’t fare too well either. It didn’t have the energy that previous games had, and while the campaign wasn’t bad, it was just far too short to keep players engaged for long – and it was buggy as all hell.</p>



<p>It’s not the worst Call of Duty game ever, but it’s far, <strong>far </strong>from being the best.</p>



<h3 id="h-15-call-of-duty-wwii">15. Call of Duty: WWII</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Following three years of the Call of Duty series going into the future, Activision went back to its roots with a World War II-era game. Although it was a good change of pace, Activision failed to deliver and it quickly became a forgotten title in the series as there have been better World War II-era entries before and since. </p>



<p>It is worth playing the campaign if you can get the game cheaply enough, but you won’t miss much if you bypass this entry. Many will tell you that WWII had solid multiplayer, but they’re remembering it wrong…</p>



<h3 id="h-14-call-of-duty-black-ops-3">14. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>After Sledgehammer Games took the series into the future with Advanced Warfare, Treyarch followed suit with Black Ops 3. As with other futuristic Call of Duty games, Black Ops 3 cemented the fact that the series doesn’t work as a sci-fi shooter. </p>



<p>Black Ops 3 does have its moments though, including a great Zombies mode. But when compared to the previous two entries in the series, Black Ops 3 doesn’t hold up.</p>



<h3 id="h-13-call-of-duty-ghosts">13. Call of Duty: Ghosts</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Like Infinite Warfare, Call of Duty: Ghosts is a game that divides opinions. Some players have fond memories of it while some think it is one of the worst entries in the series.</p>



<p>This game did serve as a precursor for what would become more standard with multiplayer games in the future in that it featured various collaborations with pop-culture icons, including Snoop Dogg as an announcer and both Michael Myers from Halloween and Predator being playable characters on DLC maps.</p>



<p>We all know how that panned out, though.</p>



<h3 id="h-12-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare">12. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Advanced Warfare was a fairly forgettable title that expanded on the jetpack era of Call of Duty, sitting in the middle of the series that spanned Black Ops II to 2018’s Black Ops 4. The campaign featured a solid cast fronted by the likes of Kevin Spacey and Troy Baker, but looking back, I can’t recall a single detail of the story.</p>



<p>Sledgehammer Games tried to get creative with the UI and various other mechanics in Advanced Warfare, which earns the game some extra points when we’re looking at all Call of Duty games ranked, but it wasn’t enough to push it into the top ten COD games ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-11-call-of-duty-2">11. Call of Duty 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It was immediately clear after the first game that Activision had a winner on its hands, but few could have predicted the rise that it would go on to have. </p>



<p>Call of Duty 2 is more of the same when compared to the first entry, with one of the most interesting facts being that it wasn’t released on PlayStation. This means that it is understandable if many players haven’t had the opportunity to play it, but it is worth hunting down if you haven’t played this great entry in the series.</p>



<p>For many of today’s OGs, Call of Duty 2’s multiplayer platform is where <strong>it all began</strong>.</p>







<h3 id="h-10-call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">10. Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>In 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Activision’s studios introduced Black Ops Cold War, a game built on the back of a work-from-home initiative and excessive crunch. It featured one of the shortest development cycles ever, but despite that, it wasn’t bad. It featured a stellar multiplayer ecosystem that engaged many millions of players, and the campaign wasn’t awful.</p>



<p>It had a somewhat bizarre Zombies mode that didn’t resonate too well with fans, but it was ambitious and it gave them something else in terms of meat on the bones away from strictly multiplayer or the COD campaign.</p>



<p>It’s a love-hate game for many, but I for one adored Cold War.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3">9. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>One of the more interesting things to note about Modern Warfare 3 is it seemed to be released on everything – even the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS. Talk about accessibility.</p>



<p>Given that it was the final chapter of the original Modern Warfare series, the marketing for Modern Warfare 3 was very extensive. What was ultimately delivered ticked many boxes for fans, and it introduced some of the best core elements that we’ve come to know and expect from a Call of Duty game today.</p>



<p>For instance, Kill Confirmed debuted in Modern Warfare 3, and that’s now considered one of the best Call of Duty game modes ever. </p>



<p>The campaign was a perfect ending to several years of Modern Warfare, the Spec Ops / Survival Mode was brilliant, and the multiplayer platform was polished.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-call-of-duty-world-at-war">8. Call of Duty: World At War</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty: World At War is the second game by Treyarch in what would become the yearly trend of going back and forth with Infinity Ward. </p>



<p>World At War felt like Treyarch was finding its feet and getting ready to become a dominant force in the franchise with the Black Ops series. This game also marked the first time the popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-will-have-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies mode</a> would be featured in the series and became a huge selling point for the game and is still worth going back to today if you’re a fan of the mode, it still holds up very well.</p>



<p>Some of World at War’s maps are still being reused in modern games, which goes to show how beloved the game’s multiplayer was.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2019">7. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Modern Warfare (2019) was seen as a soft reboot of the franchise that had pulled in so many millions of gamers over the years. It was dubbed a resurgence of the series, and the anticipation in the market before it dropped was nothing short of palpable.</p>



<p>When it was delivered, players worldwide fell in love with the game’s campaign, and the new movement mechanics woven into the multiplayer platform would set a standard for years to come. It also served as the basis for Call of Duty: Warzone, one of the top battle royale games ever made and one of the best COD games of all time.</p>



<p>Modern Warfare dwindled with II and III, but the opening title is memorable, and that’s why it sits so high on this list of all Call of Duty games ranked.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">6. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here’s a surprising entry.</p>



<p>In 2024, Treyarch and Raven Software combined forces to release Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the most highly anticipated game in the series in <strong>years</strong>. It took years to develop, and when it was finally pushed live, it became the biggest Call of Duty launch in history. </p>



<p>It’s not perfect, but it took all the failings of the previous games and turned them upside down. </p>



<p>For instance, it had a meaty campaign that took around 7 – 9 hours to finish, provided you wanted to collect all the hidden goodies and achievements. It returned to a round-based Zombies operating model across two phenomenal maps, and the multiplayer platform featured decent maps, all-new movement mechanics, and a stellar array of weapons.</p>



<p>All of a sudden, the internet was ablaze with <strong>Black Ops 6</strong>. From the camo grinds to the intense marketing campaign, everyone knew about Black Ops 6, even people who didn’t play games. It was everywhere, it was everything, and it was arguably the best Call of Duty game released in several years.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-call-of-duty-black-ops-2">5. Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 is often rightfully hailed as one of the best entries in the series. </p>



<p>It features a branching, non-linear campaign with multiple endings, a first for the series, and has one of the most solid multiplayer modes the series has ever seen. </p>



<p>Black Ops 2 grossed over $500 million in its first 24 hours of release, a gaming record that stood until GTA V was released in 2013. It also was the first game in the series to be released on the Wii U, although it is understandable if you never played that version of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-call-of-duty">4. Call of Duty</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Following the departure of many Medal of Honor developers from 2015, Inc., a new studio called Infinity Ward was created and set out to make a new World War shooter, which would quickly go on to become more successful than the Medal of Honor series. </p>



<p>The original Call of Duty game was originally released as a PC exclusive, but it was eventually ported to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as Call of Duty Classic in 2009 following the release of Modern Warfare 2.</p>



<p>It’s where it all began and it’s still one of the highest-rated Call of Duty games ever made, so you can’t say fairer than that.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare">3. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty pivoted away from the World War era and into the modern age with Call of Duty 4, a move that took the series to new heights. </p>



<p>Modern Warfare was released in 2007, the same year as Halo 3, and it helped to push online console gaming into the mainstream as millions of players jumped into the game to battle it out with other players across the world. </p>



<p>Modern Warfare received universal critical acclaim, with its Metacritic scores ranging from 92-94 on most major platforms. It’s often considered the starting point for many veteran Call of Duty fans, and its simplicity is desperately sought out by players even today. Things have become too complicated in the Call of Duty space – this is when things were simple enough to just be enjoyable.</p>



<p>In 2016, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Remastered was released, with Activision’s teams diving back into the full game and recreating what made the series so great. To this day, it’s the only Call of Duty game to be remastered in full, multiplayer included.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-call-of-duty-black-ops">2. Call of Duty: Black Ops</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>By the end of the decade, Infinity Ward had firmly established the Modern Warfare series and Treyarch needed a sub-series for its bi-yearly releases. </p>



<p>Black Ops is set during the Cold War in the 1960s and the opinion of which series is better is often fairly split, with some preferring Treyarch’s offerings and some preferring Infinity Ward’s. The game featured licensed music by the likes of Eminem and The Rolling Stones but notably included an original song by Avenged Sevenfold, a trend that would continue until Black Ops 4. </p>



<p>This game is often considered the peak of Call of Duty, and it’s no wonder why Treyarch has revisited the game’s concepts time and again. By 2024, we’re sitting on <strong>six </strong>Black Ops games, even if they’ve not all reached the expectations players have had for them. </p>



<p>Black Ops was innovative, it had a flawless campaign, a remarkable Zombies mode, and the multiplayer was second to none. It helped ease many into the idea of Call of Duty esports, a concept that would be bolstered immeasurably with Black Ops II.</p>



<p>This is easily a contender for the title of the best Call of Duty game ever released, but it doesn’t quite snag it.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-2009">1. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Modern Warfare 2 is legendary, and that’s all there is to it.</p>



<p>From the expansion of the campaign established in 2007’s COD 4, to a multiplayer platform that users are still logging on to enjoy all these years later, Modern Warfare 2 helped grow the Call of Duty series beyond epic proportions.</p>



<p>In 2023, Modern Warfare III was released with a full remastered mapset pulled from MW2, and it was a win with fans worldwide – particularly the more veteran players who got started on 2009’s MW2.</p>



<p>Even the side content, like the game’s Spec Ops mode, was lauded by fans worldwide.</p>



<p>This game gave rise to some of the most monumental maps ever made, including Terminal and Rust, and every inch of the campaign can be remembered all these years later.</p>



<p>There is nothing bad to say about MW2, and it’s the best Call of Duty game ever made.</p>

<p>Call of Duty is the largest and most impactful first-person shooter franchise ever made. Every year, a new title hits the series and it’s soaked up by tens of millions of players worldwide – it never stops being popular. It’s not the only shooter out there, though. With that being said, we’re piecing together the best games like Call of Duty in this guide, just in case you want an alternative.</p>



<p>Read on to learn about the best games like COD that could replace this shooter series in your library.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-games-like-call-of-duty">Top Games Like Call of Duty</h2>



<p>Call of Duty spans several ‘eras’, from the Second World War to the Cold War, and from near-future theatres of war to the Gulf. It has taken players from space to the jungles of Vietnam, and from stealthy situations to all-out, guns-blazing engagements. It’s hard to compete with that diversity, but here are the best games like Call of Duty that try hard to beat the series.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-counter-strike-2">5. Counter-Strike 2</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Counter-Strike 2, the recently released sequel to CSGO, is another FPS title that is commonly related to Call of Duty. The game is similar to COD’s Search and Destroy mode, which pits teams against each other, as one team tries to defuse the other team’s bomb.</p>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 is an incredibly popular game within the FPS community, making it a great alternative to those who enjoy Call of Duty. It’s only really available to those playing keyboard and mouse on PC platforms, though – so it’s a bit limited and blocked off from the console community.</p>







<h2 id="h-4-titanfall-2">4. Titanfall 2</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Titanfall 2, a large-scale multiplayer FPS game, is often compared to some of COD’s more futuristic titles. Like Black Ops III, Titanfall 2 has similar mechanics such as the jetpack, which allows players to jump higher throughout the maps. Both games have a Team Deathmatch mode and other fun game modes that people can play.</p>



<p>If you enjoyed the futuristic games that Call of Duty has released, then you will love Titanfall 2.</p>







<h2 id="h-3-rainbow-six-siege">3. Rainbow Six: Siege</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six: Siege is another game that draws similarities to COD’s Search and Destroy mode. The game is a 5v5 FPS title, that has modes that include defusing a bomb, saving a hostage and more. While Siege may be a bit slower-paced, both games are still incredibly similar in comparison.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six: Siege is the perfect example of a game that Call of Duty players would highly enjoy.</p>







<h2 id="h-2-halo-infinite">2. Halo Infinite</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Halo series has notoriously been known as a rival to Call of Duty. While the franchise has slowed down on releasing new games, making them inferior to COD, it still is a great alternative to those looking for a similar style of game. The most recent title, Halo Infinite, has various game modes that rival all of the modes in COD.</p>



<p>Halo Infinite, or any game within the Halo series, is a great replacement for those looking for a game similar to Call of Duty.</p>







<h2 id="h-1-battlefield-2042">1. Battlefield 2042</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Battlefield series is arguably the closest thing you’ll get to a modern Call of Duty game. </p>



<p>Battlefield 2042 in particular is one of the best games like Call of Duty, boasting typical first-person shooter combat mechanics spread across a series of maps and modes. In recent years, Call of Duty and Battlefield have become more aligned as Battlefield has become more ‘arcadey’ while Call of Duty has edged more into the bold, ambitious modes that feature vehicles and destruction.</p>



<p>Which game do you prefer when you are not playing Call of Duty? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[5 Best Games Like Fallout | Enter The Apocalypse]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-games-like-fallout/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-best-games-like-fallout-enter-the-apocalypse.1029417/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-games-like-fallout/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fallout is one of the best-known post-apocalyptic multimedia franchises ever made, allowing players to explore vast, open wastelands and carve out a name for themselves after the end of the world. Since spawning in the late 1990s, Fallout has gone on to inspire many similar games. With that in mind, we’re here today to identify the best games like Fallout for you to enjoy <strong>now</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-games-like-fallout">Top Games Like Fallout</h2>



<p>If you’re looking for games similar to Fallout, search no further than this list. We’ve broken down what you need to go off and enjoy another romp through a ruined wasteland, a broken world, and a harrowing story. Strap on your survival gear – you’re going to need it where you’re going.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-the-outer-worlds">5. The Outer Worlds</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>The Outer Worlds </strong>was dubbed ‘like Fallout but in space’ by many, and that’s because it was co-created by teams who once had a hand in developing the Fallout franchise. In The Outer Worlds, players assume control of a character on an open-ended adventure across space, and like in Fallout, how the story unfolds is entirely up to you.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-starfield">4. Starfield</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Starfield </strong>is the latest open-world epic from Bethesda Game Studios, the company responsible for producing every Fallout game since 2008. It’s easily one of the best games like Fallout because it soaks up so many mechanics and elements from 2015’s Fallout 4 and 2018’s Fallout 76.</p>



<p>In Starfield, you’re left to your own devices to explore a monumental map made up of 1,000 planets. It’s a great game with incredible depth, but it doesn’t have that post-apocalyptic element you might be looking for – but our top game like Fallout has that in spades.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-s-t-a-l-k-e-r">3. S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The ‘<strong>STALKER</strong>‘ series is perhaps one of the closest games to Fallout you’ll ever see. It’s a harrowing and intense series set in and around the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, and it tasks players with exploring and surviving the zone, doing battle with mutants, enemy human factions, and ethereal anomalies.</p>



<p>It’s not technically an ‘end-of-the-world’ game, but it’s damn close, and it’s easily one of the best games like Fallout you can play right now.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-the-last-of-us">2. The Last of Us</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>The Last of Us</strong> tells one of the most emotional and heart-wrenching stories of the end of the world that you’ll ever see represented in games. Like most Fallout games, The Last of Us’ story is about being some of the few survivors remaining after an apocalyptic event, and both franchises deal with concepts of loss, combat, revenge, and suffering.</p>



<p>The Last of Us is much more ‘serious’ than Fallout, and side-by-side, they look and feel nothing alike, but you can’t escape the fact that these two franchises represent the crème de la crème of post-apocalyptic gaming.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-metro">1. Metro</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Metro </strong>is my number-one pick for games like Fallout. This series has almost unfolded in parallel alongside Fallout, with the first game in the franchise dropping just two years after Fallout 3 hit the market. Based on a novel series of the same name, Metro plunges players into post-apocalyptic Moscow, with survivors now occupying the city’s metro system while the world above burns in the nuclear fire.</p>



<p>Metro Exodus in particular is most worthy of the ‘best game like Fallout’ title, given its semi-open-world operating model and solid end-of-the-world vibes. It’s mostly linear and not so much an RPG by nature, but if you put Fallout (with some mods) side-by-side with Metro Exodus, you’d barely be able to tell the difference.</p>

<p>Riot Games’ Arcane is a show-stopper of a series that has been turning heads since the first season dropped in 2021. Fans are now getting deep into the highly anticipated second season of the show, but recently a stat surfaced showing just how much of a financial burden producing the series was on Riot Games.</p>



<p>It was confirmed in an interview with Variety that Arcane cost a whopping $250 million to produce in full. That makes it the most expensive animated series to land on linear or streaming television services <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-money-well-spent">Money Well Spent</h2>



<p>Arcane boasts a phenomenal cast, stellar acting, and mind-blowing visuals, which is par for the course when it comes to Riot Games’ animated sequences. The company has long focused on piecing together some of the best visual content in the business, such as the punchy animated promos they assemble for the League of Legends World Championship year after year.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/riot-games-arcane-hollywood-netflix-most-expensive-animated-series-ever-1236196655/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an interview with Variety</a>, co-founder of Riot, Marc Merrill, suggested that despite the bloated cost, the company isn’t wavering on the animation front:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our ambitions in entertainment haven’t changed. </p>



<p>We were never intending&nbsp;to operate like a traditional studio with traditional timelines. What&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;change as we learned more was our expectations of ourselves: We realized that getting it right takes a lot more time than we’d originally expected, and so we recalibrated our development, output goals and teams with that in mind.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition, Merrill addressed the cost of producing Arcane:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re more than comfortable with the spend it took to deliver a show that was worthy of our players’ time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>League of Legends is one of the most popular games ever made, and it boasts a phenomenal esports ecosystem that pulls in millions of viewers <strong>with ease</strong>. The recent League of Legends World Championship broke viewership records as the event’s grand final series was streamed live from London.</p>



<p>Do you think the $250 million investment to produce 18 episodes of a show for a streaming service is appropriate? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

<p>The 2025 season hasn’t started, and last year’s world champion, OpTic Texas’ Shotzzy, is busy claiming trophies. With Lucky, Kremp, and Beans, Shotzzy claimed the top spot in The Flank’s Black Ops 6 Invitational, netting the biggest prize we’ve seen in the game ahead of the upcoming CDL season being formally announced.</p>



<p>That marks the end of the $100,000 tournament collective backed by The Flank. From what we’ve already seen, this year’s competitive ecosystem, built on the foundation of Black Ops 6, will be nothing short of electrifying.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-easy-money">Easy Money</h2>



<p>As rosters for the upcoming competitive season were being cemented and everyone was getting to grips with Black Ops 6, the world’s best COD players were busying themselves trying to win $50,000 in one of the best pre-season events around. </p>



<p>The Flank’s Invitational played host to everyone from world champions to aspiring superstars, and it was genuinely such a great event to watch on stream.</p>



<p>When the dust had settled, it was Kremp, Shotzzy, Beans, and Lucky who stood victorious. This was Shotzzy’s second win in The Flank Invitational series, showing how ready he is to dominate again this season.</p>



<p>Before them came some top-tier teams, including one represented by Simp, Cellium, and Scrap, three of the most talented players in COD esports history, but somehow, Team Shotzzy pulled off a massive win and netted the $50,000 prize.</p>



<p>Before this, The Flank held two smaller tournaments to get things heated up, here’s how they ended up:</p>



<p><strong>Tournament #1: $25,000</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Dashy</li>



<li>Drazah</li>



<li>Simp</li>



<li>Shotzzy</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Tournament #2: $25,000</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Ghosty</li>



<li>Scrap</li>



<li>Gwinn</li>



<li>TJHaly</li>
</ul>



<p>These tournaments have got fans lusting for the competitive season to kick off. Recently, leaked documents outlined a rough roadmap for the 2025 Call of Duty League season, and it’s looking <strong>sharp</strong>.</p>

<p>Take-Two Interactive has confirmed that a new PGA Tour 2K game, likely PGA Tour 2K25, is scheduled to be released in Q4 2025.</p>



<p>The reveal came towards the of the company’s Q2 2025 earnings call on November 6.</p>







<p>“So for Q4, yes, you’re right, we have [Civilization] seven releasing,” Take-Two Interactive CFO Lainie Goldstein said in a response to a question about bookings growth for FY Q4 2025. “We also have our PGA title releasing in the quarter and our WWE title. And last year, we only had our WWE title.”</p>



<p>No other information was given about the next game in the franchise. It’s also unclear if this was an announcement that was supposed to be made or just a slip of the tongue.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Mike Straw had been reporting that the next game was well in development and was expected to release in 2025. Wednesday’s call seemingly confirmed that information.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Take-Two for more direct comment on the reveal from the earnings call. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

<p>Publisher Take-Two Interactive unveiled sales data for several of its big titles and franchises, including the entire Red Dead Redemption series, as part of its earnings call. You know, we’ve been quite curious about the Red Dead Redemption sales over the years, especially considering the sequel is often called one of the greatest single-player video games of all time. Well, now we know!</p>



<p>According to the earnings report, the entire Red Dead Redemption series has sold more than 92 million units to date. Red Dead Redemption 2, as expected, accounts for the vast majority of series sales, with more than 67 million units sold since launch.</p>



<p>As part of its announcement, Take-Two shared a few stats:</p>



<ul>
<li>Red Dead Redemption 2 is the second best-selling title in the U.S. in the past six years.</li>



<li>Red Dead Online launched as a standalone in 2020 but was included with every copy of Red Dead Redemption 2.</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare were re-released on PS4 and Nintendo Switch in August 2023 and PC in October 2024.</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite these obviously impressive sales numbers, we still have yet to hear about Red Dead Redemption 3. Is it happening? When?!</p>

<p>The Holidays are just around the corner, and with Christmas cheer comes family gaming time. Everyone loves to sit around an open fire and play video games with the family, but which games are best to play this Christmas?</p>



<p>Here are the top five best games to play with family at Christmas.</p>



<h2 id="h-top-video-games-to-play-with-family-at-christmas">Top Video Games to Play with Family at Christmas</h2>



<p>Do not get this list confused with the best Christmas games to play. This list solely is made up of the best multiplayer games to play with your family this Christmas.</p>



<p>While so many titles are out there waiting to be explored, there are a specific few that really hit the mark when looking for a family-fun game to play this Holiday season.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-all-lego-games">5. All LEGO Games</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>There are many different LEGO games out there, making it incredibly difficult to choose just one. However, all LEGO video games have a co-op mode, meaning you can explore the plot with another player.</p>



<p>And guess what? They are all family-friendly too! LEGO Star Wars, LEGO Batman and more all fit the bill as being some of the best games to play with family at Christmas. Whether you are looking for a galactic adventure or something else to sit down with your kids and play, any LEGO game should suffice.</p>



<p>LEGO games are also available on all consoles, including PlayStations, Xboxes and Nintendo Switches.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-4-minecraft">4. Minecraft</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another great game for the family to explore together is Minecraft. Not only is this game cheap, but it allows parents and kids to sit down and build entire worlds together. Explore your creativity with this game, building different landscapes the ways you want them.</p>



<p>Minecraft has been around for over a decade now, and still stands as one of the best multiplayer games out there, whether it is with friends or family.</p>



<p>This Christmas, though, anyone with a PC, Switch, Xbox or PS5 will be able to sit down and play this popular game together, making it the perfect video game for the Holidays.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-3-super-smash-bros-ultimate">3. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Need a game with a bit more action? Super Smash Bros. Ultimate takes all the famous Nintendo characters, allowing players to fight each other with them. Smash Bros has been around since the N64, being one of the most popular competitive games out there. The game is a Nintendo exclusive, though, so will only work on the Switch.</p>



<p>Still, this game is great for anyone, as you do not need too much knowledge to actually enjoy the fighting process. With maps resembling your favorite Nintendo character’s world, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will have any gamer excited.</p>



<p>While the game includes fighting, it is still toon-animated, meaning there is absolutely no blood or gore.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-2-mario-kart">2. Mario Kart</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Can’t have a list of games to play at Christmas with the family without including Mario Kart. With Mario Kart 8 Deluxe being the current Nintendo racing game on the Switch, families can jump in a vehicle and race each other just like back in the ’90s when the N64’s version was released.</p>



<p>The game even has a plethora of classic maps too for those who have not played the game in years to explore. Mario Kart has always amped up the action in every title Nintendo has released, making it one of the most popular multiplayer games in the world.</p>



<p>Mario Kart is perfect for anyone looking for a fun game to play with family during Christmas.</p>



<hr>

<p>Dota 2 is arguably the biggest esports in the world. With The International giving out millions of dollars every year, we have seen many new Dota players emerge into the scene. Dreaming of being one of those players? Well, you better start off playing ranked. </p>



<p>Here is a list of all the Dota 2 ranks.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-dota-2-ranks">All Dota 2 Ranks</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Herald</strong></li>



<li><strong>Guardian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Crusader</strong></li>



<li><strong>Archon</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legend</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ancient</strong></li>



<li><strong>Divine</strong></li>



<li><strong>Immortal</strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-in-dota-2-matchmaking-rating-mmr-explained">How to Rank Up in Dota 2 | Matchmaking Rating (MMR) Explained</h2>



<p>Hitting the rank of Immortal in Dota 2 is incredibly difficult for any competitor, even the best. The game’s ranking system follows a Matchmaking Rating (MMR) system, which grants players MMR as they progress through the ranks. </p>



<p>To rank up, players will have to participate in ranked matches, winning games and more. </p>



<h4 id="h-all-dota-2-ranks-and-their-mmr">All Dota 2 Ranks and Their MMR:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Herald:</strong> 1 – 769 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Guardian: </strong>770- 1539 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Crusader:</strong> 1540 – 2309 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Archon:</strong> 2310 – 3079 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Legend:</strong> 3080 – 3849 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Ancient:</strong> 3850 – 4619 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Divine:</strong> 4620 – 5620 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Immortal:</strong> 5620+ MMR.</li>
</ul>



<p>When first beginning to play ranked, new accounts will have their MMR calculated after playing a series of matches. They will then be put into rank and awarded their first medal. </p>



<p>No one, however, will start in Immortal. With each loss, you will lose MMR, potentially dropping in rank. However, those playing core roles in matches (carry, mid-lane) will receive more MMR per win than those playing support roles (off-lane, soft support, hard support).</p>



<p>All Ranks, excluding Immortal, are split up into five parts. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-ranked">What is ranked?</h2>



<p>Ranked play is a special competitive mode in Dota 2 (and many other games) where players compete against one another, climbing a specialized ranked system. While the actual ranked system does not reward players outside of in-game rewards and bragging rights, many pro players still make sure to flex their high ranks amongst others.</p>



<p>With Dota 2 having such a large skill gap, it can be incredibly difficult and daunting for new players to attempt an Immortal run, but it is still entirely possible.</p>



<p>Will you be attempting to hit the Immortal rank in Dota 2?</p>

<p>By now, we’ve all heard or witnessed the atrocity that they’re calling the Borderlands movie. It receives staggeringly low reviews from critics and viewers alike, with low single-digit ratings for the most part. But apparently, it wasn’t all bad. According to Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick, the live-action film didn’t hurt the video game franchise, but it actually helped significantly.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-borderlands-movie-was-disappointing-but-didnt-hurt-at-all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Zelnick said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Obviously that movie was disappointing. That said, it actually sold more catalog. So, I don’t think it hurt at all, if anything I think it may have helped a little bit. It does highlight something that I’ve spoken about many times which is the difficulty of bringing our intellectual property to another medium.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, by “catalog,” Zelnick refers to the collection of video games within the franchise, such as Borderlands 2, Tales From the Borderlands, and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. Essentially, the hype surrounding the film and people actually viewing it in theaters caused a significant rise in video game sales. People saw the movie, wanted more of the genuine article, and went to play the video games instead of re-watching the bomb film a second time. </p>



<p>If you saw the film and were one of the many who decided the video games were more your style, welcome! You should start by playing Borderlands 2, as it’s universally considered one of the best titles in the franchise. I didn’t mind the gameplay in Borderlands 3, but the writing and dialogue left me cringing more frequently than I’d typically like.</p>

<p>Take-Two Interactive held its earnings call for Q2 2025 on Wednesday, and with it came an update on the development of Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6.</p>



<p>In its <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/9aa55113-4f45-4264-8ff6-822353eddcd8">press release</a> for the earnings, it was said, once again, that the game will release in fall 2025. </p>







<p>The small update, which many won’t view as much of an update at all, continues the regular messaging from the company on the state of GTA 6. Over the last few months, Take-Two has continued to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-reaffirms-fall-2025-release-date-for-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaffirm people</a> that GTA 6 is scheduled for a fall 2025 release date. </p>



<p>As far as when a new trailer could be revealed, more details on the game’s features, or a more concrete release date announcement, the release didn’t mention that. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick didn’t provide any additional comment or context regarding the game’s release date or announcement plans during the actual call.</p>



<p>The first reveal of GTA 6 came <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-releases-gta-6-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly a year ago</a> when the first trailer was released. Since then, however, there’s been no update for a game that’s said to be a year away.</p>



<p>Do you still think GTA 6 will release in 2025? Join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>Following the closure of Roll7 and Intercept Games, Take-Two also revealed they sold off indie game publisher Private Division, but didn’t specify the buyer. Along with the sale of the company itself, Take-Two also sold off the publisher’s entire catalog of live and unreleased titles. However, they stated they would continue supporting No Rest for the Wicked, the recent Private Division-published action RPG from developer Moon Studios.</p>



<p>The publisher’s sale comes as part of the Take-Two earnings results, in which they said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are grateful for the contributions that the Private Division team has made to our company and are confident that they will continue to achieve success in their new home.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Supposedly, while the buyer remains unknown, a private equity firm did show interest in Private Division beforehand.</p>



<p>Private Division, as a publishing company, was behind multiple hit releases and upcoming games we had on our radar, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>No Rest for the Wicked</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tales of the Shire</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Outer Worlds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Kerbal Space Program 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>OlliOlliWorld</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hades</strong></li>
</ul>
