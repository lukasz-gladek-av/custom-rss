            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As the controversial cacophony continues with Roblox, disgruntled gamers worldwide have poured into a petition to demand the removal or resignation of Roblox’s CEO, David Baszucki. In less than ten days, the petition has racked up more than 110,000 signatures, and more are coming in with every passing minute.</p>



<p>This is all in response to the recent (but not the first) complaints regarding Roblox’s handling of child safety protocols and the control of predatory action on the platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-roblox-s-ceo-going-to-resign">Is Roblox’s CEO Going to Resign?</h2>



<p>It’s impossible to know what the strategy is for the Roblox team at present, but 110,000 signatures and counting can’t be ignored.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.change.org/p/remove-david-baszucki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the petition</a>, a clear explanation has been outlined:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Roblox is supposed to be a safe and creative space for children. But under the leadership of CEO David Baszucki, that safety has been repeatedly compromised. Instead of prioritizing the protection of young users, Roblox Corporation continues to allow harmful and exploitative behavior to thrive on its platform — with little accountability or transparency.</p>



<p>Children are being exploited and exposed to dangerous content, all while Roblox’s executive leadership turns a blind eye. If nothing changes, this pattern of negligence will continue — and more children will be hurt. This is not just about poor leadership. This is about child safety.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is far from being the first time that these criticisms and concerns have surfaced, but this is perhaps the most severe bout we’ve had yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-roblox-is-being-investigated-for-child-safety">Roblox is Being Investigated for Child Safety</h2>



<p>In recent weeks, Louisiana’s attorney general filed a lawsuit against Roblox, demanding that the company do more to protect children on the platform. Most recently, it was announced that Chris ‘To Catch a Predator’ Hansen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chris-hansen-confirms-going-after-roblox/">is assembling a documentary</a> diving into the state of play in the world of Roblox, and is working hand-in-hand with the likes of Schlep.</p>



<p>Roblox remains arguably the most popular game in the world by the sheer number of active users within the ecosystem. Could that be set to change with a mass exodus and shunning sitting on the nearby horizon?</p>

<p>Gears of War: Reloaded will provide a fresh boost for the franchise in a big push from Microsoft, with another new title also on the cards, and we’ve got all the details on the review embargo.</p>



<p>Set for release on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 26</a>, Gears of War: Reloaded is the second big remake for the franchise following Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, and there’s an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-gears-of-war-reloaded-free-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgrade to the new version available</a>, while one of the big additions is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-cross-platform-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossplay functionality</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re on the fence on whether to purchase Gears of War: Reloaded, you may want to wait to see how the review scores stack up. There is a review embargo in place, however, and we’ve got all the details on when it lifts.</p>



<h2 id="h-gears-of-war-reloaded-review-embargo-date-explained">Gears of War: Reloaded Review Embargo Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Here we go again. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The official Gears of War: Reloaded review embargo ends on August 26, though no precise time has been announced.</strong></p>



<p>Confirmation of the review embargo date came from <a href="https://x.com/MrboomstickXL/status/1956428233785672132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MrboomstickXL on X</a> (formerly Twitter), who told followers they would “be able to give my thoughts on August 26th when the embargo is lifted.”</p>



<p>The embargo comes on the same day as the release, although given the code supplied to the source mentioned is a YouTube channel, there could be a separate review embargo for written content. We’ll update this article with any further details that might emerge.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-gears-of-war-reloaded-scores-can-we-expect">What Gears of War: Reloaded Scores Can we Expect?</h2>



<p><strong>As a remake</strong>, <strong>Gears of War: Reloaded will be marked heavily on the differences compared to the original time at the Ultimate Edition released in 2015, though scores should be high.</strong></p>



<p>The original Gears of War, released in 2006, has an impressive <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/gears-of-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a> score with 94 from critic reviews, with user scores averaging at 8.2. Those numbers did drop for the Ultimate Edition, however, with a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">critic score of 82</a> and a user score of 7.8.</p>



<p>We’d expect scores to be in a similar range for the franchise, which usually lands with an 80-90 average score, including the much-maligned Gears 5, which has an 84 average score and 8.2 user review average.</p>



<p>Anything below the 80 mark would certainly be considered a blow for the title, particularly given that it is making the huge step of leaving Microsoft exclusivity and making a PlayStation debut.</p>

<p>EA is encouraging players to hop back into Battlefield 2042 after a chaotic few weeks in the Battlefield 6 beta. We’re all being tempted back in with new weapons, vehicles, and a rumored new map.</p>



<p>All good things must come to an end. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-battlefield-6-beta-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 beta</a> broke records and has been a big success. Battlefield might finally be back, but the irony of this statement is that it has to go away for another couple of months. But you can hop back into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2042</a> while you wait as new free goodies await.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-guns-amp-vehicles-added-to-battlefield-2042">New Guns &amp; Vehicles Added to Battlefield 2042</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’ll be back, don’t worry. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>We recently reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-update-surprisingly-big-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2042 could be getting a ‘Surprisingly Big’ update soon</a>. BF 2042 has largely abandoned the seasonal content schedule as it’s full steam ahead for Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>This hasn’t stopped <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 2042</a> from receiving the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lynx (Weapon)</li>



<li>F2000 (Weapon)</li>



<li>Warthog (Vehicle)</li>



<li>Frogfoot (Vehicle)</li>
</ul>



<p>As of writing, there are still items missing from the update that were initially rumored: The Prototype (another weapon) and the Iwo Jima map. This doesn’t mean they won’t be happening. We’ll keep an eye on things to see if they’re added to Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>Are you returning to Battlefield 2042 before Battlefield 6’s full launch? Or are you interested in checking out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-5-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 5</a> again, for example? Share your thoughts and more via the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>While you might not recognize David Hayter if you walked past him on the street, you’d certainly become wide-eyed if you heard his Snake voice. The legendary voice actor, who commanded the role of Snake for many years in MGS, recently revealed that he has finally played Metal Gear Solid 5—a tough ask, given he was replaced as Snake’s voice actor.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> is the creative visionary behind Metal Gear Solid. There’s no denying MGS wouldn’t be what it is without him. But the gruff, roughness of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/david-hayter-mgs-konami/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Hayter</a>‘s Solid Snake voice added to the character’s aura of the years. However, Hideo Kojima replaced Hayter with Kiefer Sutherland for Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain. This hurt Hayter a lot.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Time is the ultimate healer. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hayter told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/03/25/david-hayter-playing-metal-gear-solid-v-would-have-been-60-hours-of-humiliation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a> in 2016 that playing Metal Gear Solid V would have been “60 hours of humiliation.” He also added that Kojima had been trying to replace Hayter before The Phantom Pain, before ultimately doing so with Kiefer Sutherland—best known for the TV show 24.</p>



<p>As a result, Hayter didn’t play The Phantom Pain or Ground Zeroes: “Yeah. That’ll be 60 hours of humiliation that I can’t get to. I haven’t played the latest two iterations, because it’s just too painful.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/all-is-forgiven-after-being-dropped-for-metal-gear-solid-5-david-hayter-now-says-its-my-favourite-gameplay-of-the-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> reports that David Hayter has finally played Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain: “And then I played it and I’m like, I think this is my favourite gameplay of the series. The fact that you can go into the same scenario each time, and the [enemy] soldier’s gonna be doing the same thing, but you can take on different routes or different strategies of attack, makes it feel like time travel.”</p>



<p>He added that the gameplay is “badass” and “all is forgiven.”</p>



<p>David Hayter was returned to the role of Snake in the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>.

<p>Mega Evolution will make a Pokémon TCG Pocket debut later this year, with the first cards also being revealed during the closing ceremony of the Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is bringing Mega Evolution back to the mainline games when it releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 16</a>, while the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolutions-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Evolution in the physical TCG</a> has already been released in Japan with the first English sets due later this year.</p>



<p>Now, Pokémon TCG Pocket is following suit with Mega Evolutions confirmed to arrive “this fall” as part of a “new season,” which could be in line with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-devs-plan-to-release-a-major-update-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge update that has already been teased</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-unveils-first-mega-evolution-cards">Pokémon TCG Pocket Unveils First Mega Evolution Cards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>A trailer shown at the Pokémon World Championships featured a recap of some of the additions to the game we’ve seen so far, followed by the reveal of the Mega Evolutions symbol and a first look at several cards.</p>



<p>Mega Altaria ex, Mega Blaziken ex, and Mega Gyarados ex were all featured, showing the art style for the cards and confirming how they will be utilized in the game.</p>



<p>Similar to the latest physical TCG sets, Mega Pokémon will not evolve from their standard forms. Instead, Mega Blaziken evolves from Combusken, Mega Gyarados evolves from Magikarp, and Mega Altaria evolves from Swablu.</p>



<p>Mega Evolution in Pokémon TCG Pocket will also be a high-risk vs reward strategy as, while they will be among the strongest cards in the game, with all the revealed cards having 210 HP and dishing out high damage, the opponent will secure three points if your Mega Evolution Pokémon is knocked out.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether the battle format will change for Pokémon TCG Pocket’s new season, but currently, securing three points ends the match. Therefore, a strategy is required on when to introduce them and when to retreat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A will feature online ranked battles and a four-player PvP mode, it has been revealed at the Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim.</p>



<p>Due to be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 16</a>, Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the next big release for the franchise heading into a huge year in 2026, where Pokémon celebrates a 30th anniversary and is widely expected to release the tenth generation of Pokémon.</p>



<p>Legends: Z-A follows on from the success of 2021’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus, which featured open-world catching mechanics for the first time, but big steps forward are being taken in the latest entry to the series with online support.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Big features. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the biggest disappointments with Legends: Arceus was the lack of online features, with no battling, trading, or Mystery Gift system. That all changes in Legends: Z-A, however, which will feature them all.</p>



<p>Ranked battles will provide competitive action for trainers around the world, with private matches also being available, while the trading mechanics suggest that trade evolutions will return—having been replaced by single-use items in Legends: Arceus.</p>



<p>Another piece of big news revealed at Anaheim was a four-player PvP mode, where trainers will compete within a time limit to secure the most knock-outs, with Mega Evolution confirmed to be available in the mode.</p>



<p>The four-player mode follows on from the four-player co-op introduced in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, though that was restricted to open-world exploration and did not include battle features. Instead, battles remained in the same one-vs-one format we’ve become accustomed to.</p>



<p>Introducing a four-player PvP mode in Legends: Z-A could mean big things for the tenth generation of the game, given Scarlet &amp; Violet took a lot of the mechanics from Legends: Arceus and introduced them to the mainline games—including open-world catching and exploration.</p>
