<p>While the games that are released bring the joy of being able to experience something new, there’s something about the build up to a game that can be just as, if not more, exciting as the release itself. In 2026, the gaming calendar is loading with titles like Marvel’s Wolverine, Resident Evil Requiem, and Phantom Blade Zero that could be in contention for Game of the Year. However, no game has the community talking and is more anticipated than Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6).</p>



<p>A poll hosted exclusively on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a> saw GTA 6 get 29.8% of the votes. That may be far less than the 87% it received last year, but that can be blamed, if you will, on the other games in development.</p>







<p>But why did GTA 6 win for the second year in a row? It’s kind of obvious, really. </p>



<p>It’s the first game in 13 years for the nearly 30-year-old franchise. It also sees the series return to Vice City and the state of Leonida as a whole in what looks, based on the information released so far, to be the largest region in the history of GTA. </p>



<p>Two trailers have been released so far, both doing well over 100 million views, showing just how excited players are to get this game. It’s expected to be the highest-grossing game in the series and could very well beat the sales numbers for GTA 5, which made $815 million in just 24 hours. </p>











<p>As mentioned, GTA 6 received 29.8% of the votes this year. Where things got interesting, though, is in the rankings that followed.</p>



<p>Second place saw a tie between a game confirmed for next year and one still a year or two away. Both Marvel’s Wolverine, which releases next fall, and The Witcher 4 received 18.2% of the vote. That was followed by another tie for fourth between Resident Evil Requiem and the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake at 9.9%.</p>



<p>Other games receiving votes included 007 First Light, Phantom Blade Zero, Pokémon Pokopia, Saros, and Fable.</p>



<p>What do you think about GTA 6 being voted the most anticipated game of 2026? Is it something you agree with or are you more excited for a different game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Stardew Valley is officially available, with a shadowdrop landing today, December 25th. It’s priced at just $14.99, but existing owners can take advantage of a <strong>free upgrade pack</strong>.</p>



<p>It boasts several innovations to boost the game up to spec on Nintendo’s latest flagship console, including ‘intuitive mouse controls’ and online multiplayer that supports up to eight players.</p>







<h2 id="h-stardew-valley-on-switch-but-2">Stardew Valley on Switch, But 2</h2>



<p>ConcernedApe has delivered everyone a neat Christmas gift and launched Stardew Valley’s Switch 2 edition without any warning. It’s available to download <strong>now </strong>through the Nintendo eShop, but if you already own Stardew Valley on the Switch, you can download a <strong>free upgrade pack</strong>.</p>



<p>This new version of the game introduces mouse controls, four-player split-screen co-operative multiplayer, and, as mentioned, eight-player online support. If you lean on GameShare, four friends can play together even if only <strong>one of them </strong>has the game.</p>



<p>While we knew about the version upgrade for Stardew Valley thanks to an announcement made months ago, a release date was never confirmed. It was given a <strong>window </strong>of Fall 2025, which it missed. Here’s the trailer that was published to announce the upgrade several months back:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Stardew Valley: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition – Nintendo Direct 9.12.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ac2-LRIAeU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Back in July, Stardew Valley shattered a record held by Portal 2 for <strong>14 years on Steam</strong>. It became the highest-rated game on the entire platform, out of tens of thousands of games. That’s nothing if not indicative of how universally beloved Stardew Valley is.</p>

            <guid>1392199</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Here’s to raising a glass to RPG games that continue to bring deep, detailed worlds for everyone to lose hours in. 2025 delivered its fair share of world-class role-playing games, and Insider Gaming is celebrating these outstanding feats with the RPG Game of the Year 2025 award, and the winner might surprise you.</p>



<p>What another year it’s been for the RPG market—you’re simply spoiled at this point. It’s been so overwhelming that even remasters have been some of the most popular launches, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remastered-9-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and Final&nbsp;Fantasy&nbsp;Tactics&nbsp;–&nbsp;The&nbsp;Ivalice&nbsp;Chronicles. Plenty of fresh meat has been thrown onto the market, and picking a winner for dinner was tricky.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-role-playing-game-of-2025-winner-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Best Role-Playing Game Of 2025 Winner—Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>From a pure role-playing game standpoint, with a primary emphasis on quests, world-building, exploration, and deeper, meaningful RPG fundamentals and mechanics, it would be wrong not to award RPG of the year to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios is not here to placate casual users: This is a serious RPG requiring immersion, concentration, and attention to your actions, as one false step or bad choice can be the end of a quest or even your game! There’s so little bloat in KC2, and you have limitless paths to choose from in how you tailor your version of Henry to meet your needs.</p>



<p>The realistic gameplay won’t be for everyone, but who cares when the experience is this rich and full? This is years of hard work and dedication, making a unique RPG. Progression is a multi-layered cake of voluminous ingredients, and well over four million of you have been subjected to its unabashed brilliance. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is the RPG game of the year, and an all-time great role-playing game. </p>



<p>If you disagree, you might be branded.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-rpg-game-of-2025-nominations">Best RPG Game of 2025 Nominations</h2>



<h3 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a superior, cleaner, and better-perfected game compared to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, but it’s just <em>not </em>a better RPG. While Sandfall’s adventure doesn’t hold your hand, it simply doesn’t have the diverse range of freedom KC2 offers, not even close, to be honest.</p>



<p>That said, there’s no disputing how good Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is. It will forever go down as the game that took home a record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-broke-all-time-the-game-awards-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nine The Game Awards 2025</a> honors. Its battle-to-battle scenarios and set-pieces are determined by your team and your build: How you invest skill points, your ability to attack an enemy’s weakness, and so forth. It’s a rightful GOTY contender, and will be talked about for decades, but it can’t be recognized as 2025’s best RPG from a genre standpoint.</p>



<h3 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s hard to argue against Monster Hunter Wilds being the most open and inviting release in the franchise yet. You might have the odd Monster Hunter purist disagree with some of the changes in Wilds, but the fact is that Capcom has done it again. Wilds and World have helped the series transcend the joy and satisfaction of slaying monsters for a select audience and opened the franchise up to the mainstream.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds switches to a living, breathing open-world design, you have a dedicated mount, there are tweaks to the combat and modes of attack, and if you invest now, expect a constant stream of updates between now and the end of the game’s lifecycle—look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-4-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Update 4</a>, as an example.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Obsidian’s calendar has been exceptionally full in 2025, and it’s had another RPG to release and support—Avowed. However, the focal point of the company’s year was always likely to be The Outer Worlds 2. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tim-cain-returns-to-obsidian-for-new-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Cain</a> helping, the developer has released the perfect follow-up to 2019’s The Outer Worlds.</p>



<p>Almost everything has been overhauled and improved in some capacity or another. There’s also a plethora of fun weapons—Wham-Bam!, take that—and even quests feel like you (the player) have been unshackled. You can approach missions and play them in different ways, and between its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-trolls-players-who-buy-the-games-premium-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hilarious trolling Flaws</a> and progression trees, it’s a must-play RPG!</p>



<p>It’s your chance to go to the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> to tell everyone your favorite RPG game of 2025. You can also admonish us for not giving it to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33!</p>

<p>The holidays have finally kicked in, and players are ready to kick back and relax while trying some new games, warming up with a nice cup of hot chocolate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this holiday season, you might be thinking of introducing one of your non-gamer friends or family members to the world of gaming. There are some great picks out there where you can experience a whole new world along with your non-gamer friend.&nbsp;This Insider Gaming guide will help you pick the best game to play with your non-gamer friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Holiday 2025 hub</a> for the best deals on games and hardware across all platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-it-takes-two">It Takes Two</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Starting with the game of the year for 2021, It Takes Two is a brilliant co-op game that will really get your non-gamer friend interested in this field of entertainment. It Takes Two has players exploring a couple’s clashes and how they make up while being turned into dolls and overcoming a series of obstacles. Each level features unique, interconnected abilities that must be used in coordination to get ahead. &nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction">Split Fiction</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Split Fiction is the latest title from the same people who introduced us to It Takes Two, but it’s a lot more recent and a great pick for non-gamers. The narrative follows two writers who are stuck in their own stories, trapped by a force trying to steal their creative ideas. One world is sci-fi, and the other is fantasy, and the things you will experience in this game are unlike any other.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-way-out">A Way Out</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Next, we have A Way Out, a premise that should interest a non-gamer friend who’s into prison escape movies. That’s right, in this title, you have to work in tandem with your friend to plan and execute a prison escape. There will be a variety of puzzles and obstacles to overcome through coordination and teamwork across areas that you would only have seen in the movies. Will you be able to break free?&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The latest instalment to the iconic kart racing franchise is Mario Kart World, and it’s exclusively available on the Switch 2. Mario Kart World is a great introductory game for a non-gamer; some competitive fun across various levels is always fun. Moreover, the new entry introduces free exploration, increased 24-player lobbies, and much more.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-lego-marvel-super-heroes-2-nbsp">LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2&nbsp;</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>LEGO games are always good titles to get non-gamers inducted into gaming, and Marvel Super Heroes 2 helps if your friend is a fan of the MCU. Players can play as iconic heroes and superheroes from the Marvel universe from different eras and realities as you go head-to-head with the time-traveling Kang the Conqueror. Explore an expansive open world with areas inspired by Ancient Egypt to The Old West, Sakaar, and New York City in 2099, all built in LEGO.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If your non-gamer is not a friend of Marvel, then Star Wars could be their thing. The Skywalker Saga lets you experience all nine films reimagined with LEGO humour and enables you to play the three trilogies in any order you want. There are over 300 characters to play as from this highly popular franchise, more than 100 vehicles, and 23 planets that you can spend time exploring.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another way to get your non-gamer into gaming is to try out some sports titles. FC 26 is one of the most popular sports titles, with football being one of the biggest sports. FC 26 is wildly popular for its co-op play, and players can choose their favourite teams and try out a variety of game modes that suit their preferences.&nbsp;The series has also made some significant improvements over the last title, including more responsive dribbling, smarter AI positioning, sharper, more explosive movement, and much more.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If football isn’t your jam, then basketball might be a sport that your non-gamer friend is more inclined towards. The new instalment uses technology that “directly translates NBA footage into realistic gameplay.” NBA 2K26 also features a wide variety of teams and game modes you can choose from, either fight it out in an arena, or take it to the streets. The new title also makes you feel more connected to every dribble and crossover with revamped size-ups and experience fast-paced, dynamic movement with all-new ProPLAY features.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>WWE is an iconic franchise that almost everyone, gamer or non-gamer, has heard of. It’s a familiar, entertaining world where players have spent hours on end performing special moves in real life, and it’s never too late to get into it. There are a variety of modes that players can try out, play with, or against their non-gamer friends, and choose from one of the most prominent entertainment personalities from this world.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Button-mashing is always fun, and what better game for a non-gamer to be introduced to than Mortal Kombat?&nbsp;Mortal Kombat 1 is the rebirth of this universe, where things feel familiar but are drastically altered. Along with a stellar campaign, the game also features a multiplayer mode where you and your non-gamer friend can choose from a roster of characters, each having a unique set of abilities, and battle it out for hours on end. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you unwrapped a Nintendo Switch 2 this Christmas, consider yourself very lucky—you’ve just secured one of the hottest gaming devices of the year. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-10-million-sales-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo’s latest console</a> has only been out since June 5, 2025, but in just half a year, it’s already built a stacked line-up of blockbuster exclusives, upgraded ports, and surprise indie hits. </p>



<p>With a library growing this quickly, it can be tough to know where to start. Do you jump into the flagship first-party titles? Revisit remastered classics? Or explore the early wave of third-party heavy hitters taking advantage of the system’s improved power?</p>







<p>If you’re feeling spoiled for choice, don’t worry—this guide should have you covered. Insider Gaming has put together a definitive list of must-play Nintendo Switch 2 games to help you hit the ground running and make the most of your brand-new console. Whether you’re a long-time Nintendo fan or new to the ecosystem, these are the titles you won’t want to miss.</p>



<h2 id="h-must-play-games-on-the-nintendo-switch-2">Must-Play Games On The Nintendo Switch 2</h2>



<h3 id="h-mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Take your Kart across the open world. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Where better to begin than with the Nintendo Switch 2’s flagship launch title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/could-mario-kart-world-be-getting-dlc-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>? In a bold reinvention of the series, Nintendo has thrown open the track boundaries and delivered a sprawling open world filled with secrets, challenges, and a massive selection of new courses to discover as you explore.</p>



<p>The shake-up doesn’t stop there. Mario Kart World introduces a brand-new race mode: Knockout Tour. Drivers tear through the open world toward a series of checkpoints, and at each one, the bottom four racers are eliminated. Whether you’re racing side-by-side in couch co-op, battling the chaos online, or taking on the AI in solo play, Mario Kart World feels like an instant classic and a must-play for every new Switch 2 owner.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Get searching for those Bananas! Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Move over, Mario—there’s a new 3D platforming king on the Nintendo Switch 2. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-donkey-kong-bananza-game-length-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, from the team behind Super Mario Odyssey, delivers the console’s standout platforming experience. Its lush, interconnected worlds are packed with secrets, clever challenges, and the kind of inventive level design that keeps you exploring long after you finish the story.</p>



<p>DK trades Mario’s finesse for raw power, leaning fully into destruction and chaos. You’ll smash through enemies, tear up the environment, and use DK’s sheer strength to climb, launch, and even rock-surf your way across multi-layered worlds. It’s fast, loud, and endlessly satisfying.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Explore Lumiose City like never before. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can’t talk Nintendo without bringing up Pokémon, and the series’ newest entry is essential for any Switch 2 owner. Pokémon Legends: Z-A breaks from tradition by setting the entire adventure within Lumiose City, swapping sprawling open regions for a dense, ever-evolving urban landscape filled with vertical exploration and hidden pockets of activity.</p>



<p>The big draw is the long-awaited return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-all-mega-evolutions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Evolutions</a>, now more dynamic and impactful than ever. Triggering a Mega form transforms battles into explosive showcases of power and strategy, giving familiar Pokémon a fresh edge. It’s a bold reinvention of the Kalos experience—and one of the standout titles defining the Nintendo Switch 2 era.</p>

<p>Unlike some of the other games on this list, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom didn’t debut on the Nintendo Switch 2—but its upgrade pack makes it feel right at home. Boosting performance to a smooth 60fps and sharpening visuals to 4K when docked, Link’s latest adventure has never looked or played better.</p>







<p>If you’re new to the Switch-era Zelda games, you’ll want to start with Breath of the Wild to fully appreciate the journey. But if you’re after the most refined and ambitious version of the formula, Tears of the Kingdom is the definitive choice, offering the grandest and most creative Zelda experience available on the Switch 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-hades-2">Hades 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Somehow even better than the first. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hades 2 isn’t exclusive to the Switch 2, but it feels tailor-made for handheld play. Supergiant’s sequel puts you in the role of Melinoë, the Princess of the Underworld, as she sets out to stop Chronos, the Titan of Time. The game builds on everything fans loved about the original—tight combat, stylish world-building, and sharp writing—while giving the series a darker tone and a brand-new mythological focus.</p>



<p>Melinoë’s blend of witchcraft and melee combat keeps every run fast, flexible, and wildly satisfying, especially with new weapons, expanded god Boons, and a deeper cast of characters to interact with. Whether you’re grinding through a late-night run or squeezing in a session on the go, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-roguelites-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2 shines on the Switch 2</a> and stands as one of the console’s most satisfying experiences.</p>



<h3 id="h-cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</h3>



<figure><figcaption>We’ve got a city to burn. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-hits-new-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077 is no newcomer</a>, but experiencing it on the Nintendo Switch 2 feels like discovering the game all over again. CD Projekt Red’s ambitious RPG has been refined, expanded, and polished since its original launch, and bringing that definitive version to a handheld console is a massive win for players who love deep, story-driven adventures on the go.</p>



<p>Night City’s dense streets, branching quests, and razor-sharp combat translate beautifully to portable play, making every quick session or long commute feel like meaningful progress. Being able to dive into one of the most elite modern RPGs anytime, anywhere turns Cyberpunk 2077 into a must-play addition to your Switch 2 library—and one of the most impressive handheld feats the console has to offer.</p>



<h3 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Later bosses make this guy look tame. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong has been one of the most anticipated games of the decade, and its arrival on the Nintendo Switch 2 more than justifies the wait. Hornet’s journey through the towering, trap-filled kingdom of Pharloom builds beautifully on the foundations of the original—faster movement, refined combat, and a world so atmospheric and intricate that exploring it becomes completely absorbing.</p>



<p>While it isn’t a Switch 2 exclusive, it feels almost designed for the hardware. The handheld’s responsiveness brings out the best in Silksong’s precision platforming, making every leap, parry, and needle strike feel incredibly smooth. Pharloom’s layered zones and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-mask-shard-locations-in-hollow-knight-silksong-act-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hidden challenges</a> are perfect for quick sessions or long dives, and the sense of discovery never fades. For Metroidvania fans, this is a must-play and a standout addition to the Switch 2 library.</p>



<h3 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The long-awaited sequel is finally here. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking of Metroidvanias, let’s head back to where it all started. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond stands tall as one of the Nintendo Switch 2’s flagship experiences, marking Samus Aran’s long-awaited return to the Prime series. Retro Studios has delivered a bold evolution of the classic formula, blending the atmospheric exploration fans adore with tighter gunplay, richer environmental storytelling, and some of the most visually striking world design the franchise has ever seen.</p>



<p>Though it’s not exclusive to the Switch 2, the upgraded hardware elevates the experience dramatically. The smoother framerate and enhanced fidelity make scanning alien structures, navigating hostile ecosystems, and battling colossal creatures feel incredibly immersive—especially in handheld mode, where the detailed environments and moody lighting truly shine. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-locks-basic-feature-behind-30-amiibo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is a triumphant continuation of Samus’ saga and an essential addition to any Switch 2 library.</p>

<p>Fortnite continues to shine year after year, and Christmas is a time when a flurry of festive skins are made available, and the vast quantity of them makes it difficult to rank the very best.</p>



<p>With the annual Winterfest celebration, Fortnite adds new Christmas-themed skins every year, featuring entirely new creations or established characters with a festive spin.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has run the rule over all of the Christmas skins introduced to Fortnite over the years to issue a verdict on the best ever released.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-fortnite-christmas-skins">Best Fortnite Christmas Skins</h2>



<h3 id="h-crackshot">Crackshot</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Terrifying. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Initially introduced on Christmas Eve in 2017, Crackshot is a terrifying nutcracker that makes regular appearances in the Fortnite Item Shop, and stands out as one of the best festive-themed skins in Fortnite.</p>



<p>With five Selectable Styles, Crackshot is certainly worth the 2,000 V-Bucks it costs to purchase, and it will take some doing for the skin not to be considered among Christmas’ best.</p>



<h3 id="h-grimbles">Grimbles</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Gnome. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Grimbles was first introduced to Fortnite in Dedcember 2018, making repeated appearances since then, and, while he has a much more approachable look compared to some of the other Outfits on this list, it’s certainly not one to mess with.</p>



<p>Grimbles has a Selectable Style that includes red, glowing eyes, transforming the friendly gnome into a rather haunting nightmare.</p>



<h3 id="h-krampus">Krampus</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Ho ho horror. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another iconic Christmas skin in Fortnite that first appeared in 2018, Krampus is an Outfit that splits opinion in the Fortnite community, but there’s no doubting it boasts an iconic look.</p>



<p>Anti-Claus is inspired by European folklore, said to be a half-goat, half-demon figure who acts as the opposite to Santa Claus, punishing those who misbehave, so play nice.</p>



<h3 id="h-sgt-winter">Sgt. Winter</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Naughty or nice. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A Battle Pass skin all the way back in Season 7 in 2018, Sgt. Winter shows what Santa would look like if he were to have chosen a different lifestyle and brought the pain rather than spreading Christmas cheer.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Sgt. Winter came in the Battle Pass before Fortnite removed the exclusivity restrictions, so the original Sgt. Winter won’t be available again.</p>



<h3 id="h-dolph">Dolph</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hooves and all. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Introduced in 2019 on Christmas Eve, Dolph is a bipedal, almost humanoid version of Santa’s favorite reindeer, though points have to be docked due to the lack of a shiny red nose.</p>



<p>Still, Dolph is a classic Christmas skin in Fortnite and provides a stellar look while you sleigh your enemies.</p>



<h3 id="h-polar-patroller">Polar Patroller</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Beary good. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Polar Patroller was initially introduced on New Year’s Eve in 2019 and has regularly returned to the Item Shop, including a styint available in November this year, and pairs well with the Dolph skin as both show animals transformed into Fortnite characters.</p>



<p>He doesn’t look as imposing without the grenade launcher he carries in promotional art, however, but you still shouldn’t cuddle this bear.</p>



<h3 id="h-sled-ready-guff">Sled Ready Guff</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Unbeatable. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Guff is a fan-favorite character introduced in Fortnite and the Sled Ready skin is arguably the best of them all, with the reindeer attire certainly looking better than the Santa approach in Guff Gringle, where it looks like he’s suffered a bit of sunburn.</p>



<p>Sled Ready Guff was initially available in Chapter 4, Season 1 in December 2022 through completing challenges, and has not been obtainable since. </p>



<h3 id="h-winterfest-bushranger">Winterfest Bushranger</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Winter is coming. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A Christmas twist to the traditional Bushranger Outfit, Winterfest Bushranger comes equipped with a Christmas tree design, a Santa hat, and plenty of decorations.</p>



<p>Winterfest Bushranger was released in December 2023, obtainable through challenges, and may feature in the Item Shop in future.</p>
