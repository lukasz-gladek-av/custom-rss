<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 has revealed its roadmap for 2026 ahead of its release and hints at some new free and paid DLC.</p>



<p>If you enjoy cozy games, PowerWash Simulator is a familiar name to all. The simple maintenance simulator took the world by storm in 2022, getting everyone to do something many hate doing: cleaning. With its huge popularity, the game teamed up with iconic IPs like Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2024-every-game-shown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shrek</a>. A sequel was announced earlier this year, with a release date <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed just this month</a>. Now, with its release in a few hours, Futurlabs has shown off its planned roadmap for 2026, as well as how it‚Äôll spend 2025.</p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We have our PowerWash Simulator 2 Roadmap to share with you all üí¶</p><p>Coming in 2025/2026 ‚§µÔ∏è</p><p>‚Äì 3 Paid IP DLC<br>‚Äì 3 Free Caldera Chronicles Jobs<br>‚Äì A bucket full of other planned additions</p><p>For the rest of 2025 we‚Äôre focusing on fixes, further optimisations and QOL improvements! <a href="https://t.co/eUOk2bfEzP">pic.twitter.com/eUOk2bfEzP</a></p></div>‚Äî PowerWash Simulator (@PowerWashSim) <a href="https://twitter.com/PowerWashSim/status/1980972487199379614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post from PowerWash Simulator‚Äôs <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1980972487199379614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Twitter/X account</a>, the roadmap for 2026 is now available. As shown above, the team plans to have new paid and free DLC every quarter, starting with Q1. No specifics were given for what to expect, but the free DLC, called the Caldera Chronicles, will likely be similar to the original‚Äôs Muckingham Files. As for the paid DLC, it‚Äôll be based on other IPs, so we may see some zany crossovers like last time. </p>



<p>Additionally, updates to the game, including community events and costumes, will be added over time. No DLC or new content is coming out in 2025, as the team plans to focus on QoL and optimization fixes. Reviews for PowerWash Simulator 2 came out today, and, for many, it maintains the charm and fun the original did. Given how much of a sleeper hit it was, its sequel may just give it the attention it deserves. Plus, with a Day One release on Xbox Game Pass, it‚Äôs sure to keep many of us company (and make us clean freaks again).</p>

<p>Sonic Rumble is making its way to PC and mobile devices in early November.</p>



<p>The party royale game, which capitalizes on Fall Guys‚Äô success, has been in development for quite some time. Gameplay consists of players choosing their favorite Sonic characters and duking it out with others in fun and interesting mini-games. Despite positive feedback from early playtests, Sonic Rumble was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rumble-delayed-yet-again-by-sega/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met with multiple delays</a>. Earlier this month, however, it was announced that the game would release in November. Now, we finally have the official release date, as well as a cool new trailer to debut it.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/ZSF2uZ7W5Ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a short YouTube video</a>, SEGA and Sonic Team officially reveal the release date for Sonic Rumble: <strong>November 5th</strong>. The game will launch on Steam, Google Play, and the Apple App Store, with pre-registration available now. Currently, there are no announced plans to bring the game to consoles like Nintendo Switch 2. Regardless, given its successful playtests, it may very well happen. Plus, given the popularity of similar titles like Fall Guys and the Sonic brand, it‚Äôll likely gain some attention.</p>



<p>The last update for Sonic Rumble <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rumble-pc-mobile-launch-november-2025/">provided some insight</a> as to what the full release will look and play like. With the playtests, the development team took the feedback from fans and fine-tuned many elements. For example, the progression and rewards system is now more streamlined, as well as an overhaul of the game‚Äôs user interface and onboarding. In addition, many new features like skills and joinable Crews with friends add more to the competitive side of the title. While it has taken a while for it to arrive, Sonic Rumble will finally see the light of day, and it won‚Äôt be long until we get to see how it goes.</p>
