            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The PC Ram pricing problem continues to get worse for consumers. What was once one of the cheaper parts when building a custom PC, buying RAM has gotten to the point where it’s more expensive than buying even a brand-new graphics card for some.</p>



<p>A few weeks back, Insider Gaming reported on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-prices-have-soared-by-up-to-250/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fact that RAM prices have risen</a> by up to 250%. Well, fast forward to mid-December, and those prices now look “affordable”. There have been increases in PC RAM prices by, on average, another 25% since November 26. Some have even gone up by another 50% or more if you were looking at picking up a 64GB pack. </p>







<p>That means modern day graphics cards like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series and AMD Radeon RX 9000 series are becoming cheaper in comparison. Need specific examples? A new ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5070 is available for $549.99 while a ASRock Radeon RX 9070 XT can be had for $599.99. Even an RTX 5070 Ti, which costs an average of $749.99, is cheaper than some 64GB packs, like the Corsair Vengeance. </p>



<p>Below you’ll find a comparison of prices from November 1 to November 26 to December 11. All of them have continued to rise, with reports suggesting that it’s not going to slow down. It’s even gotten to the point that traditional budget-friendly brands are being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/micron-shutting-down-its-consumer-crucial-ram-and-ssd-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completely shuttered</a> in order to focus on the needs of the big AI companies that are causing the problems. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>PC Memory</th><th>Nov. 1 Price</th><th>Nov. 26 Price</th><th>Dec. 11 Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>16GB Kingston Fury</td><td>$62.99</td><td>$149.99</td><td>$241.02</td></tr><tr><td>32GB T-Force</td><td>$96.99</td><td>$339.99</td><td>$429.99</td></tr><tr><td>32GB G.Skill Flare X5</td><td>$97.99</td><td>$269.99</td><td>$349.99</td></tr><tr><td>32GB G.Skill Trident Z5 NEO</td><td>$104.99</td><td>$279.99</td><td>$439.99</td></tr><tr><td>64GB Corsair Vengeance</td><td>$239.99</td><td>$839.99</td><td>$899.99</td></tr><tr><td>64GB G.Skill Trident Z5 NEO</td><td>$204.99</td><td>$629.99</td><td>$719.99</td></tr><tr><td>64GB G.Skill Flare X5</td><td>$204.99</td><td>$569.99</td><td>$669.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has attempted to reach out to multiple manufacturers to discuss what consumers can do and if they are going to do anything to make sure they still have options when building a PC. As of publishing, however, no company has given answers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is a beloved game after being on the market for a little more than six weeks. It’s an all-new extraction adventure title from Embark Studios, and it’s proving to be a true disruptor to the genre. Recently, NVIDIA kickstarted a promotional event that allows certain players to unlock an exclusive ARC Raiders backpack, and it has proven to be a little too popular.</p>



<p>If you try to redeem the ARC Raiders NVIDIA backpack right now, you’ll be met with network errors and server issues.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-nvidia-arc-raiders-backpack-is-sought-after">The NVIDIA ARC Raiders Backpack is Sought-After</h2>



<p>There are a few caveats to claiming the ARC Raiders NVIDIA backpack, the most critical of which is that you need to be a PC gamer with an NVIDIA GPU. This is because it needs to link to the NVIDIA App and the GeForce Rewards program.</p>



<p>We’ve got a full guide explaining <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/get-free-arc-raiders-nvidia-backpack/">how to get the ARC Raiders backpack</a> from NVIDIA.</p>



<p>The listing went live at 6 AM PT, and what must be thousands of ARC Raiders fans were waiting to receive it, so much so that the NVIDIA site stopped working:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is a testament to the power of ARC Raiders, which is one of the most popular and successful games of 2025 after just a few weeks on the market.</p>



<p>To be honest, customization in ARC Raiders could be a little better. It’s limited right now, and that’s fine, because it’s a live-service game and Embark Studios is adding more content as they flesh out the holistic offering. But that’s why deals like this NVIDIA ARC Raiders backpack are so special – because people want <strong>more</strong> ways to outfit their character.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you managed to secure one of the NVIDIA backpacks in ARC Raiders.</p>

<p>PlayStation have announced that Killzone content is returning to Helldivers 2, and this time, it’s here to stay. </p>



<p>Back in December 2024, Killzone made its first appearance in Helldivers 2 with two waves of crossover items that included weapons, armor sets, and cosmetics. The developers at Arrowhead have made it clear that they’ve heard the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-killzone-cosmetics-price-backlash-response-from-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan feedback regarding the pricing</a> and that the content will instead be re-released as a Premium Warbond. </p>







<h2 id="h-killzone-themed-premium-warbond-heading-to-helldivers-2">Killzone-Themed Premium Warbond Heading To Helldivers 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The perfect fit for Helldivers 2. Image by PlayStation.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Announced via the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/the-helldivers-2-x-killzone-items-return-as-a-legendary-warbond-dec-18/">Pla</a><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/the-helldivers-2-x-killzone-items-return-as-a-legendary-warbond-dec-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ySta</a><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/the-helldivers-2-x-killzone-items-return-as-a-legendary-warbond-dec-18/">tion Blog</a>, Arrowhead have confirmed that a fresh batch of Killzone-themed gear is on the way to Helldivers 2. For 1500 Super Credits, players will be able to unlock a Premium Warbond packed with iconic Killzone weapons, armor, and cosmetics—plus a collection of brand-new items that weren’t part of last year’s limited release.</p>



<p>Better still, Arrowhead are rewarding returning players. Anyone who <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-x-killzone-cosmetics-are-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously purchased any Killzone item</a>—even a single piece—will receive the full Killzone Legendary Warbond at no extra cost. All previously owned or gifted items will also be medal-unlocked, meaning players won’t need to spend medals to reclaim them and can instead focus on the new additions.</p>







<p>Here’s how eligibility works, as confirmed by PlayStation.</p>



<ul>
<li>Players who have previously purchased any (even one) of the Killzone items, will have the whole Helldivers 2 x Killzone Legendary Warbond unlocked at no extra cost! Additionally, there is no medal vacuum here! The items previously purchased (and those which were gifted last December) will be medal unlocked. So no need to spend medals on the items you already own!</li>



<li>Players who received the gifted items in December 2024 but didn’t pay for any single item, will have to pay the 1500 Super Credits to unlock the full Legendary Warbond.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Not to worry, if you do pay for the Warbond; the gifted items will also be medal unlocked.</li>



<li>Players joining after the Helldivers 2 x Killzone items left the store in December 2024 can access the Warbond by unlocking it for 1500 SC, and then enjoy redeeming medals on their favorite items just as usual.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Premium Warbond includes every item from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/second-wave-helldivers-2-killzone-2-crossover-content-will-be-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first two waves of Killzone X Helldivers 2 content</a>, as well as a list of new items, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>StA-52 Assault Rifle</li>



<li>StA-11 SMG</li>



<li>PLAS-39 Accelerator rifle</li>



<li>AC-1 Dutiful/The Strength In Our Arms cape</li>



<li>AC-2 Obedient/Defender of Our Dream cape</li>



<li>Acclimated Passive</li>



<li>Extrasolar Ash patterns</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re a fan of either franchise, then now’s a great time to hop back into Helldivers 2. Will you be checking out the new Premium Warbond? Share your thoughts in the official <a href="https://discord.gg/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>. </p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077’s lead writer has stated that the team understood during the game’s pre-production that Night City would be the main antagonist, confirming the age-old fan theory.</p>



<p>The main attraction of Cyberpunk 2077 has always been Night City, which is not only a dense open-world that will keep you engaged the entire journey, but also an all-knowing and all-seeing entity that sells people big dreams, but they always come with massive repercussions. Now, a lead writer has confirmed that Night City is indeed the true villain of Cyberpunk 2077. </p>







<h2 id="h-it-s-always-night-city-versus-everyone-else-in-cyberpunk-2077">It’s Always ‘Night City Versus Everyone Else’ in Cyberpunk 2077</h2>



<p>For some time, players have theorised that Night City is the main character and antagonist in Cyberpunk 2077, and this post on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1aeuz79/v_is_not_the_main_character_my_simple_theory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cyberpunkgame</a> explains it quite well. During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/5-years-on-from-cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-reveals-why-making-night-city-the-main-antagonist-created-an-irresistible-rpg-exploring-the-darker-side-of-human-nature-is-exciting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Cyberpunk 2077’s lead writer, Tomasz Marchewka, confirmed, “Quite quickly, during pre-production of Cyberpunk 2077, we realized that Night City is going to be our main antagonist.”</p>



<p>Marchewka acknowledged that some players had caught on quite quickly and asked about it. The game also features other antagonists, such as Arasaka, Adam Smasher, and others. However, it has always been “Night City versus everyone else, even the big guys. So yeah, that’s a cool concept to make the city the main antagonist,” explained the lead writer.</p>



<p>Igor Sarzynski, the cinematic director, also explained why players might find this world so compelling, stating that for him it was always finding the balance between “subtle, personal, human, and emotional elements – things that are fragile and touching and invite compassion – versus what you mention: the danger, the violence.” </p>



<p>“Everything that forces you to put on armor, literal or emotional, and protect yourself, fight for survival. Night City exists right on the edge of those realms, between beauty and bloodshed, and so you’re never bored; you always think that&nbsp;maybe&nbsp;the next dream will come true,” Sarzynski added. </p>
