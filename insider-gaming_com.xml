<p>Like General Khazan and the power of the Blade Phantom, you are likely to form a strong connection to The First Berserker Khazan Trophy List. It features a tough and unenviable test of Trophies and Achievements.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> has the makings of a great action game. Khazan’s assortment of reality-defying powers mesh well with the environments and their rich color palette. The action looks intense, and some might say contains a lot of <em>soul</em>. If you’re keen on The First Berserker Khazan, you might want to consider acquiring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-the-first-berserker-khazan-early-access-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a>—although you might need to know its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-pc-system-requirements-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC requirements</a> first.</p>



<p>Once you’ve confirmed your ticket for the carnage of Khazan, you should check out the complete Trophy List.</p>



<p><strong>*This is an early spoiler warning as we have two separate lists here: One for the Trophies revealed from the start, and a separate list of hidden Achievements. So take care if you want to keep some of these a surprise.* </strong></p>

<p><strong>58 PlayStation Trophies and 57 Xbox Achievements await The First Berserker Khazan players.</strong></p>



<p>An extra PlayStation Trophy lies in wait for hardened collectors—the Platinum Trophy. An extra intangible reward for earning the other 57 Trophies (and Achievements). If you’re on Xbox, you don’t get a Platinum, but you still get the pride from earning every achievement.</p>

<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s upcoming competitor is none other than its decades-old rival, Digimon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-card-game-con-mobile-phone-app-teaser-renamon-1851770444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, a new post on the digimon_tcg account on <a href="https://x.com/digimon_tcg/status/1901112392492478758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> teased an upcoming digital card game for the franchise. The post includes a short 10-second teaser, where we see Renamon hovering over a smartphone before the Digimon is suddenly sucked into the phone. That’s all that was revealed. However, more information about the game will be shown during Digimon Con on March 20.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon and Digimon have been rivals for decades, with the former eventually taking the lead. However, seeing how Pokemon TCG Pocket has amassed so much success within such a short time, earning over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-surpassed-120-million-in-earnings-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$120 million</a> within the first seventeen days and crossing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-crossed-30-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30 million downloads</a> within the first nine, Digimon seems to want a cut of that success too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like the Pokemon Trading Card Game, Digimon has also had a card game since 2020, so they already have an established base for the digital version. However, the title’s success ultimately depends on the audience’s reception of another digital trading card game based on a different franchise. However, fans in the r/digimon subreddit seem ecstatic about the new digital trading card game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Niantic, Pokemon Go’s developer, has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-developer-acquired-by-scopely-for-3-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired by Scopely</a> for $3.5 billion. Also, here’s everything we know about Pokemon Champions, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-champions-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its release window, platforms</a> and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Palworld devs recently spoke about how Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit “came as a shock” for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-came-as-a-shock-to-pocketpair-because-patent-infringement-was-something-that-no-one-even-considered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Pocketpair’s communications director and publishing manager, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley, addressed Nintendo’s lawsuit against Palworld during a panel at GDC 2025. Bucky first spoke about the “little thing that happened in September”, where a company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to come for them</a>. Bucky explained that he doesn’t want to talk about it too much as it is “an active lawsuit”, and he doesn’t want to get “wrapped up” in the situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bucky added that Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit “came as a shock” to them, considering they had received a green signal for all the legal checks in Japan before the game was released. The lawsuit was a shock for many people, as it was something the devs had never “considered” and is something they are “still hashing out basically.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bucky elaborated that the lawsuit didn’t “feel good” considering they had been “pretty vocal” about Palworld before the game was released. However, after contacting lawyers and courts, they realised that the lawsuit was for patents. When the information was released to the public, it was a “pretty depressing day” for the devs as “pretty much everyone at Pocketpair is a huge fan”. At the same time, they were gearing up for the PlayStation release and a showcase at the Tokyo Game Show, which had to be scaled back due to legal problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired a new patent</a> that helps their lawsuit against Palworld. Also, Pocketpair publishing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-publishing-warn-not-more-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has warned gamers</a> not to expect “more Palworld”.

<p>Amazon has greenlit the God of War series for two seasons, reveals showrunner, as he speaks about how he had to stop playing the games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/god-of-war-tv-show-writer-reveals-amazon-has-already-ordered-two-seasons-and-that-he-cant-play-the-video-games-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>, God of War series showrunner&nbsp; Ronald D. Moore recently appeared on Katee Sackhoff’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu704p568-Y&amp;list=PLiHvVvKZ9lt6_mIcI0YwKPY1CgSYUvORQ&amp;index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sackhoff Show</a>, where he revealed more details about the upcoming adaptation. Moore first revealed that “Amazon has ordered two seasons” of the God of War series. Moore said it is a more challenging project as he is “not a gamer”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moore revealed that he “tried” to play the God of War games but is not a gamer. He grew up in the “arcade era,” and he would always be up to playing a game like Defender or Asteroid. However, Moore hasn’t overcome one obstacle with recent games: the modern controller. Moore elaborates that he has trouble with the button layout and cannot find the right buttons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, Moore’s family is filled with avid gamers. His children play constantly, and his wife has played Skyrim for “probably 15 years.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moore is the new showrunner for Amazon’s God of War series after the previous executive producers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-series-redone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exited the show</a> late last year. Moore is best known for his work on projects like Star Trek and the Battlestar Galactica series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the next God of War game is reportedly centred around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egyptian mythology</a>.

<p>Marvel Rivals devs recently spoke about drawing inspiration from Hazelight Studios’ It Takes Two when they had performance issues with Dr Strange’s portals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Strange’s portals in Marvel Rivals are one of the strongest abilities for strategic gameplay. The character can create a portal between any two points on the map, providing a direct line between those two points. However, while developing this ability for the character, Marvel Rivals developers were worried about the performance issues it might cause in the game, and to bypass this issue, they took inspiration from It Takes Two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-surprising-game-helped-improve-doctor-strange-portals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, Marvel Rivals senior graphic designer Tieyi Zhang recently spoke about drawing inspiration from It Takes Two at a panel at GDC 2025. Zhang talked about how the Unreal Engine game (It Takes Two) “simultaneously renders two views without catastrophic overhead”, which made him wonder whether this game uses “some magic” he doesn’t know about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Marvel Rivals’ breakthrough came after “discovering the local function, creating a local player.” Zhang realised that adding a local player “automatically enables split-screen rendering via distant cameras.” The report reveals that Marvel Rivals devs didn’t go through It Takes Two’s source code. The problems were solved by researching how Hazelight addressed its performance issues and using a similar strategy for Marvel Rivals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has released a new teaser featuring gameplay for upcoming Daima DLC characters, including Son Goku (mini) and Vegeta (mini).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Spakring Zero’s Daima DLC trailer kicks off featuring combat sequences for Vegeta (mini), showcasing his moves in his base transformation and Super Saiyan form. Next up is Glorio, who uses his Ki-based whip to whack his opponents. Last up was Son Goku (mini); the character was already playable in the original Sparking Zero roster. However, the new trailer reveals the Super Saiyan transformation for the character.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Daima DLC will be split into two parts, as revealed through a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-daima-dlc-part-1-is-arriving-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam listing</a> earlier this month. According to the new <a href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1901488566708130120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official post</a>, the first set of DLC characters is scheduled to be introduced in April 2025. The next part of the Daima DLC is expected to arrive between July and September 2025, and that’s when players might receive the more hyped characters, such as Goku SSJ4 and Vegeta Super Saiyan 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No concrete release date was provided, and only three characters were revealed for Sparking Zero’s Daima Part 1 DLC. Many players wonder whether that’s all they get for the first part or more content will be announced next month.</p>
