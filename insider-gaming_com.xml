<p>In a recent interview, Microsoft’s Jason Ronald, the VP of ‘Next Generation’, explained that the company is working to fuse Xbox and Windows to create an enhanced, accessible, and much more enjoyable handheld gaming experience.</p>



<p>He stressed that the tech titan has ‘spent 20 years building a world-class operation system’, but that OS is confined almost entirely to ‘the console’. The goal is to make Windows-powered gaming handhelds much more efficient and user-friendly by linking the power and versatility of Windows with the gaming-focused capabilities and UI of Xbox.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-innovating-for-a-long-time">‘Innovating for a Long Time’</h2>



<p>For years, rumours regarding an Xbox handheld have circulated like wildfire. With the global rise of handheld gaming devices soaring, many have wholeheartedly expected Team Green to come out with <strong>something </strong>in that space, but Xbox’s representatives have remained relatively tight-lipped.</p>



<p>During a recent panel that was covered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by The Verge</a>, Jason Ronald of Microsoft spoke about the impending fusion between Xbox and Windows that will vastly improve how users enjoy their handheld devices. For the longest time, devices like the ASUS ROG Ally (and Ally X) have been hampered by the cumbersome and at times buggy Windows UI and experience on the small screen.</p>



<p>Ronald explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been really innovating for a long time in the console space, and as we partner across the industry it’s really about how do we bring those innovations that we’ve incubated and developed in the console space and bring them to PC and bring them to the handheld gaming space.</p>



<p>I would say it’s bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together, because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it’s really locked to the console. What we’re doing is we’re really focused on how do we bring those experiences for both players and developers to the broader Windows ecosystem.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many opt to go with a Steam Deck because the SteamOS is built for gaming <strong>first</strong>, whereas the Windows 11 implementation featured on most handheld gaming devices is designed for multi-tasking of sorts.</p>



<p>Sure, it means that all Windows 11 devices are much more versatile and inclusive, but the experience isn’t great overall, and using a stock-standard Windows UI on a 7-inch or 8-inch display is often painstaking.</p>



<p>Ronald summed it up:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, our goal is to make Windows great for gaming on any device.</p>



<p>The reality is the Xbox operating system is built on top of Windows. So there’s a lot of infrastructure that we built in the console space that we can bring to the PC space and really deliver that premium gaming experience on any device.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Perhaps this mission could make gaming handhelds feel much more like <strong>gaming handhelds </strong>in future, and not like a miniature laptop that also plays games. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pubg-set-to-feature-nvidia-ai-%E2%80%98ally%E2%80%99-companions.1076772/</guid>

<p>At CES 2025, NVIDIA unveiled an AI innovation in PUBG – the ‘PUBG Ally’. This AI companion system will grant players a buddy to run around the map with, performing tasks and helping them out on a strategic level, being driven entirely by NVIDIA’s AI technology.</p>



<p>It was claimed that PUBG Ally characters will be capable of human-like behaviour, including sharp decision-making and advanced levels of audio and visual perception. The technology is set to appear in Naraka: Bladepoint and inZOI, but the most-talked-about introduction is in PUBG, the popular battle royale game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-the-first-time">Not The First Time</h2>



<p>In August 2024, I sat down with Arena Breakout: Infinite’s development team to learn about FACUL, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-facul/">revolutionary AI companion system</a> that would align players with AI support in place of real-world gamers. The system was yet to be finessed into the game, but the potential of the system seemed white-hot when it was presented at Gamescom.</p>



<p>It was a throwback of sorts to the decades-old command system found in games like SOCOM.</p>



<p>The PUBG Ally model promises to work the same way as MoreFun Studio’s FACUL engine. In PUBG, a proposed ‘co-playable character’ will support players by finding loot, driving vehicles, and providing cover fire. It’ll use ‘small language models’ to accomplish most of this, empowering the ‘CPC’ to act as a human would in every scenario imaginable.</p>



<p>If you avoid playing PUBG because you’re afraid of running solo in a battle royale game, look no further than the PUBG Ally model.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t confirmed <strong>when </strong>the system would be added to PUBG. It was stressed during the CES 2025 presentation that viewers were watching a tech demo and not a live representation of the model.</p>

<p>Hi-Rez Studios has officially confirmed that Smite 2 will transition from a paid alpha to a free-to-play open beta next week, on Tuesday, January 14. It was back in September 2024 that paying customers gained access to the Smite 2 alpha, but starting next Tuesday, you’ll be able to download and play Smite 2 without spending a penny.</p>



<p>The free-to-play transition will come hand-in-hand with a sizeable content update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-smite-2-free-to-play-update-incoming">Smite 2 Free-to-Play Update Incoming</h2>



<p>The first Smite title debuted in 2014, and it wasn’t until last year that Smite 2 surfaced in an alpha state. Now, the second title is preparing to be offered to a wider audience, with developer Hi-Rez Studios pushing it out with a free-to-play operating model.</p>



<p>When January 14 rolls around, Smite 2 will become free-to-play, but it’ll also receive a substantial update including new God characters, mechanics, and modes.</p>



<p>Smite 2 is already pretty diverse, featuring a stacked roster of playable characters – 45 in total. That number is set to be increased by more than 10% with this update, as five new Gods will come through into the game, four of which are throwbacks to the original game – Ullr, Mulan, Geb, and Agni.</p>



<p>The fifth God will be Aladdin, a character who is paired with a genie that can trap opponents at will. That sounds familiar!</p>



<p>Additionally, Hi-Rez Studios will be introducing a new 3-v-3 mode called Joust. This mode accommodates the arrival of an all-new map, made up of just one lane, such is the mode. The team has also pieced together a 1-v-1 mode called Duel, which will allow players to battle on a much more intimate playing field.</p>



<p>All this is being added to Smite 2 ‘s free-to-play update alongside a slew of quality-of-life changes, such as ‘Role Guides’, and balances.</p>



<p>Will you be downloading Smite 2 when it goes free-to-play? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
