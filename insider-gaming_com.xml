<p>Funko Fusion developer 10:10 Games has recently undergone restructuring within the studio which includes some layoffs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that 10:10 Games made changes with the last week as part of projects within the company wrapping up. We were told that the restructuring was being done to better meet the needs of current projects within the studio. What those projects are, however, remains unknown.</p>



<p>As far as the number of people let go, sources have indicated that it’s around 20 employees. 10:10 Games has yet to give clarification on the exact number of people who were laid off despite multiple requests.</p>



<p>Sources say that the company is assisting with those let go, but couldn’t verify whether that includes any sort of severance as of publishing.</p>



<p>Founded in 2021 by industry veterans Arthur Parsons and Traveller’s Tales founder Jon Burton, 10:10 Games is based in Warrington, United Kingdom. The studio released Funko Fusion, its first game, in September 2024. According to the latest public records and information from the studio’s website, 10:10 Games employed around 100 people before the layoffs. </p>



<p>Through the first seven weeks of 2025, the games industry has seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 1,000 known jobs lost</a> across 27 companies.  Multiple companies have yet to make headcounts public, meaning t hat it’s likely the number is well over 1,000 at this point. In 2024, the industry saw over 16,000 estimated losses.</p>

<p>Konami officially confirmed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater at PlayStation’s State of Play event yesterday. As you wait for the game, here is a guide on the minimum and recommended system requirements for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater on PC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is a remake of the hit 2004 title, featuring the original story, characters, voice acting, gameplay, and music. The rest of the game has been built from the ground up for modern consoles, featuring cutscenes with new life, expansive stages, and new graphics for jungles, forests, and more. Characters also have better details, with even facial wrinkles, pores, and iris movements becoming visible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have also upgraded the MGS 3 remake’s battle system, so players will see wear and tear on Snake’s clothes, bruises and bullet wounds will appear on the body, and serious injuries will remain permanently.&nbsp;</p>







<p>To best experience Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eaters’ visual enhancements, the developers have revealed a set minimum and recommended PC system requirements. However, players should note that 16 GB of RAM, 100GB of SSD storage, and DirectX 12 are compulsory for both presets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Check out Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater PC’s minimum and recommended specifications, as listed on the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam listing</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-nbsp">Minimum&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The minimum requirements for MGS 3: Snake Eater are more demanding than those for recent games. As the bare minimum, players need an Intel i5-8600 or AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and RTX 2060 Super (8GB) GPU. These specifications will let players run Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater at 1080p/30fps.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-recommended-nbsp">Recommended&nbsp;</h3>



<p>With the recommended specifications, players can run Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater at 1080p/60fps. However, they will need some upgrades, with the CPU increasing to Intel i7-8700K or AMD Ryzen 5 3600 and the GPU increasing to RTX 3080.&nbsp;</p>
