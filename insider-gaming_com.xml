<p>It has been claimed by dataminers that a Killzone collaboration is en route to Helldivers 2. If these reports are accurate, it’ll be the first time we’ve seen something Killzone-related surface in a game (outside of Astrobot) in more than a decade.</p>



<p>The last Killzone game surfaced in 2014, and it was a short-lived thing on the PlayStation 4 that died a death, before the developer, Guerrilla, moved off to focus on Horizon. Now, dataminers have uncovered images showing a new Warbond in Helldivers 2 that will award players with Helghast outfits.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-just-want-it-back">I Just Want It Back</h2>



<p>I’m a huge Killzone fan and would do anything for a revitalisation of the franchise, but that’s not going to happen. </p>



<p>Instead, I might need to rely on the new datamined Warbond – ‘Righteous Revenants’ – that’s reportedly coming to Helldivers 2.</p>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://x.com/Iron_S1ghts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Iron_S1ghts</a> published images of the ‘leaked’ Warbond, and in no time at all, it had been pulled down by Sony in a copyright strike. That’s typically all you need to believe that something is <strong>real</strong>. The images have since been shared by other fans across social media.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Helldivers 2 dataminers are giving me hope. This is the first new Killzone content in 11 years.</span></p></article></div>



<p>Per the leaks, two new armour sets could be set to surface in Helldivers 2:</p>



<ul>
<li>AC-1 Dutiful</li>



<li>AC-2 Obedient</li>
</ul>



<p>They’re both ‘Acclimated’, providing 50% resistance to elemental forms of damage. The core difference between them is that AC-1, which is based on the typical Helghast foot soldier, has a higher armour rating, while the AC-2, based on a Helghast sniper, has less armour but is faster and has better stamina regen.</p>



<p>It’s a sight better than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ellie-tlou-ii-remastered-skins-sad-killzone/">the Killzone t-shirt</a> that was added to The Last of Us Part II Remastered.</p>

<p>Team Heretics’ VALORANT superstar Benjamin “Benjyfishy” Fish has been issued a warning by Riot Games for violating the gambling section of the Global Code of Conduct. The former Fortnite pro placed, and won, a bet made during the League of Legends World Championship final between T1 and Bilibili Gaming.</p>



<p>The ruling by Riot was officially made just a couple weeks before the doors were opened to betting sponsorships.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-you-win-some-you-lose-some">You win some, you lose some</h2>



<p>According to an <a href="https://competitiveops.riotgames.com/en-US/rulings/benjy-benjyfishy-fish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official ruling</a> on Riot’s Competitive Ops website, Team Heretics informed Riot in early November that benjyfishy placed and won a wager on the Worlds final. The ruling, made on November 28, states that benjyfishy won €100 from his wager.</p>



<p>Placing said wager violates section 3.15 of the Global Code of Conduct. That section states that “Esports Professionals” may not engage in legal or illegal gambling activities involving any title owned by Riot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their ruling, Riot noted several factors that contributed to a reduced punishment. Benjyfishy self-reported the incident after realizing what they had done and fully cooperated with the investigation. The ruling also notes that he volunteered “to donate a sum to charity.” Additionally, because benjyfishy placed a wager on a game and in a region they don’t compete in, there was little “risk of direct harm to the competitive integrity of VALORANT.”</p>



<p>Benjyfishy was issued a warning, and a fine of an undisclosed amount was imposed on Team Heretics. Coincidentally, Riot confirmed to Insider Gaming earlier this week that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-policy-change-betting-sponsorships/">partnered VALORANT and League teams will be allowed to explore partnerships</a> with betting companies. An official Riot statement notes that the Riot broadcast and team jerseys will remain free of gambling branding. All potential betting partners will also be vetted by Riot before getting approval.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do you think the allowing of betting sponsors could result in a rule change that lets players place wagers? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Shift Up has revealed an upcoming holiday update for Stellar Blade, the electrifying action title released by the South Korean studio in April this year. The title competed for trophies in a couple of categories at The Game Awards, and it has been turning heads since it launched on account of the game’s protagonist, Eve.</p>



<p>As you could expect, Eve is the central focus of the holiday update, with Shift Up adding a stack of accessories, a new hairstyle, and a fresh outfit for Eve to equip.</p>



<p>Read on to check out what’s coming in the Stellar Blade holiday update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-goes-seasonal">Stellar Blade Goes Seasonal</h2>



<p>In the latest update for Stellar Blade, a slew of holiday-themed assets have been added.</p>



<p>Players can unlock the ‘Santa Dress’, an exclusive outfit for Adam, and other new accessories, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Santa Girl hairstyle</li>



<li>Snow Crystal glasses</li>



<li>Wreath Earrings</li>



<li>Sleigh Earcuff</li>



<li>Rudolf Drone Skin</li>
</ul>



<p>Shift Up has added new BGM to celebrate the Christmas period, and they’ll be playable both in the camp and in certain areas around Zion – in the small plaza and The Last Gulp. Players can also marvel at the seasonal decorations spread around Zion, adding a touch of festivity to the post-apocalyptic slasher.</p>



<p>If you look hard enough in Zion, you’ll find that the target shooting minigame has been adorned with a festive theme, but that’s the most interactive element of this update if I’m being honest.</p>



<p>In addition, the team has made various bug fixes as part of the update – but we don’t care about that, we just want the holiday-themed content.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to unlocking the holiday content in Stellar Blade? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Lords of the Fallen 2 is already being eagerly awaited by the community. Today (17), new information about the sequel was revealed by Marek Tyminski, CEO of CI Games, the game’s publisher.</p>



<p>According to Marek, the game has already entered the full production phase with more than 200 developers working on it. </p>



<div><article><p><span>The next game under </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LordsoftheFallen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#LordsoftheFallen</a><span> has been already under full production for a good part of this year. As of now we have over 200 people full time working on that, both internal team and codev partners.</span></p></article></div>



<p>According to the CEO, the internal forecast is for the game to be released sometime in 2026. The marketing campaign will begin sometime next year. </p>



<p>Hexworks has delivered a very competent Souls-like game that has revitalized the franchise. Surprisingly, as well as making a new game, the studio still manages to find time to support the first game by releasing patches frequently. </p>



<p>The reboot was praised for its unusual realm-crossing mechanics that impacted exploration and direct campaign progression.</p>

<p>Exodus, a new AAA sci-fi RPG from Archetype Entertainment, has been given an electrifying gameplay trailer.</p>



<p>Called “The Traveler’s Creed”, the material shows story scenes, some of the locations we’ll be visiting, breathtaking scenery and, of course, lots of explosions. The game’s budget seems to be quite generous, after all, even a trailer featuring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exodus-starring-matthew-mcconaughey-gets-new-cinematic-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew McConaughey</a> has been released.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EXODUS Gameplay Trailer: 'The Traveler's Creed'" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DmJxSKn47EE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In one part of the trailer, we can see a gigantic bear wearing space armor. Crazy, right? The protagonist will also be able to use a grappling hook to move around the environment faster.</p>



<p>Comparisons with Mass Effect are and will be inevitable, after all, part of the Exodus team are veterans who worked on the BioWare franchise. And, well, judging by this initial trailer, fans of Shepard are going to be very happy with Exodus.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, no release date has been announced. The synopsis reads as follows:</p>



<p>“<em>Join the Travelers, as they sacrifice their lives to travel through the Centauri Universe on a dangerous mission to save an isolated Awakened civilization from enslavement by Celestials. Our service – our sacrifice – discovers worlds, seeds hope, breaks empires</em>.”</p>
