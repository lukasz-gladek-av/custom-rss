<p>The Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) may be gone, but the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) isn’t done putting on events centered around the games industry. The ESA announced on Thursday the creation of the Interactive Innovation Conference, or iicon.</p>



<p>Billed as an “essential convening for changemakers across industries”, <a href="https://www.theesa.com/entertainment-software-association-unveils-iicon-game-changing-thought-leader-summit-to-harness-the-power-of-interactive-entertainment-and-shape-the-future-of-business-and-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the inaugural event</a> will take place in Las Vegas from April 27-30, 2026. </p>



<p>“For decades, video games have been at the forefront of technological and cultural innovation,” ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis said. “With iicon, we are creating a space for visionaries across industries to come together, connect and reimagine what’s possible through interactive entertainment.”</p>



<p>“The Entertainment Software Association and its member companies are among the innovators and leaders shaping the future of culture, business and human connection,” ESA’s Chairman of the Board Doug Bowser said. “It’s a natural role for ESA to host and support an event that fosters an open exchange of new ideas with our peer industry leaders. Iicon is bringing together changemakers from across industries to envision how the strengths of the interactive entertainment industry can break entirely new ground.”</p>



<p>As far as what organizations will take part in the event, the ESA revealed that Amazon Games, Disney, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Microsoft, Nintendo of America, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Square Enix, Take-Two Interactive, Ubisoft and Warner Bros. Games. will  all have a presence.</p>



<p>“Iicon will bring together some of the brightest minds from the games industry to navigate present challenges and harness the opportunities ahead,” Christoph Hartmann, vice president of Amazon Games, said.</p>



<p>Despite being run by the same organization, this event isn’t being touted as a replacement for E3, which was often filled with large presentations  and, in its later years, thousands of gamers. The ESA says that iicon is “tailored to visionaries, thought leaders and innovators across industries that intersect with interactive entertainment.”</p>



<p>More details on the event such as speakers, general access, and more will be announced at a later date. Attendance will be invite only.</p>

<p>Official mods are now available for Hogwarts Legacy, allowing players to change how they perceive the already magical world created by Avalanche Software and Warner Bros. Games. Mods are a way to add a new layer of excitement to the game’s vanilla experience. Players can mess around with how their characters look, how the game’s world feels, how they interact with traversal objects and even experience new quest lines and missions. This guide will take you through some of the best Hogwarts Legacy mods available through official mod support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game has always had mods on PC; however, the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-mods-support-arrives-with-new-pc-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a> has added official support from the developers. <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hogwarts-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cursed Forge</a> is managing and publishing the official mods for Hogwarts Legacy, and you can find these mods in-game mod manager. If you are unaware of how to install Hogwarts Legacy mods, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-install-hogwarts-legacy-mods-a-step-by-step-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s guide</a>. </p>



<p>If you have finished all that Hogwarts Legacy has to offer, then mods will be the best way to jump back in. As official mod support is pretty new, we will go through some of the top mods for Hogwarts Legacy across various categories, such as Brooms, Wands, Clothing, Gameplay and more. </p>

<h2 id="h-hogwarts-legacy-broom-mods">Hogwarts Legacy Broom Mods</h2>



<p>If you have grown tired of all the stock Brooms in the game, here are some unique ones that can be accessed in Hogwarts Legacy through mods. Various choices are available, and we will go through some of the best ones. </p>



<h3 id="h-giant-cat-broom">Giant Cat Broom</h3>



<p>You guessed it; this mod switches out your Broom for Giant Cat in Hogwarts Legacy. However, it can only be used as a variant of the Moon Trimmer broom. The Cat also has an animation, and it moves its legs when flying in the air. </p>

<h3 id="h-magic-carpet-broom-and-vacuum-broom">Magic Carpet Broom and Vacuum Broom </h3>



<p>There are some silly Hogwarts Legacy Broom mods, too. The first one, Magic Carpet Broom Mods, lets you get into the shoes of Alladin and fly on a magic carpet across the open world. However, it looks silly as the character’s legs pop out of the rug, as they are designed to sit on a broom. Vacuum Broom replaces the Moon Trimmer with a Vacuum cleaner. </p>



<h3 id="h-dementor-s-broom">Dementor’s Broom</h3>



<p>If you have missed Dementors in Hogwarts Legacy, this mod will allow players to hang out with one almost perpetually. The Dementor’s Broom mod will tether a spectral Dementor to the Ember Dash broom. </p>



<h3 id="h-dragon-brooms-and-dragon-spine">Dragon Brooms and Dragon Spine</h3>



<p>Fans of Harry Potter would love to ride around on some Dragons in Hogwarts Legacy, and this mod allows you to live your dream. Dragon Broom adds three Dragons: the Moon Trimmer turns into a Green Welsh, the Ember Dash turns into Hebridean Black, and the Yew Weaver turns into the Hungarian Horntail. On the other hand, Dragon Spine replaces the Moon Trimmer with a dragon’s skeleton. </p>

<h3 id="h-broom-trails">Broom Trails </h3>



<p>If you don’t wish to change how your broom looks, then you can go for a different trail. Players will find Trail Blazers for all brooms: Emberdash, Yew Weaver, Moon Trimmer, Aeromancer and more. </p>



<h2 id="h-hogwarts-legacy-wand-mods">Hogwarts Legacy Wand Mods</h2>



<p>In a game about Harry Potter, you need access to as many wands as possible. As Hogwarts Legacy sticks you with one wand for the entire game, players can use mods to add a plethora of new choices. </p>



<h3 id="h-character-wands">Character Wands </h3>



<p>This mod will allow players to swap their wand for a wand used by other characters in the game. Players will be able to shuffle between mods by using Shift + Page Down / GPad Left Shoulder + GPad DPad Right for ‘Next Wand’ and Shift + Page Up / GPad Left Shoulder + GPad DPad Left for ‘Previous Wand’. </p>



<h3 id="h-wacky-wands">Wacky Wands </h3>



<p>Players can swap their authentic wands for some of the most goofy objects out there with Wacky Wands mod. This mod will allow players to choose from options like a Baguette, Inflatable Sword, Chainsaw, Rubber Chicken, Electric Guitar, and more. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-default-wand-shop">Default Wand Shop </h3>



<p>This mod will allow players to change their wand style, wood type, and wand core from any stock wands on the fly. Players will find a new ‘Wand Shop’ button on the bottom right of the Save Settings menu. </p>



<h3 id="h-elder-wand">Elder Wand </h3>



<p>If you are using different types of wands in Hogwarts Legacy through mods, you might as well use the most iconic wand in the franchise’s history, the Elder Wand. </p>



<h2 id="h-hogwarts-legacy-clothes-and-accessories-mods">Hogwarts Legacy Clothes and Accessories&nbsp;Mods</h2>



<p>Hogwarts Legacy already provides tons of customisation options in the game’s character creator and the loot you find throughout the game. However, with the help of mods, the level of customisation options is taken to the next level. </p>



<h3 id="h-cliffans-outfits-and-accessories">Cliffans Outfits and Accessories</h3>



<p>Cliffans Outfits and Accessories is one of the best Hogwarts Legacy mods right now, thanks to all the options it provides. Players get to wear high-quality clothing and accessories like rings and bags. The new clothes have physics, and players can also wear their broom on their shoulders. The mods’ items are available through Galdrags Wizardwear. However, players must wait three in-game days for the items to be visible in the shop. </p>



<figure></figure>

<h3 id="h-beard-appearance-mods">Beard Appearance Mods</h3>



<p>In Hogwarts Legacy, the player character is a school-going kid, so it’s bizarre to see kids walking around with long beards in the school. But if that is how you want your character to be, you can do so either through the Dark Brown Beard Gear Appearance mod or the Wizard Long Beard Gear Appearance Set. The latter adds three long white beats for male and female avatars. </p>



<h3 id="h-casual-npc-costume">Casual NPC Costume</h3>



<p>If you are tired of seeing the game’s NPCs wear the same outfit the entire time, check out the Casual NPCs mod. It provides a complete wardrobe overhaul for 10 characters, including ” custom-designed ensembles.” Currently, the mod can change the appearance of the following characters in Hogwarts Legacy: Sebastian Sallow, Ominis Gaunt, Garreth Weasley, Amit Thakkar, Natsai Onai, Leander Prewett, Poppy Sweeting, Imelda Reyes, Arthur Plummly, and Andrew Larson. </p>



<h3 id="h-dark-arts-wardrobe">Dark Arts Wardrobe </h3>



<p>Another option for new outfits is the Dark Arts Wardrobe mods. Players can access three new costumes: Spooky Formal Attire, Beetle Suit and Halloween Vest and Stockings. All three are available in both male and female versions. Like Cliffans, players will find these outfits in Galdrags Wizardwear, and they must wait three in-game days for the items to be visible in the shop.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-skin-colour-and-hair-colour-change">Skin Colour and Hair Colour Change</h3>



<p>If you are done checking out all the new Hogwarts Legacy outfit mods, check out the new Skin Colours and Hair Colours. Colorful Skin Colors mod will add Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple skin color to the Character Creator. The Additional Hair Colors mod adds 10 additional hair color options to Madam Snelling’s Salon and Character Creator. </p>



<h2 id="h-hogwarts-legacy-gameplay-mods">Hogwarts Legacy Gameplay Mods&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The list up till now has focused on purely cosmetic mods for Hogwarts Legacy; however, the following mods will focus on how you modify your gameplay experience. </p>



<h3 id="h-unlock-all-spells-gear-and-brooms">Unlock All Spells, Gear and Brooms </h3>



<p>If you find the unlocking process too long, check out these mods to use zero Effort. Unlock All Spells will instantly unlock all the spells for the player character, and Unlock All Brooms will add all the game’s brooms to the player’s inventory. Unlock All Gear will reveal all gloves, glasses, hats, scarves, robes, and outfits, allowing players to transform any outfit. However, it won’t add anything to the player’s inventory and will only change the character’s appearance. </p>



<h3 id="h-cheat-plus">Cheat Plus</h3>



<p>The Cheat Plus mod for Hogwarts Legacy adds a variety of convenience-based cheats for gameplay. Players can access any shop anywhere, become invincible, perform super jumps, add or remove money, identify all gear and much more. </p>



<figure></figure>

<h3 id="h-alohomora-unlocked-lv3">Alohomora Unlocked (Lv3)</h3>



<p>This mod will set your Alohomora Spell to level 3 without having to find any moons in the game. Level 3 allows you to access any of the locked doors. </p>



<h3 id="h-instant-plants-and-potions-and-increased-capacity">Instant Plants and Potions and Increased Capacity</h3>



<p>If your interests lie in Herbology and Potions, these mods will be a perfect fit. Instant Plants and Instant Potions mods reduce the brewing and growing wait time to one second, allowing you to have a surplus of plants and potions. </p>



<h3 id="h-increased-gear-potion-and-resource-capacity">Increased Gear, Potion and Resource  Capacity </h3>



<p>With the help of Hogwarts Legacy mods, players can acquire resources and store many more of them instantly. Increased Gear Capacity increases the player’s inventory to 520 items. Instant Potion/Resource Capacity will increase the maximum capacity of plants and potions. If the maximum capacity were 999, it would expand to 9999, 500 would also increase to 9999, 25 would change to 2500 and 12 would change to 1200. </p>



<h3 id="h-dekita-battle-pets">Dekita Battle Pets</h3>



<p>Modders have found a way to merge Pokemon and Hogwarts Legacy, and that’s done through a new mod called Dekita Battle Pets. Through this mod, players will be able to take customisable pet companions into battle. First, they will only be allowed muggle pets, but later, they receive access to the game’s Magical Beasts. The pets will grow and become stronger over time by levelling up and learning new skills.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-hogwarts-legacy-mission-and-quest-mods">Hogwarts Legacy Mission and Quest Mods </h2>



<h3 id="h-dungeon-of-doom">Dungeon of Doom </h3>



<p>The Dungeon of Doom mod for Hogwarts Legacy adds a brand new experience for the player. The experience features new design elements and areas players haven’t seen in the game. The Dungeon of Doom tests players’ wits as they go through a series of rooms, take on a variety of enemies and unlock new rewards. </p>



<h3 id="h-sam-s-dungeon">Sam’s Dungeon</h3>



<p>Like Dungeon of Doom, the Sam’s Dungeon mod also adds the custom Dungeon, this time near the Hamlet of Upper Hogsfield. Sam’s Dungeon will feature some tricky puzzles, different enemies, and some exploration that will lead you to new rewards. </p>



<figure></figure>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-avowed-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1102155/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-xbox-game-pass/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Microsoft is set for an interesting year in 2025, and Avowed is leading the charge for the green brand. Xbox Game Pass is one of the company’s leading benefits, and a partnership with Avowed could help both Obsidian and Microsoft at the end of the day.</p>



<p>Xbox Game Pass is a simple model—you pay a monthly fee, and you get free games. Game Pass’ library continues to grow month by month. It has players constantly wondering if they need to fork out top dollar on new AAA titles when they might be part of Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a> is looking like being one of Microsoft’s bigger exclusives in 2025—with titles such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-period-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a> making their way over to PS5—so let’s see if Game Pass users get to play it for nothing.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-avowed-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Avowed on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It looks enchanting. Credit to Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Avowed is coming to Xbox Game Pass as a day-one title, meaning if you have an active subscription, you can play Avowed on Game Pass from February 18.</strong></p>



<p>The “Avowed – Official Announce Trailer” on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox’s official YouTube channel</a> (back on July 23, 2020) made waves. It’s a teaser, for sure, but it has enough substance and gameplay to stir up players for a new Obsidian franchise. Curiously, it makes no mention of Xbox Game Pass throughout its duration.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Avowed - Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W3QkO8fy3tg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But thanks to some journalistic digging, I did find it in the video’s description: “<strong>Play day 1 on Xbox Game Pass</strong>.” With not long to go until February 18, five years is suddenly nothing! </p>



<p>Its status has remained unchanged for the last five years, meaning it is indeed a day-one Game Pass launch for Xbox and PC users. The news was also confirmed in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-titles-for-february-2025-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Xbox Game Pass games reveal</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-avowed-on-xbox-game-pass">How Long is Avowed on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Neither Microsoft nor Obsidian has commented on how long Avowed is staying on Xbox Game Pass.</strong></p>



<p>It’s the kind of question that always comes up. You don’t want to miss out, and neither do I. FOMO is a powerful tool, but sleep easy knowing exclusive games like <strong>Avowed are usually on Xbox Game Pass for several years—and longer</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you happy to see Avowed coming to Xbox Game Pass? Do you think it can go one better and outdo Obsidian’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a> in 2025? Share your thoughts and feelings.</p>



<p>We have the latest on many other titles and their Xbox Game Pass status: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-sniper-elite-resistance-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-coming-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-stalker-2-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2</a>.</p>
