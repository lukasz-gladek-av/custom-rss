<p>Details of the recent Discord data hack continue to paint a darker picture for the company and its users. According to Discord news source Discord Previews, the group taking responsibility for the compromise claims to have an enormous amount of user data, specifically millions of user photos.</p>



<p>In a post on social media <a href="https://x.com/DiscordPreviews/status/1975909634293854364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord Previews</a> said that <strong>‚Äúthe perpetrators of this attack claim to have obtained 1.5 TB of age-verification photos totalling 2,185,151 images.‚Äù</strong> It was added that the stolen data is being used, as with most instances like this, to ‚Äúextort Discord‚Äù.</p>



<p>On October 3, Discord publicly announced that an ‚Äúunauthorized party compromised one of Discord‚Äôs third-party customer service providers.‚Äù This incident, which happened in late September, had the following data impacted:</p>



<ul>
<li>Name, Discord username, email, and other contact details if provided to Discord customer support</li>



<li>Limited billing information, such as payment type, the last four digits of your credit card, and purchase history, if associated with your account</li>



<li>IP addresses</li>



<li>Messages with our customer service agents&nbsp;</li>



<li>Limited corporate data (training materials, internal presentations)</li>
</ul>



<p>Information such as full credit card and CCV numbers, private messages, passwords, and other authentication data wasn‚Äôt involved.</p>



<p>According to Discord‚Äôs own policies, ID submissions are supposed to be deleted after age verification is complete. </p>



<p><strong>‚ÄúDiscord and k-ID do not permanently store personal identity documents or your video selfies,‚Äù </strong>they say. <strong>‚ÄúThe image of your identity document and the ID face match selfie are deleted directly after&nbsp;your age group is confirmed, and the video selfie used for facial age estimation never leaves your device.‚Äù</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Discord for comment on how the company is looking to move forward and why so many age-verification photos were still within the company‚Äôs database. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>Bethesda is preparing the world for another epic day. Fallout Day 2025 has been announced, and there are broadcast date details, along with information on its start time, and a sneak peek at what the company could have in store for you all on the S.P.E.C.I.A.L day.</p>



<p>Some people love Christmas Day, others look forward to Thanksgiving. But for long-time Bethesda fans, it probably doesn‚Äôt get better than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-day-broadcast-dates-and-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout Day</a>. The 2025 edition is upon us, and last year‚Äôs showcase provided huge updates on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-release-notes-pts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 76</a> and new content and DLC.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-day-2025-date-amp-time-announced">Fallout Day 2025 Date &amp; Time Announced</h2>

<p>Bethesda and Fallout fans can look forward to Fallout Day 2025 starting at 1 PM ET on October 23!</p>



<p>News of this comes directly from <a href="https://x.com/Fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fallout</a>‚Äòs social media: ‚ÄúSave the date! Our annual FalloutDay Broadcast will be streaming live on October 23 at 1 PM ET, with the FalloutforHope post-show immediately following.‚Äù</p>



<p>If you didn‚Äôt know, FalloutforHope is a charity organized by Fallout content creator Kenneth Vigue and aims to ‚Äúoffer hope and relief for children and their families at a time of year when loss is felt and help keenly needed.‚Äù</p>



<p>This is amazing publicity for a good cause, which should round off what is usually a solid show.</p>



<p>While Bethesda hasn‚Äôt explicitly revealed anything in particular that will be shown off or announced during Fallout Day 2025, the company has said the broadcast will feature ‚Äúnews about existing Fallout games‚Äù and news on upcoming Fallout fan events.</p>



<p>Could there be a surprise announcement regarding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-fallout-3-remastered-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 3 Remaster</a> lying in wait? I guess we‚Äôll all have to tune in and find out.</p>
