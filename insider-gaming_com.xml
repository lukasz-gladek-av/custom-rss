<p>Ubisoft has acquired a new studio. In a press release on Monday, the France-based company announced that it was bringing in the developers of March of Giants. </p>



<p>Terms of the agreement weren’t made public, aside from the fact that Ubisoft will gain the rights to March of Giants and Amazon will provide marketing for the game on Twitch.</p>







<p>March of the Giants is an upcoming 4v4 tactical&nbsp;MOBA that has players fight in lanes and command groups of “comparatively pint-sized enemies”. According to Ubisoft, the gameplay <strong>“combines elements of real-time strategy and lane-based combat with large-scale coordination and mastery of the giant heroes that make up its roster.”</strong> When it launches, the game will be free to play. </p>



<p>With the deal for the Montral team, Ubisoft sees the <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6TYgLsRkVYP97hVH0Rhzn7/ubisoft-acquires-march-of-giants-from-amazon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">former creative director</a> of Rainbow Six Siege, Xavier Marquis, return to the company after seven years.</p>



<p><strong>“Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle,</strong>” Marquis said via release. “<strong>We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level.</strong>“</p>







<p>Also returning to the company is Ubisoft Toronto’s former managing director Alex Parizeau. </p>



<p><strong>“My thanks go to Amazon for their commitment during the first chapters of March of Giants,”</strong> Parizeau said. <strong>“Our closed alpha was an important milestone and showed a glimpse of the game’s real promise. Now, by joining Ubisoft, we’re uniting behind a shared vision to build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs.”</strong></p>



<p>Aside from March of Giants, there’s no word on what the plans are for the former Amazon Games Montreal team with Ubisoft. As the weeks and months go by, those plans are likely to be made known.</p>

<p>The head of studio at Crystal Dynamics has revealed that players don’t need to do homework with previous games before jumping into Tomb Raider: The Catalyst. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Game Awards 2025 made dreams come true for Tomb Raider fans with not one, but two new game announcements. The first is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remake of the original 1996&nbsp;title</a>, arriving during the franchise’s 30th anniversary. The other is a brand new chapter that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-catalyst-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">takes Lara Croft to northern India</a>. We have now received some new details for the latest chapter. </p>







<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-catalyst-is-the-largest-game-for-the-franchise-to-date">Tomb Raider: Catalyst is the ‘Largest Game’ for the Franchise To Date</h2>



<p>During a virtual Q&amp;A session attended by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/tomb-raider-catalyst-is-crystal-dynamics-largest-lara-croft-game-yet-and-theres-no-homework-required-to-jump-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Crystal Dynamics Head of Studio, Scot Amos, provided more details about Tomb Raider: Catalyst. Amos first spoke about the timeline, revealing that the game is set in “the furthest point in [Lara Croft’s] career”. This is where the character is right now, and “everything else is her history”. However, even though this is the furthest point, new players don’t need to play the previous games before Catalyst. </p>



<p>Amos explains that Tomb Raider Catalyst has been designed in a way where new players “can jump in right now and pick up with her adventures as is, like I say, there’s no homework required.” Players who try the new game will feel “this [is a] complete adventure top to bottom, and understand the story and the characters without having to know any of that pre-history.”</p>



<p>The head of studio also revealed that this is “the largest Tomb Raider” that they have ever created, and they are excited about bringing this experience to everyone. The game also features “really vast and varied landscapes as well that are just begging to be explored.”</p>
