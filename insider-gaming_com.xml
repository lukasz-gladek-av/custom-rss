<p>It has been confirmed that Geralt of Rivia <strong>will indeed appear </strong>in The Witcher 4, but everyone involved is NDA’d out of their minds and can’t say exactly in what capacity he’ll surface.</p>



<p>It was just a few days ago that Doug Cockle, the veteran voice actor behind Geralt, confirmed that he’d ‘been slapped’ by CDPR for commenting about appearing in The Witcher 4. Now, CDPR itself has confirmed that Geralt will appear in the upcoming title, which was unveiled this week at The Game Awards.</p>

<h2 id="h-on-the-path">On The Path</h2>



<p>In the first trailer for The Witcher 4, a few seconds were reserved right at the tail end for a line from Doug Cockle in true Geralt form. It referenced staying on ‘the path’ that Witchers follow, and it commented on this being the beginning of a new saga.</p>



<p>The Witcher 4 will star Ciri in a leading role, which shouldn’t come as a surprise to the franchise’s truest fans. It has always been about Ciri, after all – it was <strong>expected </strong>that she’d take up the mantle of ‘The Witcher’ in this all-new game from CDPR.</p>



<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-and-that-is-indeed-doug-cockles-voice-in-the-trailer-cd-projekt-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, CD Projekt confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Geralt will appear in the game, but we don’t want to spoil his role precisely. You’ll have to wait to learn more for now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the end of Blood and Wine, the final expansion for 2015’s The Witcher 3, Geralt effectively retired to a vineyard in Toussaint. What he’s been doing since then is anyone’s guess, but it’s now assumed to be canonical that Ciri took up the silver sword and went Witchering in his place. </p>



<p>In the trailer for The Witcher 4, we see an empowered Ciri consuming potions and using signs, which means she’s undergone the Trial of the Grasses, at the very least.</p>



<p>Perhaps Geralt of Rivia will appear in The Witcher 4 in a similar role that Vesemir served in The Witcher 3, as a wise old mentor.</p>
