<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is set to be released on February 4, bringing a deeply realistic open-world RPG experience to players everywhere. It’s one of the most highly anticipated games of 2025, featuring a widely branching and immersive story that might leave newcomers feeling confused about what’s going on.</p>



<p>With that being said, I’ve pieced together a guide to tackle the topic: ‘Do you need to play Kingdom Come Deliverance first?’ The first game came out in 2018, and the second game is a direct follow-on from that title.</p>



<p>But do you need to play Kingdom Come Deliverance before 2? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-a-sequel">Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 a Sequel?</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a direct sequel to the first game, which was released in 2018. The events of the second game start very soon after the ending of the first title, with the player assuming control of the same protagonist in roughly the same game world.</p>



<p>That means that you might be feeling wary about going into such an expansive story with no idea of what happened in the first title.</p>



<p>Is it worth playing Kingdom Come Deliverance before KCD2, though?</p>



<p>Not necessarily.</p>



<p>In the game’s opening sequences, you’re given a step-by-step introduction to the universe, and Warhorse Studios, the game’s developer, has done a wonderful job of letting you know what happened in the first game while making it seem like a natural walkthrough.</p>



<p>You’ll learn about – or have the option to <strong>choose </strong>– what happened in the first game. Many themes pull across from KCD into KCDII, but if you’re completely new to the series and want to get started with the second game, you won’t feel like a fish out of water.</p>



<p>By itself, KCDII is a perfectly enjoyable game that can be appreciated by anyone who hasn’t played the first title. There are many flashback sequences and conversations that help you piece together the main character’s story before Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-kingdom-come-deliverance-story-real">Is The Kingdom Come Deliverance Story Real?</h2>



<p>Most of the events that unfold in Kingdom Come Deliverance (and the sequel) are true-to-life. The historical figures are mostly real, and the setting is a like-for-like replica of real-world locations. The era has been represented perfectly by Warhorse Studios, which employed scores of experts to make sure everything was as accurate and authentic as possible.</p>



<p>That being said, it’s highly likely Henry of Skalitz <strong>wasn’t</strong> a real person. He’s a fictional rendition created to explore this wonderful world at a turbulent time.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is set to be released on February 4, and previews are running wild. It’s scoring high in the early impressions – including mine. This open-world RPG from Warhorse Studios is a direct continuation of the 2018 epic, both of which are steeped in history and authenticity.</p>



<p>In this snapshot game guide, I’m answering one key question: ‘Does Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 have photomode?’</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-there-photomode-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Is There Photomode in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 does have photomode</strong>, but it’s a relatively unassuming, toned-down inclusion.</p>



<p>When you activate photomode in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll be presented with a freecam that you can move around, but that’s about it. There are no options to zoom, tilt, or alter the field of view, and there is no function that allows you to apply filters, or to edit the image in any way.</p>



<p>It’s simple, but it’s <strong>there</strong>.</p>



<p>The first Kingdom Come game, released in 2018, did <strong>not </strong>have a photomode, so users found it awkward to capture shots of the game’s environment. If you played on PC, there was a command to remove the UI, which was the best you could get.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has gone one step ahead of that in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 by including a basic photomode.</p>



<p>That’s not to say that this is where it ends for the feature, though. The team may enhance the photomode once the game has been released in full on February 4, adding poses, facial expressions, a time of day scroller, and frames. It’s likely not high on the list of pre-release priorities, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-photomode-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">How to Use Photomode in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</h2>



<p>If you’re playing Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 with a controller, simply click both L3 and R3 together to open up the photomode menu.</p>



<p>If you’re playing the game with a keyboard, you need to tap F1 to open the photomode screen, but that can, of course, be rebound at your will.</p>



<p>That’s all there is to it – owing to the simplicity of the feature, there’s not much else to say.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-new-peak-player-count-steam-charts/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivels-just-hit-a-new-peak-player-count-and-topped-steam%E2%80%99s-charts.1079748/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-new-peak-player-count-steam-charts/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Marvel Rivals continues to impress fans worldwide since being released in December. The increasingly popular hero shooter secured 20 million players by the end of December, and it has refused to move from the top of the charts in the days that have followed. Hours ago, Marvel Rivals hit a new peak player count on Steam as season one was rolled out.</p>



<p>The charts are little more than a plaything for Marvel Rivals, which is already defying the typical performance of a live-service game, getting stronger over time rather than ebbing away a month after release. There are no signs of the game slowing down.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-huge-performance">Huge Performance</h2>



<p>Following the deployment of the game’s first full season, the player count soared on Steam. Marvel Rivals secured a peak concurrent player count of 644,269 users, and for a time, it was the single-most popular game on Steam, beating the likes of Counter-Strike 2, which is by no means a simple feat.</p>



<p>NetEase hit the nail on the head with Marvel Rivals. It helps that the game had a pre-existing fan base, and one of the most engaged communities in the world at that, but it <strong>also </strong>helps that it offers a solid, enjoyable experience with few issues.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has untapped potential abound – there are so many characters that the developer can implement in the game, and that’s in addition to an already dense roster featuring Marvel’s greatest heroes. There are also some unsung gems in that crowd, of course.</p>



<p>Are you one of the 20 – 30 million people playing Marvel Rivals, or is the hero shooter not your kind of thing? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Anthony ‘Shotzzy’ Cuevas-Castro is one of the most talented and consistent players in the Call of Duty League. While flying the OpTic Texas banner last year, he won the CDL Championship, securing yet another ring in the game he’s scarily good at. He’s one of just two esports pros in history to have earned a world championship title in two games, so he’s got a little prestige to his name.</p>



<p>Recently, the 23-year-old superstar exploded on social media, going on a rant against his peers and fellow CDL competitors. In a series of inflammatory comments posters on Twitter, the young player roasted others around him.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-excuse">‘Another Excuse’</h2>



<p>It all began <a href="https://x.com/Shotzzy">when Shotzzy posted</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Most teams study break offs more than playing efficient – fkn idiots’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a response to a comment on that very post, Cuevas-Castro followed up by explaining: ‘Truly dgaf anymore I’m speaking wtf I think to day’. As fans settled in for the heel turn, Shotzzy then posted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Players getting payment cuts every year and wonder why, fking clowns most yall guys don’t do shit besides collect a check’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>His most devoted fans lauded his attitude, stressing that he’s ‘one of the only pros’ who applies ample effort to his content and career. Recently, Shotzzy proposed that organisations should stream their scrims to give fans of the Call of Duty League something to watch during the mid-stage breaks that happen once every few weeks.</p>



<p>He’s one of many COD pro players to stress recently that Black Ops 6 is in a dark place.</p>



<p>From there, Shotzzy got even more aggressive:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘8s don’t help this and that SnD 8s WON ME CHAMPS AND EVERY TOURNAMENT I HAVE EVER WON another excuse of not playing the game lazy fucks’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He capped off his rant with a coupe de grace:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Gonna chill now but yo @ most cdl pros put the fries in the bag in a couple years ty</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After that, Shotzzy kicked off a stream on Twitch. It’s possible this was all a plan to generate engagement before leaping onto a stream and capturing an enthralled audience. It could also be the player’s true feeling bubbling to the surface after containing them for quite a while.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that the Call of Duty esport scene isn’t in the best shape, but is it up to the players themselves to heft it up onto their shoulders and bring it back to life? Let us know what you think on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nickmercs-left-faze-clan-five-years/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nickmercs-has-left-faze-clan-after-five-years-with-the-brand.1079742/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nickmercs-left-faze-clan-five-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Nickmercs has announced a withdrawal from FaZe Clan, an organisation he has been with for more than five years. In a lengthy announcement posted on social media, both Nickmercs – real name Nick Kolcheff – and FaZe Clan posted an emotional farewell message.</p>



<p>The content creator, who at times has been highly controversial, let his followers know that it’s not a ‘bad blood’ situation and that he has ‘no issues with them whatsoever’, it’s ‘just that time to move forward’. He didn’t explain if he’ll be joining a new organisation but stressed that on Monday, he’ll have a ‘huge announcement’ to share.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-moving-on">Moving On</h2>



<p>On social media, Nickmercs wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, I wanna let y’all know that we are no longer with FaZe Clan. No issues with them whatsoever, it’s just that time to move forward. Y’all know I gotta lot of love for Banks, Tommy, Rug, Apex etc &amp; wish them &amp; the boys all the best. Beyond grateful for the memories &amp; achievements we had together.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By way of a response, FaZe Clan then posted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>NickMercs, you joined FaZe at the worst possible time. The fact we made it 5 years with you just goes to show what kind of a guy you are. We clicked almost immediately and always felt like you were truly one of the boys. “Cut from the same cloth” if you will. You repped this FaZe shit and rode through the absolute worst period of its existence.</p>



<p>He’s hard planted in Michigan building MFAM and taking care of his beautiful family. It’ll always be nothing but love for you big guy. Best of luck in your future endeavors</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nickmercs was one of FaZe Clan’s most prominent creators, boasting a following of 10.8 million users between Twitch and YouTube alone. He has been streaming for years and regularly partners with some of the biggest content creators in the business.</p>



<p>Recent years were not smooth sailing for the 34-year-old. In 2023, he landed himself in hot water following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nickmercs-drama-subscribers/">an anti-LGBTQ tirade</a>, but his return after the debacle saw him rack up 11,000 subscribers in a single stream. Later that year, he came under fire for signing a contract with Kick.com that included <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nickmercs-kick-gambling/">a requirement to host gambling streams</a>.</p>



<p>Then, in June 2024, Nickmercs was banned from Twitch for the first time <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nickmercs-banned-from-twitch/">for using a ‘transphobic slur’</a> while talking in the wake of the Dr Disrespect controversy. </p>



<p>Since then, the ship has been righted and the creator is back on top where he loves to be.</p>

<p>In 2023, Evil Geniuses won VALORANT Champions, claiming just the third ever world championship in Riot’s tactical FPS. Less than two years later, only one face remains: coach Christine “potter” Chi.</p>



<p>Potter, a former Counter-Strike pro who first joined EG as a player in 2021, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/potter-signs-three-year-extension-with-eg-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed an extension this offseason</a> to continue coaching through 2027. The team also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/evil-geniuses-sign-yay-and-icy-to-complete-2025-valorant-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed Jacob “icy” Lange and once-upon-a-time best player in the world Jaccob “yay” Whiteaker</a>.</p>



<p>This year, the goal for potter is the same as it always is: do more with less.</p>



<hr>



<p>Insider Gaming had the opportunity to sit down with potter at the VCT Americas Media Day. The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</p>



<p><strong>IG: At the SEN City Classic you talked about wanting to work with that roster specifically, but what led to the team ending up with icy as opposed to&nbsp;Tyler “sym” Porter?</strong></p>



<p>“My mindset towards rosters has always been tunneled towards making it work, no matter what. I’ve never looked at it from the angle of ‘when can I replace this player?’ So when I said that at the time, I fully believed that would be our roster in 2025.</p>



<p>After that tournament though, it was clear there were some issues with sym. I do really wish we could have made it work; sym is incredibly talented, he’s really hungry, an incredible teammate and a really good human. But the time issue was always on my mind, with trying to bring yay into a comfortable environment and highlighting him to be successful. We need to make sure everyone was playing their roles properly, especially with all of yay’s role changes and not being as comfortable on the sentinel role.</p>



<p>This roster that we’re going into Kickoff with, this combination of players turned out to be better for us.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>Potter lifts the trophy at Champions 2023. Image credit: Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>IG: The last time you kept the same roster core between years was from 2022 to 2023, and we all know how well 2023 turned out. How important is it to keep the same core together through the offseason?</strong></p>



<p>“It’s so important. Even at that time, I was getting so much shit from the community, my peers, from some in management about replacing certain players on that 2023 roster. But I knew keeping a core was going to be important. All the work, all the small annoyances that teams have to do that take so much time, that was already out of the way [in 2023].</p>



<p>And it’s the same with this roster in 2025. We took last year to hash out a lot of those details, to learn about each other, get those fundamentals down. All those things are done. And yeah we lost Alexander “jawgemo” Mor, and that fucking hurt really badly, and it hurt us as a team. But, we put in a lot of work last year, and we feel very confident about that work we put in.”</p>



<p><strong>IG: What do you hope to see out of both yay and Icy? What can they bring to the table that VCT Americas viewers haven’t seen yet?</strong></p>



<p>“Over the last three years, EG has been a place where every player ends up not by choice, but more so by how things turned out. Each player has their own hunger, and drive, and story they want to rewrite for themselves. And that’s always been my strength: having these misfit players with their own desperate drive they need to prove. I see exactly [those kind of players] in yay and icy. </p>



<figure><figcaption>In his OpTic days, yay was regarded as the best VALORANT player in the world. Image credit: Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With yay, he’s gonna have to prove that he’s not just a Chamber main. That’s his ultimate goal. He’s swapped over to the sentinel role, and every day it’s a work in progress. We have El Diablo on our team, but we still need him to do his job, which sometimes isn’t as sexy as going out there and getting three crispy headshots. Sometimes he’s gonna have to play off of his trip, and it’s small things like this we’re working out as a team. He’s such a capable player, but sometimes being that capable can bait you into into certain engagements that don’t make sense.</p>



<p>For icy, he’s an incredible role player. His IQ is up there, he’s humble, and he’s a very sacrificial duelist. As a duelist, you have to be greedy, but you also have to be willing to go in there and die for your team. So my focus for him is to highlight his mechanical skill. That consistency wasn’t there last year, and I’m hoping he finds that here on this roster.”</p>



<p><strong>IG: You had the prestige and name power to go coach another team. What made you want to stay with EG?</strong></p>



<p>“I did get a lot of offers, and they were all exactly the same: building up a roster of misfits or players that need to prove themselves from tier two or tier three. I did want to look at a team that was willing to spend the big bucks on big names, but that didn’t work out. A lot of the rumors are true. I did look into NRG, and those talks did go pretty far, but they went a different route. At that point it was either go somewhere brand new and do what I’m already doing here, or continue what I’ve done at EG with the core I’ve already built here.</p>



<p>I fully believe in Phat “supamen” Le, in the same way I was fully convinced jawgemo was going to be the best duelist at the end of the year. Turns out he wasn’t even our main duelist!”</p>



<p><strong>IG: He wasn’t even the best duelist on EG!</strong></p>



<p>“[Laughs] Right! And NaturE is a top IGL. He and I have worked so long together, and we’re in that sweet spot. And Derrek is casually good, and I like that. In practice and matches, he’s not straining for highlights. His energy is fantastic.</p>



<p>I really stayed because I believe in this core. I think we made the right roster moves. Yay is a big question mark, but he absolutely is elevating us and catapulting us up like how Ethan and Demon1 did in 2023. So I’m excited about this roster.”</p>
