<p>An insider has revealed new details about the stalker monster from Resident Evil Requiem, which could relate to the game’s gameplay. </p>



<p>After months of waiting, we finally received a new trailer for Resident Evil Requiem at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-gets-gameplay-trailer-at-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom’s Opening Night Live</a>, which featured Alyssa Ashcroft, Grace’s mother. We also got a small glimpse of gameplay before it was interrupted by the stalker monster. Now, new details about this monster have been revealed by an insider.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-stalker-monster-s-skin-reportedly-melts-in-the-sun">Resident Evil Requiem Stalker Monster’s Skin Reportedly Melts in the Sun</h2>



<p>The latest leaked details about Resident Evil Requiem’s stalker monster come from none other than Dusk Golem (AestheticGamer). The leaker had previously posted an image of an ice cream melting, and now they have provided <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1957896949287514353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">context</a> for it. It appears that the stalker monster’s skin begins to melt “gruesomely” in the sunlight, which serves both a “bigger plot” and a “gameplay purpose.” </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you don't mind some early bird spoilers, though undoubtedly will be revealed tomorrow I feel, the meaning of the ice cream:<a href="https://t.co/a128A0kxPo">https://t.co/a128A0kxPo</a><br>SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING<br>The stalker monster's skin starts melting off gruesomely in light, has bigger plot &amp; gameplay purpose.</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1957896949287514353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The leaker has stated that this is an early bird spoiler from them; however, players should soon learn about it officially, as Resident Evil Requiem has a press embargo lifting soon, and players might know more about this stalker monster then. Nevertheless, as this information doesn’t come from an official source, readers should treat it with caution. </p>



<p>Dusk Golem has provided players with several leaks leading up to the game’s new trailer at Gamescom. Most recently, we were informed that the game will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-will-have-3-playable-characters-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three playable characters</a>, including Grace, Leon, and a little bit of Alyssa. Moreover, some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-story-details-leaked-by-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story details</a> were leaked recently, too, which stated that the woman monster is none other than Alyssa, Grace’s mother.</p>



<p>In other news, the upcoming Resident Evil movie by Zach Cregger will feel “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-movie-fresh-edgy-weird/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh, edgy, and weird</a>“. Additionally, the next Resident Evil Remakes are reportedly going to be Code Veronica and Zero, and they are expected to arrive in&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-resident-evil-remakes-are-releasing-in-2027-2028-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2027/2028</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has been revealed, and details have been shared for the upcoming Open Beta, where players will get the first opportunity to get their hands on the title. Here’s everything we know.</p>



<p>The Black Ops 7 Open Beta is split into two parts, with the first few days available only to those with Early Access before the doors open for everyone, and it’s the perfect time to try out the title before the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a> release.</p>



<p>In the guide below, we’ve outlined all of the crucial information for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-access-black-ops-7-beta-pre-order-bonuses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Beta</a>, including the dates, how to sign-up, and what you can expect.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-open-beta-start-date">Black Ops 7 Open Beta Start Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Squad up. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Black Ops 7 Open Beta begins on October 5, though three days of Early Access are available from October 2.</strong></p>



<p>These dates have been confirmed by <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/9PLBM5790L94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">store listings</a> for Black Ops 7 pre-orders, though it’s worth noting that the dates are subject to change.</p>



<p>No end date has been revealed yet for the Black Ops 6 Open Beta, though expect things to wrap up before the release of Battlefield 6 on October 10, as Activision understandably won’t want the timings to clash.</p>



<p>If any further details are announced regarding the beta, we’ll add to this article.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-sign-up-for-black-ops-7-open-beta">How to Sign Up For Black Ops 7 Open Beta</h2>



<p><strong>Pre-ordering Black Ops 7 or having an active Game Pass subscription qualifies you for Early Access to the Beta from October 2.</strong></p>



<p>From October 5, however, the doors open for all players and there are no entry restrictions, so you won’t need to pre-order. As we don’t know exactly how long the Open Beta will be live for, though, it could leave you with very limited time to try it out before the doors close.</p>



<p>No further Betas are expected after the Open Beta before launch on November 14, with the title once again included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-black-ops-7-open-beta">What to Expect From Black Ops 7 Open Beta</h2>



<p><strong>The Black Ops 7 Open Beta will be Multiplayer only, so you won’t be able to try out Zombies, the Campaign, or Warzone.</strong></p>



<p>Full details of what’s included are not yet revealed, though there could be a limited amount of guns available and only a select few maps and game modes in rotation.</p>



<p>Any progress earned in the Beta will not transfer over to Black Ops 7 at launch, though there may be some exclusive bonuses to unlock for participating.</p>



<p>Are you planning to pre-order Black Ops 7 to secure Early Access to the Beta? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s Camo grind is set to be the biggest in the franchise’s history, with more Mastery Camos than ever before to secure.</p>



<p>Gathering the exclusive Camos across all modes has become a popular pastime for players, with exclusive Camos available in Multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone.</p>



<p>In Black Ops 7, releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, Campaign joins the mix with its own set of Mastery Camos, giving players another avenue to run down in the hunt to secure them all.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-will-feature-16-mastery-camos">Black Ops 7 Will Feature 16 Mastery Camos</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get your grind on. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>As revealed in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-multiplayer-and-zombies-launching-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog</a>, Black Ops 7 will feature Global Progression in the campaign for the first time, with Player and Weapon XP, challenges, and Weapon Camos earned through the campaign transfering over to Multiplayer and Zombies, along with Warzone when Season 1 launches.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 will feature 30 weapons at launch, each with its own set of camos available across the various modes, and four Mastery Camos will be available for Campaign, along with their usual appearances in other modes.</p>



<p>Mastery Camos in Call of Duty are the most illustrious of them all, requiring you to complete all other challenges to unlock. For the rarest, this includes completing all challenges across all weapons in the same class, so it’s the ultimate flex on other players.</p>



<p>The campaign grind will become much more manageable with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return of co-op</a>, which supports up to four players, and the End Game mode in Avalon will likely be the area where the majority of the Camo grind takes place.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will feature a new feature to weapon builds that makes it easier than ever to share loadouts with friends and other players.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7, releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, continues the trend of having highly customizable weapons, with adjustments impacting everything from fire rate to range.</p>



<p>Finding the perfect build has always been tricky, requiring players to copy a loadout piece by piece in the past, but that is changing with Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-loadout-sharing-codes">Black Ops 7 Loadout Sharing Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lock and load. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>In Black Ops 7, created loadouts will now feature a code that can be shared with other players, which they can then input in their game to copy the design instantly—meaning no more awkwardly fiddling through the options to find the right attachment.</p>



<p>The feature was revealed in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-multiplayer-and-zombies-launching-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, announcing that players can share or import Weapon Build Codes to try out loadouts with ease—and while the post says to try friends’ designs, it’s more than likely going to be used to copy creator designs or loadouts that appear on websites like ours or TikTok.</p>



<p>However, it’s unknown what will happen if you input a code that includes attachments you haven’t unlocked yet and whether the loadout will be blocked, or if it can be saved for later.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 has also confirmed the return of Weapon Prestige, said to be the “deepest and most rewarding” system yet, awarding Prestige Attachments and Weapon Camos.</p>



<p>More details will be shared in the coming months, with a full multiplayer reveal scheduled for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-next-announced-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 30’s COD Next showcase</a>, while a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-zombies-reveal-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive into Zombies is due in early September</a>.</p>



<p>How much easier is this feature going to make building weapon loadouts in Black Ops 7? Let us know your thoughts in the<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3348/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
