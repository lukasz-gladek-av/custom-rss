            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>That’s a pretty interesting and loaded title. Recently, Razer unveiled Project AVA, an AI-powered desktop device that houses a holographic representation of what has been described as a ‘waifu’. The cylindrical device uses Grok AI and dynamic personality metrics to embody a 3D hologram with ‘human-life vision’ and ‘full contextual awareness’.</p>



<p>The <strong>conceptual </strong>device has been described as an ‘enthusiastic gaming wingman,’ and it sits on your desk, organizes your day, and keeps you company with a conversational model backed (at least initially) by Elon Musk’s Grok AI.</p>



<p>Recently, the firm’s CEO explained why they’re leading the way with Grok, given all the recent scandals.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-is-project-ava-using-grok-because-it-s-the-best">Why is Project AVA Using Grok? Because It’s the Best</h2>



<p>Project AVA was unveiled by Razer at CES, emerging as one of the most innovative (and perhaps invasive) inventions at the show. It’s a small, Razer Chroma-backed tubular device that has minimal inputs and maximum practicality, apparently. It has an HD camera, microphones, an LED system, and, most importantly, a 5.5-inch, 3D holographic avatar projection system.</p>



<p>Razer has unveiled a string of ‘companions’ that users can pick from to power their wingman device. It’s a relatively bizarre lineup, but it’s worth stressing right now that there’s no release date for the device. Razer has <strong>no idea </strong>when Project AVA will leave the conceptual stage.</p>



<p>First, there’s AVA, a throbbing circle of Razer-branded energy that doesn’t take a human form. There’s Kira, your traditional anime waifu model, dubbed the ‘loveliest gaming partner’, and then there’s Zane, a muscular, traditionally handsome, and tattooed male model.</p>



<p>The roster continues with Lee “<em>Faker</em>” Sang-hyeok, one of the most recognizable esports pro players in the world and a certified GOAT of the League of Legends space. Finally, you’ve got SAO, a corporate female character modelled on <strong>kawausosuki0513</strong>, a Japanese ‘office lady’ creator.</p>



<p>Right now, the biggest point of contention around Project AVA is the fact that <strong>Grok </strong>is the AI engine powering its development. In recent weeks, Grok has come under intense fire as the AI model has been stripping people naked on Twitter (now known as X) at the simplest request.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent interview</a>, Razer’s CEO, Min-Liang Tan, explained <strong>why </strong>the company had gone with Grok first:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Well, I think for Grok, you know… We picked Grok also because it’s got the best conversational AI at this point, for us. At least from a conversation, personality side of things, and that’s one of the things that we looked at from a tech perspective. Now, ultimately, however, we do see Ava as an open platform, right? </p>



<p>If somebody wants to be able to use a different model, it’s one of the things that we’re taking into consideration. And we are multi-model, right? But I think from a perspective of an avatar, from a conversational AI for CES, we feel that Grok has a really great conversational AI model at this point. So that’s one of the reasons why we picked Grok.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When asked how Razer can ensure user safety, Tan said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think we’re still in the early days. Now, the question, I think, where it’s going to lead to is something that we need to discover, right? And, of course, we need to discover it in a responsible manner to figure out how we do that, and put the right guardrails in. What do we do in terms of AI, in terms of this? That’s something that we’re learning.</p>



<p>Now, maybe it’s even a hardware lock that we need to put in. We don’t know, right? Or it’s more software guardrails that we have to put into place at this point in time. </p>



<p>That’s one of the reasons why we decided to put it as a concept first out there, to get the feedback. And we’re not gonna be able to think of everything, but we would like to be able to get as much thought, concern, and care into the product before we actually launch it.</p>
</blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[Six Invitational 2026 Groups Unveiled by Ubisoft]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/six-invitational-2026-groups-unveiled/</link>
            <guid>1410496</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has revealed the group draw for the Six Invitational 2026, setting the stage for one of the largest esports events in the entire business. What has been uncovered reflects a stunning selection that should make for some exciting match-ups straight out of the gate.</p>



<p>As usual, the tournament begins with four groups of five teams competing for spots in the playoffs. The two-bracket split will be populated by these teams, but not <strong>every organization </strong>in the group stage will advance to the final round. Four teams will be eliminated before they can make it anywhere close to the final stage.</p>







<h2 id="h-six-invitational-2026-groups-confirmed">Six Invitational 2026 Groups Confirmed</h2>



<p>The group draw for the Six Invitational 2026 was completed recently by Ubisoft:</p>



<p><strong>Group A:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Weibo Gaming</li>



<li>M80</li>



<li>FEARX</li>



<li>Ninjas in Pyjamas</li>



<li>Project Zero</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group B:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Elevate</li>



<li>Wildcard</li>



<li>Daystar</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group C:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Shopify Rebellion</li>



<li>DPlus</li>



<li>Black Dragons</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group D:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Spacestation</li>



<li>Team Secret</li>



<li>Fluxo W7M</li>



<li>ENTERPRISE Esports</li>



<li>Oxygen Esports</li>
</ul>



<p>It could be argued that Group C is the most energetic and unpredictable of the bunch. FaZe Clan, G2, and Shopify Rebellion are all the most legitimate contenders for the trophy, and we’re sure to see sparks fly in Paris before the playoffs even kick off.</p>



<p>Group D is also bursting with potential. Every team there has a credible playoff claim, with Team Secret especially coming in as the Esports World Cup 2025 champions.</p>



<p>As always, the Six Invitational will remain relatively hard to pin down. It has one of the largest single prizes in the esports space, so you’d best believe every team taking to the stage will fight tooth and nail to secure the biggest chunk of it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tarkov Dev’s New Game Could Be Revealed on February 1st]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-dev-new-game-revealed-february-1/</link>
            <guid>1410358</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Over the last couple of weeks, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, Nikita Buyanov, busied himself posting cryptic images and brain teasers on social media. Eventually, an entirely new website surfaced, seemingly hosting some minigame teasing <strong>a new project called COR3.</strong></p>



<p>Now, <strong>another </strong>website has surfaced, this one hosting nothing more than a countdown and a blurry video that, when examined, represents a first-person shooter that scales back to show an entire planet. That countdown expires on February 1st, which is when everyone believes we’ll get something tangible about this game.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-cor3-and-why-is-it-exciting">What is COR3, and Why is it Exciting?</h2>



<p>Nikita Buyanov is one of the creative minds who has directed the growth of Escape from Tarkov over the last decade. He has dedicated his life to the extraction shooter, a fact that he pointed out when we interviewed him as part of a recent episode of Access Granted.</p>



<p>He recently took a cryptic turn on social media, posting stacks of enigmatic images and puzzles, which his followers set to decoding.</p>



<p>Before long, <a href="https://os.cor3.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a website had been found</a>, an interactive thing that placed users in some kind of post-apocalyptic bunker with a retro-futuristic computer system bursting with lore, teasers, and world-building elements. As it stands, we have <strong>little idea </strong>what COR3 is, but the best guess is that it’s Buyanov’s new project.</p>



<p>We say ‘Buyanov’ and not <strong>Battlestate Games</strong>, as right now, there’s <strong>no indication </strong>that Battlestate is linked to COR3. The COR3 trademark, dug up by eagle-eyed netizens, is in Nikita’s name, and nobody <strong>but </strong>the man himself has been sharing content related to COR3 online.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>On <a href="https://m7.repnodemassive.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the countdown website</a>, a clock is running out, and it’s set to expire on February 1st at 3 PM GMT / 10 AM EST. Nobody knows what will happen when that countdown hits zero, but it’s a safe bet that something more tangible will be revealed by Buyanov, and whoever else he’s working with (if anyone).</p>



<p>COR3 appears to represent some kind of alternate reality title set in a universe where Earth suffered from a catastrophic event. There’s talk of interplanetary travel, space pirates, and ships adrift in the great beyond, all of which couldn’t be further from Escape from Tarkov, the leading extraction shooter.</p>



<p>It’s set hundreds of years in the future, but the COR3 website that users could interact with boasted grounded elements like modern-day armor items and traditional computers.</p>
