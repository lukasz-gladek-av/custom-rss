<p>History looks to be repeating itself as a recently registered domain name suggests Persona 4 Reload is on the way—and this is more than likely a remake from the ground up of 2008’s Persona 4.</p>



<p>Persona remakes have been creeping out over recent years. But it makes complete sense if you’re Atlus. The series has sold millions of copies and its popularity continues to rise. This is why Persona 3 received a remake in 2024 with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/persona-3-reload-episode-aigis-dlc-details-new-trailer-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Persona 3 Reload</a>.</p>



<p>Now, a year later, a domain name suggests Persona 4 Reload is on its way, and it could be announced soon.</p>

<p>YouTuber and social media personality <a href="https://x.com/ScrambledFaz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@ScrambledFaz</a> found the domain “<strong>p4re.jp</strong>” registered on March 20.</p>



<p>They discovered the listing featuring the domain name’s creation date and name. It doesn’t directly spell out “Persona 4 Reload,” but a brief history lesson tells us this is probably the case.</p>



<p>As told by Faz, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/persona-3-remake-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">p3re. jp was registered in 2023</a>, and we got an official Persona 3 Reload announcement a few weeks later. This looks to be a carbon copy of these events, only this time we’re swapping the 3 for a 4.</p>



<div><article><p><span>p4re. jp was registered a few hours ago.

2 years ago, p3re. jp was registered. 3 months later Persona 3 Reload was revealed</span></p></article></div>



<p>This has to go down as speculation for now, but it’s very realistic speculation at least! Persona 3 Reload was lauded by fans of the series and critics and went on to become Atlus’s fastest-selling game at the time.</p>



<p>If Persona 4 Reload comes to fruition, it’s hard to see it not having similar results.</p>

<p>Jack Black became “the most passionate player” on set, logging over 100 hours on Minecraft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/a-minecraft-movie-game-microsoft-1236341672/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, Torfi Frans Ólafsson, Mojang’s senior director of original content, revealed some details about Jack Black playing Minecraft. Ólafsson had purchased Xboxes and set up private Minecraft servers for the cast and crew to enjoy the game. Within the group, Jack Black turned out to be the most passionate player, gathering over 100 hours of gameplay time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ólafsson added that Jack Black “was just completely manic” in Minecraft, and he is obsessed with ‘lapis lazuli’ “because he liked the way it sounds”. Jack Black also insists on talking about Lapis Lazuli in the movie. For those wondering, Lapis Lazuli is a blue mineral ore in the game that can be used for enchanting items, creating blue dye and other purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-jack-black-almost-played-a-talking-pig-in-a-minecraft-movie">Jack Black Almost Played a Talking Pig in A Minecraft Movie</h2>



<p>During the same interview, Ólafsson revealed that Jack Black was not going to play Steve originally; instead, his character was a “talking pig”. However, “very, very, very late in the development”, the crew realised that they “needed an expert and host”; hence, they decided that Black would play Steve instead. Ólafsson elaborated, “This is not my Steve or your Steve — this is Jack Black’s Steve”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Turf Wars is on its way. Unfortunately, if you’re looking for this to be a fully-fledged Cyberpunk 2077 game, rein in your hopes and expectations now. Turf Wars is an Arcade-Machine Shooter made by LAI Games and looks like a great way to spend a few Eurodollars.</p>



<p>The resurrection of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/top-10-cyberpunk-2077-mods-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a> needs to be studied. Not only did CD Projekt Red spend hard hours fixing and improving upon the original release, but the Phantom Liberty DLC blew us all out of the water. Cyberpunk 2077’s legacy can now be seen positively, but we know CD Projekt Red has turned its attention to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-the-witcher-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a>.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean we aren’t getting new Cyberpunk 2077 media though—so say hello to Turf Wars.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Turf Wars was announced and shown to the world on March 12. A Cyberpunk-inspired YouTube video revealed the new “Next-Gen Futuristic Tactile Shooter”. Sadly, yes, it’s a <strong>classic Arcade cabinet</strong> you’re encouraged to dump a ton of money into.</p>



<p>However, it looks incredible. LAI Games promise immersive features from “projection mapping technology” to “advanced haptic feedback and a pulse-pounding soundtrack.”</p>



<p>You can check out the full trailer for the Cyberpunk 2077 Turf Wars cabinet below thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LAIGames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LAI Games</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Turf Wars is officially endorsed and licensed by CD Projekt Red and offers “Story Mode, Co-Op/Versus, and Sniper Mode.” It looks to be a sophisticated piece of technology. Who knows, if Turf Wars is a success, it could make the jump to consoles and other platforms à la Time Crisis, House of the Dead, and Point Blank.</p>



<p>It should keep us all ticking over until the real <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-is-working-on-the-most-realistic-and-reactive-crowd-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a> at least. If you’re worried about The Witcher 4 though, you don’t need to as CD Projekt Red has promised <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-wont-let-the-witcher-4-cyberpunk-2077/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4 launch won’t be another Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco has revealed Digimon Alysion, a free-to-play online card game arriving for iOS and Android devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just a few days ago, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-getting-a-surprise-rival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that Digimon was also receiving a TCG Pocket competitor, and thanks to Digimon Con (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/free-to-play-online-card-game-digimon-alysion-announced-for-ios-android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>), we have finally learned about the game. Digimon Alysion brings the card game experience straight to players’ smartphones. Not much is known about the game; however, the trailer has provided some glimpses about what to expect from the free-to-play title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Digimon Alysion trailer begins by showcasing the basics of a trading card game experience, including card collection and battle features. However, the players are teased with a narrative element towards the halfway mark. The trailer also reveals brand-new characters for the franchise, including Kanata Hondo, Futre, and Valner Dragnogh. There’s also a brand new Digimon called Gemmon featured in the trailer.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="《公式》スマートフォン向けアプリ『デジモンアリシオン』プロジェクト始動PV　|《Official》New Digimon Card Game app &quot;DIGIMON ALYSION&quot;" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JaoHerGig5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Digimon Alysion doesn’t have a release date at the moment. However, a closed beta is in the works; its details will be revealed shortly. Players should also expect new Digimon and characters to appear in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket already has a new competitor in less than 6 months of release, and it is fitting to see Digimon, their decades-old rival, enter the space. TCG Pocket pulled in some unbelievable numbers during its release, getting over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-crossed-30-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30 million downloads</a> in 9 days and earning over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-surpassed-120-million-in-earnings-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$120 million</a> in the first seventeen. It’ll be interesting to see how Digimon Alysion compares when it releases.</p>



<p>In other news, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO x Pokemon</a> partnership has been officially announced. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/niantic-says-pokemon-go-location-data-wont-be-given-to-saudi-arabia-government/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Niantic has said</a> Pokemon GO location data won’t be provided to the Saudi Arabian government.
