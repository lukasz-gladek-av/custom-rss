<p>Helldivers 2 shows no signs of slowing down, with releases coming thick and fast, with the new Dust Devils Premium Warbond now available—but is it worth it?</p>



<p>After the long-awaited Xbox launch last week, which coincided with the release of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</a>, a fresh update has brought a wealth of new challenges. Whether you’re taking down the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-hive-lord-hp-best-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hive Lord</a>, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-destroy-spore-lung/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">destroying Spore Lungs</a>, new gear will not go amiss.</p>



<p>We’ve got all the details on the Dust Devils Premium Warbond here, including a breakdown of what’s included and whether it’s worth spending your hard-earned Super Credits on.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-dust-devils-premium-warbond">How Much is The Dust Devils Premium Warbond?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of gear. Image via Arrowhead Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Dust Devils Premium Warbond in Helldivers 2 costs 1,000 Super Credits, the standard price of Warbonds in the game.</strong></p>



<p>This translates to $9.99 in real-world money, though you don’t need to spend at all, as Super Credits can be farmed in the game. You can also use a Warbond Token to unlock the full pass.</p>



<p>As usual with Warbonds in Helldivers 2, there is no limited-time period to make the purchase, and it will remain available permanently, so you can purchase it whenever you like.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-the-helldivers-2-dust-devils-premium-warbond">All Rewards in the Helldivers 2 Dust Devils Premium Warbond</h2>



<p><strong>The Dust Devils Warbond in Helldivers 2 has a total of 22 rewards to claim, including two armor sets, three Stratagems, and a new assault rifle.</strong></p>



<p>Rewards in the Dust Devils Warbond are geared around the latest content drop, introducing Hive planets, providing effective firepower to take down the threats they pose, along with accompanying cosmetics.</p>



<p>We’ve got a full breakdown of every reward in the Dust Devils Warbond below, including the Medals required to unlock them.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-the-dust-devils-premium-warbond-worth-it">Is the Dust Devils Premium Warbond Worth it?</h2>



<p><strong>The Dust Devils Premium Warbond in Helldivers 2 is definitely worth purchasing for additional firepower to take down the Hive Worlds introduced in the Into The Unjust update.</strong></p>



<p>With missions on the Hive planets taking you deep underground, where your Stratagems are ineffective unless you manage to find an opening in the tunnel system, the weapons included in the Dust Devils Warbond are the perfect tools for the job.</p>



<p>The AR-2 Coyote assault rifle is ideal for mowing through the Terminid hordes, with the incendiary ammunition packing a punch, and the G-7 Pineapple cluster frag grenade is similarly effective for taking out large groups of enemies.</p>



<p>Both pale in comparison with the EAT-700 Expendable Napalm, a single-use missile that contains napalm cluster bombs, and the MS-11 Solo Silo, which calls down a Hellpod-sized missile silo with a single, ultra-powerful missile and a handheld targeting remote—though the latter may require being outside of the cave system.</p>



<p>The Dust Devils Warbond is a worthwhile addition for any Helldiver, though it’s particularly useful for any new Xbox players who perhaps don’t have an arsenal as expansive as their PC and PlayStation counterparts just yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals developers have confirmed plans to introduce Placement Matches to the ranked mode for new seasons, though there is no details on exactly when it will release.</p>



<p>Since its launch in December 2024, Marvel Rivals’ ranked set-up has attracted criticism from players, particularly at the start of new seasons when things reset, as higher-ranked players drop several tiers.</p>



<p>This has made the first few days of a new season in ranked incredibly unbalanced, a frustrating experience for players, but devs have been listening to feedback and announced plans to bring placement matches into the fray.</p>



<h2 id="h-placement-matches-coming-to-marvel-rivals">Placement Matches Coming to Marvel Rivals</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big change. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>Announced at the end of the latest <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1963300965437538535" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dev Vision video</a> ahead of the drop of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 on September 12</a>, Marvel Rivals devs acknowledged the discussions in the community on the back of the recently released details explaining <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-explain-matchmaking-system-after-player-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how the matchmaking system works</a>.</p>



<p>It was confirmed that the team is “already working on implementing Placement Matches,” but, as it is a “complex feature with a lot of moving parts,” the team needs “more time for development and thorough testing.”</p>



<p>While Placement Matches won’t be ready for the drop of Season 4, the team is “pushing forward as quickly as we can.”</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether Placement Matches will be a major feature that drops as part of Season 5, which is expected to launch in early November. Exact details of the Season 5 launch are not known, though the start date should be revealed by the Season 4 Battle Pass.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[10 Best Fallout DLCs, Ranked—Which Fallout Expansion is the Best?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/10-best-fallout-dlcs-ranked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-best-fallout-dlcs-ranked%E2%80%94which-fallout-expansion-is-the-best.1288362/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If there’s one thing Bethesda Game Studios does well, it’s the creation of a top-notch expansion. For the Fallout franchise, some sizeable expansions have dropped over the years that have left players impressed and hungry for more. </p>



<p>From Fallout 3 to New Vegas and from Fallout 4 to Fallout 76, Bethesda Game Studios has delivered some great additional content. In this list, we’re taking a look at the 10 best Fallout DLCs and ranking them.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-best-fallout-dlc-ever">What’s The Best Fallout DLC Ever?</h2>



<p>Everyone has their idea of the perfect expansion. It’s a mostly subjective argument, but there are some universal truths. If you disagree with this list of the best Fallout DLCs ranked, then be sure to leave a comment and set us straight!</p>



<h3 id="h-best-nuka-world-fallout-4">Best: Nuka-World (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nuka-World was a fantastic adventure from start to finish, taking players to a wide, open theme park that could be made operational. It was the perfect endgame DLC to an already impressive base game, and it served as a sublime send-off to the best-selling core Fallout game ever released. </p>



<h3 id="h-2-point-lookout-fallout-3">2. Point Lookout (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Point Lookout was a creepy, backwoods expansion that forced players to contend with some of Fallout 3’s eeriest enemies. It was a darker, more foreboding expansion that took players out of the base game’s map and put them in the heart of a swamp bursting at the seams with danger.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout"><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout/">10 Most Iconic Brands From Fallout</a></strong></h6>



<h3 id="h-3-far-harbor-fallout-4">3. Far Harbor (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Behind Nuka-World, Far Harbor was a fantastic expansion for Fallout 4, and in many ways, it was similar to Point Lookout from Fallout 3. It introduced players to a brilliant map that was a wonder to explore, and the only thing holding this particular Fallout DLC back from the top spot is the series of annoying puzzles that must be solved as part of the expansion. </p>



<h3 id="h-4-the-pitt-fallout-3">4. The Pitt (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Pitt was so good that Bethesda Game Studios decided to revisit it in Fallout 76 more than a decade later. It was one of the grittier Fallout expansions, landing players in the heart of Pittsburgh to go toe-to-toe against savage, mutated creatures that were once slaves, twisted up by their masters and the environment around them.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-lonesome-road-fallout-new-vegas">5. Lonesome Road (Fallout New Vegas)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fallout: New Vegas had some fantastic expansions, but few are as memorable as Lonesome Road. It’s one of the best Fallout DLCs because of the writing behind it and the characters it introduces – namely, Ulysses. It expands beautifully on the protagonist’s backstory and gives players a great location to explore,but  it’s just a little light on content.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-broken-steel-fallout-3">6. Broken Steel (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Broken Steel was one of the best Fallout DLCs that was released to appease fans who wanted more of the base game. It boosted the game’s level cap, added a stack of new content, and introduced an extra act that saw players fight the Enclave directly alongside the Brotherhood of Steel – Liberty Prime included. It was a bit of an afterthought that Bethesda created to ‘give players a little more’, but it was solid.</p>







<h3 id="h-7-automatron-fallout-4">7. Automatron (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Automatron was a short but sweet Fallout DLC that saw players pick up the ability to solve a mechanical mystery and create a robot companion that could be anything they so desired. It was the first outing for the expansion concept in Fallout 4, and while it didn’t add too much, it was entertaining enough for a couple of hours’ worth of content.</p>



<h3>8. Vault-Tec Workshop (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>In Vault-Tec Workshop, players get access to their own customisable Vault. It’s a massive, underground cavern with untold potential to craft something truly unique, but that’s about all it is – a building expansion. There are a few experiments to carry out, in true Vault-Tec style, but ultimately, it’s an expansion that allows you to build a Vault, which is about it.</p>







<h3 id="h-9-honest-hearts-fallout-3">9. Honest Hearts (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Honest Hearts has been the subject of many memes over the years, most notably because of the character that’s introduced in it – The Burned Man, Joshua Graham. It’s a great narrative, but the expanded area that’s opened up for exploration isn’t all that memorable, and aside from the core story, there isn’t much to unravel.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-steel-reign-fallout-76">10. Steel Reign (Fallout 76)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Steel Reign was one of the more sizeable Fallout 76 expansions – more commonly known as ‘updates’ – that brought the Brotherhood of Steel back into play. It was a follow-on from Steel Dawn, which was released around a year prior, and it added plenty of story content for the player to enjoy – but since it dropped in 2021, Bethesda Game Studios hasn’t been back to revisit the Brotherhood storyline. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is 007 First Light Like Hitman? IO Interactive Development Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-like-hitman/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-007-first-light-like-hitman-io-interactive-development-explained.1288353/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Is 007 First Light like Hitman from a gameplay standpoint? That’s a common question from anyone who hears IO Interactive is making the jump to James Bond.</p>



<p>Millions of people fell in love with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-75-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hitman: World of Assassination trilogy</a> over the last decade. During that time, Agent 47 had an established formula that was consistently refined with interesting maps and engaging challenges.</p>



<p>James Bond has quite an interesting history when it comes to video games, but what can you expect in the newest game? Is 007 First Light like Hitman?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-007-first-light-gameplay-similar-to-hitman">Is 007 First Light Gameplay Similar to Hitman?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>He may be another spy, but James Bond is not Agent 47. Image via IO Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>007 First Light can be compared to Hitman and shares some of its mechanics and stylings, but it’s not an exact copy and is its own game.</strong></p>



<p>A lot of the things that connect Hitman and First Light are the exploration aspects of the game. When things are calm, James Bond will survey his environment and look for ways to sneak around and enter restricted areas by causing distractions or using gadgets to disorient enemies. That is very similar to how Agent 47 operates in Hitman, so the blueprints align there, though we haven’t seen James try to steal someone’s outfit like 47 often does.</p>



<p>We would say where the two differ the most is in the combat. In Hitman, the focus was very much on remaining stealthy as long as possible. Agent 47 can fight his way out of a tricky situation, but those moments are rather limiting. Shooting in the Hitman games is rather stiff, and his melee is basic at best.</p>



<p><a href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">007 First Light</a> seems to have gotten a big facelift when it comes to combat. Bond can do more with the environment around him when fighting, like grab an enemy and throw them in a direction, or fight to take a weapon away from someone. We’ve also seen Bond control an airplane and make it rock sideways while in combat, so there could be bigger ways to give enemies a harder time taking you out.</p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-has-more-to-it-than-stealth-and-combat">007 First Light Has More to It Than Stealth and Combat</h2>



<p>For the Hitman games, stealth and combat are essentially the main things you have to look forward to. There is a story there, but to be honest, it’s nothing that special or interesting.</p>



<p>IO Interactive is putting in the work to make 007 First Light a more cinematic experience than Hitman. Consider the car driving sections that never appeared in Hitman, or just how much more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-james-bond-voice-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Bond is willing to talk</a> to get his way. We love Agent 47, but the point of his character is to be silent and stoic.</p>



<p>From the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-preview-hitman-as-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early look we’ve had at the game</a>, 007 First Light definitely appears to have some of the Hitman DNA in it, but we would say it’s been built on top of not necessarily making something completely new, but augmenting what came before so that James Bond can stand apart from Agent 47.</p>
