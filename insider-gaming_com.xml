            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-deadlock-bogur-interview-gaming-world-media/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>DreamHack Stockholm is wrapping up today, but there are plenty of tidbits to be extracted from the many creators and pro players in attendance. In an exclusive interview, Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky and Hunter Grooms sat down with Siarhei ‘Bogur’ Alekau, one of the most popular and prolific personalities in the Overwatch space.</p>



<p>With the opportunity to talk transparently about the hero shooter scene, Bogur was more than happy to divulge his opinions about the future of these games, talking specifically about Deadlock.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-deadlock-will-100-surpass-overwatch">Deadlock Will ‘100%’ Surpass Overwatch</h2>



<p>Bogur has racked up hundreds of thousands of followers and scored some unique achievements in the Overwatch space, but that doesn’t mean he’s in love with the game.</p>



<p>In an interview with Gaming World Media at DreamHack Stockholm, Bogur spoke frankly about competing titles, suggesting that Overwatch players can’t ever break away entirely to play something else:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think Overwatch players have Stockholm Syndrome, because they’re going to say they’ll quit and they’re going to say they’re going to play another game, but they always come back. I think Marvel Rivals is the closest competitor to Overwatch, because Deadlock is so different.</p>



<p>I think all of these games are fun. I think I’m just really happy that I can finally play another game but Overwatch, because for the last six years, if the meta was stale, I had no choice but to play Overwatch, because my audience wouldn’t transition well into League or something else.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With competing titles surfacing, like Valve’s Deadlock, there are now legitimate contenders to tackle Overwatch’s leading position. Bogur believes that if Valve can deliver on the developing title, it will take over. When asked if he thinks Deadlock will surpass Overwatch, Bogur said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, 100% – if they do it right. I think a lot of people are saying Deadlock is dying and it’s really tilting because the game isn’t even out yet.</p>



<p>I think long-term, there’s going to be a moment where it blows up, and all of these streamers, that have like 1k, 2k, or pro players that have like 10k, 20k viewers… It’s the same with Overwatch when it was coming out. </p>



<p>The same thing is going to happen with Deadlock because they’re updating it, they’re making changes, they’re taking risks, and they’re really keen on listening to the community and just making the best experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When asked if he still has faith in the developers, Bogur spoke kindly about Blizzard, but he admitted that he’s only still playing it because he has ‘nothing better to play’. Like many hero shooter fans, he’s waiting for Deadlock to fully materialise before he jumps over, but his short-term vision is locked in tightly on Marvel Rivals.</p>

<p>Team Falcons has just lifted the inaugural Overwatch Champions Series trophy at DreamHack Stockholm. The win followed an intense bracket that saw Team Falcons push forcefully past Twisted Minds, NTMR, and Crazy Raccoon – the team’s nemesis – to make it to the grand final.</p>



<p>In the closing series of the tournament, Team Falcons faced off once again, for a final time, against Crazy Raccoon, shutting down the round with a 4 – 1 finish that led the team to the lion’s share of the prize and the first OWCS trophy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-unexpected-ending">Unexpected Ending</h2>



<p>Crazy Raccoon was the favourite going into the final bracket at the Overwatch Champions Series World Final, but Team Falcons proved to be a thorn in the team’s side.</p>



<p>This season, which was the first for the OWCS since the collapse of the Overwatch League, Crazy Raccoon and Team Falcons clashed on more than a dozen occasions, and in almost every face-off, it was CR that walked away victorious. When it mattered most, the team failed to clutch up, with Team Falcons quite literally saving the best until last.</p>



<p>In consecutive rounds, Team Falcons secured a record of 7 – 1 against Crazy Raccoon, putting to rest a year of coming in second post to the team.</p>



<p>Crazy Raccoon only entered the Overwatch scene earlier this year, while Team Falcons has been battling for a while to make a name for itself in the space. This win will go down well with the fans, who just days ago were celebrating Team Falcons securing the Esports Organisation of the Year award at The Esports Awards.</p>



<p>Going into the 2025 season, Blizzard has lined up several major changes that fans have responded to quite nicely. Are you looking forward to the next year of competitive Overwatch? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-next-update-fixes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2%E2%80%99s-next-update-will-target-crashes-quest-issues-and-ui-bugs.1043862/</guid>

<p>STALKER 2 has been on the market for three days, and it seems that for every person ranting about the game, there’s someone there singing the title’s praises. It’s a divisive game, that’s for sure – but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in my review</a>, I gave it a 9/10 and recommended gamers everywhere invest at least a little time in the post-apocalyptic epic.</p>



<p>GSC Game World is hard at work patching up the game, addressing the bugs that have caused some users to leave negative reviews or order refunds of the game that took more than a decade to piece together.</p>



<p>The next update is said to be a doozy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changes-incoming">Changes Incoming</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455843903878203415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on Steam</a>, GSC Game World revealed that the next STALKER 2 update is a hefty one. It’s going to target some of the stickiest issues players have been dealing with since the game was released on November 20 on Xbox and PC.</p>



<p>This includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Issue and memory allocation failures (PC)</li>



<li>Main quest progression fixes (game-breaking bugs)</li>



<li>Gameplay balancing and adjustments (trader prices and NPC behaviour)</li>



<li>Cutscene fixes (facial animations and clipping)</li>



<li>‘Softlock’ fixes (menu freezing)</li>



<li>UI improvements (quest notifications, interaction prompts)</li>
</ul>



<p>In a future update, the team will work on ironing out bugs in the ‘A-Life’ system that powers the game’s AI-driven NPCs. It has been a notorious issue since the game dropped, with the intelligent, realistic AI that was promised not having been delivered.</p>



<p>GSC will also work to address controller-based issues, such as dead zone bug fixes.</p>



<p>In a statement, the team said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want to reassure you once more that we will make every effort to constantly improve your S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl experience. We are truly grateful for your feedback and suggestions for improvement.</p>

<p>Dr Disrespect, the disgraced content creator who found himself at the centre of a dire scandal in recent months, has teased a departure from YouTube in favour of Rumble, a competing platform.</p>



<p>It all started with a new ‘DrDisrespect’ profile cropping up on Rumble, which according to <a href="https://streamscharts.com/platforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">StreamsCharts.com</a> is the sixth largest streaming site by viewer numbers. From there, Rumble’s CEO posted a cryptic message on social media that many saw as a connection to Dr Disrespect.</p>



<p>This move has come from Dr Disrespect’s failure to regain monetisation on YouTube, which he lost when he admitted to using Twitch to inappropriately message a minor in 2017.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-home-same-old-doc">New Home, Same Old Doc</h2>



<p>Rumble’s CEO has been flying in the face of controversy, refusing to acknowledge Dr Disrespect’s wrongdoing and seemingly teasing the scandalous creator’s impending arrival several times on social media. In a post on October 26, Chris Pavlovski, Rumble’s CEO, said that he’s securing the ‘biggest gaming streamer’ with a contract in 2025.</p>



<p>At the end of <a href="https://x.com/layer_cake/status/1860133482930094342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dr Disrespect’s most recent stream</a>, the veteran creator faded out with a cryptic sequence. His broadcast dropped to bars and tones before pivoting to a loading screen that read ‘Connection Redirected’. </p>



<p>Fans and critics alike have surmised that Dr Disrespect is about to announce a move to Rumble which could kickstart in 2025.</p>



<p>In June, the infamous streamer admitted to messaging a minor on Twitch several years ago but stressed that nothing criminal took place and that the business was long since settled. Regardless, he lost the support of hundreds of thousands of followers, had ties with other content creators cut, and was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-studio-cut-ties-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped by sponsorship partners</a>.</p>



<p>Despite the scandal, he returned to streaming in September and pulled in substantial numbers, with his core following standing firm in the face of blatant issues.</p>
