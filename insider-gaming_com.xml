<p>The Australian Classification Board has refused to classify Hunter X Hunter Nen X Impact.</p>



<p>If you head to the Australian Classification Board <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/hunterhunter-nenimpact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, you will see that Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact has been classified as ‘RC’ or ‘Refused Classification’. The website has not provided a reason for refusing classification and has asked fans to contact them for further clarification on their decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Australian Classification Board provided a statement to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/489089/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-refused-classification-australia-ban-rating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> regarding the classification of Hunter x Hunter Nen X Impact, explaining that the game was refused classification due to “a visual depiction of implied sexual violence, where an adult male exposes himself to persons under the age of 18 years.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Australian Classification Board added:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Board noted in its report that the implied sexual violence is implicitly condoned as appropriate due to a lack of resolution of the act through the game’s narrative and that it is not justified by context. Implied sexual violence that is visually depicted, interactive, not justified by context, or related to incentives or rewards is not permitted.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Currently, Hunter X Hunter Nen X Impact does not have a concrete release date, but it is scheduled to arrive at some point in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Leaks about upcoming playable Marvel Rivals characters have surfaced online, revealing new details about Ultron and The Thing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-the-thing-leak">Marvel Rivals The Thing Leak</h2>



<p>The Thing is set to be <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1865513703044485624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another Tank</a> for Marvel Rivals. The character’s passive ability is Solid as a Rock, which makes him immune to enemy knockback and displacement effects. The character’s primary attack is Combination Punch, which releases quick and continuous punches. Their secondary attack is Thunderbolt Punch, which releases a devastating blow at the enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Thing’s E ability in Marvel Rivals is Battlefield Support, which will make him jump towards teammates and reduce damage for allies and himself. His L Shift move is Furious Charge, which triggers a Continuous Forward charge that pummels enemies in your way and leaves a seismic zone behind you. Lastly, The Thing’s ultimate is called Slam Moment, and it knocks all enemies in front of you in the air.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-ultron-leak-nbsp">Marvel Rivals Ultron Leak&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As per <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1864338925164093603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RivalLeaks</a> on X (formerly Twitter), Ultron will be a supporting character in Marvel Rivals. His primary attack will be the Encephalo-Ray, an energy beam, and his secondary move is Dynamic Flight, which allows him to quickly fly in the direction of movement and then enter a free-flight mode. Ultron’s E ability is Imperative: Firewall, which provides health to allies within range with the help of drones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultron’s L Shift ability in Marvel Rivals is Imperative: Patch, which releases a giant drone that follows an ally, healing them and others within range. Ultron’s passive ability, called Algorithm Correction, allows him to jump and fall slowly. His ultimate is Rage of Ultron, which releases Ultron Drones that Encephalo-Rays at enemies or heal allies. RivalLeaks added in another post that Ultron might be released <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1865940057988935760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sooner than we think</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that Marvel Rivals has not officially announced The Thing or Ultron as upcoming playable characters.</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals has hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million players in just three days</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-development-issues/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/michel-ancel-says-beyond-good-and-evil-2-issues-were-caused-by-problems-between-managers.1055562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-development-issues/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a rare interview, Michel Ancel said that problems between management caused Beyond Good and Evil 2’s development issues.</p>



<p>The new interview came from French outlet <a href="https://www.superpouvoir.com/entretien-avec-michel-ancel-le-createur-de-rayman-et-beyond-good-evil-se-confie-sur-sa-nouvelle-vie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Superpouvoir</a>, where Ancel answered elaberated on the development issues of Beyond Good and Evil 2 and where he believes some of the accusations of toxic management, of which he denies, originates.</p>



<p>“On&nbsp;BGE2, for example, there were too many problems between managers. The artistic director wanted to redo everything constantly, <span>and the&nbsp;game director&nbsp;wanted to make a game of generated dungeo</span>ns. I dreamed of a space adventure. We could not agree and the&nbsp;game director&nbsp;took the project in other directions,” he said. </p>



<p>Ancel continued, “In this type of situation, teams find themselves tossed around and don’t even know who’s in charge and making decisions. The producer is supposed to sort things out, but that didn’t happen.&nbsp;Yves Guillemot&nbsp;even had to go down to Montpellier to get things back on track, but that wasn’t enough and the&nbsp;<em>game director</em>&nbsp;continued in his stubbornness. When I read in Libé that I was the one directing the game and asking for changes, I thought I was going to choke.&nbsp;<em>BGE2</em>&nbsp;is the game on which I don’t think I’ve ever questioned a decision.”</p>



<p>Michal Ancel left Ubisoft in 2020 to spend time in a wildlife sanctuary following burnout while working on games. One week later, though, accusations of toxic leadership by Ancel began to circulate, which Ancel firmly denied and continues to do so.</p>



<p>As of the time of writing, Ubisoft’s Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still in development. After nearly two years of development, it finally found its footing in early 2017. Speaking with sources, the game is still a couple of years out, though. We’ll share some exclusive details on the game later this week.</p>



<p>What do you think of the issues surrounding Beyond Good and Evil 2? Do you think it will ever be released? &nbsp;Let us know how it’s going on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Per a recent report, Apple and Sony are collaborating to bring third-party controller support for the Vision Pro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-08/apple-sony-talk-playstation-vr-ps-vr2-hand-controller-support-for-vision-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Apple approached Sony at the beginning of 2024 to bring support for PlayStation VR 2 controllers for the Vision Pro. Moreover, Apple has also had conversations with other third-party developers about featuring third-party controller support for their games on the VR platform. The controllers will not only be a valuable addition for gaming on the Vision Pro but also provide more control over the entire operating system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report adds that Apple and Sony had planned to announce PlayStation VR 2 controller support for the Vision Pro “weeks ago”; however, the announcement was postponed due to an undisclosed reason. Also, Sony has another hurdle to cross: selling their VR controllers as standalone accessories, as right now, they can only be acquired by purchasing the PlayStation VR 2 console. When the announcement does come, players will seemingly be able to grab the PS VR 2 controllers from Apple’s retail and online stores.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In their latest update, Palworld developers have changed the behaviour of Pal Spheres while battling Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pal Spheres work like Pokeballs and capture and summon Pals in Palworld. However, after <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4477236636060484669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">version v0.3.11 </a>(spotted by <a href="https://nichegamer.com/palworld-removes-pal-sphere-summons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NicheGamer</a>), the Pal Spheres will have a different activation. Now, whenever a player uses a Pal Sphere, their Pal will be summoned near the player without them needing to throw the sphere. Also, the new update will display a reticle while aiming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest developments</a> on Nintendo’s lawsuit against Palworld, the former has alleged that the latter has infringed three different patents and is seeking damages of 10 million Yen (approximately USD 66,000). Pocket Pair replied, stating they “will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings” in the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Palxworld is getting its biggest island yet in December, which is about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-december-dlc-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six times bigger than Sakurajima</a>. Also, Palworld has finally launched for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-finally-launches-for-ps5-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 consoles in Japan</a>.
