<p>Insomniac Games has just revealed the PS5 Pro features for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, and reflections seem to be the main focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jacinda Chew, the Senior Art Director at Insomniac Games, recently <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1853157700408168553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke about</a> how the world of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is filled with reflections, whether it be the windows of the skyscrapers, Spider-Man’s Googles or even large water bodies. However, players cannot experience full fidelity when playing the game in performance mode, creating a “compromise between the creative vision and the technical limitations” of the console.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 on PS5 Pro, Insomniac Games has been working to provide incredible detail with much smoother gameplay, no matter what graphics settings players choose. The PS5 Pro offers higher fidelity, 2-3 times more ray tracing, a custom silicon AI upscale, and anti-aliasing that helps free up the GPU to provide even more quality and detail. </p>



<p>On the PS5 Pro, players will experience the same fidelity of the world and characters featured in the Fidelity mode while swinging through New York City at 60 fps. Bryan Intihar, the Senior Creative Director for Insomniac Games, stated that Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 on the PS5 Pro is the “quintessential version of the Spider-Man experience on the PS5”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Insomniac Game has confirmed that there are “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-additional-story-dlc-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no plans for additional story content</a>” for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2.
