<p>SAG-AFTRA has announced that its strike against video game studios will continue. The announcement comes after more negotiations between the parties over AI protections and better general working conditions failed to result in a deal..</p>



<p>“After three days of scheduled negotiations, SAG-AFTRA announced that Interactive Media Agreement negotiations with employers would continue, with new dates to be announced as soon as they are confirmed,” the union <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/video-game-negotiations-continue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in a statement</a>. </p>



<p>“Negotiations resumed with the employer unit which includes Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc., Llama Productions LLC, Take 2 Productions Inc., and WB Games Inc. on Oct. 23.”</p>



<p>The union says that the strike remains in place against “all signatories to the Interactive Media Agreeement”. The only exception is to games “signed to the Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement or an Interim Interactive Media Agreement.”</p>



<p>The latest video game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strike began in July</a> when SAG-AFTRA called for it after 18 months of negotiations between the union and various game studios. The union believes that studios don’t have their actors’ best interests in mind when it comes to potential AI exploitation.</p>



<p>“We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate,” SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said at the beginning of the strike.</p>



<p>What do you think about the latest video game strike, and its call for protections against AI for voice and performance actors? Let us know down below, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>
