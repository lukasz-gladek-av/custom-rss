Taking place after Dynasty Warriors 2, players will play as over 40 officers during the Three Kingdoms era. Given the advancements made since its initial release, including Origins’ 1000 v 1 combat and Unreal Engine 5, it’ll feel like a whole new game.

<figure><figcaption>Credit to Tecmo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 2000s were great for the horror genre, but one series made waves in Japan and later in the West: Fatal Frame. While new entries haven’t happened since 2014, a remake of the second title, 2003’s Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly, will suffice. Following twin sisters Mio and Mayu, the two become trapped in a ghost-infested, cursed town and are forced to recreate the ritual that summoned the hex. Using your Camera Obscura, you’ll solve puzzles, locate important items, and kill dangerous ghosts. Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake will bring plenty of spooks and scares to satisfy even the bravest, and it should be a worthwhile addition to your library—if you’re brave enough!</p>

<h2 id="h-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</h2>

<p>Mojang have unveiled the first Minecraft Snapshot of 2026, and it’s easily one of the most wholesome ones they’ve revealed yet. Multiple changes have been made to numerous baby mobs, and they’re bound to steal fans’ hearts. </p>



<p>The most notable change made in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecrafts-mounts-of-mayhem-update-is-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a> 26.1 Snapshot 2 is the retexturing of multiple baby mobs. These younger mobs will now better reflect their adult variant textures, and some of them will even make new baby sounds. </p>



<p>Another change that fans have long been calling for is the introduction of craftable Name Tags. No longer must they be found in chests or fished up by chance; instead, fans can now reliably craft them and name mobs to their heart’s desire—all it costs is one Paper and any Metal Nugget.</p>



<p>Check out the full patch notes for Minecraft 26.1 Snapshot 2 below, and leave your thoughts on the changes down in the comments, as well as in the official <a href="https://discord.gg/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

<p>PlayStation has just revealed a new collection of Hyperpop DualSense controllers and PS5 console covers, featuring three colourways.</p>



<p>It is finally time for PlayStation players to add some new colours to their lives, and the three new designs really know how to stand out. It has been quite some time since we received a new collection of PS5 accessories, and a brand-new colourway after the Chroma and Metallic collections was long overdue.</p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-hyperpop-collection-releases-in-march-2026">PlayStation Hyperpop Collection Releases in March 2026</h2>



<p>PlayStation’s Hyperpop Collection adds three new colourways to the DualSense controllers and PS5 console covers. These are Techno Red, Remix Green, and Rhythm Blue. All three colourways follow a similar aesthetic, starting with a glossy black and shifting into vivid neons of their respective colours. Check out the gallery below to see the Hyperpop Collection DualSense controllers and PS5 console covers: </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It seems that ID Software might be returning to one of the most famous franchises under its belt, Quake. </p>



<p>The Quake series is one of the most popular franchises in gaming, redefining how the industry approaches first-person shooters. However, it’s been a very long time since we saw a new Quake instalment, with the latest being Quake Champions, along with some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quake-2-remaster-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enhanced versions of older titles</a>, so it’s high time we received a new game. </p>







<h2 id="h-id-software-rumoured-to-return-to-quake-or-hexen">ID Software Rumoured to Return to Quake or Hexen</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, which talks about Xbox’s plans in 2026, discusses the rumours about ID Software returning to Quake or Hexen, as Microsoft now owns all the rights to both franchises. There’s a chance that we could hear about these games at Bethesda’s Quakecon event; however, if it is a big reveal, then it might be featured during the Xbox Showcase. Regardless, players should take this information with a grain of salt, as it’s just a rumour. </p>



<p>As mentioned above, the last Quake game was Quake Champions, a free-to-play title that was released in 2022. However, the previous mainline Hexen game was Hexen 2, released in 1997. At the last QuakeCon, definitive versions of Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders and Hexen: Beyond Heretic were released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and Switch. However, we haven’t received a new mainline instalment in close to three decades. </p>







<p>In other news, Doom: The Dark Ages was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-biggest-launch-id-software-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest launch</a> in ID Software’s history. Additionally, read about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-bethesda-must-go-back-to-the-drawing-board-after-doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Year in Review story</a>, which talks about Bethesda having to go back to the drawing board after Doom: The Dark Ages.
