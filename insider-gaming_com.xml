<p>Battlefield 6 is set for launch, and, ahead of the big drop, full details of the launch patch notes have been shared, showcasing plenty of changes.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-day-one-early-patch-notes-shared-by-ea-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early patch not</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-day-one-early-patch-notes-shared-by-ea-ahead-of-launch/">es</a> were shared by EA earlier this week, ahead of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 10 launch</a>, and the full list of changes has now been published ahead of the doors to Battlefield 6 opening for players across the world.</p>

<figure><figcaption>First of many. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-movement-nerfs">Movement Nerfs</h3>



<p>Movement has been adjusted significantly from the Battlefield 6 beta, with reduced slide-to-jump momentum, lower jump height, and increased inaccuracy when firing while airborne or sliding.</p>



<p>These changes should make the game significantly different from Black Ops 7, where run-and-gun mechanics are a huge part of the game and have been enhanced further with wall jumping.</p>



<h3 id="h-weapon-handling-rebalanced">Weapon Handling Rebalanced</h3>



<p>Weapon handling in Battlefield 6 has been rebalanced from the beta, with recoil tuning and adjustments that “ensure more consistent gunplay.”</p>



<h3 id="h-rush-amp-breakthrough-layouts-revised">Rush &amp; Breakthrough Layouts Revised</h3>



<p>As indicated in the early patch notes, Rush and Breakthrough maps have been revised to “deliver a better balance between Attackers and Defenders,” which should result in more enjoyable gameplay in these modes.</p>



<h3 id="h-map-improvements">Map Improvements</h3>



<p>Maps in Battlefield 6 have been give a face lift, resulting in better traversal, lighting adjustments, and overall performance upgrades. We’ll have to wait until we’re in the game to get the full experience.</p>

<p>A clone of the popular Nintendo title, Animal Crossing, has appeared on the PlayStation Store as ‘Anime Village Online’. </p>



<p>It is not uncommon for lookalikes, clones, or rip-offs of games to appear in different stores. We’ve seen this several times in the past with games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-lookalike-appears-on-nintendo-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-switch-clone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a> being cloned on the Nintendo Store, imitations of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> appearing on PlayStation Store, and more. </p>

<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/animal-crossing-ripoff-playstation-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, the Animal Crossing Clone, Anime Village Online, has just been announced on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10017289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a> and plans to release in 2027. Right from the game’s key art, players will instantly be reminded of Animal Crossing. But it doesn’t stop there; there are several other details mentioned in the info section that make it seem more and more like Nintendo’s highly popular social simulation title. </p>



<p>Anime Village Online calls it a cozy life-simulation game where players can create their dream village, decorate their homes, and enjoy a peaceful world, either solo or with friends online. The game will allow players to design and expand their house by crafting new furniture, growing crops, and catching fish. </p>
