<p>Lenny Kravitz has commented on the inspiration for his character in 007: First Light and has given some insight into the recording process.</p>



<p>In December 2025, IO Interactive confirmed that Lenny Kravitz would voice one of the game’s main villains, an exclusive character named Bawma. The Grammy award-winning artist is now providing some insight into his inspiration for the role and the process of recording lines for the character.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/8M3Xc-RBv-I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">During an interview with IGN,</a> Kravitz explained that some of the inspiration for the character came from some of the people he grew up around.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I grew up in the Bahamas as well as New York City. There were guys that had that vibe and that were doing things in the islands that I’d known, so I had a little bit of reference,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also revealed that he did not have the opportunity to record lines alongside the rest of the cast. Instead, he just had the direction from those leading the project.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I hadn’t seen any other footage or heard any other voice-overs. So it was really sort of just in the dark, you know? They know, thus the director knowing kind of what he wants, because they know the balance, they know what all the other people are doing. I didn’t get to hear that.”</p>
</blockquote>
