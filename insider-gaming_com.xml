<p>2025 is set to continue the celebration of gaming with new remakes and remasters. It’s right we honor the games that paved the way for what we play now, and there are a variety of interesting titles scheduled for 2025.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-game-plus-in-silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-tomb-raider-games-in-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider</a> I-III Remastered are top of the mountain for 2024’s best remakes and remasters. They are products of the PS1 era and look better than ever in the present. We’re used to seeing remasters tinker with an oldie to make it a goldie, whereas remakes are built from the ground up to represent a classic in a new and reimagined way.</p>



<p>We like either direction, to be honest, as playing a prettier edition of games we love is the best! Fortunately, the games industry recognizes this too, so we’re gearing up for even more remakes and remakes in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-remakes-amp-remasters-in-2025">Biggest Remakes &amp; Remasters in 2025</h2>



<p>Like birds, expect more remasters and remakes to suddenly appear. Announcements can happen anytime and anywhere, from Summer Game Fest to Nintendo Directs. These are a handful of titles we know are coming in 2025—with official release dates and guesstimations.</p>



<h3 id="h-freedom-wars-remastered-jan-9">Freedom Wars Remastered — Jan. 9</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The bigger they are… Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p>I had the original Freedom Wars on my PlayStation Vita as it was one of the rare, exclusive first-party titles. The Vita didn’t get much love, sadly, but Freedom Wars was a great addition to its catalog. It’s a Monster Hunter clone at its core, but the gameplay gets pretty intense, and there’s a nice sense of progression as you unlock better gear and harder missions. The battles become bigger, the bosses become badder, and Bandai Namco Entertainment is heading up this welcome remaster to, hopefully, give Freedom Wars the exposure it deserves.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-jan-16">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD — Jan. 16</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It’s like a jungle out there. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-pre-orders-are-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> is a simple remaster and port of the 2010 Wii original. The Nintendo Switch has been privy to a hefty amount of remasters and ports from previous generations, and the newest Donley Kong release is just this. The biggest difference here is Donkey Kong Country Returns HD includes content only found in the Nintendo 3DS port of the OG game. Other than this, it’s the usual buffet of banana collecting, obstacle climbing, and collectible-finding platforming.</p>



<h3 id="h-tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-feb-14">Tomb Raider IV–VI Remastered — Feb. 14</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Careful. Credit to Aspyr</figcaption></figure>



<p>I don’t know how many more Tomb Raider Remastered collections are planned—as there are still a few TR games left—but if this is the last one, it’s been a fun ride. The Tomb Raider games were seminal releases and helped propagate the idea women could be the stars of the action. Lara Croft achieved this and more. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-collection-arrives-in-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider IV–VI Remastered</a>, she kicks butt across Cambodia and Egypt in The Last Revelation, multiple continents in Chronicles, and France and the Czech Republic in Angel of Darkness. They’re not the most celebrated Tomb Raider entries, but it’ll be fun to revisit them once more.</p>



<h3 id="h-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-mar-20">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition — Mar. 20</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Check the pedometer regularly. Credit to Monolith Soft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition took a while to commission, but it’s happening, and is set for a release as early as Mar. 20, 2025. The Xenoblade spin-off features all of the 2015 original’s content, along with graphical enhancements, additional story components, and much more. It shares a lot in common with other Xenoblade games as it’s a sprawling, open-world RPG where you fight aliens with spectacular attacks and complete missions to upgrade characters and earn better gear—the usual fare you’d expect. </p>



<h3 id="h-yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A darling duo is back. Credit to Playtonic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The adorably named Yooka-Replaylee takes 2017’s Yooka-Laylee and applies a fresh coat of paint. I was so excited for its original release, and despite some obvious shortcomings regarding its controls and chaotic camera, it’s the perfect example of why we need 3D platformers forever—a point Astro Bot has doubled down on. Yooka is a chameleon, Laylee is a cute bat, and together, they combine to explore multiple words brimming with personality, magically book pages, and pesky enemies. If you want a more chilled game where you can sit back, relax, and collect stuff, I’d recommend checking out Yooka-Replaylee.</p>



<h3 id="h-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</h3>



<figure><figcaption>More jungles. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> might be a convoluted name, but it’s apt for the adventure the third mainline MGS entry takes us on. The origins of Snake are born here, and it sets in motion one of gaming’s most revered series. Konami sensibly chose to remake Snake Eater first as it comes first in Metal Gear’s narrative chronology. It’s set to be a faithful recreation of Snake Eater, featuring the same story, dramatic events, and even original voice acting roles. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater may be a remake, but it’s sure to be one of 2025’s best games.</p>

<p>Role-playing games, or RPGs, are one of the most popular genres of games out there. RPGs cater to everyone from kids to adults to the elderly—you just have to find the one that fits your playstyle best! That’s why we’re here to present the top five most influential RPGs of all time so you can see the game that’s right for you. These are listed in no particular order.</p>



<h2 id="h-five-rpgs-everyone-should-play-once-in-their-lifetime">Five RPGs Everyone Should Play Once in Their Lifetime</h2>



<h3 id="h-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-games-like-the-witcher-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Witcher 3</a>, developed by CD Projekt RED and released in 2015, is an action RPG where you play as the character Geralt of Rivia. Geralt is a Witcher, a monster slayer for hire, looking for his adopted daughter Ciri after she disappeared years before trying to escape the Wild Hunt, a group of spectral warriors led by their king, Eredin. Many other characters appear in this game, including, but not limited to, Yenefer of Vengerberg, Triss Merigold, Dandelion, Zoltan Chivay, and Vesemir. The player’s choices within the game can lead to several different endings!</p>



<h3 id="h-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/6-best-games-like-skyrim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skyrim</a>, a 2011 action RPG developed by Bethesda Game Studios, is one of the most popular RPGs ever. Playing as the Dragonborn, a customizable character that can be one of nine different humanoid races, the player must save the world from Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon dead-set on destroying the world due to prophecy. Players can join many factions, side with a group for Skyrim’s civil war, choose to be good or evil, and choose from many different fighting or magic combat styles. Skyrim is popular because each player’s journey can end up differently, even if the main story concludes similarly each time.</p>



<h3 id="h-bloodborne">Bloodborne</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-games-like-bloodborne/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloodborne</a> is a 2015 action RPG developed by FromSoftware in which the player plays as a Hunter who fights through the city of Yharnam, attempting to find the source of the blood-borne plague affecting residents. Bloodborne is a Soulslike game, meaning combat is harsh, unforgiving, and relies on precise hits and timely dodging to avoid getting killed. The player character is quite customizable, allowing players to immerse themselves in the world of Bloodborne.</p>



<h3 id="h-diablo-ii">Diablo II</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Diablo II, a 2000 action RPG developed by Blizzard North, is centered around dark fantasy and horror themes and is comprised of four acts. Each act follows a predetermined path, but levels are randomly generated, allowing for a unique experience each time the game is played. The base game has five unique classes: The Amazon, The Necromancer, The Barbarian, The Sorceress, and The Paladin. The expansion Diablo II: Lord of Destruction adds two more classes: The Druid and The Assassin. The game’s purpose is to defeat Diablo in Hell and prevent his return, and each act in the game leads up to that final fight.</p>



<h3 id="h-final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>Final Fantasy VII is a 1997 RPG developed by Square (also known as SquareSoft) that follows the exploits of the character Cloud Strife, a mercenary trying to stop a megacorporation from using the planet as an energy source. Cloud fights alongside many characters who are also trying to save the planet. Many factions, including AVALANCHE, SOLDIER, and the Cetra, are in the game, all trying to fight against Shinra Electric Power Company and the Turks, a secret branch of Shinra’s security forces. The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen. While in “the field,” players can traverse areas found within the world map and explore, talk with characters, and advance the story through events. Of course, if the old-school graphics prove too much for you, there’s always the remake!</p>



<p>While these games are influential in many ways, they don’t even touch the number of RPGs available on the market. This list is meant to give you five very different types of RPGs, stories, and gameplay mechanics from some of the most influential companies and games. Head over to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a> to let us know if you’ve ever played any of these and which was your favorite!</p>

<p>Of course, the RPG genre is vast and filled with more than just the most iconic titles ever. Don’t forget about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-disney-games-to-gift-this-holiday-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many Disney games worth playing this holiday season</a>, which includes a few RPGs set in the iconic universe!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/massive-halo-leak/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/massive-halo-leak-reveals-dev-builds-unreleased-content-and-more-spanning-26-years.1069644/</guid>

<p>A massive leak of Halo content that contains development tools, unreleased content, and dev builds has leaked online.</p>



<p>The content is said to date back all the way to 1998 at Bungie, when the developers had just released Myth II: Soulblighter and were working on Oni and Halo: Combat Evolved.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1872351879843439101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VISCERAL</a>, the leak contains around 90GB of data and is said to have leaked because 343 Industries hired a group of modders to try and restore cut content and data from the old games. This was known as the Digsite project, with some users familiar with the project, including one modder who had worked on the project, <a href="https://x.com/DogbrainLudus/status/1872256501982839002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirming that the leak was genuine</a>.</p>



<p><em>As with all leaks of this nature, downloading them is at your own risk, and the files can be found on various social media platforms.</em></p>



<p>As for the Halo franchise today, 343 Industries renamed itself to Halo Studios in 2024 and continues developing the next Halo games. <span>As part of the announcement of its studio</span>‘s name change, the development also announced its games would be moving&nbsp;to Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>“If you really break Halo down, there have been two very distinct chapters. Chapter 1 – Bungie. Chapter 2 – 343 Industries,” studio head Pierre Hintze said. “Now, I think we have an audience which is hungry for more. So we’re not just going to try improve the efficiency of development, but change the recipe of&nbsp;how&nbsp;we make Halo games. So, we start a new chapter today.”</p>



<p>Will you be checking out more of the Halo leak? Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
