<p>A hacker has found a security flaw in Marvel Rivals, one of the most popular multiplayer games currently available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A report from <a href="https://shalzuth.com/Blog/IFoundAGameExploit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shalzuth’s blog</a>, spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/528355/article/can-marvel-rivals-hackers-take-over-your-pc-or-playstation-5-remotely-hacker-finds-a-security-exploit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, discusses the Marvel Rivals security exploit, which lets hackers access the player’s PC and PS5. The report states that developers use “remote code execution for their hotfix patching system.” However, when the codes are executed, the “game doesn’t verify” whether the command comes from the real server. Moreover, it provides “admin privileges for the sake of anti-cheat,” making it easier for the hacker to take over the device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those wondering about RCE or remote code execution, this is a common way for hackers to run malicious code on a player’s device if they are on an unsecured network without the victim noticing. Shalzuth also posted a video of exploiting this Marvel Rivals security flaw on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSXoH1xYIcE&amp;t=2s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gaming laptop</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDxUaIvVxmY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> by injecting malicious scripts while on the same Wi-Fi. He has also contacted NetEase through various channels to inform them about the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Security flaws in the gaming industry aren’t uncommon, especially with games like Marvel Rivals, which focus on online gameplay. However, the fact that a hacker can quickly take over a player’s device with the help of the game is a cause for concern, mainly when the title attracts close to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">200-300,000 players every day</a> on Steam alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-cancels-mid-season-rank-reset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled mid-season rank resets</a> after recent backlash. Also, the game has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-section-disney-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a section on Disney Plus</a>. What are your thoughts on the Marvel Rivals security flaw? Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Split Fiction is the spiritual successor to It Takes Two, and people are hyped. Hazelight Studios has cracked the co-op formula, and Split Fiction’s release can’t come soon enough for those seeking a tandem adventure.</p>



<p>I constantly advocate gaming needing more co-op games. The genre isn’t as dead as people think it is has plenty of titles supporting local and online co-op. You need to check the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest co-op games coming in 2025</a> to see this. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> is likely to be the standard-bearer for the genre moving forward.</p>



<p>Director Josef Fares looks to keep the art of co-op alive and further the genre wherever possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-release-date">Split Fiction Release Date</h2>

<p><strong>Hazelight Studios is launching Split Fiction on March 6.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a> hosted an incredible ceremony celebrating all things gaming. Amongst the awards were a large volume of game announcements and trailers. Hazelight Studios director Josef Fares announced the much-anticipated follow-up to It Takes Two—<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<p>It doesn’t have any Early Access or ways to sample the action early. You and I have to wait patiently until March 6 to see what new ideas and innovations come up.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-platforms">Split Fiction Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>It’s a pure next-gen launch for Split Fiction debuting on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>I’m shocked Split Fiction is skipping last-gen formats, to be honest. It Takes Two launched on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC at launch—offering a Switch port one year later.</p>



<p>Whereas Split Fiction is sticking to the most recent generation, and that’s it. I’d argue a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-nintendo-switch-2-direct-reveal-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> release could happen in the future. Nintendo’s newest console is rumored to be a lot more powerful, so don’t be surprised if the Switch 2 eventually gives Split Fiction a new lease of life.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-editions-amp-price">Split Fiction Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>Split Fiction has an established recommended retail price of $49.99 or £39.99 for the Standard Editon—the only version of Split Fiction.</strong></p>



<p>Physical and digital editions of Split Fiction exist. An interesting note is the Standard Edition is the <strong>only way to play Split Fiction</strong>. There is no Deluxe Edition, Unbelievable Mega Ultra Deluxe Edition, or a Collector’s Edition. This is good news for players unwilling or unable to splash out on constant expensive upgrades.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’ve a huge fan of Hazelight Studios from the A Way Out days. How much are you looking forward to Split Fiction? Does EA have another bonafide success on its hands?</p>



<p>Check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction gameplay</a> to wet your whistle in the meantime.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation State of Play Announced For February 12]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-february-12.1105890/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-announces-state-of-play-for-february-12/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Sony has officially announced its next PlayStation State of Play event. Confirming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rumors</a>, the show will take place on Wednesday, February 12 at 5pm ET/11pm CET.</p>



<p>In its announcement on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-february-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, the company says that the show will be over 40 minutes long, and will feature “news and updates on great games coming to PS5.” </p>



<p>“The show celebrates a creative and unique selection of exciting games from studios around the world,” Sony said with no other details being given regarding what games will appear.</p>



<p>But aside from the small tease from Sony, Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill said on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6qKJBGGFu6X4hNmi6GQP8C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest episode of Insider Gaming Weekly</a> that a brand new game from a brand new studio will be shown during the event as well.</p>

<p>As far as what else to expect, it’s unclear. With plans for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-more-xbox-games-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more Xbox games</a> to come to the PlayStation 5, the show could see another announcement of the next Xbox game to come to PlayStation. Halo and Gears of War are two of the bigger names making the rounds online, though there is nothing to confirm those being the next games to come. Two games that could also be shown are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a> and Death Stranding 2 as both are scheduled to release in 2025.</p>



<p>Like always, Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the show as it airs, including every announcement you need to know.</p>
