<p>On October 1, Microsoft announced that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/">rais</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">i</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/">ng the price</a> of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate by 50%. Now, less than a week later, news is coming out that not all subscribers will be subject to the price increase. </p>



<p>According to emails being sent out to Xbox Game Pass members within the European Union (EU) and elsewhere, the price increase from €18 to €27 will only be for new members and those who don’t have auto-renewal enabled.</p>



<p><span><strong>“Recently, you may have heard about changes to Xbox Game Pass subscription prices,”</strong> the <a href="https://x.com/Colteastwood/status/1975585850751844383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">email reads</a>.<strong> “At this time, these increases will only apply to new purchases and will not affect your current subscription in your region, as long as you are on an auto- recurring plan. </strong></span></p>



<p><strong>“Should you choose to cancel <span>your plan and repurchase, you will be charged the new current rate. If for any reason there may be changes to your existing account, we will notify you at least 60 days in advance and you will have the option to cancel or change your subscription plan at any time.”</span></strong></p>



<p>After the emails went out, you’ve had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/gp_price_hike_doesnt_seem_to_affect_people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many take to Reddit</a> to confirm that they received the same message.</p>



<p>“Same with PC Gamepass in Germany, signed up for it when it was 9,99€, still paying 9,99€ after the increase to 11,99€ and got an email that the price will remain at 9,99€ instead of the new 14,99€ for me,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/gp_price_hike_doesnt_seem_to_affect_people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said one user</a>.</p>



<p>As of publishing, Microsoft hasn’t made any sort of wide-ranging public comment on the matter. Insider Gaming has reached out to the company for clarification on prices for auto-renewal members and what regions are impacted. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>Players have reported that Battlefield 6 physical copies include the entire game and do not require any additional downloads to play. </p>



<p>It’s less than 3 days until the highly anticipated Battlefield 6 releases on October 10, 2025. Interestingly, some players who had pre-ordered the physical copy of BF6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-physical-copies-reportedly-received-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received the game early</a> and have started providing reports on what is available on the disc, and it seems you can have the whole experience right off the bat. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-servers-seem-like-they-are-already-online">Battlefield 6 Servers Seem Like They Are Already Online</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-physical-copies-are-content-complete-and-require-no-initial-install-according-to-early-copy-holders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the original poster, who had received Battlefield 6’s physical copy early, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nzhg5l/comment/ni2p42z/?share_id=gftOQn-SiPIYz2EDMKSD6&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> some other details as well. A player asked the OP whether the game was playable without an internet connection and required no additional downloads, and the answer was “yes”. The OP also confirmed other points, such as being able to play the campaign through the Battlefield 6 disc, and the multiplayer servers seem to be online as well. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 developers have also contributed to the hype ahead of the game’s release recently. During a recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-teases-naval-warfare-is-coming-to-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a>, the developers stated that “requests for naval warfare have not gone unnoticed, nor have the calls for a certain fan-favorite little helicopter, platoons, and more.” These points are likely to make fans happy, as even more exciting content appears to be on the way. </p>



<p>In other news, early patch notes for Battlefield 6’s day one update have been shared by EA ahead of release, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-day-one-early-patch-notes-shared-by-ea-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 200 changes coming.</a> Additionally, here are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exact release times</a> for BF6.
