<p>Tim Cain, one of the leading creative minds who fleshed out the Fallout franchise from the first game, recently revealed his original pitch for the ending of the 1997 title. At the end of the first Fallout game, the player will receive one of two sequences, depending on how they played their game.</p>



<p>One sees them return to Vault 13 after a string of successful missions before being permanently ejected by the Vault’s overseer (admittedly for good reasons). The second is the ‘bad’ ending that sees the player character becoming part of the Master’s mutant army, being dipped in FEV and turned into something grotesque.</p>



<p>Tim Cain uncovered a third proposal that’s much more light-hearted.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sunshine-lollipops-and-rainbows">Sunshine, Lollipops, and Rainbows</h2>



<p>Fallout isn’t a peppy, upbeat series with positive themes and jovial sequences. It’s a dark, morbid, and miserable representation of a world beyond an apocalypse, torn apart by nuclear fire and twisted by mutation.</p>



<p>It therefore comes as no surprise to learn that Tim Cain’s pitch for the first game’s ending was shot down after being proposed.</p>







<p>In a recent video, the industry veteran explained how he wanted Fallout 1 to end:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I had pushed for Fallout ending with a party.</p>



<p>You’d come back to Vault 13, you’ve gotten the Water Chip, you’ve taken care of the mutant army and the Master, and everybody has a big party for you. There’s cake and balloons.</p>



<p>That got rejected.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full video, which showcases Cain talking about all his proposals over the years that have been pushed away. The Fallout bit is first up in the pecking order:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>After the dreary events of Fallout’s story, it might have seemed a little bizarre to end with a party, but the canonical ending is something much more depressing entirely. No matter what you do to save the people of Vault 13, you can’t be trusted to stay in there as a dweller because of the example you’ll set for younger residents of the Vault.</p>



<p>If you can leave and explore the devastated wasteland, why can’t they?</p>



<p>Tim has made his peace with it, but it’s always interesting to know what might have been. Years later, Tim’s vision unfolded in a way. Fallout 3 opens with a birthday party sequence with – you guessed it – <strong>cake and balloons</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-fallout-crossover-make-me-play-indie-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/balatro%E2%80%99s-fallout-crossover-might-make-me-finally-play-the-smash-hit-indie.1118025/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-fallout-crossover-make-me-play-indie-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Balatro is one of those games that passed me by. Not because it’s bad, but because I have no idea how to play card games. It was a couple of months ago that it was revealed that Balatro had sold a whopping 3.5 million copies, which is a stellar performance for a game pieced together by a solo developer.</p>



<p>Recently, it was announced that Balatro will be landing on the Game Pass subscription service. To usher in this addition to the library of games, the ‘Friends of Jimbo (Pack 4)’ reveal was dropped, showcasing a series of cosmetic collaborations including Assassin’s Creed, Slay the Princess, and most importantly, <strong>Fallout.</strong></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-time-to-learn">Time to Learn</h2>



<p>If you know me, you’ll know I’m dizzy for the Fallout franchise. I’m a die-hard fan with thousands of hours invested across the series. When I first played Fallout 3 in 2008, it introduced me to a veritable feast of post-apocalyptic potential that became a burning adoration for the genre and setting.</p>



<p>Balatro, on the other hand, never took my fancy. It was released just over a year ago to an overwhelmingly positive reception, but I never saw the attraction simply because I know flat-nothing about card games.</p>



<p>To herald the arrival of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-game-pass-friends-of-jimbo-pack-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro on the Game Pass</a> service, a trailer was released showcasing the Friends of Jimbo (Pack 4) DLC, a cosmetic crossover featuring iconic imagery from some of the biggest and boldest franchises ever made.</p>



<p>To cut a long story short, there’s a cosmetic card upgrade featuring Fallout’s Vault Boy character, which you can see in the below trailer.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Balatro - Friends of Jimbo (Pack 4) | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0G24sFdbXws?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>And just like that, my curiosity is piqued and I have some connection to the chart-topping indie game that has won stacks of awards.</p>



<p>It helps that I’m also a huge Assassin’s Creed fan, and having Ezio Auditore on a card face has me eager to secure the pack and find out what all the fuss is about.</p>



<p>Recently, Balatro’s solo developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-luck-be-a-landlord-win-pegi-ratings-appeals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won a PEGI ratings appeal</a>, months after the game was classified as a game for adults because of the ‘promotion of gambling’. The developer, LocalThunk, also teased the impending ‘1.1’ update for the game, which is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-balatro-update-details-intentionally-being-kept-under-wraps/">being kept under wraps</a> until it’s the right time to reveal what’s coming.</p>



<p>Do you rate Balatro as one of the best indie games to emerge in years? In 2024, it was the Insider Gaming community’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/">Indie Game of the Year</a>.</p>

<p>It has just been revealed that Tekken 8 has already sold three million copies, passing the milestone inside a one-year window. The successful fighting title is also getting a new DLC fighter in the form of Anna Williams, a classic character who has been a stalwart figure in the franchise since the original Tekken in 1994.</p>



<p>Bandai Namco released an exhilarating gameplay trailer to showcase the imminent arrival of Anna Williams, who will join the game on March 31 for pass owners and April 3 for everyone else.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-blast-from-the-past">Blast From The Past</h2>



<p>It hasn’t been all that long since Anna Williams was last in a Tekken title. She surfaced in Tekken 7 as a DLC character and was in the starting line-up in Tekken 6. Her impending release in Tekken 8 was heralded by a three-minute gameplay trailer published recently by Bandai Namco:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="TEKKEN 8 – Anna Williams Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b6hYwWoOrDk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Anna Williams will appear at the end of March wielding her trusty rocket launcher, but in a switch-up to her moveset, she’ll be wielding that bazooka as a melee weapon as well as a ranged accessory.</p>



<p>The trailer above showcases a classic clash between Anna and Nina Williams. These sisters have been an iconic duo for years, but Nina has arguably enjoyed a little more time in the limelight. In 2005, she headlined a game on PlayStation 2 named Death by Degrees. </p>



<p>If you could complete the game, you’d unlock Anna as a playable skin, which represents her assuming the role of second fiddle.</p>



<p>Despite never being a Tekken fan, I somehow managed to find and play Death by Degrees when it came out twenty years ago, and for some reason, it has stuck with me all this time.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see Anna Williams arrive in Tekken 8 in just a few weeks? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bossa-games-has-made-more-layoffs-amid-%E2%80%98industry-turmoil%E2%80%99.1118004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bossa-games-more-layoffs-industry-turmoil/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In January 2024, Bossa Games (formerly known as Bossa Studios) laid off ‘around one-third’ of all employees, citing a ‘perfect storm of circumstances’. Recently, it was revealed that further layoffs have hit the company, with Bossa Games’ CEO stressing that the industry is in a place of turmoil.</p>



<p>These layoffs represent the second round of redundancies to strike Bossa Games since the company revealed Lost Skies, an innovative open-world title that’s a far cry from the games the company is used to producing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-this-is-not-a-phase">‘This is Not a Phase’</h2>



<p>Henrique Olifiers, the CEO of Bossa Games, posted a lengthy statement on LinkedIn highlighting the state of the wider industry. It’s his opinion that the tens of thousands of workers laid off over the last two years don’t represent ‘a phase’ but ‘a fundamental transformation’ of the business at large.</p>



<p>The co-founder of the company <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bossa-games_activity-7298367748902912001-h4lt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAoO_OkB-VfPR7dhiZ-PZ-9sf_EfWliEy1k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve had to make the painful decision to scale back, focusing on the late-stage production of Lost Skies and its upcoming launch, ensuring the game is successfully released and evolved for its players for the foreseeable future. Once Lost Skies is established and enjoying live operations, we’ll reshape into small teams working independently on novel game ideas brought to the players as early as possible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It wasn’t mentioned how many people were impacted by this round of redundancies, as Olifiers’ statement only mentions letting go of ‘extremely talented and treasured colleagues’.</p>



<p>This has already been a terrible year for the industry when it comes to layoffs and studio closures. Recently, it was suggested that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-studio-closures-dozen-claim/">NetEase is preparing to divest</a> overseas studios, which could result in several offices closing entirely. That news came days after the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-laid-off-as-netease-guts-entire-team/">laid off a North American team</a> formerly working on Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>Bossa Games is best known for Surgeon Simulator and the quirky title, I Am Bread. The reveal of Lost Skies came out of left field, as it’s like nothing that the studio has worked on before, but gamers were enamoured by the exciting trailer and have been looking forward to the title since.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Activision Has Been Forced To Admit It uses AI To Generate Assets in Call of Duty]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/activision-forced-gen-ai-call-of-duty/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-has-been-forced-to-admit-it-uses-ai-to-generate-assets-in-call-of-duty.1118001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/activision-forced-gen-ai-call-of-duty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty players have accused Activision’s studios of using generative AI to produce in-game assets, namely calling cards, stickers, and some skins for at least a few months. For instance, a festive-themed calling card showing a ‘zombified’ Santa Claus bore clear traces of gen-AI usage – the character in question had too many fingers.</p>



<p>Now, the proof is in the open, and it’s all thanks to a recent Steam policy update that requires developers to clarify when generative AI has been used in the production of <strong>any </strong>game on the storefront. </p>



<hr>







<p>In a recent update to Steam’s policies, developers must disclose the use of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-players-want-to-filter-out-games-that-use-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any generative AI</a> in a sub-section listed under any game’s core description. This comes as a result of new rules published by the United States Copyright Office, which has decreed that any AI-gen content cannot be classified under copyright laws.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933620/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page for Black Ops 6</a>, it’s written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Call of Duty is one of the most ambitious development efforts in modern gaming, with Activision’s studios boasting thousands of developers working concurrently across multiple projects. It rankled with <strong>many fans </strong>that these teams would need to ‘resort to’ using generative AI to produce in-game assets.</p>



<p>In most cases, the content produced has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-modern-warfare-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">branded ‘AI slop’</a> by followers of the legendary FPS franchise.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time Activision has leaned on AI to support the Call of Duty series, though. In 2023, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-anti-toxicity-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI and ML-based tools</a> would be used to moderate in-game voice and text chat. This news wasn’t taken as harshly as the revelation that the team is using gen-AI to supplement the work of artists, though.</p>



<p>What’s the worst gen-AI asset you’ve seen created in Call of Duty? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-releases-statement-on-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-leaks.1117803/</guid>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t release until March 20, but that hasn’t stopped some players from getting their hands on a copy of the game. Ubisoft knows about the situation and has, in turn, released a statement to players about Assassin’s Creed Shadows getting out to the public early and the leaks that have followed.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1894135156312617339/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledges that players have</a> “accessed Assassin’s Creed Shadows ahead of its official release”. Ubisoft says that players, if they see the gameplay, should know that there is still some work being done to prepare for the day one experience.</p>



<p>“The development team is still working on patches to prepare the experience for launch and any footage shared online does not represent the final quality of the game,” Ubisoft said.</p>

<p>The studio also called the leaks “unfortunate” and “can diminish the excitement for players”. To that point, they suggest those with the game avoid publishing anything to avoid spoiling it for those who are waiting until the game launches.</p>



<p>“We kindly ask you not to spoil the experience for others,” they said. “Thank you to our community for already taking steps to protect everyone from spoilers.</p>



<p>“Stay in the shadows, avoid the spoilers, and keep an eye on our channel for more official surprises in the coming weeks!”</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on March 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game’s launch comes after multiple delays from its original fall 2024 release.</p>
