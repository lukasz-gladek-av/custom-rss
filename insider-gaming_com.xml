<p>Marvel Rivals has been confirmed to show up at the 2025 Game Awards. Season 5.5 is right around the corner, and there’s plenty that could be revealed for the game’s future. </p>



<p>The latest playable character for Marvel Rivals has just been teased, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-showcases-rogues-vanguard-moves-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rogue is set to join the fray</a>. It’s the third consecutive season that a new vanguard has been added into the mix, but that doesn’t stop fans from wanting to know more about the future of the franchise.</p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-will-be-at-the-game-awards">Marvel Rivals Will Be At The Game Awards</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The announcement came directly from Geoff Keighley, who shared a promotional image featuring Jeff the Land Shark sitting in a theatre seat marked with both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-statue-mystery-possibly-solved-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-unveils-new-gacha-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> branding. The artwork is loaded with personality, featuring Blade looking unimpressed in the background, Emma Frost sitting casually beside Jeff, and Gambit and Rogue sharing a kiss behind them—a playful nod to both the game’s tone and its growing roster.</p>







<p>What Marvel Rivals will actually showcase remains a mystery. Keighley’s only caption was a teasing “Tomorrow,” leaving fans to speculate wildly. The safest bet is a deeper look at the upcoming Season 5.5, but given NetEase’s recent momentum, it wouldn’t be surprising if they have a bigger reveal planned.</p>



<p>Fans will have to tune in to the Game Awards live to find out the truth for themselves. Do you have any theories about how Marvel Rivals could showcase at the Game Awards?
