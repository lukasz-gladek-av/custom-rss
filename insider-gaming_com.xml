<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t release until March 20, but that hasn’t stopped some players from getting their hands on a copy of the game. Ubisoft knows about the situation and has, in turn, released a statement to players about Assassin’s Creed Shadows getting out to the public early and the leaks that have followed.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1894135156312617339/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledges that players have</a> “accessed Assassin’s Creed Shadows ahead of its official release”. Ubisoft says that players, if they see the gameplay, should know that there is still some work being done to prepare for the day one experience.</p>



<p>“The development team is still working on patches to prepare the experience for launch and any footage shared online does not represent the final quality of the game,” Ubisoft said.</p>

<p>The studio also called the leaks “unfortunate” and “can diminish the excitement for players”. To that point, they suggest those with the game avoid publishing anything to avoid spoiling it for those who are waiting until the game launches.</p>



<p>“We kindly ask you not to spoil the experience for others,” they said. “Thank you to our community for already taking steps to protect everyone from spoilers.</p>



<p>“Stay in the shadows, avoid the spoilers, and keep an eye on our channel for more official surprises in the coming weeks!”</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on March 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game’s launch comes after multiple delays from its original fall 2024 release.</p>

<p>Phoenix Labs is officially shutting down its free-to-play action RPG Dauntless this spring. In a post on Steam and social media, the studio kept the announcement pretty short and sweet.</p>



<p>“Dauntless is shutting down on May 29, 2025,” the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/331370/view/503943474819631342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement reads</a>. “Dauntless will receive no additional content or updates. The game will no longer be available to play on May 29, 2025.”</p>



<p>They closed the social media post, specifically, saying, “Thanks to all for being a part of the Dauntless journey.”</p>



<p>Dauntless’ shutdown comes nearly six years after it first launched in September 2019 for PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. The game had since been released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. </p>

<p>The movealso comes during a tumultuous time for Phoenix Labs as a studio. </p>



<p>In January, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phoenix-labs-layoffs-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming learned</a> that roughly 50 people were let go at the company. There was a belief among those let go at the time that Phoenix Labs as a whole was set to be closed. </p>



<p>As of writing, parent company Forte has yet to make an announcement on the status of the studio. Insider Gaming has reached out, however, to attempt to get clarity on the situation.</p>



<p>At its peak, Phoenix Labs said that Dauntless had seen over 6 million players.</p>

<p>The CEO of esports tournament organizer PGL says there have been “concerted efforts from multiple parties to stop” running CS2 events. The most recent PGL event at Cluj-Napoca sold out tickets, despite many teams backing out of the tournament at the last minute.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pgl-ceo-says-anyone-trying-to-monopolize-cs2-will-simply-fail">PGL CEO Says Anyone Trying to Monopolize CS2 “Will Simply Fail”</h2>



<p>Following the conclusive grand finals of PGL Cluj-Napoca, where MOUZ defeated Falcons 3-1, PGL CEO Silviu Stroie <a href="https://x.com/ssilviu/status/1893928028591251706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took to X </a>(formerly known as Twitter) to celebrate. While celebrating the event, Stroie also spoke against the alleged efforts to thwart PGL, and called out those looking to monopolize the CS2 tournament circuit.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is Cluj Napoca, this is Romania!!! We finally decided to run an event with audience in our home country and we were all blown away! By far one of our best events ever. We will continue to run CS2 events despite concerted efforts from multiple parties to stop us. Counter-Strike is a global phenomenon and any single company that will try to monopolize it will simply fail. Our next arena event is in May in Astana, where we expect another sold out arena full of [Counter-Strike] fans.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But who are the parties trying to stop PGL? Stroie’s comment about monopolization suggest he’s referring to the larger competing organizers in ESL and BLAST. Prior to 2025, ESL and BLAST’s primary Counter-Strike leagues featured partnered organizations, which incentivized those teams to prioritize those events over any other ones, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">save for Majors</a>. Not only did those teams prioritize ESL and BLAST events, put the partner programs restricted the number of non-partnered teams that could qualify for those events.</p>



<p>These programs were effectively dashed by Valve changes made in 2023 that went into effect at the start of 2025. These changes banned partnership programs between team and organizer, forced all events to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-vrs-in-cs2-valve-regional-standings-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use Valve rankings</a> or open qualifiers for qualification, and forced organizers to make compensation public. In an attempt to get teams to re-prioritize their events, both ESL and BLAST have publicized new revenue share models. According to HLTV’s Milan “Striker” Švejda, the lack of revenue share <a href="https://www.dust2.us/news/57777/striker-reveals-why-several-teams-skipped-pgl-cluj-napoca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">directly led</a> to some of the top teams choosing to skip PGL Cluj-Napoca.</p>



<p>While PGL has not pursued a revenue share model, their Cluj-Napoca event drew praise for its format. Namely, fans were overall pleased to see a meaningful 3rd place match adopted, upping the stakes with an improved result in the Valve rankings and a big prize pool bump.</p>
