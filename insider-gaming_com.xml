<p>After years of waiting, Hytale is finally available in early access. While there are vast differences between the Hypixel Studios title and comparisons are widespread, there are plenty of things Hytale does better.</p>



<p>Hytale is still very young in its lifespan, but there are already areas where the game has the edge over Minecraft, and Insider Gaming has detailed them here.</p>







<h2 id="h-8-things-hytale-does-better-than-minecraft">8 Things Hytale Does Better Than Minecraft</h2>

<h3 id="h-crafting-from-storage">Crafting From Storage</h3>



<p>Is there anything worse in Minecraft than realising you have miscounted or forgotten a material, requiring you to trundle awkwardly back to your storage to collect what’s missing, and having to start the process all over again. In Hytale, that’s not an issue at all, as crafting will automatically pull in materials from nearby storage.</p>



<p>This is particularly useful if you’re yet to properly sort out all your storage boxes and have things randomly strewn all over the place, saving you a lot of time trying to find the particular item you’re missing.</p>



<h3 id="h-inventory-management">Inventory Management</h3>



<p>Second to the point above, inventory management in Hytale is a lot less stressful than Minecraft, and it’s extremely quick to dump and sort everything you’ve collected on a recent trip. Whether you grinded for food, ores, or random materials, you can shift everything into a box and organise it by type in just a few button clicks.</p>



<p>Similarly, it’s easy to stack resources that are already placed in a box, which means that you don’t have to spend a hefty chunk of time manually sorting things constantly.</p>



<h3 id="h-wildlife">Wildlife</h3>



<p>Minecraft regularly adds new wildlife mobs in annual updates, which has seen the array of creatures discoverable in the world increase significantly, but Hytale is certainly on the front foot with a wide array of animals already, and more in the pipeline.</p>



<p>From boars to fish, frogs to crows, owls to bears, moose to snakes, Hytale is packed full of animals to encounter already, with dinosaurs set to be introduced imminently, while previous development screenshots have shown off bison, antelope, and sabertooth cats. It really is a jungle out there.</p>

<h3 id="h-modding">Modding</h3>



<p>Minecraft’s modding scene is incredible for PC players, but Hytale has the capacity to be even better. In just a few days of early access, players have downloaded mods over one million times on Curseforge, and Hypixel Studios has made tools for modding the game widely available.</p>



<p>From quality-of-life adjustments to entirely new concepts, modding in Hytale has the capacity to be a game changer, providing a never-ending supply of experiences for all players in a similar way to Fortnite and Roblox.</p>



<h3 id="h-no-crafting-grid">No Crafting Grid</h3>



<p>Though Hytale has widespread comparisons to Minecraft, one of the biggest differences is crafting. While Minecraft requires you to arrange items for crafting in a particular design across a 3×3 grid, Hytale’s crafting requirements are more like Valheim, and it just requires you to have the necessary items.</p>



<p>It’s admittedly not too much of a problem in Minecraft, as you can get the game to put the crafting layout in automatically if you have the items, but Hytale’s approach is much easier to get to grips with.</p>



<h3 id="h-server-support">Server Support</h3>



<p>Like Minecraft, Hytale is heavily geared towards multiplayer, and, while custom servers are widely available in Minecraft, the process can be overwhelming, particularly for new players, and setting everything up can be quite a headache.</p>



<p>Hytale, which started life as a Hypixel Minecraft server, has tools available from the off that make joining a server, or connecting to one that you have purchased, extremely easy, and it’s quick and simple to jump into a new world.</p>



<h3 id="h-mantling">Mantling</h3>



<p>Minecraft’s blocky approach to the world can be difficult to navigate at times, with limited jump height and not much manoveurability, and while Hytale has a similar block-like approach, traversing the terrain is made a lot better with the addition of one simple feature: Mantling.</p>



<p>In Hytale, you can pull yourself up on a ledge that is within reach, which can be a lifesaver when trying to escape hostile mobs and PvP situations.</p>



<h3 id="h-plenty-more-to-come">Plenty More to Come</h3>



<p>At the time of writing, Hytale is only a few days out from being introduced to players in early access, and the content in the game so far is merely a drop in the ocean. With lots more to come in development and the promise of regular updates, there’s no telling what lies ahead for the future of the game.</p>



<p>That’s extremely encouraging in a world where Minecraft has arguably not adapted quickly enough to modern gaming, with updates taking a lot longer to come into fruition, particularly major tweaks to the game. It remains to be seen whether Hytale will continue on this path of updates post early access, but there’s a lot of excitement for what’s on the agenda.</p>
