<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-animus/">details regarding</a> the Assassin’s Creed Animus Hub made their way online thanks to a leaker. The leaks showed a Battle Pass for the game that included various cosmetics and even pets that could be unlocked. </p>



<p>This led to speculation about what else could be included in the Battle Pass and within Animus as a whole. After rumors continued to swirl about the possibility of paid extra content within the Hub, Ubisoft decided it was best to comment on the claims.</p>



<p>In a post on the game’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1gs3ahg/a_message_from_the_team_on_the_animus_hub/?rdt=40110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official subreddit</a>, community manager Ubi_Waldo clarified some details about the Animus Hub and what players can expect from the offers.</p>

<p>“It has come to our attention that inaccurate rumors have been circulating online regarding the upcoming Animus Hub (ex-codename Infinity),” Ubi_Waldo said. </p>



<p>He then went on to clarify that all rewards in the Animus Hub will be “entirely free”. He also said “players will have access to regular content &amp; missions at no extra cost”. Lastly, there are “no paid subscriptions or paid battle pass” within the Animus Hub.</p>



<p>He closed his remarks stating that more details on what the Animus Hub will offer will come as the launch of Assassin’s Creed Shadows gets closer.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-infinty-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first to report</a> on the Animus Hub, formerly known as Infinity. The hub will act as the launcher for all Assassin’s Creed games moving forward.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on February 14, 2025 after being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed from its original</a> November release. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
