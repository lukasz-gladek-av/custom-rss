<p>Death Stranding 2 On The Beach is the sequel from the mind of Hideo Kojima. Its release date was finally confirmed, and if you want to hear more about the follow-up, we’ve got the main details you need to know.</p>



<p>Hideo Kojima springs to mind when I think of auteurs across any medium of media. He’s produced and directed games featuring over-the-top mecha combat, hallway-based horror, and most notably strategic stealth and surrealism. Death Stranding was arguably his most “out there” work to date, and Death Stranding 2’s release will inevitably try to one-up it.</p>



<p>With a stellar cast and even a curious homage to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-luca-marinelli-solid-snake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solid Snake</a>, let’s check the latest on one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-playstation-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest PS5 releases</a> coming soon.</p>

<p><strong>Death Stranding 2 On The Beach has a June 26 release date—making it one of the Summer’s biggest launches if it meets its announced release date.</strong></p>



<p>Originally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2 was a rumor</a>. The worst-kept secret became official at The Game Awards 2024. Screenshots, trailers, and gameplay have been shown off periodically over the last several years, but a release date was notably lacking.</p>



<p>This was until Kojima Productions unveiled an official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2 release date</a>. It was great news, and fans also got to see the full extent of the action title’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-colelctors-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collector’s Edition</a>.  </p>



<h2 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-platforms">Death Stranding 2 On The Beach Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>A <strong>Death Stranding 2 On The Beach</strong></strong> <strong>PlayStation 5 exclusive launch is happening, with PC, Xbox, and any other platforms having to miss out for now.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a rare PlayStation-only launch. Exclusives are seemingly coming few and far between in 2025. Death Stranding 2 On The Beach can only be purchased on its June 26 release date for PS5.</p>



<p>But all is not lost if you’re a PC player without a PS5 console. The original Death Stranding was one of a few PlayStation-exclusive titles that eventually came to PC. Sony has made a habit of releasing its recent library of exclusives on PC—exposing titles to a wider audience, and making more money.</p>



<p>Meaning, <strong>a Death Stranding 2 On The Beach PC port is not out of the question</strong> a year or two from now.</p>



<h2 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-editions-amp-price">Death Stranding 2 On The Beach Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>You must choose between Death Stranding 2 On The Beach’s Standard Edition ($69.99/£79.99), Deluxe Edition ($79.99/£79.99), and Collector’s Edition ($229.99/£249.99).</strong></p>



<p>Look at each Death Stranding 2 edition below, and see which one is the one for you.</p>

<p>Death Stranding 2 On The Beach is without doubt one of the biggest games (on paper) in 2025. Expect more to be added as it looks to shake the reputation of being a walking simulator. Are you picking up the sequel? What did you think of the OG Death Stranding? Let us know.</p>

<p>Activision has confirmed that Verdansk is officially returning to Call of Duty: Warzone as part of Season 3. The announcement came via social media posts on Monday morning.</p>



<p>“As we celebrate Call of Duty: Warzone’s 5 Year Anniversary, it’s time to revisit a place of unforgettable memories,” the game’s official <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1899083215802904607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media account</a> said.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Future Of Call of Duty—Insider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>Verdansk will be returning alongside the start of Season 3 on April 3. In addition to the announcement, Activision released a new trailer to get players ready for what’s to come.</p>



<p>As far was what else fans can expect in Season 3 of Call of Duty: Black Ops  6, that information will be fully revealed when the launch gets closer. Season 3 was originally planned for a release later this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but was delayed</a> so the developers can “[take] time to deliver a great experience” for players.</p>



<p>The announcement of Verdansk’s return is likely just the first for what fans hope is a big new season for the game.</p>
