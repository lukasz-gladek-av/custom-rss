<p>New details about Rainbow Six Siege X’s beta tests have been leaked, and it seems the game might feature a new 6v6 mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The leaker responsible for accurately predicting the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-2-reveal-si-2025-rumour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal date</a> for Siege X has now provided new details about the upcoming game. According to a new <a href="https://x.com/fraxiswinning/status/1897409037849051323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter) by fraxiswinning, Siege X will feature a new 6v6 mode, which the developers seemingly describe as “Experience the new Dual Front game mode featuring 6v6 non-stop action.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides the 6v6 mode, the leaker provided new information about Siege X’s <a href="https://x.com/fraxiswinning/status/1897385623570538733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">closed beta test</a>. Per their post, the closed beta test will be hosted between March 13 and 19, beginning on the same day as the Siege X <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showcase</a>. They aren’t sure how players will get access to it or whether the test will be conducted on consoles, as it will be hosted on a ‘test server’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Siege X has been described as “not just another update” but a “major evolution” for the series. The developers are working to ensure the upcoming title remains “at the pinnacle of tactical PvP first-person shooters.” The new instalment will feature graphical and audio upgrades, a refined game feel, and new ways to enjoy it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Rainbow Six Siege will be around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for another 10 years</a> after Siege X. Also, the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-rainbow-six-siege-top-esports-game-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still tops the esports charts</a> 10 years later. What are your thoughts on Siege X featuring a 6v6 mode?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>An unannounced first-person shooter (FPS) multiplayer game has been canceled at Respawn Entertainment. This news comes via former production coordinator at the studio Emilee Evans.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emevans04_opentowork-activity-7303182878773846017-Y_WP?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> on Wednesday, Evans revealed that the “incubation project” she was a part of had been scrapped.</p>



<p>“The unannounced incubation project I was a part of for the past year was canceled this week, so I am joining the group of extremely talented and kind people in the games industry searching for a new role,” Evans said.</p>



<p>The incubation project, while announced, was expected to be a multiplayer FPS title if <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/game-design-director-incubation-team-at-respawn-entertainment-3789765830/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">past job postings</a> were any indication. As far as the theme, setting, or anything else about the game, that remains unknown.</p>



<p>The cancellation of this new game at Respawn follows the cancellation of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-mandalorian-game-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio’s Star Wars Mandalorian game</a> in early 2024. When that was canceled, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/electronic-arts-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of restructuring</a> at EA that saw 5% of its staff let go.</p>
