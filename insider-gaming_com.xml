<p>The Last of Us Complete Edition is now available on PlayStation 5 for $99.99. It was published today, following announcements from Naughty Dog that revealed a physical edition will be launching in July.</p>



<p>This is yet another re-release of the franchise that spans just <strong>two games </strong>but has managed to cover more than a decade of entertainment. I’m a massive fan, and this will be an easy purchase. And as you read this, I’m arranging my pre-order for the physical collector’s edition.</p>

<h2 id="h-back-in-the-apocalypse">Back in the Apocalypse</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/the_last_of_us_complete_ps5_collectors_edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">snapshot blog post</a>, Naughty Dog wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Available today on the PlayStation 5 console, The Last of Us Complete allows players to experience both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II Remastered in one package. </p>



<p>The Last of Us Complete makes it easier than ever to experience the full story on PS5, whether you’ve played both entries, just one, or have yet to immerse yourself in the world of Joel, Ellie, Abby, and all of our characters.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans with a little more dough in their pockets (and patience) can pre-order The Last of Us Complete Collector’s Edition for $109.99, exclusively from PlayStation. It’s an attractive version of the game that comes with an exclusive steelbook, comics, and lithographic art prints. </p>



<p>You’ll also get a ‘thank you letter’ penned by Neil Druckmann, the creator of The Last of Us.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, the Collector’s Edition comes with physical discs <strong>only,</strong> and there’s no indication that it comes with digital ownership codes, which means if you’ve got a Digital Edition console, you’re buying this for the collectables, and those alone aren’t worth $109.99. </p>

<p>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era is set to release in early access Summer 2025. The release window for the game was confirmed during Thursday’s Triple-i Initiative showcase.</p>



<p>Alongside the release window announcement, developer Unfrozen released a new cinematic story trailer to set the stage for what’s to come for players.</p>



<p>“Tensions rise yet again,” the description reads. “The would-be protectors of Jadame clash their arms against one another, engulfing the continent in chaos and conflict. Reason is forsaken in the name of conquest and bloodbath. In the shadows, a malevolent force emerges, seeking to use this opportunity to claim dominion in the name of their master.”</p>



<p>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era is the first new game in the franchise since 2015’s Might &amp; Magic Heroes 7. While it’s once again being published by Ubisoft, it’s the first in the series to be developed by Unfrozen. The game, though the eighth mainline title in the series, is a prequal that’s set before the events of the 1995’s original Heroes of Might and Magic.</p>



<p>The game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-announced-by-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first revealed</a> at Gamescom 2024 and will launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105440/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-vampire-survivors-coop-update-and-2-new-adventures">Vampire Survivors Coop Update and 2 New Adventures</h2>



<p>Vampire Survivors Coop update, as you guessed it, is a chicken-themed update where you dash around the field as a chicken. The update brings a new relic that lets players speed up the game, a new stage, new characters, weapons and darkana. Players can try their hands at eight new achievements, too. </p>



<p>Moreover, there are two new adventures to sink your teeth into, each having 6 chapters to explore. For the base game, players can check out “To End an Ice Age”, and for the Tides of the Foscari DLC, they can play “Tides of the Foscari”.</p>



<h2 id="h-vampire-survivors-cross-save">Vampire Survivors Cross-Save</h2>



<p>Vampire Survivors Cross-Save features are now available on PC, Xbox, Android, and iOS. Nintendo Switch will soon receive the feature. However, Playstation 4 and 5 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will not receive cross-save in this update</a>. It wasn’t shared when it will be released, but the devs are working on it.</p>



<p>In other news, Enshrouded has revealed the “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/enshrouded-reveals-thralls-of-twilight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thralls of Twilight</a>‘ content update during the same event.
