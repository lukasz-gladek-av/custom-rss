<p>Lee Sang-hyeok, more commonly known as ‘Faker’, has received the highest possible merit that athletes can achieve in South Korea. He was recently awarded the Cheongnyong Medal of the Order of Sport Merit, bestowed upon him by the nation’s president, Lee Jae-myung.</p>



<p>This medal recognizes Faker’s decade of contributions to the esports industry, maintaining a name as the most dominant League of Legends player ever to emerge. He’s the first esports competitor in history to secure a spot in the prestigious line-up of medal recipients.</p>







<h2 id="h-faker-recognized-in-new-year-s-ceremony">Faker Recognized in New Year’s Ceremony</h2>



<p>Faker was invited to the State Guest House in Cheong Wa Dae to receive his Cheongnyong Medal, recognizing his dedication and evolution in the esports industry over the last ten years.</p>



<p>For just over a decade, Faker has been dominating the League of Legends space, and has secured more world titles than any ofther competitor in the business. He has secured records in the domestic space in South Korea and has become synonymous with the ongoing success of the esports industry.</p>



<p>Many have dubbed Faker ‘the GOAT’ of esports.</p>



<p>Speaking after the medal ceremony, Faker said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s an enormous personal honor to receive a decoration that represents the Republic of Korea. But I could not be standing here without the teammates and colleagues who have run alongside me up to this point.</p>



<p>This would have been impossible without the support of the fans who are always there giving me strength. I will continue to devote myself with my best effort in every moment, both in and out of competition, so that I can share positive messages and help raise the stature of Korean esports.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In social circles, Faker is seen as an eternal ‘good guy’ who never fails to deliver. He’s a stalwart competitor but also a wholesome, charitable, and polite individual who takes his success in his stride.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Todd Howard Showed No Interest in Fallout 4’s Most Impressive Mod]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-no-interest-fallout-4-mod-london/</link>
            <guid>1396324</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In July 2024, Fallout: London was released after years of development. The game-sized mod represented one of the most ambitious and long-awaited conversion projects in the history of the Fallout franchise, and it was very well received by fans worldwide. Owing to the size and stature of Fallout: London, it garnered quite a cult following over the years.</p>



<p>However, one of the people who perhaps <strong>should </strong>have been interested in it but <strong>wasn’t </strong>was Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard. In a recent interview, Howard revealed that he hasn’t played and never really followed Fallout: London, arguably the biggest Fallout 4 mod ever created and a transformative, mighty project.</p>







<h2 id="h-todd-howard-plays-it-safe-with-fallout-london">Todd Howard Plays it Safe with Fallout: London</h2>



<p>The driving theory behind Todd Howard’s apparent disinterest in Fallout: London is that he was hampered from praising the project by legal conditions. It’s no big secret that mods walk a grey area when it comes to legitimacy and IP infringement, but they’re part and parcel of the Bethesda landscape regardless.</p>



<p>If Todd Howard started gushing over Fallout: London, he’d have netizens taking to social media the world over to declare the mod canon, or something.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout4london/comments/1q03rsp/todd_howard_on_fallout_london/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent interview</a> hosted to celebrate the launch of Fallout’s second season, Todd Howard was asked about his interest in the Fallout: London mod, but the recognizable developer played coy:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Only some videos that I’ve seen online; I have not played it.</p>



<p>Only a little bit. I would say we look at a lot of the modding that’s going on, and when you have those total conversions – I just want to say how <em>hard </em>that is.</p>



<p>And so, the fact that it came out, first of all, because most of those never come out, and the fact that it came out… It seems a lot of fans love it.</p>



<p>It’s just – I need to express to everybody out there how difficult and what a journey that is for some of these big mod teams to do stuff like that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It also doesn’t help that he’s probably so busy he’s lucky ever to scrape a few hours playing <strong>any </strong>Fallout game, modded or otherwise.</p>



<p>Fallout: London represents what’s possible when a team of dozens pours resources, time, money, and effort into creating a passion project and turning it into something tangible and wholly accepted by a community. It’s one of the single-biggest mods in the gaming space, and it takes Fallout 4 and manipulates it into something otherworldly.</p>



<p>Team FOLON, the folks behind the mod, did such a good job that one or two of them were ultimately <strong>hired </strong>by Bethesda Game Studios.</p>



<p>When it launched, it was hosted on GOG and was downloaded a whopping 500,000 times in 24 hours, and in 2025, a <strong>VR version </strong>of the mod surfaced. If that wasn’t enough, more than a year after release, an expansion called Rabbit and Pork dropped, fuelling more interest in the mod.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Year In Review: AI in Gaming Will Only Get Worse in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-ai-in-gaming-will-only-get-worse-in-2026/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2025 has seen AI dominate various forms of media, leading to a significant impact across the entire spectrum of the world, including the gaming industry. However, this is merely the tip of the iceberg, and the impact is likely to intensify in 2026.</p>



<p>The past 12 months have seen AI become increasingly prominent in gaming, ranging from additions like an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-faces-unfair-labor-practice-charge-for-use-of-ai-darth-vader-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI-voiced Darth Vader in For</a>tnite to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-game-playable-demo-codex-mortis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fully AI-generated game</a>, with a smattering of other controversies in between.</p>



<p>While these incidents have sparked discussions at various points of the year, 2025 is set to be only a drop in the ocean for AI in video games, and a huge crossroads lurks ahead.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-major-turning-point">A Major Turning Point</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Controversial. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s important to remember that AI in video games isn’t anything new, and the fact of the matter is, games would simply not be able to run without some AI. All of the enemy soldiers you defeat in a Call of Duty campaign, the opponents you come up against in single-player in EA FC 26, and the NPCs you meet across the vast worlds require AI, in some capacity, to work.</p>



<p>The turning point, however, has been how AI is being used. Rather than using AI to support human-created elements, that step is being skipped in many cases to reduce the workload and have AI do the creation, where it’s artwork to coding. While it’s a crucial tool that can help prevent crunch at studios, controversy remains about its use and whether it will ultimately cost people their jobs.</p>



<p>Using AI as a replacement for human work has been problematic, and gamers have a keen eye to spot where AI has been used, particularly in artwork, with accusations cast towards a slew of major games for certain aspects of work published in 2025.</p>



<p>The discovery of AI use in 2025 has led to backlash, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie Game Awards disqualifying Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> for generative AI usage and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/">Battlefield 6 coming und</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">er</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/"> fire</a> for suspected use of AI in cosmetic items, and the big question now is how long that furore will last.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-backlash-ease">Will The Backlash Ease?</h2>



<p>Heading into 2026, using AI, particularly generative AI, is somewhat of a death note, as it’s certain to cause backlash among gamers, and there’s no hiding any usage, as players don their detective gear to uncover the truth of whether AI has been used in assets. Essentially, it’s a PR nightmare.</p>



<p>What’s unclear is whether that backlash will remain, as the growing use of AI may eventually be the norm, rightly or wrongly. When used in the right way to support developers and ease tasks, AI is a handy tool, but it’s hard to look across the wealth of layoffs in the industry in recent years and see higher-ups not viewing AI as a handy cost-cutting measure.</p>



<p>This isn’t restricted to gaming, as the use of AI has attracted huge criticism in all forms of media, while it also has both environmental and political impacts. For now, the general view of AI is a negative one, but don’t be surprised if millions upon millions is splashed to try and alter public opinion.</p>



<p>AI use is not a problem unique to gaming, but the future does look bleak, particularly for those employed in a creative industry. Unfortunately, there are no signs of the problem going away, and 2026 could be the stage for a major shift.</p>
