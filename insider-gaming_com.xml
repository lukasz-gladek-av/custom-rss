<p>You can read the official press release below:</p>



<div><p>Skipton, WY, UK – 29/11/2024 – Assassin’s Creed has had some truly unique Swords over the years, but arguably the most iconic is the Sword of Altaïr from the original Assassin’s Creed. Now you can own this truly legendary piece of gaming history for yourself, with the official release coming today, Black Friday!</p><p>This beautifully sculpted sword was meticulously crafted using over 200 references and hundreds of hours of gameplay from the original Assassin’s Creed released in 2007. Having to reverse-engineer this sword from nothing but low-res polygons and pixels to create this stunning 1:1 scale replica, Raven Forge also drew heavily on their own sword fighting background to not only know how this sword should look, but also the size and more importantly, how it should feel.</p><p>This is an arming sword, a knightly sword, the sword that is drawn in emergencies when subtlety has failed and armed combat is the only option. Heavy enough to parry a guard’s blade, light enough to be moved with ease. The swooping eagle quillons or cross guards have been made aggressive and angular, simulating a hunting bird of prey. The signature reversed “V” on the blade below the triple fullers is meticulously hand-ground on each sword that passes through our doors. When you hold this sword, you’ll know you’re holding the legendary sword of Altaïr.</p><p>With a beautiful wall plaque in the shape of the Assassin’s Creed logo and painted in the colours of the brotherhood accompanying the polished stainless steel and spiral black leather of the replica sword, and a stunning double-sided certificate of authenticity, as well as a hidden easter egg for the true fans, this is the ultimate addition to any Assassin’s Creed, prop replica weapon, or indeed any pop culture collection anywhere.</p><p>With the partnership between Ubisoft and Raven Forge now well established, we can expect to see some more highly collectable legendary weapons and products coming out soon that will excite the Assassin’s Creed fanbase as much as the Sword of Altaïr has!</p><p>With this being the first of a highly anticipated collection of legendary items from iconic games, TV and Films, Raven Forge continues to push forward into the world of high-end collectables, with more very close on the horizon.</p><p>Raven Forge is a small company from the UK, based in rainy Skipton in the Yorkshire Dales, that was founded and is run by two brothers, Sam and Tom Ive. Sam and Tom grew up on fantasy, sci-fi, and computer games, with a deep love of everything from Star Trek to Lord of the Rings, Terry Pratchett, Final Fantasy, Dungeons and Dragons, and everything in between. Now, they run one of the largest stockists of fantasy and historical memorabilia and collectibles in the UK.</p></div>

<p>The NFL is heading to the virtual gridiron in a new special broadcast in December. NBC Sports, EA, and the NFL have announced the first-ever “Madden Cast” broadcast for the Saturday, December 21st matchup between the Houston Texans and Kansas City Chiefs.</p>



<p>This new broadcast type will air exclusively on the Peacock streaming platform. It will feature it’s own broadcast team, feature Madden NFL 25 graphics, route trees similar to what’s in the game, play selection cards, player rating showcases, and more.</p>



<p>Calling the game will be Paul Burmeister on play-by-play with former NFL quarterback Kurt Benkhart and legendary Cincinnati Bengals receiver Chad Ochocinco providing commentary.</p>







<p>“The&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL Cast</em>&nbsp;will transform football strategy, information and IQ for viewers, enabled by the NFL’s Next Gen Stats and&nbsp;GeniusIQ<em>,&nbsp;</em>Genius Sports’&nbsp;next generation data and AI platform,” an announcement on the broadcast read.&nbsp;“GeniusIQ&nbsp;combines real-time data insights with fully branded animations, delivering an immersive viewing experience.”</p>



<p>“By merging the excitement of live NFL action with the immersive possibilities of augmented reality, we’re redefining how fans experience football,” GM and SVP of Publishing at EA Sports Andrea Hopelain said.</p>



<p>It’s not the first special broadcast for the NFL as they’ve done crossovers with Toy Story and, coming December 9, The Simpsons. Still, it’s the first one to truly crossover into video games.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that the broadcast will be weather dependent as the game is in Kansas City, Missouri. </p>

<p>The Buffer Weight Stock attachment in Black Ops 6 is another in a long line of optional gear you can add to your favorite guns. It doesn’t apply to all though, and there’s confusion about how it works. This guide covers the Buffer Weight Stock unlock requirements, how to equip it, and explains its effects.</p>



<p>I yearn for the old days of CoD where attachments were limited. You relied more on your skill and the default characteristics of the weapon, rather than turning it into a bespoke beast. Nevertheless, each new Call of Duty title has a mountain of attachments available for each gun, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/">Black Ops 6</a> has added the Buffer Weight Stock to add to the possibilities.</p>



<p>This new attachment links directly to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-hit-list-event-release-date-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hit List Event</a> in Black Ops 6, and there’s plenty to dive into.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-buffer-weight-stock-attachment-do-in-black-ops-6">What Does the Buffer Weight Stock Attachment do in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sweet recoil control. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Black Ops 6’s Buffer Weight Stock offers <strong>huge increases to Vertical and Horizontal Recoil Control</strong>—making any respective weapon it’s attached to much more accurate.</p>



<p>Here’s the pros and cons of the attachment.</p>



<h3 id="h-pros">Pros</h3>



<ul>
<li>Vertical and Horizontal Recoil Control x3</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-cons">Cons</h3>



<ul>
<li>Aim Down Sight Speed x1</li>



<li>Aim Walking Movement Speed x1</li>
</ul>



<p>Stock attachments usually help ADS, hip-fire spread, and other movement stats. This makes the Buffer Weight Stock extremely unique, and along with a Barrel attachment—and other accuracy-aiding attachments—you can turn your gun into a veritable laser beam.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-buffer-weight-stock-attachment-in-black-ops-6">How to Unlock Buffer Weight Stock Attachment in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p><strong>The Buffer Weight Stock automatically unlocked</strong> once Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 players collectively <strong>reached 8 billion Community Eliminations in the Hit List Event.</strong></p>



<p>The Hist List Event is the first proper event of Black Ops 6. A bunch of rewards and bonuses await those who take part. The super-secret <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-veteran-perk-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Veteran Perk</a> is one, and the Buffer Weight Stock is another.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick look at the scoring system, and what everyone needed to do to reach 8 billion community Eliminations:</p>



<ul>
<li>A Black Ops 6 multiplayer kill counts equals one Elimination.</li>



<li>Five Black Ops 6 Zombies kills equals one Elimination.</li>



<li>One Warzone kill equals five Eliminations.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-equip-buffer-weight-stock-attachment-in-black-ops-6">How to Equip Buffer Weight Stock Attachment in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Only three guns in Black Ops 6 are compatible with the Buffer Weight Stock: The <strong>XM4 Assault Rifle</strong>, <strong>XMG Light-Machine Gun</strong>, and <strong>DM-10 Marksman Rifle</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick guide on how to add it to your gun:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the Black Ops 6 multiplayer menu screen.</li>



<li>Scroll across to the <strong>Weapons </strong>tab.</li>



<li>Press on <strong>Loadouts</strong>.</li>



<li>Choose the loadout you want to use the Buffer Weight Stock attachment with.</li>



<li>Select the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/">XM4</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xmg-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XMG</a>, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-dm-10-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DM-10</a> as your primary weapon.</li>



<li>Click on the weapon’s <strong>Gunsmith</strong> option.</li>



<li>Scroll across to <strong>Stock </strong>and press on it.</li>



<li>Finally, go down the list until you get to Buffer Weight Stock and click on it to equip it!</li>
</ol>
