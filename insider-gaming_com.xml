<p>It has been revealed by Farm 51 that Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone will be released on PC in early access on March 6, 2025. This surprise announcement came just weeks after a new trailer that perfectly showcases everything this post-apocalyptic-style game has to offer, from a massive open world to branching character development options.</p>



<p>The first Chernobylite game was released in 2019 and flew under the radar for a bit. It was a first-person survival game with exploration options left and right, plus a base-building ecosystem and some intense combat mechanics. While the first game is available on all platforms, Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone is entering early access exclusively on PC.</p>

<h2 id="h-enter-the-zone">Enter the Zone</h2>



<p>I’m coming into Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone hot off an irradiated spree through games like STALKER 2 and Fallout, and I love it. I’m a huge fan of the first game, which looks phenomenal and offers a top-tier story and some interesting features, and I can’t wait for the second game to enter early access.</p>



<p>Chernobylite 2 has already been a hit with investors. This Kickstarter-backed title has secured 170% of what it was aiming for to bring the game to market, and there’s still a week left in the campaign. If you pledge to support the game, you’ll get access to both a beta and demo version of the game. </p>



<p>Here’s the most recent trailer for Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>On Kickstarter, Chernobylite 2 has secured $168,400 (at the time of publishing) out of a goal of $98,678. The most exciting stretch goal hit so far introduces first-person combat to the game. In a twist, Chernobylite 2 breaks away from the first-person exclusive perspective of the 2019 opening title and opts to use a third-person perspective.</p>



<p>But now, thanks to those backing the game, you’ll be able to switch whenever you want.</p>



<p>Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone also offers fully open-world exploration, while the first game focused on smaller, more confined ‘regions’ that you could jump in and out of.</p>



<p>I’m ready for Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone – it enters early access on Steam on March 6, 2025. Are you going to give it a try? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>In a recent study published by modl.ai, it was revealed that a whopping 77% of developers polled felt like they didn’t conduct enough QA for their studio’s most recent releases. Additionally, 50% of developers surveyed felt that QA budgets aren’t ‘growing fast enough’ to keep up with the ‘increasing complexity of modern games’.</p>



<p>The study was pieced together to take stock of the quality control ecosystem in the world of gaming development. It was focused primarily on gauging the adoption and anticipation of artificial intelligence in QA processes and procedures.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-ready-but-released">Not Ready But Released</h2>



<p>In recent years, we’ve seen some big-budget games released in a woeful state. More than a few titles have hit the open market in a paltry condition, boasting bugs across the board and performance issues left and right.</p>



<p>Last year, STALKER 2 was released to an eager reception but it was hampered by a stack of bugs – particularly on console platforms. In 2020, Cyberpunk 2077 was released in such a bad state that it faced legal concerns from investors.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://insights.modl.ai/state-of-games-qa-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report published by modl.ai</a>, it was revealed that 94% of developers (extrapolated) believe that AI will ‘play an important role in the future of game QA’. But with that being said, it comes as a surprise that just 18% of developers feel they’re ‘fully prepared to implement AI in all QA processes’.</p>



<p>They recognise that it’s the future of QA and testing, but they’re not ready to adopt it just yet.</p>



<p>In the numbers, 70.3% of survey respondents said they’d never launched a bug-free game.</p>



<p>In a statement on the data, Dajana Dimovska, the CEO of Indium Play, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’re never going to catch every bug, but AI can get you closer. It can take on early testing responsibilities, reducing the need for large QA teams throughout the production phase.</p>



<p>As the game reaches a more playable and polished state, manual QA testers step in — working alongside AI to identify and address quality issues. This collaboration between experienced testers and AI ensures a better final product.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many are ready to place stock in the implementation of AI-based QA. In one slide in the report from modl.ai, it was revealed that 21% of developers feel that AI testing is much more effective than traditional methods.</p>



<p>Presently, the blockers preventing industry-wide adoption include the complexity of setting up and operating AI-based systems, the costs of doing so, and the resistance to change – and fear of facing redundancy.</p>



<p>Do you think more AI in QA processes would eliminate more bugs ahead of launch? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you think.</p>

<p>Later in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll be tasked with getting a treasury key before a big raid can take place. It’s one of the most important steps in the run-up to one of the game’s most major missions, so it cannot be avoided. It’s simple – <strong>you need that key</strong>.</p>



<p>However, when it comes to trying to find Vavak’s key, you’ll most likely have a hard time given the size of the search area and the lack of direction towards where it might be. In this guide, I’ll tell you where and how to find Vavak’s key in Oratores, the all-important mission in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-vavak-s-key">How to Find Vavak’s Key</h2>



<p>Despite chatting with Christian in the guarded building in Kuttenberg, you’ll likely be searching the place for ages trying to find Vavak’s key. He doesn’t know where it is, either – it’s up to you to track it down.</p>



<p>Now, you could spend the next few minutes probing the building and the search area in a desperate attempt to find the critical key, or you could follow this guide and find it in a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>Firstly, you’ll need to get past the guards at the front of the building. If you have a high enough charisma level (and other skills are assigned), you can pass a skill check and you’ll simply be granted access to the site. It’ll surprise Christian, who is already inside, but if you did his earlier missions and aligned amicably with him, it won’t be a concern.</p>



<p>Otherwise, expect trouble – and more speech checks.</p>



<p>Now that you’re in the building, you’ll learn that Vavak has fled, but there’s a chance that the key might have been left behind. However, this building has several floors and rooms, along with plenty of chests and hidden nooks and crannies – it’ll take <strong>forever</strong> to search everything – and not everyone knows <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-lockpick-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/">how to pick locks</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t</strong> do that.</p>



<p>Instead, head to the ground floor and out the back door, making a beeline for the toilet that sits in the rear courtyard of the building. Inside the toilet (yes, <strong>inside</strong>) you’ll find a key sticking out of a pile of waste. That’s where Vavak’s key is in Oratores – simple.</p>



<p>Once you’ve got the key, you’ll need to wash up in a trough, otherwise people will notice your stink. But that’s it – that’s how to find Vavak’s key in Oratores. Have fun!</p>
