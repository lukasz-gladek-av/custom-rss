<p>Peak developer has announced that a new biome, called ‘Roots’, will be arriving on November 5, 2025. </p>



<p>Landfall and Aggro Crab’s co-op physics-based climbing title, Peak, has been a major success since its release. The title had already approached the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-sold-nearly-2-million-copies-last-week-during-steam-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million sales mark</a> a few months ago, thanks to a boost in sales from Steam. Now, the developers are introducing a new biome to provide additional content for players. </p>



<h2 id="h-peak-s-next-biome-is-going-to-be-forest-themed">Peak’s Next Biome is Going to be Forest-Themed</h2>



<p>Announced through a new update on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3527290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, the next Peak biome has been named Roots, and it evokes a truly foresty vibe. In the trailer, we see two characters hiding atop a tree trunk, with one character sliding in while holding a vine. As the duo seems to be planning their next move, one of the characters is abducted by a spider, and the teaser ends at that moment, revealing the November 5 release date. Check out the teaser for Peak’s Roots biome below: </p>

<p>The last biome added was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peaks-first-major-update-adds-a-new-biome-items-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mesa</a>, which featured sandy terrain and massive mountains. This time, it seems like players will be scaling massive tree trunks rather than mountains and hills. Similar to Mesa, Roots might take over on its arrivals and then be rotated randomly with Mesa and Alpine; however, developers have not confirmed these plans. Moreover, players can also expect new items to keep them safe, new resources to make climbing each other, and new obstacles to make their lives more difficult. </p>



<p>In other news, Peak developers announced a brand-new co-op arcade racing game this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-devs-announce-a-new-co-op-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crashout Crew</a>, and its demo is now available.

<p>Developer Heart Machine has laid off more employees, just weeks before the launch of its next game. According to a number of now former employees, the studio behind Hyper Light Breaker and the upcoming Possessor(s) has let them go ahead of the latter’s November 11th launch.</p>



<p>Based on social media posts, the layoffs took place on October 28 and 29. </p>



<p><strong>“I just wanted to post, I’m laid off,”</strong> said <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/burnrate.bsky.social/post/3m4bqa3s5is26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one impacted employee</a>. <strong>“Just shouting into the void of the internet! It was a beautiful and wonderful team of people to work with at HM.”</strong></p>



<p>Another said that their time with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mllepilgrim.bsky.social/post/3m4c2kazjfk2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the company will end</a> after Possessor(s) launches while Community and PR Manager Yiyi Zhang actually posted a video about the cuts.</p>



<p><strong>“Heart Machine has just laid off a bunch more people, effective immediately,”</strong> she said. <strong>“And by the time&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>&nbsp;comes out on November 11, I don’t know if anyone who worked on the game will even be at the company anymore. That’s game dev.”</strong></p>



<p>The latest round of layoffs comes just two weeks after Heart Machine said it was letting go of staff and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyper-light-breaker-developers-ending-development-and-laying-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">winding down development </a>of Hyper Light Breaker.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Heart Machine for clarification on the layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>What do you think about the second round of layoffs at Heart Machine in a month? Do you think the studio will last much longer?

<p>A new rumour states that Valve may have begun work on a Half-Life 3 trailer. </p>



<p>Valve has been utterly silent about the next instalment to the Half-Life series, with only rumours, datamines, and leaks being our only source of information. Most recently, we heard that the upcoming title was being developed as the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/half-life-3-has-been-designed-to-be-the-final-chapter-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final chapter</a>‘ of the franchise. Now, a new rumour states that a trailer for HLX/HL3 is already in the works. </p>



<h2 id="h-half-life-3-s-announcement-and-launch-will-be-very-close-to-each-other-it-s-claimed">Half-Life 3’s Announcement And Launch Will Be Very Close to Each Other, It’s Claimed</h2>



<p>The latest update regarding Valve’s work on Half-Life 3’s trailer comes from Tyler McVicker’s latest HLX Files episode on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKR-G1EuYyg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. McVicker says that the “current rumour that’s going around is that work on the trailer is occurring.” McVicker added that Valve’s approach to trailers is very different from “publicly-owned triple-A studios'” approach.</p>



<p>The video also mentioned that trailers and announcements typically arrive close to a year before launch. However, “Valve is not doing that.” Players are going to get Half-Life 3’s announcement and launch “very close together”, similar to what they saw with Half-Life Alyx.</p>



<p>McVicker explains that when trailers are created for games that are still far from launch, developers “have to effectively fake” what is being showcased, with very specific scripted content being pushed to the finish line earlier than the rest of the game’s aspects. </p>



<p>However, players should take this information with a grain of salt, as it was not obtained through a data leak or datamine, and Valve has not officially announced anything. </p>

<p>In other news, Half-Life 3 is reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/half-life-3-is-playable-end-to-end-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable end-to-end</a>. Additionally, Valve’s next SteamVR headset has allegedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valves-next-steamvr-headset-has-reportedly-entered-mass-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entered mass production</a>.
