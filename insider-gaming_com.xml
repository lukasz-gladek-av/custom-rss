<p>Xbox owners could be getting their hands on more PlayStation-exclusive games in 2025. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/inside-the-risky-strategy-that-will-define-xboxs-next-decade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new report</a> from Jez Corden of Windows Central, sources have told him that there will be “more unannounced and previously PlayStation-exclusive games” coming to Xbox Series X|S next year. </p>



<p>News of PlayStation exclusives coming to Xbox shouldn’t surprise anyone. Over recent years, both sides have continued to release games on the competing platforms. Recently, Genshin Impact finally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genshin-impact-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made its debut</a> on Xbox after being console exclusive to PlayStation since 2020. Another PlayStation exclusive,&nbsp;Predator: Hunting Grounds, released on Xbox in 2024 after four years as a Sony exclusive.</p>



<p>As of now, it’s unclear if Corden is referring to first-party or third-party games making their way to Microsoft’s consoles.</p>



<p>On the other side of the coin, Microsoft is bringing exclusives like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> to PlayStation 5 in 2025. There are also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-was-ready-but-delayed-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored plans</a> for Forza Horizon 5 to make its way to the console as well.</p>



<p>What PlayStation games do you think will make their way to Xbox Series X|S in 2025?

<p>One of the most popular memes is making its way to Fortnite as Skibidi Toilet is coming to the game. According to Fortnite leaker <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1869022252060365263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a>, a Skibidi Toilet bundle will be available in the game starting on Wednesday, December 18.</p>



<p>Players will be able to buy the full bundle for 2,800 VBucks or a la carte. The main piece of the bundle is a Plungerman skin for 1500 VBucks that includes a LEGO variant and a Skibidi backpack. Also available is a Skibidi Toilet backpack for 600 Vbucks and a Plungerman’s Plunger pickaxe for 800 Vbucks.</p>



<p>As of publishing, Epic Games has yet to confirm the release of the bundle. If and when that happens, this article will be updated with full details.</p>



<p>The continued growth of Skibidi Toilet shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone. Earlier this year it was announced that a Skibidi Toilet TV show and movie were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skibidi-toilet-movie-and-tv-show-are-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the works at a major studio</a>.</p>
