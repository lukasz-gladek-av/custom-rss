<p>A new update is out now for Silent Hill f, which adds a new ‘Casual’ difficulty, optional skips for New Game+, and other fixes. </p>



<p>Silent Hill f was released on September 25, 2025 and has been doing quite well for itself, with sales exceeding one million units. Recently, we saw a Switch and previous-gen port <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-f-switch-and-previous-gen-port-might-have-been-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemingly being confirmed</a> for the title; however, there is no official update on it yet. In the meantime, the developers have released a brand new update for the title, which adds new features and addresses some in-game issues. </p>



<h2 id="h-silent-hill-f-difficulty-update-biggest-changes">Silent Hill f Difficulty Update Biggest Changes</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The first new addition with the Silent Hill F Update is the fresh action difficulty, Casual. Players will be able to choose this difficulty when starting a ‘New Game’ as well as trying out New Game+. Players who already have it on Story action difficulty or higher will see the new difficulty become selectable once they reach the game-over screen multiple times. </p>



<p>The next new feature in this update is optional skips for select sections of New Game+. Once players have installed this update, they will find an option to skip upon completing the “Go through the door” objective after solving the mural puzzle in New Game+. The game will then resume at the scene where Hinako awakens in the corridor of the Dark Shrine for the second time with the “Proceed” objective if skipped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should note that the items that were found in the skipped sections will not be collected. “Thankful to Be Here,” “Grateful for a Worthy Foe,” and “Clear Skies” do not unlock on a playthrough that uses the skip feature. Lastly, this feature will not impact branching paths or endings. Interested readers can check out the system changes and bug fixes in the patch notes below: </p>

<p>ARC Raiders has a fresh new patch ready to be downloaded today, and it introduces the North Line update, the new map (Stella Montis), two new ARC enemies, and <strong>much more</strong>. It also brings about a series of bug fixes and tweaks that address some of the game’s biggest concerns.</p>



<p>Read on to scope out the full ARC Raiders patch notes for the 1.2.0 update.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-patch-addresses-desync">ARC Raiders Patch Addresses Desync</h2>



<p>One of the core elements addressed in the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/north-line-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new ARC Raiders patch</a> is desync, which was causing players to look as though they’d been hit by incoming fire even after getting behind cover. Embark Studios has adjusted this, and it should no longer be a concern for players.</p>

<li>Fixed various achievements not working correctly. Players will need to redo some achievements with only one objective item (e.g. “Destroy the Queen”) while achievements with multiple objectives will only need parts of them completed again.</li>

<p>Use these Roblox Skateboard Simulator monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Win Potions, Cash, Rebirths, Pets and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Skateboard Simulator is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-drift-36-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game where players are required to perform various skateboarding tricks to make themselves the best boarder on the platform. Players must train to gain strength before competing in various events to get better and upgrade their skateboards. With plenty of new areas to unlock and a variety of skateboard designs to purchase, Skateboard Simulator offers hours of mindless fun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boasting a rather aesthetic street theme and with endless progression opportunities, this will be a fun experience for anyone who has skateboarded before or even watched legends like Tony Hawk growing up. While simply playing the game will provide players with all the resources they need to get ahead of the competition, some additional free rewards never hurt anybody. That’s where these redeem codes will come in handy.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="h-active-skateboard-simulator-codes">Active Skateboard Simulator Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>update1</strong>: Get 1 Double Win Potion (NEW)</li>



<li><strong>RELEASE</strong>: Get 2 Double Win Potions (NEW)</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-skateboard-simulator-codes">Expired Skateboard Simulator Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Skateboard Simulator, as the game hasn’t been out for too long. However, one thing worth noting is that since its release, it has had regular content updates, meaning that more codes are likely to drop in due course. With this in mind, players are urged to make use of the active codes at the earliest, as the release of new codes could result in the expiry of the existing ones. Redeem them now so you don’t miss out on the free rewards and fall behind the competition.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-skateboard-simulator-codes">How To Redeem Skateboard Simulator Codes</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new entry in the Call of Duty franchise takes center stage in Black Ops 7, which follows the standard approach for the franchise with having a variety of level unlocks to gain access to new weapons, Perks, Scorestreaks, and more.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is making big changes to the formula this year, introducing a four-player co-operative campaign that is followed by a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-endgame-multiplayer-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new PvE endgame mode</a>, but there’s still plenty of familiar aspects to the game.</p>



<p>Unlocking the best weapons, Perks, Scorestreaks, and other items in Call of Duty is all part of the journey, and we’ve got details on all the Black Ops 7 level unlocks so you can track your progress.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-level-unlocks">All Black Ops 7 Level Unlocks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Progression is key. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 55 base levels to work through in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, followed by the customary Prestige system to further enhance your total level.</strong></p>



<p>While some weapons and Perks are available right from the start, the majority are unlocked through progression. However, Progression is universal in Black Ops 7, so you’ll level up whenever you play Campaign, Zombies, Multiplayer, or Warzone.</p>



<p>The table below showcases every level and what is unlocked by reaching it in Black Ops 7 Zombies. However, some content is only applicable for certain modes, so we’ve separated them out where appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-many-prestiges-are-in-black-ops-7">How Many Prestiges Are In Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 10 levels of Prestige available in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, with the final level, Death, coming alongside an endless amount of levels to churn through.</strong></p>



<p>Prestige Levels 1-9 follow the same process as the standard level-up, earning you unlockables at each level. However, you will receive a Permanent Unlock token after each Prestige, allowing you to choose any weapon, Perk, Equipment, or similar, to remain unlocked, whatever your level.</p>



<p>It’s worth using the Permanent Unlocks on items that are only unlocked in the higher levels of Black Ops 7, or for a weapon that has become your go-to in your chosen game mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Images and information on Ubisoft’s upcoming Far Cry 7 and a separate extraction shooter have leaked online, but dataminers seem to be confused about what exactly they’ve unearthed.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming in 2024</a>, Far Cry 7 was originally under the development name ‘Talisker’, which was subsequently canceled, leading to the creation of two new Far Cry projects: Blackbird, its new mainline title, and Maverick, a new extraction-based shooter.</p>







<p>Some images were described by leakers as being from the Alaskan extraction shooter game, but, in my opinion, those images appear to be jungle-themed, with Maya pyramids found similar to those in the Mexican jungle, not Alaska. That’s because these images originate from project Talisker’s multiplayer mode, which was a team-based elimination-style mode, and is why giant billboards are scattered around the map. Concept art and early in-development images sent to Insider Gaming under the condition that they are not made public match the actual screenshots identically.</p>



<p>As seen in one screenshot we’ve embedded below, a giant rat seems to be pulling a dead player away because Talisker had animals experimented on in the story, which mutated. This story setting will still bleed into the main Far Cry 7 title, but as far as Maverick goes, you’re likely to encounter more realistic animals such as wolves and bears.</p>



<p>That’s, of course, if Maverick doesn’t get canceled, which, at the time of writing, is a possibility. According to sources, the game has struggled to find an engaging gameplay loop, and with constant leadership changes and development issues, the project could be at risk of cancellation. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://t.co/8JXwqqAzNu">https://t.co/8JXwqqAzNu</a></p><p>Far Cry 7 details have reportedly leaked via game files from XDefiant. Fans datamined images showing what appear to be locations from the next Far Cry, strongly suggesting an Alaskan setting, which lines up with previous rumors.</p><p>The leak also seems to… <a href="https://t.co/O1FztPsVxZ">pic.twitter.com/O1FztPsVxZ</a></p></div>— GameGPU (@GameGPU_com) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameGPU_com/status/1988730314726969477?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>One image from the three does stand out from the rest, though: the Beckett family. As reported in the past, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=far+cry+7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry 7 will have a 24 real-life hours</a> timer (72 hours in-game) to rescue their family, who have all been kidnapped. It’s not entirely clear how much this has changed (if at all), but at least at the time of writing, this somewhat controversial gameplay loop is still within the game.</p>







<p>As for who plays the protagonist in the game<span>, it’s currently unclear, as Cill</span>ian Murphy was reported (and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cillian-murphy-far-cry-7-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later debunked</a>) at one point, but I have heard that Kevin Durand (The Strain, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, The Naked Gun) was in the running for the role.</p>



<p>Apparently, these images originate from an old Ubisoft Confluence build, and could be why the screenshots and information are somewhat blurry from the original leakers.</p>

<p>A new season is deploying in Marvel Rivals with the launch of Season 5, which naturally comes alongside a fresh balance patch with buffs and nerfs, and we’ve got all the details.</p>



<p>Season 5 in Marvel Rivals features all the tweaks we’ve come to expect with the seasonal transition of the title, including a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-team-up-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shake-up to Team-Up Abilities</a>, and tweaks are made to specific heroes to ensure they all remain viable.</p>



<p>For a breakdown of all the buffs and nerfs present in Marvel Rivals for the Season 5 launch, we’ve got all the information you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-marvel-rivals-season-5-buffs-amp-nerfs">All Marvel Rivals Season 5 Buffs &amp; Nerfs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Tweaks. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Season 5 sees potentially the biggest balance changes of all, and remarkably, there’s not a single nerf at launch. Instead, a host of characters are receiving buffs.</strong></p>



<p>For Vanguards, stand-out changes include Peni Parker’s Cuber-Webs now providing the same Healing Over Time and Movement Boost to ally players as she receives, while Magneto’s Metal Bulwark and Iron Bulwark have had their cooldowns seperated, although the shield value is reduced from 250 to 200.</p>



<p>In the DPS scene, Mister Fantastic’s Bonus Health has been tweaked to provide an addition of 350 Maximum Health and a one-time heal of 350, which is removed upon exiting his inflated state, while Squirrel Girl’s Burst Acorn damage has been increased to 110 from 100.</p>



<p>Finally, two Strategists have seen their base health increased, with Cloak &amp; Dagger and Loki receiving the boost, while Invisible Woman can now deploy a shield in front of her.</p>



<p>Here’s a full list of all the characters affected with buffs and nerfs in Season 5.</p>
