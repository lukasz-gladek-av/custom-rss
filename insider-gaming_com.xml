</p></figure>



<p>At Gamescom earlier this year, Insider Gaming got hands-on with the game, calling it “familiar, but entirely different” thanks to the series’ new setting. You can read our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full hands-on preview of Hell Let Loose: Vietnam here</a>.</p>



<p>From our perspective, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is going to be an unforgettable entry into the Hell Let Loose franchise, giving players a fresh and immersive gaming experience that is often overlooked in the first-person shooter scene.</p>



<p><strong>Game features:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Welcome to the Jungle – You and your fellow soldiers will be thrown into dramatic terrains and engage in warfare across 6 new Vietnam maps, featuring dense jungle, twisting deltas, and open clearings that offer unique tactical challenges.</li>



<li>Aerial Units – Allowing&nbsp;fully&nbsp;operational helicopters&nbsp;for troop deployment and fire support.&nbsp;&nbsp;These units play a pivotal role in transporting soldiers to landing zones,&nbsp;delivering supplies to the team in tactical locations,&nbsp;conducting&nbsp;reconnaissance,&nbsp;and offering aerial firepower.</li>



<li>Patrol boats&nbsp;– Take control of heavily armed vessels, such as&nbsp;the iconic U.S. patrol boat, the PBR.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Tunnels –&nbsp;The North Vietnamese forces can construct extensive tunnel networks, offering strategic advantages for surprise attacks and troop movements. This means that mastering tactics will become essential to winning the battle.​&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Holiday season allows everyone to let off some Steam at the end of the year. Steam Wrapped 2025 is the next-best day outside of Christmas, and it’s a time to rejoice at your year-long Steam stats.</p>



<p>Ever wondered how many games you’ve bought in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-deals-holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> sales? How many hours have you spent in front of your monitor or Steam Deck? Well, Steam Replay 2025 wraps up all of this information into one handy showcase for you.</p>







<h2 id="h-steam-replay-2025-expected-release-date">Steam Replay 2025 Expected Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Steam</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>History suggests the 2025 Steam Replay will release on Thursday, December 18, as this lines up with the last couple of iterations of Steam’s Wrapped.</strong></p>



<p>If you ignore the slight outlier of Steam Replay 2022—made available to all users on December 26—and consider the last two incarnations, the proof is pretty much in the pudding present.</p>







<p>Steam Replay 2023 came out on Monday, December 18, and the year after, the 2024 replay was on Wednesday, December 18. You can see where Insider Gaming is going with this, but logic dictates that the date is the same for the last two years, so why would Steam break a winning habit?</p>



<p>Unless something weird happens or Steam has a Half-Life-sized facility meltdown, Thursday, December 18, seems like a reasonable assumption. Keep checking back on the day to see when Steam Replay 2025 is out.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-steam-wrapped-2025-stats">How To Check Steam Wrapped 2025 Stats</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Valve</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Steam Wrapped 2025 includes your games played, achievements unlocked, and more, and the way to access this is through clicking a simple link and logging in.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s what you’ll probably need to do once it’s out:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to Steam’s website.</li>



<li>Log in to your account you want to see the stats for.</li>



<li>Click on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/replay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Replay link</a> (currently, it only shows 2024).</li>



<li>Look through your stats, and feel free to share them wherever!</li>
</ol>



<p>Checking out these Wrapped or Year in Review showcases can be daunting sometimes, so be prepared to see some numbers you didn’t expect. Then, you can do it all over again in 2026.</p>



<p>Once you have your Steam Replay 2025 breakdown, please share it with the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Official Discord Server</a>. It’s free to join, and it would be fun to see what everyone else has been doing.</p>

<p>Minecraft’s Mounts of Mayhem drop is live now, introducing new weapons, mounts, enemies, and more. </p>



<p>The developers of Minecraft have been churning out a lot of content for the game this year. We already received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-vibrant-visuals-happy-ghast-chase-the-skies-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vibrant Visuals and Happy Ghast</a> in June, and now, we are all set to receive Mounts of Mayhem, the next big content update for the title, which you can learn more about below.</p>







<h2 id="h-minecraft-s-mounts-of-mayhem-update-will-introduce-new-weapons-foes-mounts-and-underwater-exploration">Minecraft’s Mounts of Mayhem Update Will Introduce New Weapons, Foes, Mounts, and Underwater Exploration </h2>

<h4 id="h-mounts-of-mayhem-weapons">Mounts of Mayhem Weapons</h4>



<p>Starting with the weapons, Minecraft’s Mounts of Mayhem update will add a spear, which is excellent for both hand-to-hand and mounted combat. The weapon’s damage can scale based on the speed of the player. Lunge Enchantment is a new enchantment unique to the spear, which gives players a burst of speed with the jab attack. Moreover, the higher the enchantment level, the farther the player will be able to travel with their attack. </p>



<h4 id="h-zombie-mounts-and-enemies">Zombie Mounts and Enemies</h4>



<p>Then we come to Zombie Mounts, which are not only enemy mobs, but can be tamed to be your own mounts. Zombie Horses are the first; they are passive mobs, but are ridden by spear-wielding zombies. Get rid of them, and the mount is yours. Then we have the Zombie Nautilus, an underwater mob ridden by a trident-wielding drowned. Players will have to tame it by unseating the ride and tempting it with a pufferfish. </p>



<p>The next enemy mob in Minecraft’s Mounts of Mayhem update is Camel Husks. These are passive mobs, but are spawned with two riders, one with a spear and the other with a bow. What’s more, these mobs are immune to sunlight and will provide a daytime challenge to the player. </p>



<p>Lastly, Mounts of Mayhem will allow players to explore the underwater world of Minecraft in the best way possible. There are three types of mounts: the nautilus, zombie nautilus, and coral zombie nautilus. Each of them can be ridden and provides a speed boost while preserving the player’s existing air supply. </p>
