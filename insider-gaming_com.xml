<p>The Outer Worlds 2 has received a new trailer from Obsidian, which debuted tonight at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>In the trailer, and in true Outer Worlds fashion, the narrator makes plenty of quips, including a neat reference to Fallout: New Vegas basically being Fallout 3: Part 2.</p>



<p>The trailer doesn’t reveal a release date but offers a reiteration that The Outer Worlds 2 is dropping in 2025. It also gives us a nice preview of what’s to come in terms of the scope of the game.</p>



<p>Check out the new trailer below.</p>

<p>The Outer Worlds 2 promises to be much bigger, broader, and more ambitious than the first game, which was released in 2019. The sequel is long overdue, but the wait seems like it will have been worthwhile by the time the game is released next year.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The Outer Worlds (2019) is a solid Obsidian RPG, and it was dubbed ‘Fallout: New Vegas in space’ by many. It offers plenty of freedom, a branching narrative, and the ability to go anywhere and do whatever you like, often with hilarious and chaotic results. </p>

<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is a standalone game that acts as a spin-off to the original Elden Ring as opposed to a sequel. The game lets players play with up to two other players on a smaller map based on the Limgrave region of the Elden Ring map. Each enemy will be randomized at the beginning of your playthrough.</p>

<p>CD Projekt has given Witcher fans everywhere their first look at The Witcher 4 in the form of an all-new trailer. The footage was dropped today during The Game Awards in Los Angeles, sending fans of the open-world fantasy series giddy with excitement.</p>



<p>Recently, it was suggested by the CD Projekt team that The Witcher 4 will be released before the end of 2027. It has been almost a decade since the last brand-new Witcher game, so it’s nice to know that fans don’t have <strong>that much longer </strong>left to wait.</p>



<p>Check out the new trailer for The Witcher 4 below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-conjunction-time">Conjunction Time</h2>



<p>The Witcher has gone from strength to strength in the last decade or so. From a multi-award-winning game in The Wild Hunt to a successful live-action adaptation, The Witcher has won over millions of fans worldwide. It has been a boon for CDPR, and even today, it’s at the top of many gamers’ top titles lists.</p>



<p>The Witcher 4 first surfaced as ‘Polaris’, one of the many codenames that CD Projekt divulged during a series of company updates a year or two ago. It was revealed first in 2022, but since then, almost nothing has been said about the game.</p>



<p>That was, until a while ago when Doug Cockle, the iconic voice actor behind The Witcher’s Geralt of Rivia, dropped a tasty tidbit of information that earned him a slapped wrist from CDPR. The actor said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/geralt-va-got-slapped-by-cdpr-for-witcher-4-comment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geralt is in The Witcher 4</a> but he’s not the main character – and that was enough to set the community ablaze.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer that debuted today at The Game Awards:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The trailer showcases a dark and mysterious title with Ciri at the forefront, which is what people fully expected following the end of Blood and Wine, the final DLC for 2015’s The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p>



<p>In the trailer, we see new elemental attacks, a new terrifying creature, and Ciri’s full abilities as a Witcher realised.</p>



<p>What do you think about The Witcher 4? Do you think anything can top 2015’s Wild Hunt? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
