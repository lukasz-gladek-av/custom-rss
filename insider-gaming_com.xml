<p>Fortnite revealed the return of the Double Pump for OG Chapter 1 Season 1 in a unique way this time. Before officially confirming on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1860006119420174525" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the official Fortnite Twitch account took the chats of certain popular streamers to make the reveal. Streamers like <a href="https://x.com/DrLupo/status/1860003558051184758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dr Lupo</a>, <a href="https://x.com/sparkles_qt/status/1860001598971478132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">100T Sparkles_qt</a> and more saw Fortnite enter their chat to state, “hey, chat…double pump returning December 6 with OG chapter 1 season 1, btw”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the announcement of Double Pump’s return to Fortnite, fans have started speculating what else could return along with OG Chapter 1 Season 1.
