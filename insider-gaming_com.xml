<p>GDKP runs are still banned in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/world-of-warcraft/" id="830">World of Warcraft,</a> even if the player base thinks it’s a ridiculous and ineffective ban.</p>



<p>GDKP (Gold Dragon Kill Points) are types of raids in WoW that allow players to bid on loot after boss battles, and even though the highest bidder wins, the gold earned from the bids is then put into a pot and split amongst all players.</p>



<h2 id="h-world-of-warcraft-players-want-gdkp-unbanned">World of Warcraft Players Want GDKP Unbanned</h2>



<p><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/in-game-advertising-services-channel-in-burning-crusade-classic-anniversary/2238861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blizzard </a>recently issued a statement on their forums, noting that the policy around GDKP runs has not changed in anniversary Realms in either North America or the EU. However, the statement also claims that players are not restricted from buying or selling game services for in-game, but boosting communities are not permitted.</p>



<p>For the most part, comments on the post suggest that the ban doesn’t actually work, with one user commenting, “Continuing to deny GDKP on Anniversary realms while refusing to admit that the economy is absolutely horrible and the ban has not given the results you claimed it would.”</p>



<p>Then, of course, there are the people who are extra intense about the news, such as one user saying, “Absolutely moronic. Give us back GDKP. Everyone who takes this game semi-seriously wants it back… Give us back GDKP or people will quit!” </p>



<p>Blizzard does remain steadfast in their decision, however. </p>

<p>The team behind Omelet You Cook, a cooking roguelike, is worried about the release of Slay the Spire 2, which could take away all the buzz the game could have.</p>



<p>Roguelike games are plentiful in 2026, but Slay the Spire arguably stands head and shoulders above the rest in the genre. Omelet You Cook, published by SchuBox Games, offers a unique take on the genre and is currently available on Steam Early Access. However, it’s scheduled to leave early access on February 8, giving the game only one month before Slay the Spire’s long-awaited sequel comes out and dominates the roguelike discussion.</p>

<p>In September 2025, Mega Crit announced that the sequel to the massively popular 2019 roguelike deck builder would be hitting Early Access in March, following a delay. </p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/slay-the-spire-2-pulls-a-silksong-scares-indie-devs-into-releasing-roguelike-ahead-of-schedule-in-fear-of-losing-players-to-an-absolute-juggernaut-in-our-own-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+, </a>Dan Schumacher noted that they originally assumed they would not have to compete with the massive title because they believed it was still set to release in late 2025. </p>



<p>However, as it turns out, they missed the delay announcement. Schumacher even joked that he won’t have time to finish his own game because he’ll be too busy playing that</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There was no way we could release at the same time as an absolute juggernaut in our own genre,” he says.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He encourages audiences to be kind to the title as it leaves early access in February, noting that it’s a big jump, but they want the chance to have a wider audience play the game.</p>







<p>You can pick up Omelet You Cook right now on Steam and Early Access for $15. There’s a free demo, as well.</p>
