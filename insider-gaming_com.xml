<p>The remainder of Phoenix Labs developers have been laid off, with the studios game ‘Dauntless’ and it’s studio likely to close.</p>



<p>Speaking with now past-employee’s at the studio, it’s understood that around 50 employees have been made redundant today. Several of those employee’s now believe that the Dauntless game is now dead, and that Phoenix Labs is likely to shut down, although Parent company Forte has yet to make such an announcement.</p>



<p>According to those familiar with the situation, no one at Phoenix Labs still has a job with one person saying it was “surprising” that it was announced as round of layoffs instead of a studio closure.</p>



<p>Forte, a blockchain company, acquired Phoenix Labs around summer 2023 and in May 2024 made more than 100 of its staff redundant. Forte was asked to comment, but did not supply one in time ahead of publication. </p>



<p>Following the internal announcement, Phoenix Labs staff took to their Dauntless Discord server to make the announcement of redundancies, where it was said that “Earlier today, the majority of our development team was impacted by significant reductions at Phoenix Labs. This has been a heartbreaking decision for us, and we are deeply saddened for the talented individuals who are affected.”</p>



<p>The statement continued, “We know you may have questions about what this means for Dauntless and its future. While we don’t have all the answers at this time, we are committed to keeping you informed and will share updates as soon as we can.”</p>



<p>“Your support means the world to us, and we are truly grateful for this incredible community. Thank you for standing with us during this challenging time,” it concluded.</p>



<p>Phoenix Labs was founded in April 2014 and is best known for Fae Farm and Dauntless, with the company also having had multiple games in development before being cancelled by Forte after the studios acquisition. </p>



<p>The latest rounds of layoffs put 2025’s count well over&nbsp;<a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">500 known jobs lost</a>, with estimates having it over 700.

<p>Intel is one of the largest computer technology companies in the world. When it comes to consumer CPUs, it’s often in a neck-and-neck battle with competitor AMD for the processor market. </p>



<p>Because of that, Intel’s earnings reports are closely watched by investors, analysts, and consumers alike. That makes it important to know when the next one is, what time it starts, and how you can listen to it live. These quarterly updates provide insights into a company’s financial health, performance across key divisions, and general outlooks for the months ahead. </p>



<p>What is the health of Intel’s business? What are investors looking for in terms of revenue? Are there any concerns or roadblocks in various sectors? All that gets answered with each call.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-intel-earnings-report-date">When Is The Next Intel Earnings Report Date?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/intel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intel</a> is currently scheduled to deliver its fourth quarter (Q4) earnings for fiscal year (FY) 2024 on Thursday, January 30.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some companies run an April-March fiscal year, Intel’s fiscal year goes from January to December, and ends on the last Saturday of the month. That means its fiscal year ended on Saturday, December 28th. The company’s quarters are structured as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Q1: January – March</li>



<li>Q2: April – June</li>



<li>Q3: July – September</li>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-next-intel-earnings-report-start-time">Next Intel Earnings Report Start Time</h2>



<p>The next Intel earnings report is scheduled to start after trading closes for the day at 5PM ET/2PM PT on January 30, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-listen-to-intel-s-earnings-report">How To Listen To Intel’s Earnings Report?</h2>



<p>If you want to listen to Intel’s quarterly earnings report—or just look over the numbers—you can do so via the company’s website. Simply do the following:</p>

<li>Then select “Financial Results”</li>



<li>This will take you to a page with recent earnings calls, presentations, infographics, remarks, and more.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you want more than just the most recent earnings call and data, the “Financial Results” page will have a catalog of the reports from past years, going back—as of writing—as far as 2002.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-intel">What To Expect From Intel</h2>



<p>When Intel releases its latest earnings, it will provide a number of updates on the state of the overall business. Details such as where things stand with its restructuring efforts, early returns from the release of its new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-core-ultra-9-285k-review-a-new-era-for-efficiency-but-is-it-right-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Core Ultra S CPUs</a>, the launch of its Intel Arc <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/intel-battlemage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlemage graphics cards</a>, its growth in the AI space, and more will be discussed.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-intel-earnings-report">The Last Intel Earnings Report</h2>



<p>When Intel announced its earnings for Q3 FY2024, it announced that it’s year-over-year net revenue fell by 6.17% to $13.28 billion from $14.16 billion. Intel said that the decline in revenue was due to restructuring costs after laying off 15% of its global workforce along with more investments into different areas of research and development.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-company-earnings-calls">What Are Company Earnings Calls?</h2>



<p>Quarterly earnings calls are meetings held publicly traded companies to provide updates on their overall financial performance. Typically, these calls are open to shareholders, analysts, and media to call in and ask questions. The public, regardless if they’re a shareholder or not, is also able to listen to these calls live as they happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the calls themselves, companies will often put out a press release and presentation with important details included ahead of the call taking place. This allows investors, analysts, and media to prepare coverage or questions based on the information provided.</p>
