<p>Activision has finally given a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remake the green light and a release date. It looks to follow in the footsteps of the previous remake and deliver an old-school kickflipping good time for fans old and new.</p>



<p>Many hearts (and skateboards) broke when a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remake was canceled. It seemed a bizarre call given the lauded nature of the 1 + 2 Remake. But the legendary <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-continues-to-tease-future-pro-skater-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk</a> himself created buzz back in September 2024. February 2025 came and went, and a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-remaster-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Remake</a> was suddenly a real possibility.</p>



<p>Rumors became reality, and we no longer had to ruminate as a new remake is confirmed.</p>
