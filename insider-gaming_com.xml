<p>The next game from the developers of It Takes Two is set to be unveiled soon with a release date just a few months after. According to known data minter <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-la-date-de-sortie-de-split-fiction-le-nouveau-jeu-video-a-venir-des-studios-hazelight-59733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, Hazelight Studios is preparing to announce its new game called Split Fiction.</p>



<p>Split Fiction will release on March 6, 2025, and will be available on PC and consoles. The specific consoles are currently unknown.</p>



<p>As far as an announcement of the game, the report says that its expected to happen this month. The likely place would be during The Game Awards on December 12. Why The Game Awards for the reveal? As billbil-kun pointed out, studio founder Josef Fares has made a history of announcing his games at the annual show.</p>







<p>“Josef Fares is a regular at this ceremony since he has reserved the announcements of his previous titles, such as&nbsp;A Way Out&nbsp;or&nbsp;It Takes Two, in past editions,” they said.</p>



<p>No other details about what Split Faction is were revealed, but those questions should be answered when the game is official revealed this month. Based on the name and the studio’s history, however, it could be assumed that Split Faction will be another co-op game</p>



<p>What do you think Hazelight Studios’ Split Faction will be about? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, Sony faced a new competitor to its PlayStation business when Microsoft launched the original Xbox. With that new competition sparked a genuine concern from Sony that led to them getting exclusive release rights to the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) games of the era for the PlayStation 2.</p>



<p>Chris Deering, the former president of PlayStation Europe, recently spoke to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/stories-from-30-years-of-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz,</a> and shed some light as to why  PlayStation wanted an exclusive agreement for GTA 3, GTA: Vice City, and GTA: San Andreas.</p>



<p>“We were worried when we saw Xbox coming,” Deering said. “We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields, like Sky TV with sports. Just as Christmas was approaching when Xbox would launch, a few of us went out to our favourite third-party publishers and developers, and we asked them, ‘How would you like a special deal if you keep your next generation game on PlayStation exclusive for a two-year period?’ And one of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn’t clear that Grand Theft Auto 3 was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top down game.”</p>



<p>Deering added that PlayStation was “lucky” with the deal because of how it paid off for the company. </p>



<p>“It was very lucky for us,” he said. “And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid.”</p>







<p>The games ultimately saw a release on Xbox, but not before they became the best-selling games in the history of PS2. San Andreas became the best-selling PS2 game ever while the other two games, Vice City and GTA 3, became the third- and fifth-best selling games.</p>



<p>GTA 3 and Vice City released on Xbox on November 4, 2003 while San Andreas came to Xbox in June 2005.</p>
