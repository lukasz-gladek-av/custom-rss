<p>In a fresh report from NewZoo, it has been confirmed that ARC Raiders skyrocketed within just two days on the market, beating many of the world’s most capable and impactful games in October’s revenue charts. The data revealed that ARC Raiders secured the seventh spot in the charts in October, despite being released on October 30.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders has proven to be one of the most transformative games ever released, taking over the extraction shooter genre and retaining an enormous player base almost a month after release.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-on-top-almost">ARC Raiders On Top (Almost)</h2>



<p>In an all-new October revenue report from NewZoo, it was documented that ARC Raiders hit the seventh spot in the charts despite being on the shelves for just two days in October.</p>



<p>It effortlessly walked over some of the biggest games in the business:</p>



<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>VALORANT</li>



<li>ROBLOX</li>



<li>World of Warcraft</li>



<li>Marvel Rivals</li>
</ul>



<p>The stunning achievement sat ARC Raiders behind the likes of NBA 2K26, Fortnite, Ghost of Yotei, and Battlefield 6, all of which is/were to be expected.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders continues to stun gamers worldwide, and everyone from diehard extraction shooter fans to those totally new to the concept is getting on board. Recently, a streamer-backed initiative saw some of the biggest creators in the space take part in an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-war-bungulators-arc-battle/">unofficial ‘war’</a> that pulled unprecedented audiences into some streamers’ chats.</p>



<p>There’s a hefty roadmap in store for ARC Raiders, and Embark Studios, the game’s stellar creator, has vowed to support the title for years to come. The next major update will be <strong>Cold Snap</strong>, coming in December 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a data mine from the Invincible VS Closed Alpha, a controversial character is set to join the roster. Furthermore, it seems the character may be the next one announced.</p>







<p>Based on the comic series and animated show, Invincible is a more bloody version of superheroes. Think <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-boys-operators-for-call-of-duty-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Boys</a>, but more on the mature and dramatic side. The Prime Video show has been going strong for three seasons, with the fourth coming in March 2026. Many game adaptations <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skybound-games-announces-new-invincible-universe-game-within-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been made</a>, but Invincible VS gives the fans what they’ve wanted: a good old-fashioned fighting game. </p>



<p>Announced earlier this year, the game, which comes from former Killer Instinct developers, looks to be the ultimate Invincible experience, down to the show’s all-star cast (like The Walking Dead’s Steven Yeun and Whiplash’s JK Simmons) returning. Now, it seems a new character has been prematurely revealed, and it’s one that comic book fans will be taken aback by.</p>

<p>The news comes from Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p53a5b/invincible_vs_closed_alpha_test_accidentally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RIPMrMufasi</a>, who posted on /GamingLeaksandRumours about the Invincible VS Closed Alpha. The test, which started on November 21st, has been going fairly well. As was the case with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-demo-data-mine-heroes-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, it doesn’t stop fans from doing a data mine into the files and seeing if anything unannounced is in it. As expected, there was indeed something: <strong>a character available through a model swap bug</strong>, seen in the video <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/bada-bing-VLST6Nh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>



<p>According to the video from the Invincible VS data mine, <strong>the character looks to be Anissa</strong>. In the show, the Viltrumite warrior is played by Shantel VanSanten (One Tree Hill, The Boys). The character, seen as an antagonist in the show, is <strong>a rather controversial choice</strong>. While not adapted into the show yet, an inappropriate moment in the comics between her and Mark, the protagonist, has made many worried about her inclusion. </p>



<p>As of now, the character has not been confirmed by Skybound Games or Quarter Up, so <strong>take it with a grain of salt</strong>. For fans of the show, the character is a welcome addition to the roster. However, to fans of the comics, it’s one that may stir up some controversy. Either way, if true, it won’t be long until it’s official.</p>







<p>What do you think of Anissa possibly being added to Invincible VS’ roster? Think it’s a controversial pick? Will it become a problem soon? Which Invincible character would you like to see in the game?

<p>Udo Kier has starred in well over 200 films, starting in 1966 on the TV show Road to Saint Tropez. His frequent collaborations with iconic artist Andy Warhol and the vampire film genre made him a familiar face for fans. In the 90s, Kier appeared in films like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Blade, and Johnny Mnemonic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He’s appeared in several video game adaptations like Far Cry and BloodRayne. However, he’s also shown up in games over the span of his career. Often military, Udo Kier played the role of Yuri in Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2 and Yuri’s Revenge. Furthermore, he played Dr. Peter Staub in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-call-of-duty-wwii-available-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: WWII</a> and Erich in Martha is Dead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the actor’s future projects is OD, Hideo Kojima’s next big horror project for Kojima Productions. Unfortunately, it seems Udo Kier did not finish filming for the project, as Kojima <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1992785286712209409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweeted about his passing</a>, saying filming was set to start next Spring. The actor was announced alongside Hunter Schafer and Sophia Lillis at the 2023 Game Awards. A teaser for the Xbox Game Studios’ title was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/od-gameplay-reveal-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed earlier this year</a>. It’s unknown if the actor will be recast or scrapped from the project at this time.</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to his family and his partner during this difficult time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[FaZe Clan Fans Aren’t Happy With New Rollbit Jersey]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-faze-jersey-rollbit-partnership-fans-angry/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/faze-clan-fans-aren%E2%80%99t-happy-with-new-rollbit-jersey.1362373/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Earlier today, FaZe Clan unveiled its 2026 esports jersey, and fans were immediately displeased by the excessive ‘Rollbit’ branding that was slapped on the front and shoulder of it. In recent weeks, the heavy marketing push that Rollbit has been making into streaming and content creation has left fans and viewers dismayed at some, but no matter what, the bags keep flowing.</p>



<p>The jersey would look fantastic, some argue, if the sponsorship branding were either toned back or removed entirely, but that’s not going to happen.</p>







<h2 id="h-faze-clan-s-new-rollbit-jersey-sparks-outcry">FaZe Clan’s New Rollbit Jersey Sparks Outcry</h2>



<p>On social media, FaZe Clan uncovered the jersey that the pro teams under the banner will be sporting for the next year of competition. Fans were quick to point out that once prestigious sponsorships like Nissan and G-Fuel have long been removed, and in their place sits a glaring ROLLBIT sponsorship.</p>



<p>The jersey, which is a nice black and red digital camo design, has come under intense criticism by fans, commenting that the FaZe logo is ‘smaller than the Rollbit branding’.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Rollbit has been the cause of some inflammation across the esports and streaming industries of late, offering immense bags to high-ranking streamers to host gambling streams, some of which have thrown entire fanbases into question. Now, that influence is being felt in esports via sponsorships like this.</p>



<p>In one comment, a user wrote a damning review:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With the gambling sponsor being larger than the team logo and in several places I highly doubt many will sell. Glad I got mine a few years ago when it looked like a team jersey (with) a few sponsors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another wrote, ‘I thought this was FaZe, not Team Rollbit.’</p>



<p>Other fans were less critical and stressed that the jersey is ‘fire’, while some tried to field some suggestions:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Idk how i feel bout that big rollbit logo in the middle of it if you left that off and just kept it with the red and black design continuing on the front it’d be clean</p>
</blockquote>
