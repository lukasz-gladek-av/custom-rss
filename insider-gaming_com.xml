<p>Dr Disrespect still hasn’t clawed his way back into the good graces of gamers worldwide and probably never will. Regardless, he’s still trying to retain some semblance of a streaming career across <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-relocation-rumble-youtube-stream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rumble</a> and YouTube, and recently, he secured monetisation again on YouTube several months after losing it in the face of ‘minor messaging’ allegations.</p>



<p>During a recent live stream, Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm levelled some accusations at Midnight Society, the studio that he fronted until last June when things turned awry for him. In his words, ‘I can say all this s*** now.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-don-t-get-me-started-with-that-guy">‘Don’t Get Me Started With That Guy’</h2>



<p>Last summer, Dr Disrespect found himself embroiled in (another) controversy, this one concerning events that occurred in 2017. It was alleged that the supersized streamer had used Twitch’s ‘Whisper’ mechanic to inappropriately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-allegations-twitch-ban/">message a minor</a>, which the creator copped to shortly after – in a way.</p>



<p>That prompted him to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-loses-followers-allegations/">lose tens of thousands of followers</a>, be dropped by sponsors, and get cut out by fellow streamers.</p>



<p>Fast-forward several months, and Midnight Society, the studio that Dr Disrespect was a prolific part of until the allegations surfaced, is closing down. For a couple of years, Dr Disrespect provided a massive marketing pull, getting players around the world to invest in ‘DEADROP’, an NFT-backed extraction shooter that will now never see the light of day.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, Dr Disrespect went in against Midnight Society:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was handled extremely poorly by leadership.</p>



<p>It’s unfortunate.</p>



<p>That tweet that weekend, it should have never gone out. It was never approved by me. They say, ‘after fully investigating’, whatever — they didn’t investigate nothing.</p>



<p>I can say all this s*** now.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>Then, the creator fired shots at Robert Bowling, the former Call of Duty dev who co-founded Midnight Society:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Don’t get me f***ing started with that guy.</p>



<p>Don’t get me started with that guy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Recently, data showed that while Dr Disrespect’s airtime has gone up, his viewership and peak counts are dropping rapidly, suggesting that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-first-stream-back/">there’s no comeback in store</a> for the disgraced creator.</p>



<p>Are you still watching Dr Disrespect and are brave enough to admit it? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Battlefield Portal, which was first introduced into Battlefield 2042 will be returning to the next title, DICE has confirmed.</p>



<p>The news came via the YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOih6h3VeTE&amp;ab_channel=Flakfire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Flakfire</a>, who had an early online presentation of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> reveal last week. In Flakfire’s latest video, he said that the developers confirmed the return of Portal, a gamemode which introduces classic maps, weapons, and more into the latest game.</p>



<p>“We had surprising confirming in the briefing that Portal will be making a return with the next Battlefield title,” he said. </p>



<p>“Portal could be one of those slices tested under the Battlefield Labs program,” he theorised. </p>



<p>Battlefield Labs is essentially a Community Test Environment, where players can give feedback of specific features in the next Battlefield game and presumably, future DLC, too.</p>



<p>Flakfire pointed out earlier in the video that those who sign up to the Battlefield Labs program will be under an NDA, whcih presumably will still not stop people from sharing footage and information.</p>

<p>While we currently don’t have the name for the next Battlefield title (unless it’s just Battlefield), it has been confirmed that the game will be for current-generation consoles only, meaning it will release on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. According to EA, the game will release later this year.</p>



<p>What remains to be seen is the announcement of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Battle Royale</a>, which has been in development at Ripple Effect for the past couple of years and was exclusively reported on by Insider Gaming in early 2024.</p>
