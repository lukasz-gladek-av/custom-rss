<p>As it does every year, The Game Awards made some huge announcements during the 2025 edition. Geoff Keighley stood there and rifled off some big trailers, game reveals, and Insider Gaming has picked out six headline moments.</p>



<p>The annual end-of-year celebration of all things gaming is in the books once more. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> presented nearly 30 awards and showcased many game reveals, new trailers, and much more. Throughout the course of the nearly four-hour show, some segments happened that are sure to live long in the memory.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-the-game-awards-2025-announcements-amp-game-reveals">Best The Game Awards 2025 Announcements &amp; Game Reveals</h2>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Fate Of The Old Republic</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Arcanaut Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Who saw this one coming? The Star Wars community has spent years waiting impatiently for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/old-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-images-appear-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a>. Reports have gone back and forth on whether the remake is happening, but what everyone does know is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-shockingly-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is in development</a>. It’s a spiritual successor to KOTOR and promises to capture the essence and magic of why KOTOR is so popular.</p>







<p>The bad news is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-years-away-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is likely years away from release</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-divinity">Divinity</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Larian Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Larian Studios was quite cunning in the lead-up to TGA 2025. The company proclaimed that there were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-plans-for-divinity-original-sin-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no current plans for Divinity: Original Sin 3</a>. Evidently, this was the case. This didn’t stop the developer from solving the frustrating mystery of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-statue-mystery-possibly-solved-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards Statue</a> by announcing Divinity—a new entry in the franchise.</p>



<p>Despite Baldur’s Gate 3’s success, Larian is shifting gears back to the series that launched the company to success. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-3-announcement-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Divinity announcement</a> certainly was a bombshell.</p>



<h3 id="h-resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Plenty of Resident Evil Requiem has been seen already. The game isn’t a secret, and its release date is getting ever closer. So why does it make this list? Confirmation was finally revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-the-game-awards-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon Kennedy</a> is one of the two playable characters. Alyssa Ashcroft will handle the survival-horror and puzzle-based sections of gameplay, whereas Leon is an ass-kicking machine.</p>



<p>Over 20 years after we first saw Leon being chased by chainsaw-wielding freaks, it’s fitting that the former RPD officer now gets his own eviscerating machine.</p>



<h3 id="h-control-2-resonant">Control 2: Resonant</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Control 2 has been a constant rumor with even more constant buzz, and TGA 2025 finally revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-resonant-confirmed-the-game-awards-remedy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Control: Resonant</a>. Original protagonist Jesse Faden looks to be taking a backseat in Resonant as a new character gets to experience the usual mind-bending chaos associated with the FBC. It looks just as trippy and psychologically challenging as the first title, and Remedy has a certain penchant for infusing the weird with the wondrous.</p>



<h3 id="h-tomb-raider">Tomb Raider</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Crystal Dynamics</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s always a shame when something leaks ahead of time (the irony is not lost here), and news came out before The Game Awards 2025 that two new Tomb Raider games were about to be unveiled. In a shock to no one, this is what happened. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Tomb Raider Remake</a> of the first TR game was shown, and we also got wind of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-catalyst-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>—a completely brand-new entry in the franchise. There has been nothing on the Lara gaming front since 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and now she’s pulling double-duty!</p>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-galactic-racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Fuse Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Galactic Racer was revealed at The Game Awards</a>, and the world felt like a better place. Racing games aren’t as frequent and in abundance as they once were, and you’ll have to dust off the cobwebs to find the last Star Wars racing game. Galactic Racer is being made by Fuse Games—comprised of devs who’ve worked on Burnout and Need for Speed games—and this should give everyone…A New Hope.</p>

<p>One of the bigger announcements of this year’s The Game Awards was the reveal of a brand-new single-player Star Wars game called Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic. And while the hype surrounding the new game was understandably strong, a release date for Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is likely still many years away.</p>



<p>In a new interview at <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">StarWars.com</a>, it was confirmed that the studio working on the game, Arcanaut Studios, was formed in 2025. </p>







<p>That was followed up with a post on Bluesky on Friday by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, who says that a release date of 2030 could be an “optimistic guess” for the game. It’s important to note, however, that this is his guess and not an official report on it. </p>



<p>As far as why a game would be announced so early on in development, it’s often done as a way to show progress ahead of mass hiring. With tangible proof of the game progressing, it makes hiring an easier task for many development studios. </p>

<p>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is a single-player player narrative action RPG. It’s also not a direct sequel or continuation of the story. The game is being led by Casey Hudson, the director of the original Knights of the Old Republic and the Mass Effect trilogy.</p>







<p><strong>“Blending innovative storytelling, memorable characters, and heart-pounding combat,&nbsp;Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic&nbsp;will immerse you in an unforgettable experience where every decision deepens your journey toward the light…or the darkness,” </strong>Arcanaut said. </p>



<p>The game is still <strong>“in the early stages of development and creation</strong>” and more details on the game will come at a later date.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When Is Deadpool Coming To Marvel Rivals? Deadpool Release Period & Voice Actor, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-release-date-voice-actor/</link>
            <guid>1382101</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Deadpool is bringing his outlandish brand of violence and very quick one-liners to break down the walls in Marvel Rivals—primarily the fourth one. If you’re looking forward to using Wade Wilson in Marvel Rivals, the Deadpool release period is needed, as is the lore on the likely voice actor.</p>



<p>You’ll be hard-pressed to find many people who dislike Ryan Reynolds’ portrayal of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deadpool-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool</a>. It’s the definition of someone being born to play a role. It’s time to step away from the MCU version of Deadpool and bring Wade to Marvel Rivals to walk alongside some of the universe’s biggest names and faces.</p>



<p>The Game Awards 2025 delivered the Deadpool reveal for Marvel Rivals fans, and there’s more to Deadpool’s arrival than initially meets the eye.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-deadpool-coming-to-marvel-rivals">When Is Deadpool Coming To Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We see you. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Deadpool will debut in Marvel Rivals “Soon,” according to the game’s official social media, and Wade will likely be a big-time character addition during Season 6, when it starts in January 2026.</strong></p>







<p>NetEase likes to keep everyone waiting, unfortunately. Delays can always impact live-service games, which is why some companies are reluctant to slap exact dates on content. But the Game Awards 2025 trailer showing off Deadpool had the hero posing next to the Season 6 start date—<strong>January 16</strong>.</p>



<p>This does mean this is the earliest Deadpool will arrive. It’s more than likely that Wade Wilson becomes available halfway through the season, so you can likely look forward to using Deadpool around early to mid-February.</p>

<h2 id="h-who-voices-deadpool-in-marvel-rivals">Who Voices Deadpool In Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A few have donned the mask. Image via Marvel</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s unconfirmed, but the internet has suggested Alejandro Saab is the voice behind Deadpool, although the actor is trying to distance themself from the notion.</strong></p>



<p>It’s an interesting one, as so far, Saab has indicated to fans that he is <em>not </em>the voice. When Deadpool’s segment appeared during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>, there was immediate speculation that it was Alejandro Saab.</p>



<p>The voice actor posted a sus emoji on X of a mouth with its lips zipped up, and followed this up with an interesting message: “I meant it as it’s not me, guys.”</p>



<p>Needless to say, the community isn’t having it. The voice very much has a Saab flair to it, and the denial is what many voice actors do to deflect and shy away from the fact that something is official until they can talk about it.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We’ll have to wait and see if it is Alejandro Saab. The actor has been slaying it for years with roles in Borderlands 4, Date Everything, Zenless Zone Zero, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, and hundreds of other roles across TV, anime, and gaming.</p>



<p>Who do you think is the voice actor for Marvel Rivals’ Deadpool? Are you hoping the assassin arrives sooner rather than later?
