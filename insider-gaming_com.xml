<p>If you have been waiting to play Cities: Skylines 2 until it launches on console, you’re going to be waiting a bit longer. In an update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/4486243201365051600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released on Steam</a>, the game’s developer Colossal Order says that it still doesn’t have an update on a release date for the console version of the game on Xbox Series and PlayStation 5. </p>



<p>In its latest message to players, the developer says that while the game’s console release continues to be a “top priority”, its delay continues to be due to “hardware limitations” of the consoles themselves.</p>



<p>“Currently, we are experiencing both simulation issues (CPU) and graphics issues (GPU) which become noticeable when players take certain actions that cause frame rate drops or memory overload,” they said. “These issues are particularly challenging due to the hardware limitations of consoles.”</p>



<p>They then continued with an example of one issue consoles pose, saying, “When placing larger buildings that involve numerous entities, the system struggles to handle the data load. During the calculation process (e.g., checking if there’s enough space or if any entities overlap with existing assets), performance bottlenecks arise, resulting in these noticeable issues.”</p>



<p>The studio says they’ve gotten the game to a “playable state” by lowering the overall graphics quality “significantly”, but it brings it to a level of compromise that they “are not willing to make”.</p>



<p>“Once we get it to an acceptable level, further optimizations are needed for both simulation and memory usage before we are ready to share the console version,” they said. “Until they are resolved, we cannot provide a release estimate to avoid it being premature and potentially misleading. The console release remains a top priority for us, we have multiple solutions being explored with experts actively involved, and we’re working hard to bring you the console version of Cities: Skylines II.”</p>



<p>Cities: Skylines 2 was originally supposed to release on console alongside the game’s PC release over a year ago. Instead, it has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-console-release-delayed-pc-still-on-target/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been met with multiple delays</a>.</p>
