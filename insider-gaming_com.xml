<p>The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake is coming sooner than some might think.</p>



<p>As first mentioned on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQeluxqHMIE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest episode</a> of Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast, Insider Gaming has learned when the remake of the 2003 action-adventure game is set to release.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson has regularly reported that Ubisoft’s plans called for the Prince of Persia remake to release prior to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake</a>. And, as of publish, that remains the case.</p>



<p>According to sources close to the game, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake is <strong>scheduled to release in mid-January 2026</strong>. In addition to the release plan, sources believe it’s likely that the next look at the game will come at The Game Awards on December 11, 2025. That’s always where the official date could be revealed.</p>



<p>First announced back in 2020, the Sands of Time Remake has had an up and down development cycle. It was originally scheduled to release in January 2021 but was delayed to March 2021 in December 2020. A month before its March release, the game was delayed again to an unspecified date.</p>



<p>After that, Ubisoft went silent for a while until it was announced that development was being moved to Ubisoft Montreal in May 2022. When Ubisoft Montreal took over, development on the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was completely restarted</a>. The restart included a more ““realistic approach” to the game, including a graphical overall, new animations, and new mechanics for both combat and parkour. </p>







<p>Another two years later, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-toronto-joins-development-on-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Toronto had joined</a> the development and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-remade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the game was planned</a> for a 2026 release.</p>
