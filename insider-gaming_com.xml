            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Logitech POWERPLAY 2 is such a practical device and perfectly does what it says on the tin that there’s not a hell of a lot to comment on. It’s marketed as a wireless charging system that allows you to constantly power certain wireless gaming mice on a surface that’s synonymous with Logitech’s premium mouse pads. </p>



<p>And guess what? That’s exactly what it <strong>is </strong>and what it <strong>does</strong>. Read on to scope out this full POWERPLAY 2 review to see if it’s the kind of thing you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-logitech-powerplay-2-worth-119">Is the Logitech POWERPLAY 2 Worth $119?</h2>



<p>As I wrote this review, the POWERPLAY 2 was retailing for $119.99, which might seem steep when you can buy a G240 ‘cloth gaming mouse pad’ from the company for just $7.99.</p>



<p>So, why is the POWERPLAY 2 more than 12 times the price of a regular mouse pad?</p>



<p>The POWERPLAY 2 has integrated charging systems woven into the mat, which means that when the mouse pad is <strong>powered</strong>, it effortlessly charges your wireless gaming mouse. It achieves this by fusing the regular mouse pad surface with an unbroken charging layer that invisibly powers the device in your hand and keeps it topped up.</p>



<p>At 34.4cm by 34cm, it’s a fairly sizeable square thing that takes up a decent amount of space on your desk, and at the top of the mouse pad sits the POWERPLAY 2 power unit, which has a handy heads-up light letting you know when your mouse is being actively charged.</p>



<p>You simply pop the POWERPLAY 2 down on your desk, connect it to a powered USB port (at least 2.0), and that’s about it. To use a compatible mouse, you’ll use the POWERPLAY 2 COIN that’s included in the box.</p>



<p>Fortunately, that range of compatible gaming mice is <strong>diverse</strong>, but it’s limited exclusively to Logitech devices:</p>



<ul>
<li>G309</li>



<li>G502 X Plus (my mouse)</li>



<li>G502 X LIGHTSPEED</li>



<li>G502</li>



<li>G703</li>



<li>G903</li>



<li>PRO X SUPERLIGHT 2</li>



<li>PRO X SUPERLIGHT 2 DEX</li>



<li>PRO X SUPERLIGHT</li>



<li>PRO 2 LIGHTSPEED</li>



<li>PRO Wireless</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a brilliant piece of technology, especially for someone who regularly forgets to charge their devices. I’ll never have that happen again, thanks to the Logitech POWERPLAY 2. That’s why I think it’s more than worth the money, but I can understand how it’ll be a deal-breaker for some, that it’s so expensive.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Logitech LITRA BEAM LX Review—Minor Stream Item, Major Impact]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/logitech-litra-beam-lx-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/logitech-litra-beam-lx-review%E2%80%94minor-stream-item-major-impact.1361695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I was looking for a new lighting solution for my stream, as my old Logitech Litra had seen better days after being in continuous use for many years. Little did I realize, Logitech had since released an overhauled version – the <strong>LITRA BEAM LX</strong>. It’s an evolution in every way, offering a sweeping bar with intense RGB on one side and an extremely capable key light on the other.</p>



<p>For a while, I’ve had the LITRA BEAM LX sitting front and centre in my setup, and not only does it look fantastic, but it’s also the most effective key light I’ve ever used. It’s not the <strong>cheapest </strong>solution, and it requires a mains connection as well as USB-C hook-up, but if you can accommodate it, it’s one of the best additions you’ll ever make to your stream or video setup.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-litra-beam-lx-worth-129">Is the LITRA BEAM LX Worth $129?</h2>



<p>The LITRA BEAM LX is a handy, practical, and attractive key light that has transformed my setup. The original LITRA was a single ‘panel’ light that offered a few basic customization points, but the LITRA BEAM LX takes things to the next level and <strong>beyond</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s a dual-sided key light that comes equipped with Logitech’s clean ‘LIGHTSYNC’ RGB technology, fully customizable through the G Hub application, and a damn nice splash of color wherever you decide to put it.</p>



<p>As a versatile thing, the LITRA BEAM LX can be positioned either horizontally or vertically, like a light column. The base of the light is pretty hefty and takes up a bit of desk space, but it’s not too oppressive. It’s also a hefty thing that weighs around 1.5 KG, so bear that in mind and don’t put it anywhere it could get knocked over.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The LITRA BEAM LX does a perfect job of illuminating your face with a soft glow that doesn’t cast too many shadows</figcaption></figure>







<p>Admittedly, there’s not a huge amount you can say about a <strong>light</strong>, but if you’re in the market for a multi-functional and super-effective key light that offers remote customization, an easy install process, and genuinely satisfying effects, you’ll want to check out the LITRA BEAM LX.</p>



<p>It’s my daily driver, and at the time of writing, I had the RGB bar set up to mimic ARC Raiders colorways, while the key light perfectly brightens my streams of that same game. I think the only thing better than the LITRA BEAM LX would be TWO of these lights, to have them columned on either side of the monitor to eliminate any chance of shadows across the face.</p>



<p>Perfection.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Maono PD200W Microphone Review—Suprisingly Affordable and Effective]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/maono-pd200w-microphone-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/maono-pd200w-microphone-review%E2%80%94suprisingly-affordable-and-effective.1361674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Maono PD200W might not be the most obvious pick when it comes to looking for a new podcasting or streaming microphone, but it should certainly be one you at least consider. If you want to get into broadcasting your voice without breaking the bank, the Maono PD200W is a fantastic pick and offers plenty of bang for your buck.</p>



<p>I’ve spent a while testing the Maono PD200W and have some positive sentiments to share about it. Read on for my full take on the Maono PD200W, a ‘hybrid’ microphone that is self-dubbed the ‘world’s first wireless dynamic microphone for podcasting.’</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-maono-pd200w-microphone-worth-99">Is the Maono PD200W Microphone Worth $99?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing, the Maono PD200W microphone boasted a price tag of just $99, which is <strong>more than worth </strong>the investment. It might not be a Logitech, a Shure, or a Rode, but it’s <strong>brilliant </strong>for newcomers who want great sound quality in an attractive enough package without worrying about investing too much money right off the bat.</p>



<p>This tri-mode microphone is an innovation in itself. It can be used on a 2.4GHz band wireless connection, via USB, or XLR. It can also be used <strong>fully wirelessly </strong>using a dongle, which is nuts. I genuinely noticed very little in the way of audio loss between a wired and wireless connection, which is very surprising indeed.</p>



<p>I didn’t test this, but the battery should last (on paper at least) a whopping<strong> 60 hours</strong>, and both the broadcaster and receiver are so effective that you can have <strong>a 60-meter separation </strong>between them with low latency. If you’re on the go and want to keep crystal-clear audio quality in a microphone that looks premium, it makes so much sense to pick the Maono PD200W.</p>



<p>There’s also a 3.5mm jack, which allows you to pass through audio inputs. It’s convenient as heck.</p>



<p>If there’s one complaint I have about the Maono PD200W, it’s that it offers a dynamic microphone build, and I prefer cardioid for the more ‘directed’ input feel. That said, it offers great background noise elimination that can be further tweaked with Maono’s proprietary app, which allows you to further customize the unit.</p>



<p>And yes, that means you can alter the RGB output.</p>



<p>Maono insists the microphone is on par with Shure’s SM7B, one of the most popular microphones for podcasters and streamers.</p>



<p>I paired the Maono PD200W with the company’s BA37 boom arm, which took seconds to set up and is reminiscent of Elgato’s low-profile boom arm, which I already rated quite high.</p>



<p>At $99 for just the microphone or $129.99 for the microphone <strong>and </strong>the boom arm, you can’t really go wrong with the Maono PD200W. It’s a versatile and durable thing (it has a built-in shock mount and solid pop filter) that has plenty of range and looks great in front of your face on camera.</p>



<p>I tested the Maono PD200W across a range of applications (Audacity, OBS, Discord, Google Meet, Streamlabs) and was generally pleased with the results. The equalization needed tweaking to perfect the voice stream, but it took no time at all.</p>



<p>I’d hugely recommend it to new podcasters and aspirational streamers.</p>
