<p>Whereas most American outlets have April 9 penciled in for Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders, the UK has bucked the trend and decided to start taking Switch 2 orders ahead of schedule.</p>



<p>April 2 was a huge day. An hour-long <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> finally revealed a good chunk of information about the Nintendo Switch 2. We got to see exciting first-party software in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-is-getting-a-new-3d-adventure-on-the-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and there was also a hefty amount of controversy about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-nintendo-switch-2-games-cost-physical-digital-game-prices-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost of games</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/not-all-nintendo-switch-2-games-include-game-on-cartridge-despite-prices-of-up-to-90/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game cartridge confusion</a>.</p>



<p>Despite this, many fans are still chomping at the 8-bit, ready to pre-order. The official word is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-when/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-orders</a> would go live in the United States on April 9, with the UK getting a 24-hour headstart on April 8. UK residents are currently bemused as Switch 2 pre-orders are already live—sort of.</p>

<p>Most UK residents know of <strong>Argos</strong>—a classic retailer in these parts. If you head to the <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/list/get-ready-for-nintendo-switch-2?tag=ar:browse:plp:nintendoswitchconsoles:m020:cm:nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Argos website</a>, you can already pre-order and pay for a standalone Nintendo Switch 2 unit or the bundle packaged with a much cheaper <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>



<p>We reported the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 price</a> yesterday, and nothing has changed. Argos is offering the base unit for £395.99 and the MK bundle for £429.99.</p>



<p>Other retailers are unmoved in their position, and are still reserving their Switch 2 orders for waiting lists or allowing you to register your interest. It’s unclear if this is an error on Argos’ part or special dispensation has been permitted.</p>



<p>Argos is the way to go if you want to secure your Switch 2 pre-order!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/investors-demand-ubisoft-to-renegotiate-tencent-subsidiary-deal-and-initiate-legal-proceedings.1153893/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/investors-demand-ubisoft-to-renegotiate-tencent-deal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A minority shareholder and a growing coalition of shareholders have issued an open letter to Ubisoft to initiate legal proceedings around the recently announced Ubisoft and Tencent subsidiary deal.</p>



<p>In an open letter to Ubisoft, which was sent to Insider Gaming, the letter demands that Ubisoft hold an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) to give shareholders the right to vote on the recent subsidiary deal. For those not in the know, an EGM is a special kind of meeting that’s held outside of the general annual general meeting (AGM) to discuss significant issues that cannot wait. </p>



<p>The letter, which was sent by the minority shareholder AJ Investments demands that shareholders can vote on two separate resolutions when it comes to the Tencent deal.</p>



<p>Resolution 1 is to renegotiate the Tencent deal and have it restructured into a direct asset sale for no less than €4 billion, which is roughly the valuation already accepted by both Tencent and Ubisoft’s board. AJ Investments says that at the moment, “moment, shareholders have no clarity how the deal that was announced last week will eventually benefit shareholders of Ubisoft.”</p>



<p>Resolution 2 for the EGM would be to vote on a distribution of a Extraordinary Dividend. It’s said that following the sale (if shareholders vote for it), “Ubisoft shall return €23 per share in cash to shareholders (totalling €3 billion), while preserving.”</p>



<p>AJ Investments say that the reason for such extreme measures is because “shareholders are not sure whether they will get a significant benefit from this transaction. Ubisoft’s share price fell by more than 20% on unusually high volume. This signals a clear verdict from investors — the proposed deal is deeply flawed, structured to bypass mandatory public offer rules, and designed to entrench control by the Guillemot family, who now hold less than 10% of the company’s economic interest.”</p>



<p>Following the deal of the announcement and at the time of writing, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-falls-double-digits-days-after-tencent-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft stock has fallen 24%</a> since the subsidiary deal announcement, which will see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three of Ubisoft’s most valuable IP’s</a> move to a new subsidiary. </p>



<p>You can read the full open letter to Ubisoft below:</p>



<div><p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong><br><strong><br>AJ Investments and Shareholder Coalition wants clarity on the transaction with Tencent, vote on EGM</strong></p><p><strong>Bratislava / Paris – April 2, 2025 –</strong> In direct response to Ubisoft’s decision to transfer the IP and related rights of three major gaming franchises (Assassin Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Siege) into a newly created subsidiary—before raising <strong>€1.16 billion</strong> from Tencent in exchange for a 25% ownership stake (implying a <strong>pre-money valuation of €4 billion</strong>)—AJ Investments, alongside a growing coalition of shareholders, is initiating <strong>legal proceedings in France</strong>. </p></div>



<p>We are demanding that a French court compel Ubisoft to convene an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM), giving all shareholders the right to vote on two critical resolutions:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Renegotiate the Tencent Deal </strong>– This transaction must be restructured into a <strong>direct asset sale to Tencent for no less than €4 billion</strong>, the valuation already accepted by both Tencent and Ubisoft’s board. At the moment, shareholders have no clarity how the deal that was announced last week will eventually benefit shareholders of Ubisoft.<br></li>



<li><strong>Distribute an Extraordinary Dividend – </strong>Following the sale, <strong>Ubisoft shall return €23 per share in cash to shareholders</strong> (totaling <strong>€3 billion</strong>), while preserving<strong> €1 billion to cover remaining corporate net debt</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Additionally, we will seek a ruling that:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tencent be excluded from voting</strong>, due to its direct interest in the outcome of the<br>transaction.<br></li>



<li><strong>Guillemot Brothers Holding’s voting rights be limited </strong>to their non-Tencent-linked shares.</li>
</ul>



<div><p>The market’s reaction to this deal is clear that shareholders are not sure whether they will get a significant benefit from this transaction. <strong>Ubisoft’s share price fell by more than 20% on unusually high volume</strong>. This signals a clear verdict from investors — the proposed deal is deeply flawed, structured to bypass mandatory public offer rules, and designed to <strong>entrench control by the Guillemot family</strong>, who now <strong>hold less than 10%</strong> of the company’s economic interest.</p><p>We believe this is a critical moment for shareholders. Without immediate intervention, the company may pursue further asset sales or dilution <strong>without delivering value to shareholders</strong>. In contrast, a simple vote at an EGM could deliver <strong>€23 per share in cash ( €3 billion valuation</strong>, source: Euronext outstanding shares for calculation)—more than <strong>double the current share price</strong>—and restore shareholder trust in Ubisoft’s future.</p><p>We suggest that management will explain the benefits of the deal to the shareholders in detail (not 2 A4 pages from where many details are not clear) as the owners of the business and we will have a vote on it. Sell the core IPs to the Tencent as a whole or sell them the 25% stake in a subsidiary that was already announced. Shareholders will choose what they prefer.</p></div>



<p>We call on all minority shareholders to join us now in this legal effort to protect value and demand accountability. The time to act is today—before the damage becomes irreversible.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is FromSoftware’s New Game a Bloodborne Sequel?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-fromsoftwares-new-game-a-bloodborne-sequel/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-fromsoftware%E2%80%99s-new-game-a-bloodborne-sequel.1153878/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-fromsoftwares-new-game-a-bloodborne-sequel/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bloodborne is still the name on everyone’s lips years later. Its impact has been profound, and bridged a gap between casual gamers and the Soulslike genre. It’s considered one of FromSoftware’s finest pieces of work, and a Bloodborne 2 sequel is being discussed because of a certain The Duskbloods.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> unveiled a ton of exciting details about the new console. But one of the most shocking reveals was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-lands-fromsoftware-exclusive-the-duskbloods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Duskbloods</a>—a new FromSoftware Switch 2 exclusive. In an age where exclusivity is dying and multi-platform releases are common, this feels like a huge win for Nintendo.</p>



<p>One thing you can’t help but feel watching The Duskbloods is that it’s a Bloodborne 2 sequel.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-duskbloods-a-bloodborne-2-sequel">Is The Duskbloods a Bloodborne 2 Sequel?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I’m getting Majora’s Mask vibes. Credit to FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Duskbloods is not a direct sequel to Bloodborne, and is considered more a spiritual successor to FromSoftware’s 2015 hit.</strong></p>



<p>I watched the Switch 2 Direct live and saw <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/duskbloods/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Duskbloods</a> reveal trailer. Hand on heart, I was waiting for a “Bloodborne 2” graphic to pop up at the end. The aesthetic, the vibe, and the enemies exude a distinct Bloodborne feel.</p>



<p>But I think it’s pretty clear this is a standalone title—perhaps borrowing from the Bloodborne library. It’s due in <em>2026</em>, so there’s plenty of time to see what other influences FromSoftware has taken from its own IP—although it’s doing new things courtesy of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-will-feature-8-player-pvpve-multiplayer-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8-player PvPvE multiplayer</a>.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if we ever get official new Bloodborne media (a remake or a remaster), but this will do in the meantime.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-bloodborne-getting-a-remake">Is Bloodborne Getting a remake?</h2>



<p><strong>FromSoftware has not indicated they are developing a Bloodborne Remake, nor does it look like we’re getting a remaster or even a basic PC port for extra platforms.</strong></p>



<p>I’d argue Bloodborne is the most influential and most-loved title FromSoft has created outside of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a>. It’s resonated with fans for years, making its continued absence puzzling. Players have begged for a remake for years, or a 60 FPS remaster at the very least.</p>



<p>Worst still, while Sony continues to release its exclusives on PC, Bloodborne still hasn’t received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-boss-does-not-mind-a-bloodborne-pc-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC port</a>. FromSoftware’s president has even brought up the notion of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-bloodborne-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloodborne remake</a>, too. It probably should’ve happened by now, leading us to wonder if it ever will.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you happy to see FromSoftware making a game that looks to be in a similar vein to Bloodborne? Or are you still desperately hoping for a remake or remaster?</p>
