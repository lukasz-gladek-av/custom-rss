<p>To celebrate the Holiday season, Embark Studios is giving all ARC Raiders players a lot of Raider Tokens to claim, allowing you to buy items usually reserved for those who spend real money.</p>



<p>ARC’s developer is giving you a chance to <em>raid </em>the item store for free! That’s right, the next time you log into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-next-season-arc-raiders-new-raider-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, you should have the opportunity to claim 1,000 Raider Tokens in Embark’s ARC Raiders.</p>

<p>The festive season is officially upon us with the release of Fortnite’s annual Winterfest celebration, which brings a host of new rewards, all available for free, during the event.</p>



<p>While a lot of the hype has been surrounding the exciting collabs Fortnite has on the horizon this holiday season, players are being spoiled with a heap of free rewards, including two brand-new skins to provide a fresh look.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has all the details on every Fortnite Winterfest reward in 2025 and how to get your hands on them all.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-fortnite-winter-2025-rewards">All Fortnite Winter 2025 Rewards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots of goodies. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 16 total free rewards available in Fortnite during the Winterfest 2025 event, including Outfits, Jam Tracks, and more.</strong></p>



<p>14 of the rewards are distributed by opening presents daily in the cabin, with the final two rewards, both Outfits, becoming available when specific thresholds have been met during the event.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, if you were holding out hope for free collab skins with the likes of Harry Potter, Hatsune Miku, and Sabrina Carpenter, you’ll be disappointed, as they’re available in the Item Shop and not via Winterfest rewards.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the Winterfest 2025 free rewards.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Name</th><th data-align="center">Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Cheeks</td><td data-align="center">Outfit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Glacial Dummy</td><td data-align="center">Outfit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Winterfest Bow</td><td data-align="center">Back Bling</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Wrapped Axe</td><td data-align="center">Pickaxe</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Festive Bat</td><td data-align="center">Pickaxe</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Warm &amp; Peely</td><td data-align="center">Emote</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Just A Holiday in Battlewood</td><td data-align="center">Jam Track</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Festive Gwinny</td><td data-align="center">Back Bling</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Glacial Groove</td><td data-align="center">Instrument</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bard’s Gem</td><td data-align="center">Instrument</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Winterfest Letter</td><td data-align="center">Glider</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Shadowstorm</td><td data-align="center">Contrail</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Fire-Born</td><td data-align="center">Emote</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">No Sweat, Snowfish</td><td data-align="center">Emote</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">A Snowman!</td><td data-align="center">Wrap</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Winterfest Gift</td><td data-align="center">Emote</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-fortnite-2025-winterfest-rewards">How to Get Fortnite 2025 Winterfest Rewards</h2>



<p><strong>One Fortnite Winterfest reward</strong> <strong>can be claimed daily, with a refresh of 9 AM ET, starting at the beginning of the Winterfest event on December 18.</strong></p>



<p>Rewards can be selected in any order, so you can choose what you want to get first. However, you can’t jump straight to the new Outfits, as their distribution is slightly different.</p>



<p>The Glacial Dummy Outfit is unlocked after you open seven other presents, while the Cheeks Outfit is unlocked once 13 presents have been opened.</p>



<p>While you won’t specifically be shown what you’re about to unlock, the shape of the presents is a big giveaway, so use that to your advantage.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/first-stardew-valley-1-7-update-includes-new-farm-type-lots-more/</link>
            <guid>1386862</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Stardew Valley 1.7 update is still on the way, and while there’s still no approximate timeframe for the new content, the game’s developer has let the community in on certain features and aspects to expect.</p>



<p>Eric Barone’s—AKA ConcernedApe—solo creation of Stardew Valley needs to be studied. It’s unbelievable that one person made such a staggeringly big and timeless game. They could realistically walk away from the title at any point now. Instead, the game goes from strength to strength.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/among-us-collaboration-announced-with-stardew-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Among Us collaboration with Stardew Valley</a> was one thing, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-1-7-update-coming-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.7 update</a> is huge.</p>











<figure><figcaption>Still more to come. Credit to ConcernedApe</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 2017 life-sim title is readying itself for the upcoming 1.7 update. ConcernedApe remains coy on a release date or launch window, but when asked if the dev could “Give any hints about the newest update that we could look forward to or a sneak peek?” Concerned Ape obliged:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There will be some more character/social stuff, it’s also traditional to add a new farm type. Lots more but I don’t want to reveal much yet.”<a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001186320765583409"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>It means we need to wait longer for more details on the 1.7 update, and the content is presumably a while away yet. It’s all the more impressive when you consider the developer is also working simultaneously on a new game—Haunted Chocolatier.</p>







<p>Speculation continues to run rife over whether this will be the final, major Stardew Valley update. Many were shocked when 1.7 was announced, and every subsequent update will raise the same question.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">there will be some more character/social stuff, it's also traditional to add a new farm type.

<p>It’s the most wonderful time of the year, with Fortnite officially kicking off the Winterfest 2025 celebrations with a new update on December 18, bringing a host of additions in the patch notes.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Freebies. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’ve broken down all the major changes to Fortnite with the December 18 update, which marks the start of Winterfest 2025 and is the final patch of the year, into sections below.</p>



<h3 id="h-winterfest-2025-rewards">Winterfest 2025 Rewards</h3>



<p>Fortnite’s annual celebration around the festive season has begun, with free rewards available to claim as a result, including Skins, Emotes, and more.</p>



<p>A total of 14 rewards are available to claim, along with two skins once you have claimed seven and 13 rewards. One gift can be opened daily, with a refresh at 9 AM ET.</p>



<h3 id="h-shop-collabs">Shop Collabs</h3>



<p>A host of big collabs are available in the shop during Winterfest, including festive-themed skins for Sabrina Carpenter and Hatsune Miku, but the big addition is the Harry Potter franchise, with customizable skins for your favorite Hogwarts house.</p>



<p>There’s even more on the horizon, too, with Sidekicks coming for SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star, while Batman Beyond is also poised to appear.</p>



<h3 id="h-map-changes">Map Changes</h3>



<p>The main Battle Royale island has seen some changes with the update, with snow spreading around the northern section of the map.</p>



<p>Areas modified for Winterfest 2025 include Wonkeeland, Tiptop Terrace, Latte Landing, and Painted Palms, with fresh secrets to uncover as you fight for victory.</p>



<h3 id="h-bleach-collab">Bleach Collab</h3>



<p>Winterfest 2025 has a bunch of returning collabs, including new skins for the likes of Sabrina Carpenter and Hatsune Miku, but there’s also a brand-new collab landing in the Item Shop, along with in-game content.</p>



<p>Bleach is the latest major anime to receive a collab in Fortnite for 2025, following on from the likes of Kaiju No. 9, Cowboy Bebop, and One Punch Man.</p>



<p>Alongside items to purchase in the Item Shop, two new Mythic weapons will be available at an undetermined date: the Fully-Hollowfied Ichigo Mask and Dual Zangetsu.</p>



<h2 id="h-festive-weapons">Festive Weapons</h2>



<p>Two festive weapons have been added to rotation in the Winterfest 2025 update, with Blizzard Grenades and Snowball launchers available for players.</p>



<p>It’s not clear yet whether there is any specific method to obtaining the weapons, or whether they are random loot from chests and the ground.</p>
