            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Layoffs have taken place at Starbreeze Studios, the developer behind Payday 3, marking another difficult moment for the studio following the game’s troubled launch.</p>



<p>Multiple employees took to LinkedIn on Wednesday to confirm that layoffs were taking place. As of writing, Starbreeze has yet to officially announce the layoffs. </p>







<p><strong>“Today, many of us at Starbreeze, Stockholm, got sad news and I’m now seeking a new role and would appreciate your support,”</strong> said QA Alexander Pereswetoff-Morath. <strong>“After over 7 years, the longest I’ve ever been at any company in any industry, my time has (more than likely) come.”</strong></p>



<p>Senior Tech Producer Sabina af Jochnick added, <strong>“Due to the recent layoffs at Starbreeze, my role has been identified as at risk of redundancy, so I’m beginning to look at what’s next.”</strong></p>



<p>Since launching in 2023, Payday 3 has faced a number of problems. It’s launch was so bad with players frustrated and leaving the game altogether that Starbreeze ultimately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-fires-ceo-tobias-sjogren/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired its CEO</a> Tobias Sjögren. Starbreeze even announced in late 2024 that it was going to invest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-payday-3-less-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“significantly less”</a> in year two content for Payday 3. </p>







<p>Despite the lower investment in the game, the studio had continued to update and support the game. It’s most recent update—Update 3.1—on January 13 included a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1272080/view/494965447846790101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“Shopping Spree” heist</a> along with a number of game balance changes. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Starbreeze for clarification on the layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There will be no more remote work—or at least very limited opportunities—for Ubisoft employees moving forward. Instead, Ubisoft employees will be required to be in office on a full time basis.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, the French-based publisher announced major restructuring plans that including a number of games, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>, being canceled. While the announcement also spoke about plans to focus more on<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Games-As-A-Service (GAAS) and open world experiences</a>, they also revealed a policy change that will impact all employees within the company. </p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-wants-all-employees-in-the-office">Ubisoft Wants All Employees In The Office</h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official press release</a>, Ubisoft will return to a full five days on site “for all teams”. Staff will then receive an “annual allowance of working-from-home days.”</p>



<p>“This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams,” they said “In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity and success in a persistently more selective AAA market.”</p>



<p>SVP of Studio Operations Marie Sophie de Waubert&nbsp;told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-reveals-new-creative-house-structure-cancels-games-and-announces-final-round-of-cost-cutting-and-studio-closures-to-drive-200m-savings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a> that the company is still working with “a hybrid model, but spread differently”.</p>







<p>After the news broke, one source reached out to Insider Gaming’s Mike Straw to say that they’d expect the eventual layoffs to be “in the hundreds”. During its conference call to discuss the moves, Ubisoft wouldn’t discuss how many more layoffs would be coming as part of this restructure within the company. </p>



<p>Recently, the company has held layoffs at its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-to-layoff-55-employees-across-the-division-developers-and-stockholm-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Massive Entertainment</a> as well as at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cut-nearly-30-jobs-abu-dhabi-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</a>, the closure of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-employees-unionized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Halifax</a>, and more. </p>
