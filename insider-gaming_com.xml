<p>ArtPlay and Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement’s creative director, Shutaro Ida, has passed away at 52 from cancer. </p>



<p>Announced through the official <a href="https://x.com/ArtplayEN/status/2023213425707647237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) account of ArtPlay, their creative director, Shutaro Ida, passed away on February 10, 2026, after a one-and-a-half-year battle with cancer. Shutaro has been a significant figure in the gaming industry, not only in ArtPlay games but also in popular franchises such as Metal Gear Solid and Castlevania. </p>







<h2 id="h-bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-be-completed-to-shutaro-s-legacy-and-vision">Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement be Completed to Shutaro’s Legacy and Vision</h2>



<p>The last project on which ArtPlay’s creative director was working was Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement. Shutaro was leading this project, and it has now entered its final stages. The development studio has promised to “carry forward his legacy and strive with all our strength to complete this work worthy of his vision and name.”</p>



<p>For those unaware, Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement is a 2.5D metroidvania title, set in 16th-century England. It features a gothic atmosphere with strategic battles, crafting, and exploration. The game features a new buddy system for the series, allowing players to play as both Leo and Alex to battle Demon Lord Elias’s reign of terror. </p>



<p>The title also features the series’s largest map yet, with a day-and-night cycle that includes dawn, day, dusk, and night. Players can learn new and powerful abilities as they progress, plus there is also a lot of crafting and cooking, along with customisation that can change the players’ attributes. </p>

<p>Pearl Abyss has stated that Crimson Desert’s premium price is “not something for microtransactions.” </p>



<p>Pearl Abyss’s upcoming action-adventure, Crimson Desert, is all set to release next month on March 19, 2026. Ahead of the release, we have heard a lot of information about the title, including the fact that it has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crimson-desert-goes-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gone gold</a>. Now, we have understood the developers’ views on microtransactions. </p>

<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dropped Frames</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/2023176928870662217?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Okami</a>), Crimson Desert PR director Will Power addressed microtransactions. Powers stated that he can definitively say there is no “cosmetic shop.” Powers added, “This is made to be a premium experience that you buy, and you enjoy the world and not something for microtransactions.” The PR director concluded, “this is a premium experience, that is the transaction, full stop.” </p>
