<p>The first set of new maps coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 have been revealed. On Monday morning, the game’s official <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1853467391688110288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> channels shared a teaser look at the three new maps coming to Black Ops 6 season 1. </p>



<p>The new maps are Heirloom, Hideout, and Extraction. </p>



<p>All of the maps will be available for 6v6 multiplayer gameplay. Heirloom, however, will also be available for 2v2 combat. More details about the maps will come closer to the start of Season 1, but the teases should give players an idea of what to expect.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 Season 1 will feature new maps, weapons, and other additions for all players. It’s set to kick off on November 14 with a full reveal happening shortly before.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is available now. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our review of the game</a>, Grant Taylor-Hill said that “Black Ops 6 feels accommodating to both newcomers and veterans. It’s as typical a multiplayer offering as you can ask for, but you&nbsp;just get it<strong>&nbsp;</strong>so much faster than previous titles.”</p>



<p>Check out the teaser below, and let us know what you think in the comments. You can also take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/call-of-duty.12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. </p>
