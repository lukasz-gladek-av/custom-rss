<p>Hours ago, Steam hit a new milestone – <strong>40 million peak concurrent users </strong>online on the platform. This monumental figure was secured with 12 million players worldwide being <strong>in a game </strong>as the total number crept over the 40 million mark.</p>



<p>To put that into perspective, the most recent estimates suggest that Microsoft has sold around 30 million Xbox Series consoles since they debuted in 2020. That means that even if every person who ever bought an Xbox Series X or Series S were to log on simultaneously, they’d still need <strong>10 million people </strong>to hit Steam’s peak player count.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impressive-stuff">Impressive Stuff</h2>



<p>Steam is a powerhouse of a platform, and PC gaming is exploding. Recently, it was revealed in a data-driven report that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-gaming-outperforming-consoles/">PC gaming has been outpacing</a> ‘living room console’ revenue since 2011. Collectively, the PC gaming market has earned 225% more than ‘combined console’ spend in the last decade or so.</p>



<p>If you think about it for a moment, it becomes pretty incredible.</p>



<p>At one point in the last few hours, <strong>40 million people </strong>were online on Steam all at the same time. That’s more than the population of Canada, and it almost beats the population of Greece, Portugal, Hungary, and Switzerland <strong>combined</strong>.</p>



<p>It was recently estimated that Microsoft has managed to shift around 30 million Xbox Series consoles since 2020, pacing far behind Sony with more than 70 million PlayStation 5 sales. That means that more people are using Steam right now than have purchased Xbox consoles in a five-year window.</p>



<p>It’s apples and oranges as Steam has built up that repository of users over a <strong>very long period</strong>, but it’s certainly indicative of the wider power of PC gaming. It has even been estimated that Xbox Game Pass has around 34 million subscribers, so Steam trumps that as well.</p>



<p>Are you one of the 40 million? Let us know what you use Steam for in the comments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[John Cena’s GTA 6 Post Has Fans Speculating Like Crazy]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/john-cena%E2%80%99s-gta-6-post-has-fans-speculating-like-crazy.1123446/</guid>

<p>Recently, John Cena blew minds across the WWE universe after turning against Cody Rhodes at the Elimination Chamber PPV. This major heel turn comes as his retirement tour unfolds, and while many predicted it, it’s still surprising.</p>



<p>Following the win at Elimination Chamber, the 47-year-old superstar took to social media to post a promotional image of Grand Theft Auto 6 with no caption or context. This has fuelled speculation online, with fans of both the franchise and the iconic athlete believing that John Cena could be in GTA 6.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-highly-unlikely">Highly Unlikely</h2>



<p>Nobody understands why John Cena would post a promotional image for GTA 6 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/johncena/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on his Instagram page</a>, but he did it, and that’s all we know.</p>



<p>To be fair, his bio suggests we should anticipate posts like this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>These images will be posted without explanation, for your interpretation. Enjoy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s up to us to decide what the post means, then.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many have surmised that it’s Cena’s take on the ‘before GTA 6’ meme that has run rampant on social media in the past few months.</p>



<p>‘We got a John Cena heel turn before GTA 6’, kind of thing.</p>



<p>It’s not unheard of for celebrities to appear in a Grand Theft Auto game, but it <strong>is </strong>unlikely that Rockstar Games or Take-Two would have ‘allowed’ Cena to make the post if he were involved with the game. That’s just too much of a spoiler.</p>



<p>Cena has more time on his hands now, so perhaps he has lent his voice and acting talents to the next iteration of the Grand Theft Auto series. Who knows? He appeared in PGA Tour 2K23, and Take-Two was the publisher for WWE games for many years, so he has a connection to Take-Two in some way.</p>



<p>What role could you see John Cena taking up in GTA 6? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>The LA Thieves have secured their first sizeable win in the 2025 Call of Duty League season, beating Vancouver Surge in the grand final of Minor II. The series came down to the wire, with Vancouver riding high on a string of wins that exemplified how dominant the amended roster has been recently.</p>



<p>Vancouver Surge was able to overcome Boston, FaZe, and Toronto before putting up one hell of a fight against the LA Thieves in the grand final. Ultimately, it was LAT that walked away with the $20,000 prize and the 30 CDL points that pushed the squad into second place in the season standings.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-minor-win-major-gains">Minor Win, Major Gains</h2>



<p>The CDL Minor structure is a brand-new concept for the 2025 season. It’s designed to split up the qualifying stages and give players a cash prize to work towards, and it’s a ‘winner takes all’ event. Each stage will have a Minor and a Major, and the first one, which took place before Major I in Madrid, was claimed by Atlanta FaZe.</p>



<p>This time around, it was the LA Thieves that shone, with the team having earned a bye thanks to their seeding in the regular season. The squad picked apart Cloud9 and the Royal Ravens to unlock the grand final, at which point they stomped Vancouver Surge to claim the number one spot.</p>



<p>It was a clockwork tournament for the LA Thieves, but other teams didn’t fare so well.</p>



<p>Atlanta FaZe struggled to hit the mark and collapsed against Vancouver Surge, taking it to a game five and falling short in the final SnD. OpTic Texas clashed with Falcons and secured a win but lost with a 0 – 3 scoreline against Toronto Ultra.</p>



<p>The fixture against the Vegas Falcons saw history <strong>almost </strong>being made. The Falcons put up a solid fight in the opening Hardpoint and managed to secure a 3 – 0 win in Control. The first round of Search also went down to the wire, with round eleven being needed for OpTic Texas to win the game.</p>



<p>That could have been a <strong>very </strong>different story.</p>



<p>We now look to Major II, which will take place from March 20 – 23 in Texas. The power players could be starting to shift, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-plummets-map-win/">OpTic Texas will be in trouble</a> if it doesn’t sharpen up ahead of the home Major.</p>
