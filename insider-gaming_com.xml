<p>The second season of Prime Video’s Fallout got its reviews today, and they are quite favorable. Even more so, the Bethesda series’ sophomore season has beaten the first season’s Rotten Tomatoes score by a good bit.</p>



<p>Despite the ‘video game adaptation curse’, Prime Video’s Fallout beat the odds seemingly out of nowhere. Based on the post-apocalyptic worlds from Bethesda, the show captured what made the games special with a delightful mix of comedy and action. Released in 2024, it became a smash hit, even earning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-won-emmy-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Primetime Emmy nominations</a> like Best Drama and Best Drama Actor for Walton Goggins. It was clear a new season was in order, and, as of writing, the first episode is available to watch. Critics have already seen most of what the show has to offer and, if what Rotten Tomatoes rates is true, it outdoes the first season in a big way. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/fallout/s02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, which collects all available reviews for media, Fallout Season 2 received a 97% rating. With 39 reviews, it is now Certified Fresh. While the score can change as more reviews come in, the second season outperformed the first by 4%. Fallout Season 1 scored an impressive 93% with over 133 reviews. </p>



<p>The better score does bode well for the series’ second outing. Fallout Season 2 continues the story of Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus as the world expands to New Vegas. Its impressive accolades and numbers for Prime Video have already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-3-possibly-filming-summer-2026-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">greenlit it for a third season</a>, which aims to film in Summer 2026. It is quite rare for a game adaptation to get another shot, much less be better than the first. Fortunately, Prime Video’s Fallout has done just that, ensuring fans will have some treats in store for the series.</p>

<p>In the latest development in the saga between Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix, and Paramount, it appears that WBD is sticking with its original agreement with Netflix.</p>



<p>According to a new report from Bloomberg, the WBD Board of Directors is planning on telling investors to reject Paramount’s latest bid for the company. The report states that the Board’s decision is based on what they believe to be a better offer from Netflix.</p>







<p>“After deliberating and reviewing the Paramount bid, the Warner Bros. board still views the company’s existing agreement with&nbsp;Netflix Inc.&nbsp;as offering greater value, certainty and terms than what Paramount has proposed,” the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-16/warner-bros-said-to-prep-paramount-rejection-on-funding-terms?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg report</a> (paywall) reads.</p>



<p>WBD and Netflix <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced a deal</a> that would see the Warner side of the company be acquired in a deal worth $82.7 billion in total enterprise value and $27.75 per share. The Paramount proposal, that came after the Netflix deal was announce, was for the entirety of the company for $30 per share. That offer seemingly put the value of the television networks and other aspects of the company at a value of just $2.25 per share, if you want to keep the same $27.75 value of the WBD Streaming &amp; Services side.</p>







<p>The news of the rejection shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Not long after receiving the “hostile” and “unsolicited” offer from Paramount, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-paramount-offer-warner-bros-wont-change-netflix-sale-recommendation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WBD release stated</a> that the board wouldn’t be “modifying its recommendation” of the Netflix deal.</p>



<p>It should be mentioned, however, that just because the Board recommends the Netflix deal be chosen, there is always the possibility that the investors vote otherwise. If the Netflix deal moves forward, however, the streaming giant’s acquisition of Warner Bros. is planned to close after WBD completes its split into two companies in 2026. Should that happen, Netflix would own all of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warner Bros. Games properties</a>, including Mortal Kombat, DC, Harry Potter, and more. </p>
