<p>Larain has revealed that they will refrain from using GenAI tools for concept art or dialogue text generation for Divinity following recent community blowback.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Larian Studios was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-larian-employees-fire-back-at-bosss-ai-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under fire</a> from the community recently after the CEO stated that “everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it” regarding AI. The CEO later confirmed that the dev team will hold an AMA to clear up confusion about AI usage and address other aspects of the game, and that day has finally arrived. </p>



<h2 id="h-divinity-will-not-feature-any-genai-art-or-text-generation">Divinity Will Not Feature Any GenAI Art or Text Generation</h2>



<p>Revealed through Larian’s Divinity AMA on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games</a>, Larian CEO Swen Vincke has confirmed that “there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity.” Vincke then addressed the discussion around “AI tools as part of concept art exploration”, explaining that it didn’t mean the concept art was generated through AI; however, to avoid any confusion in the community, they have decided to “refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development.” </p>



<p>At the same time, the development team has been constantly working on speeding up the development process and feels that GenAI can help with this process. GenAI can help in refining ideas faster, “leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.” </p>



<p>However, the CEO has confirmed that Larian “will not generate ‘creative assets’ that end up in a game without being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data.” If GenAI ends up being used to create in-game assets, it will be trained on the data Larian owns. The Writing Director for Divinity confirmed that the same stance applies for the writing as well, and they “don’t have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity.” </p>



<p>In other news, Larian has confirmed that players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-says-players-dont-need-to-play-older-divinity-games-for-the-new-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t need to play older games</a> before the upcoming Divinity title. Additionally, the game will follow the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-plans-to-follow-the-same-early-access-format-as-other-larian-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same early access format</a> as the previous titles.

            <title><![CDATA[There’s A 4th Game Coming During The Xbox Developer Direct]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/4th-game-during-xbox-developer-direct/</link>
            <guid>1401604</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On Thursday, Microsoft confirmed three games would be appearing at the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct later this month. When the three games were announced, many fans were left wondering if that would be it for the event. Well, according to a new report, there’s at least one more game.</p>



<p>First mentioned by Shinobi on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot36-oops-all-obsidian.1310962/page-215#post-149812867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reset Era forums</a>, Xbox is planning to show a “secret fourth game” during the Developer Direct. Shortly there after, another outlet corroborated those claims.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-this-fourth-game-at-xbox-developer-direct">What Is This Fourth Game At Xbox Developer Direct?</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-xbox-developer-direct-will-feature-a-secret-unannounced-fourth-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, the fourth game not only exists, but it’s reportedly a <strong>“promising indie title from a third-party publisher”. </strong></p>



<p>No other details on what this game could be was mentioned by either Shinobi or VGC. </p>



<p>Despite the reliability of both sources, it’s important to note that plans can change and that everything should be taken with a grain of salt until either the show airs, or it can be confirmed by Insider Gaming.</p>







<p>As far as what is guaranteed to be there, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-games-confirmed-for-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox confirmed</a> that Forza Horizon 6, Fable, and Game Freak’s Beast of Reincarnation will be shown. Forza Horizon 6 will get its first gameplay reveal, Beast of Reincarnation will see details of the game’s protagonist Emma’s plan manipulation abilities, and Fable will get its first extended look. </p>



<p>Last year’s show featured games like Doom: The Dark Ages, Ninja Gaiden 4, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 3. There was even a surprise Ninja Gaiden 2 Black shadow drop announced.</p>

<p>A new Born In Chaos Battle Pass accompanies the arrival of South Park to Fortnite. As with all passes, it comes loaded with customizable items and conditions that need to be met. This guide looks at the South Park and Fortnite Battle Pass’ end date, and more.</p>



<p>Everyone is goin’ down to South Park to have themself a time. If you didn’t know, it’s full of friendly faces everywhere, humble folks without temptation. Non-South Park fans might struggle to get the joke, but rest assured, many of you will. The cartoon series has left an indelible imprint on society and culture.</p>



<p>It’s still incredible to think that a child-friendly game like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> has crossed over with South Park, but it’s better for it. The new Born In Chaos Battle Pass is at the heart of the collab’s progress.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-the-fortnite-amp-south-park-battle-pass-end">When Does The Fortnite &amp; South Park Battle Pass End?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get cooking. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>All Fortnite players have until February 5 to wrap up every challenge and complete all the content in the South Park Born In Chaos Battle Pass that was brought in alongside the mini-season update.</strong></p>



<p>If you go to the Born In Chaos pass screen and look in the top-left corner, you’ll see a live timer that says ‘Event Ends In.’ This is a constant reminder of how long you have to enjoy the South Park drop.</p>



<p>Eventually, it will hit zero, and it will be on February 5. After this, the AWESOM-O content and pass will be gone.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-does-the-fortnite-amp-south-park-battle-pass-cost">How Much Does The Fortnite &amp; South Park Battle Pass Cost?</h2>



<p><strong>The Born In Chaos Battle Pass is completely free in Fortnite, and everyone is entitled to claim rewards from it.</strong></p>



<p>You don’t need to acquire V-Bucks or spend your current V-Bucks to obtain the South Park pass. It’s a free addition, and all rewards from it can be earned as normal.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-devs-fired-over-leaks-sent-to-influencers-rockstar-says/</link>
            <guid>1401511</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rockstar has stated that GTA 6 employees were fired in 2023 and 2025 after leaking confidential information to third parties, who were reportedly influencers. </p>



<p>Rockstar, the developer of GTA 6, is under investigation for alleged union-busting. However, the company firmly denies these claims, stating that the recent firing of 34 employees was due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-game-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaking of features</a>. This situation has prompted the community to speculate about the nature of these leaks.</p>











<p>A Rockstar spokesperson has shared additional details about the recent firings in a statement to <a href="https://in.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-vi/250412/news/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, remaining firm that leaking was the only reason for the decision. The statement comes in response to IWGB’s claims, which state that Rockstar “broke the law” when it fired these employees, who were “organising for better conditions.” </p>



<p>The GTA 6 developers state that they took action against employees from the UK and Canada for sharing “highly confidential information”, including revealing game features from upcoming and unannounced titles, in an “insecure and public social channel.” This action was considered “a breach of long-standing and well-understood confidentiality policies.”</p>



<p>Rockstar adds that the channel that these employees were using consisted of “25 non-Rockstar employees”, including devs from competitor teams, a video game journalist, and other unidentified members. Employees who posted “union-supportive messages” and didn’t breach their policies weren’t fired. </p>



<p>It was revealed that a Rockstar employee in Lincoln, UK, was fired in April 2025 for sharing information with a third party, who then posted it to social media. Additionally, an employee was fired in November 2023 in the US and in November 2025 in India for two more acts of leaking GTA 6 information. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Rockstar has pointed to its well-established zero tolerance approach to leaks, highlighting that it dismissed a Rockstar employee in Lincoln, UK in April 2025, who it alleged disclosed confidential information about GTA 6 to a third party who published the information to social…</p>— ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/2009055571190653411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-community-speculates-leaks-from-2023-and-gameroll-could-be-true">GTA 6 Community Speculates Leaks From 2023 and Gameroll Could Be True</h2>



<p>Since the November 2023 firing was revealed, a Reddit post from the same year has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q775cn/potential_gta_6_plot_leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">come into the limelight</a>, with players speculating that it could be the information that led to the employees’ firing. The leak itself talks about the plot and some new game mechanics. Players are also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1q6xoma/gamerolls_leak_basically_confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">suspecting</a> that the leaks from Gameroll, who accurately predicted Jason and Lucia’s last names, could be true as well. </p>



<p>However, players should note that this is just speculation, and there is no official confirmation that these were the GTA 6 leaks that led to the employees being fired. </p>







<p>In other news, GTA 6 might not be content complete, and it is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-might-not-be-content-complete-hard-to-say-if-it-will-be-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hard to say</a>” whether the game will be delayed again. Additionally, we almost received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-tokyo-almost-happened-says-former-rockstar-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Tokyo</a> title.

<p>Use these active Roblox Fireworks Playground monthly redeem codes to get your hands on free rewards like coins and more.</p>



<p>Fireworks Playground is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-walk-or-die-codes/">Roblox</a> experience that drops players into the middle of a vibrant world of pyrotechnics and explosive celebrations. Players can immediately begin lighting various fireworks upon launch, and from there, progress through the game to unlock the best pyrotechnic displays available. With over 2,163 different fireworks to collect and launch, ranging from simple firecrackers to elaborate multi-shot aerial displays, pyrotechnic enthusiasts will have a fantastic time playing Fireworks Playground.</p>



<p>Having been released in beta during 2023, Fireworks Playground has gradually gained traction over the course of the following years and now boasts a dedicated player base with over 360,000 members. The game, developed by Pseudo Studio (specifically by creators PseudoDaemon and YuckMaster), offers a unique experience where players can enjoy realistic firework sounds and visuals year-round without annoying their neighbors.</p>







<p>Although simply lighting fireworks is enough for players to earn coins to unlock more spectacular displays, using redeem codes to get some extra rewards is never a bad idea.</p>

<p>Fireworks Playground codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Pseudo Studio Discord server, which has a dedicated codes channel where all new codes are posted first, and the developer’s social media accounts (specifically the PseudosStudios X page) where they announce updates and milestones for this popular pyrotechnic-inspired game.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around game milestones but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>



<p>This page is refreshed as soon as fresh codes go live, and any codes that have expired are taken out quickly so you always see only the ones that still work.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Anime Auto Chess monthly redeem codes to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Dice, Fragments and much more.</p>



<p>Anime Auto Chess is all about collecting Units to increase your Power, improving your squad composition, getting Upgrades, and boosting your Rank. Generally, to become the best, you’ll not only need the finest anime Characters but also a way to progress without spending hours. That’s when you should redeem the active Anime Auto Chess codes, as they can be redeemed for Medals, Gems, and Power Fragments.</p>







<p>New <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-walk-or-die-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> players will quickly get access to powerful Units within a few minutes after beginning their anime-based auto chess journey. Although medals, rerolls and more are earned through gameplay, the fastest way to jump ahead is by redeeming promo codes — developers hand out codes that grant free resources and boosts so players can summon more units and accelerate progression instead of grinding.</p>
