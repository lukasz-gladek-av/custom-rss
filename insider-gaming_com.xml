<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s preseason content brings Nuketown. The camo grind really begins now, but there’s a distinct lack of Easter Eggs in Nuketown, including the legendary mannequin heads.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is about to really get going. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a> is getting ready to get underway, and this will signal the long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-black-ops-7-warzone-coming-out-black-ops-7-warzone-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 &amp; Warzone Integration</a>. Before this, the preseason has started, which includes the debut (again) of Nuketown. This is the latest incarnation of the decade-old map.</p>



<p>But it’s missing one big thing at launch.</p>

<p>The mannequin heads can’t be shot in Black Ops 7’s Nuketown right now. The map is live, it has its own playlist option, but the mannequin heads are very resolute, meaning no Nuketown Easter Egg.</p>







<p>Ordinarily, you can shoot the mannequin heads, and if you pop all of them off, a humorous Easter Egg plays out. It varies from game to game, but there’s no such thing in Black Ops 7 right now.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’ve encountered this, don’t worry, it’s probably not permanent. This has happened before, and the mannequin Easter Egg—as well as any others—is usually activated once Season 1 begins.</p>



<p>No one knows why this is the case, but it’s usually what happens. So, be patient, and the time will come for you to furiously dislodge plastic heads from idle mannequin bodies.</p>
