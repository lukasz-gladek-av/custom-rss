<p>The very last game trailer at the Nintendo Switch 2 event was for a new 3D, open-world adventure, Donkey Kong Bananza.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza trailer kicks off by showcasing all the different types of biomes players will explore in the game, including thick forests, vast greenlands, snowy mountains, and much more. Donkey Kong enters the scene later, showcasing his diverse traversal abilities, such as running, jumping, and climbing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most mesmerising system of Donkey Kong Bananza is its destructible environment, with Kong able to demolish almost anything with his fists. The trailer shows Donkey Kong performing a ground pound to create a massive hole underneath him before he punches himself out from the mound. Kong is also shown grabbing a piece of concrete from the floor underneath him to cause even more destruction by either smashing it into his surroundings or tossing it around like a boulder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Donkey Kong Bananza trailer at Switch 2 Direct also showcased other vital details, such as interactive elements of the environment, transitioning from 3D to 2D and back, and all the different types of minions and bosses. Donkey Kong Banana is set to release on July 17, 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct revealed that the console will cost $449.99 at launch. This likely justifies the new games and incredible console features, making this one of the most powerful consoles ever.</p>



<p>One of the biggest questions surrounding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> has been its price. The first Switch console retailed for $299.99 and £279.99 when it first came out. However, the new and improved Switch 2 is jam-packed with a litany of expensive features including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-120fps-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4K, HDR, and 120 FPS capabilities</a>.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 was expected to cost much more, and now we finally have the answer.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will cost <strong>$449.99</strong>, and it remains to be seen if this is a fair price for such a sophisticated piece of hardware. You can also pay a bit more as there’s a packaged bundle featuring a digital copy of Mario Kart World for <strong>$499.99</strong>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-gb/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Switch 2</a> also looks like it costs a whopping <strong>£395.99</strong> in the UK, with the additional Mario Kart World bundle increasing to <strong>£429.99</strong>.</p>

<p>Fans of FromSoftware were surprised to see the developer announce an exclusive title for the Nintendo Switch 2, The Duskbloods, during today’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. The trailer drew immediate comparisons to the developer’s Sony exclusive, Bloodborne.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-switch-2-isn-t-getting-bloodborne-so-they-got-their-own-version-in-the-duskbloods">The Switch 2 Isn’t Getting Bloodborne, So They Got Their Own Version in The Duskbloods</h2>



<p>FromSoftware and The Duskbloods were given the final slot in the third-party partners showcase, and for good reason. The trailer started with the typical dark, gothic imagery and mood of a Bloodborne game, and when the FromSoftware logo appeared, fans thought the unthinkable had happened.</p>



<p>The trailer showcased more of the environments and enemies that will appear, as well as some more advanced technologies like a steam-powered jetpack and dual wield submachine guns. During the trailer, the player either summons an NPC familiar ally or a co-op partner, but it’s unclear which yet. Finally at the end, fans were given a title: The Duskbloods, plus a look at a cute but terrifying large rat-bird hybrid adorned with glyphs.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While several of the games announced at the Direct were promised at the Switch 2 launch date, June 5th, The Duskbloods trailer only gave a release window of 2026. More information on the new game from FromSoftware will be announced via a Creator’s Voice article from director Hidetaka Miyazaki. That article will be published on the Nintendo website on April 4th.</p>
