<p>The director of Pokémon Pokopia has revealed how many hours players would spend in the game and that experiences await after the end credits. </p>



<p>Pokémon Pokopia was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-announced-for-2026-nintendo-switch-2-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> for the Switch 2 during the Pokémon Presents showcase last year. Since then, we have received the March 4 release date for the title and a new trailer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-trailer-reveals-new-pikachu-snorlax-variants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featuring Pikachu and Snorlax variants</a>. Also, a leak has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leaks-confirm-pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalyptic-fan-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed the theory</a> about Pokémon Pokopia taking place in a post-apocalyptic world.Now, the developers have finally revealed some new information about the upcoming title. </p>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-pokopia-will-be-about-20-40-hours-long">Pokémon Pokopia Will be About 20-40 Hours Long</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://in.ign.com/pokemon-pokopia/252940/news/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-dire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Pokémon Pokopia director Takuto Edagawa discussed the gameplay hours for the upcoming title and the experiences after the end credits. Edagawa explained that the title’s motive is “typically not to go to the end roll [credits].” The concept is to craft a world where you can spend your time with Pokémon. </p>



<p>However, on average, the title is expected to take 20 to 40 hours, though it really depends on how players approach it. Players will have “more things to experience after the end roll [credits].” The director believes players will be encouraged and motivated to keep playing the game after the end credits. Do you want more content, or does 20 to 40 hours seem enough? </p>

<p>NetEase has praised AI integration across the full game development and gameplay innovation cycle in their latest earnings release. </p>



<p>For those unaware, it was claimed around a week ago by Grasshopper Manufacture’s founder that NetEase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-has-told-their-studios-not-to-use-ai-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn’t allow any of their internal studios use AI</a>. However, NetEase was quick to debunk the claim, stating that “the situation described did not occur”. Now, the company has revealed its stance on AI, and it seems to be loving it. </p>



<h2 id="h-netease-has-comprehensively-integrated-ai-across-full-game-development">NetEase has Comprehensively Integrated AI Across Full Game Development</h2>



<p>In the operational highlights section of its <a href="https://ir.netease.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netease-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025-unaudited" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earnings release</a>, NetEase announced that it successfully achieved comprehensive integration of AI across the entire game development and gameplay innovation cycle. This integration encompasses art, design, programming, animation, and quality assurance. It enables high-volume, scalable production and facilitates the smooth implementation of dynamic, AI-native gameplay features across several flagship titles.</p>



<p>The CEO and director of NetEase, William Ding, stated that AI has become the “foundational competency for our development and operations,” significantly improving production efficiency and creating new interactive experiences. The developer’s future plans are to foster a creative talent ecosystem, deepen collaboration with partners worldwide, and thoughtfully advance AI-application capabilities.” </p>



<p><strong>Check out William Ding’s full statement below: </strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“We concluded 2025 with another healthy quarter, reflecting the durability of our long-term game operations and the growing impact of our global titles. </em></p>



<p><em>AI has become a foundational competency for our development and operations. We have been systematically applying AI throughout game development and gameplay, where it is already driving meaningful improvement in production efficiency and unlocking new interactive experiences for our players that were previously out of reach.</em></p>



<p><em>Looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering exceptional experiences across the&nbsp;NetEase family of businesses. By fostering a creative talent ecosystem, deepening collaboration with partners worldwide and thoughtfully advancing our AI-application capabilities, we aim to further extend the longevity of our franchises while continuing to deliver innovative experiences to create even greater value for our global players and shareholders alike.”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Talking about the games and related value-added services numbers, the net revenue for this category was RMB27.5 billion (US$3.9 billion), a 3.0% increase compared to the same quarter in 2024. </p>
