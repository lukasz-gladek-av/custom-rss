<p>Marvel has released the launch trailer for Marvel Rivals, which launches worldwide on December 5. The trailer, which is reminiscent of an anime opening sequence, showcases many of the hero characters coming to the game, and there are a few easter eggs and references sprinkled in for good measure.</p>



<p>It’s an energetic trailer that has fans stoked for what’s to come. Check it out below.</p>

<p>I love the trailer for Marvel Rivals – particularly the sequence that unfolds midway through showcasing a gaggle of characters replicating the iconic group shot seen in 2012’s The Avengers.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer to add a little more fuel to your hype train:</p>

<p>On YouTube, a trailer for a cancelled LEGO James Bond project that would have been developed by TT Games has emerged. It’s only 50 seconds long, but it showcases a game that was reportedly scrapped several years ago, about the time when LEGO Dimensions was discontinued.</p>



<p>It has been claimed online that the game was being pieced together during ‘the last year LEGO Dimensions was being worked on’ in 2016, but it was ultimately decided that James Bond wasn’t a suitable franchise to focus on due to the ‘violence and sexual innuendo’ that the series is famed for.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-brick-by-brick">Brick by Brick</h2>



<p>LEGO has dabbled with many game-based franchises over the years, ranging from Star Wars to Indiana Jones, but it never delivered a James Bond project. Given the expansiveness of the JB universe, it seems as though a LEGO series would write itself – and with the release of this leaked trailer, we now know how close we came to that being realised.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer that was released on YouTube (live at the time of publishing):</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Leaked Unreleased LEGO James Bond Game Trailer - FINAL VERSION (READ DESCRIPTION)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QkSR8L8Gjwc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The trailer showcases iconic scenes from various James Bond projects, and for something that was scrapped quite early on, it looks relatively polished. It seems as though it was set to be a fully voiced game, which was starting to be the standard for LEGO games around the time that LEGO JB was reportedly being developed.</p>



<p>Sadly, LEGO James Bond was lost to the abyss of time and won’t ever see the light of day.</p>

<p>Ella Purnell, one of the faces of the Fallout TV show that debuted on Prime this year, is soaking up source material in anticipation of the show’s second season. Purnell, who plays Lucy MacLean, fronted the Emmy Award-winning show when the first season was released in April, working alongside Walton Goggins and Aaron Moten to bring the post-apocalyptic universe to life.</p>



<p>In a string of posts on social media, Purnell revealed that she’s been instructed to play Fallout: New Vegas to ‘prep for a certain job I may or may not be on soon’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-the-wasteland">Back to the Wasteland</h2>



<p>Fallout premiered in April 2024 to an overwhelmingly positive reception, emerging as one of Prime’s biggest launches ever. It proved to be a boon for the entire franchise, as player counts soared across everything from Fallout 4 to the online title, Fallout 76. It was a resurgence of sorts for the series, and for a while, Fallout mania was running wild.</p>



<p>On Bluesky, Ella Purnell posted that she’s playing Fallout: New Vegas – on Xbox – in preparation for filming the show’s second season, which was due to start in November but may have been delayed, if Purnell’s post is anything to go by.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Purnell responded to some fan requests to head north through Quarry Junction after starting the game, realising several hours later how much of a mistake that was. New Vegas veterans will understand why that’s such a problem.</p>



<p>This morning, Purnell posted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Obviously time isn’t on my side to absorb all the source material in time. I will still absorb the game until I’m called to the wasteland.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fallout: New Vegas is considered the best game in the series by many, and we <strong>know </strong>that it’s the setting for the second season per the closing moments of the show’s first season.</p>
