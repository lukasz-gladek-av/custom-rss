<p>The use of AI in video game development has been—and continues to be—a hotly debated topic among developers and players. </p>



<p>In its annual gaming report, Unity claims that 79% of the developers polled feel at least somewhat positive about AI’s impact on the gaming industry. More specifically, of the 300 respondents to the question, 48% felt somewhat positive while another 31% said they were “extremely positive” towards its use in game development.</p>



<p>“After ChatGPT hit the market, generative AI tools were suddenly everywhere, and a lot of game developers and other creators seemed apprehensive at first&nbsp;–&nbsp;but today, 79% of devs polled report feeling positive about using AI in gaming, while a mere 5% are apprehensive,” the report reads.</p>



<p>“Developers would benefit from AI tools that simplify playtesting and automate bug detection,” Pixonic marketing director Sola Saulenko said. “Additionally, AI-powered solutions for localization and quick translations of ad copy, or even generating initial sketches for concept art, could save significant time and resources.”</p>



<p>As far as the use of AI tools is concerned, that has held steady across the industry despite a growing positive sentiment. According to the survey, some usage of AI, for example in adaptive difficulty, as dropped while other areas such as automated playtesting has slightly increased.</p>

<p>“Devs report picking up AI tools at a similar rate to last year, but AI applications and use cases have matured considerably in the interim,” the survey reads. “They’ve grown faster and are better trained, and we as users have honed our ability to guide generative AI toward desired results as AI use has grown normalized.”</p>



<p>Lastly, regarding adoption of AI tools, only 4% of those asked said they aren’t planning to use AI tools in any capacity in 2025.

<p>When you play Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you’ll regularly come across buildings identified as ‘Kakurega’, but what are they and how do you unlock more of them? In this guide, I’m going to dive into the topic of Kakuregas and highlight how they help your playthrough. They’re super important, and you’ll want to acquire as many as possible.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything about what a Kakurega is in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-does-a-kakurega-do-in-ac-shadows">What Does a Kakurega Do in AC Shadows?</h2>



<p>Kakurega are small buildings that you’ll unlock all across the world in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and they serve as micro ‘bases’. They’re points at which you can restore your supplies, regenerate your Scouts, amend your Hideout, and accept Contracts. They also act as fast travel points, which is almost certainly what you’ll end up using them for.</p>



<p>Each Kakurega offers a tactical location at which you can generate more side missions or unlock more Scouts to search for objectives or smuggle back resources to your Hideout. I’ve covered everything you need to know about Scouts in another guide.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-more-kakuregas-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">How to Unlock More Kakuregas in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<p>If you want more Kakuregas in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you’ll need to have plenty of Mon, which is the money in this game. To unlock a Kakurega, you’ll first need to discover it on your journey, and once it’s marked on your map, you need to pay 800 Mon <strong>for each Kakurega </strong>to unlock it.</p>



<p>I’m not sure how many there are, but I managed to unlock more than a dozen in my first few hours of play – they’re <strong>everywhere,</strong> and they’re extremely helpful. </p>



<p>You’ll start the game with a core Kakurega in your Hideout in Tomika’s Homestead, but that isn’t one you’ll frequently visit – it’s much better to acquire Kakuregas on the road as you uncover the map.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is finally here, almost six months after it was supposed to be released. As a fan of the franchise since day one, I’ve been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this open-world adventure set at the heart of feudal Japan, an era that players have been requesting for <strong>many years</strong>. It’s finally here, and I’ve already logged stacks of time exploring my authentic, dual-protagonist journey.</p>



<p>This game is great, but it’s not perfect. It’s one of the best ‘modern’ Assassin’s Creed games in the series, boasting the RPG mechanics and the gargantuan open-world environment we’ve come to expect from these titles since 2017’s AC Origins was released. But that doesn’t mean it’s going to land well with every fan – myself included.</p>



<p>Read on and check out my full Assassin’s Creed Shadows review to understand what I mean.</p>



<p>Feel free to check out the video version of this review if you’d rather digest it that way:</p>

<h2 id="h-saved-by-the-world">Saved by the World</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has one of the most stunning worlds in franchise history. If there’s one thing I can say quite openly, it’s that 1579 Japan look <strong>gorgeous</strong>. The ability to move through seasons only adds to that beauty, allowing players to transition from the incredible colours of autumn to a world blanketed by a layer of snow in winter.</p>



<p>The world might feel overwhelming at first, but the pacing helps with that. Like in previous games, certain areas are considered off-limits until you’re tough enough to venture into them. And I mean <strong>off-limits</strong> – I found myself getting thoroughly humbled with a one-tap death from some hulking samurai because I crossed borders far too early more times than I can count.</p>



<p>It looks flawless on the surface, and everything from the weather systems to the dynamic day-night cycles works well. This is where my gripes with Assassin’s Creed Shadows start to surface, though.</p>



<p>For instance, wildlife is everywhere, but it seems far too random to make sense, and you can’t kill animals in this title, so the fauna doesn’t serve a purpose. Also, NPCs are going about their lives everywhere, but as with previous titles, they’re repetitive and <strong>never </strong>show any facial expressions, which always rubs me the wrong way.</p>



<p>If you choose to play via the non-guided mode, you’ll have to naturally explore the open world and find your objectives based on clues and tips, which is nice enough if you’ve got the time to do so. Exploring Japan in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is nice enough, and there’s plenty of scenery and hidden locations to uncover, but ultimately, it’s <strong>yet another enormous Assassin’s Creed map</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="h-variation-by-design">Variation by Design</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The dual-protagonist system is decent enough, and it offers a good spread between tactics. In 2015, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate was released with a similar operating model, but Jacob and Evie Frye didn’t feel different <strong>enough</strong>. In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Yasuke and Naoe are <strong>poles apart</strong>, and they couldn’t be more different if they tried.</p>



<p>Yasuke is cumbersome but immensely powerful and imposing. Naoe is at the other end of the spectrum – she’s light, agile, and stealthy, but much more susceptible to succumbing to a brutal death at the hands of enemies. I’ve stressed that Naoe is the most entertaining character to play as in series history. She’s so fast and fluid, and her combat mechanics are intense and so refreshing.</p>



<p>It’s a very intentional split, and you’re often given the choice to play through certain sequences as either character, but open-world exploration can be completed as you see fit. If you prefer the heavier hand of an armoured samurai, then opt for Yasuke, but if you want to control a speedy shinobi, then you’ll pick Naoe.</p>



<p>Even stingers, responses to each character, and parts of the soundtrack are unique depending on who you play as, which is another neat touch. </p>



<p>The acting between each character is also superb, with special props being given to Naoe’s actor, Masumi Tsunoda, who makes her major video game debut in Shadows.</p>



<p>There are plenty of weapons to get to grips with, abilities aplenty, and stacks of skills to learn. The ability system works similarly to every Assassin’s Creed game since 2017, but these aren’t demigod warriors, so they’re a little more bound to realism, which I love. I was never a fan of the mythical stuff.</p>



<p>One complaint I have about the combat mechanics is that finishing moves become very old, very fast. In a single fight, you might see the same finishing move play out several times, which isn’t a good look. The game has some of the best stealth mechanics in history, but the open combat sequences could be a bit better.</p>



<p>Also, Yasuke might be a phenomenal powerhouse, but my word, he is clumsy. As you sprint around, he’ll clash with <strong>everything </strong>from barrels to fences and from screens to doors, falling head over heels through every breakable object in the world.</p>

<h2 id="h-authentic-but-empty">Authentic but Empty</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>I’ve explained that the world in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is beautiful and a wonder to explore, but the meaningful content spread around the world is quite thin. Most of the side objectives I picked up as I explored were simple tick-box quests such as ‘Kill 100 Enemies in <strong>This </strong>Region’ or ‘Find 10 Things in <strong>This </strong>City’.</p>



<p>The core campaign is great and extremely cinematic. The soundtrack and the visuals mixed with the set pieces and acting all win top points from me, but it’s the side stuff that needs sharpening. There’s just not a lot of weight to the filler content. The side contracts, the Shadows Projects, the collectable hunting – it’s all just bland and quickly becomes boring.</p>



<p>Do I really want to kill 100 bandits in a certain area five times to unlock a new hat? Probably not.</p>



<p>There is a <strong>lot </strong>of side content, from assaulting enemy castles to finding spontaneous missions from NPCs, but once you’ve done it all a few times, you’re left not wanting to do it again – but you <strong>need to </strong>if you want to unlock everything. </p>



<p>If you want to eliminate every target that pops up, you’ll be in for a pretty tough time, too. As I dug into Assassin’s Creed Shadows, I found myself constantly finding more circles of enemies to assassinate:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a similar story with the base-building elements of the game. You can build a full-fledged Hideout complete with multiple, open-ended buildings, ornaments, trees, rocks, and so on. It’s great, but I feel that the requirements for constructing certain buildings are unrealistic and such a grind, casting a pall over a feature that I was looking forward to.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’ve spent hours in photomode capturing every angle of this idyllic, incredible world, but there’s only so much depth you can get from snapping photos in a fairly empty world.</p>

<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s enough meat on the bones here to justify the purchase, and the game’s visuals, stunning world, and cinematic campaign all contribute to my recommending the title. However, the cracks in the game’s foundations are evident, the flaws that have existed for years are front and centre, and it’s not enough of a change from the formula that we’ve known for years to feel <strong>all that different</strong>.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is technically sound and authentic and represents a world that fans of the franchise have wanted to explore for many years. The artistic choices are great, the soundtrack is impressive, and the ambience is stellar, plus Naoe makes for a phenomenal lead, but there are just too many niggling flaws for me to consider this a perfect title.</p>



<p>Buy it, but don’t expect anything too different from the last game – or the one that’ll probably follow this one.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the latest open-world epic in Ubisoft’s flagship franchise, and it teleports players to Japan in 1579. It’s a game set at the height of a disruptive, conflict-laden era, and with a dual-protagonist system fronted by both a samurai and a shinboi, the player finds themselves at the heart of that conflict.</p>



<p>I’m here to give you the ins and outs of the Assassin’s Creed Shadows story before you jump in.</p>



<p>Without further ado, what <strong>is </strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows about, and where does it fit into the overall landscape?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-explained">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Explained</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows opens up in and around 1579 in feudal Japan. The legendary daimyo, Oda Nobunaga, is seeking to unify the clans of Japan with an iron fist, but he’s being challenged by foreign oppressors and rebellious organisations lurking in the country’s shadows.</p>



<p>The game, which explores the late Sengoku period, tells the tale of Oda Nobunaga and those close to him, revealing plots and shady cabals working to bring down the would-be ruler and overthrow him and his people. The player will assume control of two protagonists – an honourable African samurai named Yasuke and a young but capable shinobi named Naoe.</p>



<p>Their stories, which start entirely separate, will intertwine as the game unfolds.</p>



<p>Players will explore nine regions of Japan, all of which are steeped in history, architecture, art, politics, and culture. From the hills of Iga to the monasteries of Yamato, and from the mountains of Tamba to the seascape of Wakasa, players will dive into a massive open-world environment in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>In typical Assassin’s Creed fashion, the player will be charged with taking down vast arrays of enemies. They’ll need to disrupt conspiracies, eliminate malicious groups, and topple powerful warlords. They’ll do this by assembling a network of confidants, utilising a range of period-accurate weaponry, and striking from every angle.</p>



<p>Players will ultimately learn about Naoe’s familial connection to the Assassin Brotherhood, discovering how and why she has acquired a hidden blade and why she has the typical talents of an assassin, like eagle vision.</p>



<p>It’s not to be missed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/towerborne-xbox-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Xbox has announced that Towerborne will be launching on Xbox Game Preview on April 29. The game will be available on Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC via the Xbox app, and Game Pass all on the same day.</p>



<p>The announcement came via the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/18/towerborne-game-pass-xbox-game-preview-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Xbox channels</a>, with the game also being available for press at this weeks GDC event.</p>



<p>Alongside the release on Xbox, Towerborne will get new features such as cross-platform play and progression between PC and Xbox consoles, couch co-op on Xbox consoles, and a new class skills progression system.</p>



<p>“Probably the biggest change to the game itself, Class Mastery is an all-new progression system that makes every Ace unique, based on individual player choices,” Xbox says. “By completing missions, players earn Skill Points, allowing you to fine-tune your chosen class, unlocking Focus Skills and Class Mechanics that drastically change how you play. And don’t worry, you can swap your Skill Points freely between missions, meaning you can experiment and find the perfect build.”</p>



<p>Developed by Stoic and published by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/xbox-game-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Studios</a>, Towerborne first released on PC in early access in September 2024. Despite early strong impressions, the game had only hit a peak concurrent player count of 596 on Steam, with only 12 concurrent players playing at the time of writing.</p>



<p>Towerborne is a side-scrolling action-role playing game where the player takes control of the heroes of the game called ‘Aces’, who must set out to reclaim lost territories and make the land of Belfry safe. </p>



<p>Will you be playing Towerborne? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
