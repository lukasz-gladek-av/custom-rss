<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is bringing back some fan-favorite Black Ops 2 maps for Season One of the game.</p>



<p>Releasing on November 14th, Black Ops 7 continues the Black Ops series name, as well as its story. Players will finally reunite with the Mason family from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 2</a> and witness another mind-bending narrative, now with friends. However, it seems the story isn‚Äôt the only thing coming back, as two remastered maps from Black Ops 2 are returning for the new entry, as said by Activision.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1981421047376465996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Dev Talk</a> with the team at Treyarch, the team revealed two Black Ops 2 maps returning for Black Ops 7 as part of Season One: Meltdown and Standoff. Each map will be remastered and available as part of the next batch of maps, though a release date was not given. Standoff did join Black Ops: Cold War‚Äôs roster of maps during Season Three, acting as both a Multiplayer map and Zombies map. However, Meltdown has not been in the series since Black Ops 2 back in 2012, so fans will be excited to return to the nuclear powerplant.</p>



<p>The Season One roadmap for Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was revealed today</a> as part of the Dev Talk. Seven maps, including Meltdown and Standoff, will will release during the season, with more to come later. Three other Zombies maps, two being Survival, are also coming in Season One. The team is calling the new season its biggest yet and based on what we can tell, it sure seems to be. Either way, both new and returning players are in for a treat when it releases on November 14th.</p>

<p>The full roadmap for Season One of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has been revealed by Activision.</p>



<p>Launching on November 14th, Black Ops 7 is the latest installment in the iconic FPS series. Putting an emphasis on Multiplayer, the game is set to hone in on what fans want when it comes to the series. Furthermore, the series returns to the futuristic settings of games past, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-not-have-jetpacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though without jetpacks</a>. With the release fast approaching, the team has shown off what players can expect at launch, as well as Season One.</p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The biggest year in Black Ops history starts with BO7 launch, and it's just the beginning.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1981422889497690225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Twitter/X post</a>, Activision revealed the content of the launch and Season One of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. At release, the game will have 18 Multiplayer maps and two Zombie maps for players to enjoy. A week later, the iconic Nuketown will make a return, nicknamed Nuketown 2025. After that, six maps, including Meltdown and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-showcase-tokyo-game-show-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previously revealed Yakei</a>, will come out. More maps are expected to be revealed at a later date. Furthermore, three new Zombies maps will be included in Season One, including two Survival ones.</p>



<p>Given that the game will launch on Xbox Game Pass, like Black Ops 6, it‚Äôs sure to be quite the hit. However, the decision may hurt sales, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-sales-microsoft-cost-millions-game-pass-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it did last year</a> for Microsoft/Xbox. Even still, with the success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, it‚Äôs clear the genre still has some juice in it. While the open beta didn‚Äôt go too well in terms of numbers, Black Ops 7 remains a heavily anticipated title for many. Fortunately, it seems it‚Äôll be supported for long after November 14th, should it all go well.</p>



<p>What do you think of Black Ops 7‚Äôs Season One Roadmap? Any maps you can‚Äôt wait to play in? Will you be getting the game at launch?

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Datamine Reveals Battle Royale is to Release on October 28th]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-datamine/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-datamine-reveals-battle-royale-is-to-release-on-october-28th.1333198/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A datamine for Battlefield 6 has revealed that the highly anticipated Battle Royale is currently set to launch on October 28th, 2025. The strings of code which have been posted online refer to a mode codename ‚ÄúGranite‚Äù, which Insidier Gaming can verify is the Battle Royale gamemode.</p>



<p>First leaked by <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ModernWarzone</a>, who revealed that the mode will have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 28th release date</a>, he took to X (formerly Twitter) today to reveal that code within the game files also now confirms his past reports.</p>



<p>In a follow-up tweet, he posted the strings of code revealing that Granite, the codename for the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale, is currently set to go live during the Season 1 release on October 28.</p>



<p>Of course, things are indeed subject to change, but ModernWarzone‚Äôs confidence, especially over the last couple of days around the date, tells us that he‚Äôs almost certainly not wrong. While Insider Gaming isn‚Äôt currently able to independently verify the news, it‚Äôs certainly looking like a shadowdrop of the mode is on the horizon.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play">Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Free to Play</h2>



<p>Insider Gaming first exclusively reported on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Battle Royale</a> in February 2024, which we reported at the time that it was planned to be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free-to-play experience</a>. At the time of writing, Battlefield Studios has only confirmed the game mode‚Äôs existence and hasn‚Äôt said when it will release or whether it will be free-to-play.</p>



<p>That said, we likely don‚Äôt have long to wait before hearing more.</p>
