<p>The next God of War game could be making its way to Egypt. According to a report from DanielRPK (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/120905575?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paywall</a>), Sony is casting currently casting for Middle Eastern Actors for a new game.</p>



<p>“Sony is casting Middle Eastern actors for an unknown AAA game, which is likely to be the next God of War that explores Egyptian mythology,” the report says.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that this information hasn’t been confirmed or independently verified by Insider Gaming. Until that happens, please take this news with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Moving to Egyptian mythology wouldn’t be surprising should it happen. The God of War saga began in Greek mythology before shifting to Norse for the modern games. Moving to a new pantheon would make sense for next era of the franchise. </p>



<p>As far as Egyptian specifically, it’s been mentioned in the past (h/t <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-new-god-of-war-game-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>) that Sony Santa Monica originally considered centering the game around Egyptian mythology for the 2018 revival before settling on Norse.</p>



<p>“I think the first pitch I gave was that we wouldn’t even know what was happening,” creative director <a href="https://youtu.be/ra_R-K_IoUc?si=Exzp3X0DfFld-6pZ&amp;t=1192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cory Barlog said</a>. “So i t was Kratos walking through the desert—because we were, in my mind, still doing Egypt initially—wind, sand blowing all over the place as he’s kind of crawling through and then kind of stands up over a dune and checks out this really fantastic ancient city.”</p>

<p>The WWE 2K25 cover has been officially revealed. As expected from the first tease earlier this month, Roman Reigns will grace the cover of the Standard edition of the game.</p>



<p>The Undertaker will feature on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-deadman-edition-undertaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadman Edition</a> while the entire Bloodline will be included on the Bloodline edition of the game.</p>

<p>This is the second time Reigns will be featured on the game’s base cover, and the first time as the only wrestler. Both he and Becky Lynch were on the cover of WWE 2K20 back in 2019. This time around, however, he’s joined by his “Wiseman” Paul Heyman just outside of the ring.</p>



<p>You can check out the Standard Edition covers and the first trailer for the game, below.</p>

<p>With the cover finally shown, all that’s left is for the full reveal of the game. Luckily, fans won’t have to wait long as full details on the game will be announced on Tuesday, January 28.</p>

<p>BLAST has officially revealed the dates for the BLAST.tv Austin Counter-Strike 2 Major, which will be the first Major played in North America in more than seven years. The Austin Major will be the third since the release of CS2, but it will certainly be a historic one with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-confirms-cs2-major-expansion-and-rankings-based-invitations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the expansion of both the format and the number of invited teams</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/phoenix-labs-layoffs-closure/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-lays-off-50-more-employees-with-studio-likely-to-close.1093191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/phoenix-labs-layoffs-closure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The remainder of Phoenix Labs developers have been laid off, with the studios game ‘Dauntless’ and it’s studio likely to close.</p>



<p>Speaking with now past-employee’s at the studio, it’s understood that around 50 employees have been made redundant today. Several of those employee’s now believe that the Dauntless game is now dead, and that Phoenix Labs is likely to shut down, although Parent company Forte has yet to make such an announcement.</p>



<p>According to those familiar with the situation, no one at Phoenix Labs still has a job with one person saying it was “surprising” that it was announced as round of layoffs instead of a studio closure.</p>



<p>Forte, a blockchain company, acquired Phoenix Labs around summer 2023 and in May 2024 made more than 100 of its staff redundant. Forte was asked to comment, but did not supply one in time ahead of publication. </p>



<p>Following the internal announcement, Phoenix Labs staff took to their Dauntless Discord server to make the announcement of redundancies, where it was said that “Earlier today, the majority of our development team was impacted by significant reductions at Phoenix Labs. This has been a heartbreaking decision for us, and we are deeply saddened for the talented individuals who are affected.”</p>



<p>The statement continued, “We know you may have questions about what this means for Dauntless and its future. While we don’t have all the answers at this time, we are committed to keeping you informed and will share updates as soon as we can.”</p>



<p>“Your support means the world to us, and we are truly grateful for this incredible community. Thank you for standing with us during this challenging time,” it concluded.</p>



<p>Phoenix Labs was founded in April 2014 and is best known for Fae Farm and Dauntless, with the company also having had multiple games in development before being cancelled by Forte after the studios acquisition. </p>



<p>The latest rounds of layoffs put 2025’s count well over&nbsp;<a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">500 known jobs lost</a>, with estimates having it over 700.

<p>Like its name, the upcoming Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is somewhat obscure. It’s a story-rich role-playing game with turn-based and real-time mechanics set in a world inspired by the Belle Epoque France. From what we’ve seen, it looks phenomenal, but only time will tell. For now, let’s explore the various Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 editions and pre-order information!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-included-in-the-clair-obscur-expedition-33-editions">Every Included in the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Editions</h2>



<p>There are four versions of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to pre-order, from the basic standard edition, which includes the game itself, to the collector’s edition, which features physical items, like a hardcover artbook and music box.</p>
