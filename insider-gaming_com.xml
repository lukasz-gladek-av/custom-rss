            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A live-action <strong>Far Cry TV series</strong> has been <strong>officially announced</strong> for FX. Furthermore, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-tv-show-appears-on-ubisoft-site-is-removed-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as the rumors suggested</a>, the brains behind Alien: Earth and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia are working on it.</p>







<p>The Far Cry series has been a staple of the survival FPS genre since its first release in 2004. Since then, each entry has reinvented itself as an anthology, going to various locations around the world. However, it’s great shooting and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-far-cry-games-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often brilliant villains</a> (portrayed by big-name actors like Giancarlo Esposito and Troy Baker) keep fans coming back. While it’s been four years since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry’s last release</a>, Far Cry 6, we now have a new official project: a primetime TV show.</p>



<h2 id="h-fx-s-far-cry-tv-show-announced-created-by-noah-hawley-and-rob-mac">FX’s Far Cry TV Show Announced, Created by Noah Hawley and Rob Mac</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/far-cry-tv-series-fx-noah-hawley-rob-mac-1236591190/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">broke the news first</a>, announcing that <strong>FX has ordered a Far Cry TV series</strong>. It’ll be <strong>executive-produced</strong> by Alien: Earth and Fargo director <strong>Noah Hawley</strong> and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia actor <strong>Rob Mac</strong>. In the article, it’s mentioned that <strong>the show will be an anthology</strong>, like the games, in that <strong>each season will have a different cast and story</strong>. For the first season, while details aren’t given, <strong>Rob Mac is set to star in it</strong>. The show is set to stream on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally. </p>



<p>Speaking on the collaboration, actor Rob Mac said the following,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realized,” states Mac. “Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition, Noah Hawley spoke to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/far-cry-tv-series-fx-noah-hawley-rob-mac-1236591190/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> on the Far Cry show, saying,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“What I love about the ‘Far Cry’ game franchise is it’s an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of ‘Fargo’ is a variation on a theme,” Hawley says. “To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I’m excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, no date or additional casting has been announced as of yet. Still, given both Rob and Noah’s history with FX, Far Cry seems to be in very good hands. As a fan, it’ll be interesting to see where the first season goes. </p>

<p>Use these Roblox Last Letter monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free spins and much more.</p>



<p>Last Letter is a wordplay-based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-blade-x-zombies-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that shares the same environmental design as the prominent shooter title Rivals. The gameplay depends entirely on your knowledge of words and the overall English lexicon. While this can be a strong way to win, you’ll also need Styles. Styles are in-game features that provide users with special abilities that can be used mid-game or strategically, especially when you’re losing. Redeem the active Last Letter codes to fill your treasury with free Spins. Use these Spins to obtain the best Styles and get a red-hot winning streak.</p>







<h2 id="h-active-last-letter-codes">Active Last Letter Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li>2KLIKES – 5 Spins (New)</li>

<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-last-letter-codes">How To Redeem Last Letter Codes?</h2>

<h2 id="h-more-about-last-letter-codes">More About Last Letter Codes</h2>



<p>Last Letter codes, upon redemption, offer free Spins. Spins are vital in Last Letter since they provide Styes. Styles are nothing but playstyles that enhance your avatar’s capabilities to perform better in all the letter game modes. There are different types of Styles, each with its own traits. For example, the Upside Down style is for a messy playstyle, where its ability turns the current word upside down for everyone. Similar to this, each Style, when used at the right time, will rewrite your game’s outcome.</p>







<p>The following are the chance percentages of all the Styles under their specific category:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Uncommon – 63%:</p>



<ol></ol>



<ol></ol>



<ul>

<p>Rare – 27%:</p>



<ul>
<li>Quick&nbsp;</li>



<li>Stealer&nbsp;</li>



<li>Upside Down</li>
</ul>



<p>Epic – 9%:</p>



<ul>
<li>Blocker&nbsp;</li>



<li>Mimic</li>



<li>Healer</li>



<li>Deleter</li>
</ul>



<p>Legendary – 1%:</p>



<ul>
<li>Finisher&nbsp;</li>



<li>Reverse</li>



<li>Skipper&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The Pity chance can expand up to 100 spins. The more Pity you have, the better your chances of landing on the finest Styles. All the Legendary and Epic Styles will boost your gameplay tactics and can turn the tables of any losing match.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/budapest-major-protestors-face-sabotage-bounty-from-casino-founder.1363423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you want to earn an easy $2,500, you’d better step up and identify who it was that protested Valve’s ‘censorship’ of Gamdom’s branding at the StarLadder Budapest Major. Hours ago, footage surfaced online of protestors wielding ‘f*** Valve’ signs and demanding that the company reinstate Imperial’s new logo sticker, which featured Gamdom branding.</p>



<p>The group wore t-shirts that identified them as Gamdom representatives, but the casino’s founder came out on social media to suggest it was an act of sabotage by a competitor, and promised $2,500 for information leading to the identification of the wrongdoers.</p>



<h2 id="h-and-it-s-only-the-first-stage">And It’s Only The First Stage</h2>



<p>Images and videos surfaced online showing six protestors at the StarLadder Budapest Major, a $1.25 million Counter-Strike 2 tournament. These protestors wore shirts that spelled ‘Modmag’, which is Gamdom backwards, and they were there to ‘protest’ the recent change by Valve that removed a gambling reference from Imperial Esports’ sticker.</p>



<p>As if it wasn’t bad enough that the event had already been hit with audio issues and the incorrect lining up of highlight clips by the stream’s editors.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip from a channel on social media:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>😒 Another ""riot"" accident on CS Major grounds — this time the casino behind the Imperial team hired protestors with "FUCK VALVE" signs.  </p><p>Valve recently reverted the Imperial logo to the old one, as their current logo is a casino one.   </p><p>The video is blurred for ethical… <a href="https://t.co/pctUq85vwy">pic.twitter.com/pctUq85vwy</a></p></div>— CS2 NEWS (@CS2News_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/CS2News_EN/status/1992940298142363935?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>In a shocking response, the founder of Gamdom, <strong>Felix Römer</strong>, commented under the post declaring the protest an act of sabotage by a competing casino.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/GamdomHowly/status/1992952514124411390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">He wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is NOT Gamdom or Imperial “protesting” This is an effort to sabotage us more by a competitor Paying a $2.5k bounty per person that is identified here holding up the signs, we are going to take legal action, this bs doesn’t belong to the majors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, fans of the Counter-Strike scene were quick to pick apart <strong>Römer</strong>, suggesting that it’s <strong>his company </strong>that doesn’t belong in the competitive gaming scene.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Everything We Know About Playboi Carti Fortnite Skin]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playboi-carti-fortnite-skin/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-we-know-about-playboi-carti-fortnite-skin.1363390/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nothing is off the table for Fortnite anymore, so when it’s rumored that a Playboi Carti Fortnite skin could be added to the in-game store, it’s believable. Here’s the latest on the Playboi Carti Fortnite Skin leak, if it’s true, and more.</p>



<p><em>Another </em>small-fry name has been outed for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-hour-chapter-6-finale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>: A small-time rapper with nearly 50 million followers on Spotify, number one albums, and a bunch of other successes. Obvious banter aside, Playboi Carti has established themself as one of the most prominent and mainstream rap artists on the planet.</p>



<p>What could be bigger than Playboi Carti? Why, a collaboration between Fortnite and Playboi Carti. Let’s see if it’s true.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-playboi-carti-coming-to-fortnite">Is Playboi Carti Coming To Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It could be one for the album. Credit to AWGE &amp; Interscope</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Multiple leaks indicated that Playboi Carti was indeed on the way to Fortnite with at least one skin as part of a unique crossover, and then the rapper themself seemed to confirm the collab on Instagram.</strong></p>



<p>Usual leaker Shiina was one of many to suggest a Playboi Carti skin was coming at the very least. The official Playboi Carti Instagram posted a very interesting image to the rapper’s story to bolster the claim.</p>



<p>It’s a very simple and obvious clue: <strong>A giant Fortnite logo</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unless this is either a giant coincidence or evil trolling, it’s safe to assume that Playboi Carti is coming to the live-service shooter in one form or another.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-playboi-carti-content-will-be-included-in-fortnite">Which Playboi Carti Content Will Be Included In Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>The Playboi Carti content isn’t official, but leaks indicate that the game is receiving at least one Playboi Carti skin, and perhaps even a special in-game event to go with it.</strong></p>



<p>Happy Power thinks a skin is a guarantee, and says the content: “Will feature the ‘Evil Jordan’ outfit as well. </p>



<p>The attire in question relates to Playboi Carti’s song Evil Jordan, where the singer has a Batman/demon-esuqe head garment, with a red bandana and other eye-catching qualities.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Kurrco has gone one better and claimed an ‘In-game event’ is also planned.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Until anything is official, take any information with a pinch of salt. But it would be another in the never-ending conveyor belt of crossovers and special skins if it happens.</p>



<p>Where would a Playboi Carti bundle or special items rank on your wanted list? Is Epic and Fortnite’s pulling power officially unlimited?
