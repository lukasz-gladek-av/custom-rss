<p>Use these Roblox Dungeon Hunters monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Gems and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlocking new worlds and clearing every chapter in Dungeon Hunters takes a lot of grinding. As you progress, newly unlocked Worlds become tougher, forcing you to level up, deal more damage, equip better armor, and unlock stronger gear. To speed things up, you can redeem the active Dungeon Hunters codes to earn free Gems. Gems are instrumental since they’re used to summon weapon cases, giving you access to stronger weapons early on. With the right weapons from free Gems, you can clear even the toughest dungeons without spending hours in this thrilling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-spear-fishing-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience.</p>

<p>Epic Games may have wrapped up for Christmas, but there is still one more treat in store for players with the release of an IShowSpeed Icon Series skin tomorrow, leaks state.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s huge string of collabs has continued for the festive season, with the likes of Hatsune Miku, Sabrina Carpenter, Harry Potter, and SpongeBob SquarePants joining the game, and there’s set to be another Icon Series skin on Christmas Eve.</p>







<h2 id="h-ishowspeed-coming-to-fortnite">IShowSpeed Coming to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Flipping onto the scene. Image via YouTube</figcaption></figure>



<p>Reports of a new Icon Series coming to Fortnite first came from <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/2003471578747797877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a>, who speculated that it would be IShowSpeed receiving the special treatment, and other established leaks, including <a href="https://x.com/FireMonkey/status/2003467431260385310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FireMonkey</a>, stated that it would indeed be the popular streamer who joins the Icon Series gang.</p>



<p>Rumors of an IShowSpeed skin in Fortnite started to emerge after the streamer responded to a question asking what his stream scheduled for December 24th would be about, which he stated would see him “go back to my first stream ever.”</p>



<p>IShowSpeed’s first stream was playing Fortnite, and his comments now align with the leaks of a new treat that will be added to the Item Shop just in time for Christmas.</p>



<p>However, while the collab will include the usual Outfits, Back Blings, Pickaxes, Gliders, and even a Jam Track, there won’t be any emotes in the bundle, a decision that will raise eyebrows considering the huge amount of popular memes IShowSpeed has become famous for, including his barking, backflip, and imitation of Cristiano Ronaldo’s Siu celebration.</p>



<p>Official confirmation of the Icon Series addition and pricing of the individual items and the bundle have yet to be revealed, with it likely that it will be Speed himself that unveils the skin, following the trend showcased with previous reveals in the past.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Anime Final Quest monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including cash, draws and much more.</p>



<p>Anime Final Quest is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-universal-tower-defense-codes/">Roblox</a> action RPG where players take on story missions, fight enemies inspired by popular anime worlds, and build a powerful roster of characters. Instead of running a business or placing structures, players spend their time clearing stages, defeating enemies, and tackling bosses to unlock stronger fighters. Team composition matters heavily, as different characters bring unique skills and strengths to battles.</p>







<p>Progression in this Roblox game depends on resources earned through quest completion, daily activities, and special events. These materials are primarily used for character summons, enhancements, and evolutions that increase overall team power. While steady play rewards consistent progress, redeemable codes provide a shortcut by granting free currency and bonuses, allowing players to summon more characters and strengthen their lineup without sinking hours into repetitive grinding.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-anime-final-quest-codes">How To Get More Anime Final Quest Codes</h2>



<p>Anime Final Quest codes are most commonly shared through the game’s official Discord server, the Roblox game page, and occasionally on the developer’s social media channels. The Discord community is particularly active, with developers frequently posting new codes. Therefore, the best place to find new codes is the Anime Final Quest Discord. However, tracking all these platforms can be challenging, especially since there’s no alert system to notify players when codes expire.</p>



<p>Therefore, we recommend bookmarking this guide in your browser, as it is regularly updated with the latest codes and removes expired ones promptly, ensuring you always have access to valid codes.</p>

<p>During a new interview, Bloober Team’s CEO revealed some minor details about their Nintendo-exclusive game, Project M. </p>



<p>Bloober Team’s CEO discussed several topics, including bringing Cronos: The New Dawn to Nintendo Switch 2, considering the possibility of their other games coming to the new console, and more. He also revealed that the mysterious Project M is only possible on Nintendo hardware. </p>



<h2 id="h-project-m-has-a-twist-that-no-horror-game-has-explored-yet">Project M has a Twist that No Horror Game has Explored Yet</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/bloober-team-nintendo-switch-2-interview-ports-ue5-remake-ceo-piotr-babieno/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Insider</a>, Bloober Team’s CEO, Piotr Babieno, was asked what players should expect from the Nintendo-exclusive horror game, Project M. Babieno responded, stating that it is very tough for him “not to reveal what Project M truly is—but for now, it’s still too early to talk about it.” However, the developers are confident that they will be able to share the first details “very soon”. </p>



<p>Babieno provided some additional details before wrapping up the Project M topic. The CEO revealed that fans of Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Limbo, and Eternal Darkness will feel immediately at home with this game. Project M will introduce “a bold twist,” which is something that “no horror game has explored before.” Lastly, the “vision” for this game “could only exist on Nintendo hardware”, concluded the Bloober CEO. </p>



<p>In other news, Cronos: The New Dawn will receive an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-getting-a-new-difficulty-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">easier difficulty option</a> in early 2026. Additionally, Silent Hill 1 Remake is in full production at Bloober Team. What do you think about Project M’s vision being achievable only on Nintendo hardware?
