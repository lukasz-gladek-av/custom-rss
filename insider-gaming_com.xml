<p>Having inventory of extra PC RAM is going to be as valuable as having a stockpile of gold bars if trends continue at their current pace. Due to a claimed memory shortage across the industry, RAM prices have shot up exponentially over recent weeks. </p>



<p>It’s gotten to the point where buying a couple sticks of memory can cost more than a new GPU or even a fully priced video game console. </p>







<p>But how bad is the pricing situation, actually? Looking at storefronts like Newegg, and it paints a pretty dire picture for enthusiasts of all levels. Whether you just want one stick of 16GB or even 64GB for your new build, you better be ready to spend more than ever. Prices of memory have risen by as much as 250% since the beginning of November.</p>



<p>Below you can see just how much costs have gone up for consumers for anything from 16GB (2 x 8GB) to 64GB (2 x 32GB). And this specifically focuses on the current DDR5 generation of RAM.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>PC Memory</th><th>November 1 Price</th><th>November 26 Price</th><th>Percentage Increase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>16GB T-Force</td><td>$77.99</td><td>$177.99</td><td>128.2%</td></tr><tr><td>16GB Kingston Fury </td><td>$62.99</td><td>$149.99</td><td>138.1%</td></tr><tr><td>32GB T-Force</td><td>$96.99</td><td>$339.99</td><td>250.5%</td></tr><tr><td>32GB G.Skill Flare X5</td><td>$97.99</td><td>$269.99</td><td>175.5%</td></tr><tr><td>32GB Corsair Vengeance </td><td>$142.99</td><td>$406.99</td><td>184.6%</td></tr><tr><td>32GB G.Skill Trident Z5 NEO</td><td>$104.99</td><td>$279.99</td><td>166.7%</td></tr><tr><td>64GB Corsair Vengeance</td><td>$239.99</td><td>$839.99</td><td>250%</td></tr><tr><td>64GB G.Skill Trident Z5 NEO</td><td>$204.99</td><td>$629.99</td><td>207.3%</td></tr><tr><td>64GB G.Skill Flare X5</td><td>$204.99</td><td>$569.99</td><td>178%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As the data shows, the availability of memory has turned the market into a chaotic place. It’s even gotten so bad that some stores are starting to sell the components at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1p55n8k/taken_at_microcenter_on_1123/?utm_source=embedv2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“Market Price”</a>. That’s something usually saved for Lobster and other seafood. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to a number of RAM manufacturers about when they think the prices could come down. Every single person who spoke gave a similar answer of uncertainty. That’s because of the fact that, often times, when there’s a shortage, it could take months and even years to catch back up to meet the demand. It’s the truest form of going day-by-day and week-by-week there is.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-is-there-a-pc-memory-shortage">Why Is There A PC Memory Shortage?</h2>



<p>These price increases while seemingly sudden and extreme, shouldn’t come as a surprise for those who’ve been following what’s happening. For those who are unaware, however, there’s a big reason why RAM costs have gone up the way they have: AI.</p>



<p>As AI infrastructure continues to expand worldwide, the components needed like memory and storage are being bought up. And these companies are willing to pay higher prices for more product. That means there’s just not enough to keep up with average consumer demand. And it seems to be a problem that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/ai-fuels-memory-chip-shortage-that-could-hit-phones-and-cars.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">may only get worse</a> and more expansive before it gets better. </p>



<p><strong>“It could be very bad for PCs, laptops, consumer electronics and automotive, which depend on cheap memory chips,”</strong> TriOrient’s vice president of research, Dan Nystedt, told CNBC.</p>

<p>CD Projekt Red’s dev team now consists of 851 developers, adding over 50 more since July 31, 2025. </p>



<p>CD Projekt Red’s Q3 2025 earnings call is underway today, revealing the studio’s current financial status and other details. We have already been informed that Cyberpunk 2077 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-hits-new-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 35 million copies</a>. Now, let’s get into the dev team expansion, which adds new developers across all of their ongoing projects. </p>







<h2 id="h-cd-projekt-red-has-851-developers-working-across-all-projects">CD Projekt Red Has 851 Developers Working Across All Projects</h2>



<p>The latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q3 2025 presentation</a> by CD Projekt Red reveals how many devs they have employed and how they have been spread across multiple projects. The bulk of the 851 devs are working on The Witcher 4, 447 now, up from 444 in July 2025. The next major chunk goes to Cyberpunk 2, which has 135 developers currently working on it, up from 116. The teams for Project Sirius have been increased from 51 to 56 devs, and for Project Hadar, it has been increased from 22 to 29 devs. </p>



<p>In Shared Services, 162 devs are now working on this category, up from 149. Lastly, their other category has 22 devs, up from 17. In a previous slide, the developers also spoke about laying the foundation for Cyberpunk 2 and scaling up their Boston team. Work on it began with under 50 devs in 2023, and the team has now grown to just under 150 devs by 2025. Their goal is to bring this number to over 300 by 2027. The developers added over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/60-developers-join-cd-projekt-red-for-witcher-4-cyberpunk-2-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">60 devs in July</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-hires-more-developers-to-work-on-the-witcher-4-and-cyberpunk-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just under 30 in May</a>, and over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-hires-50-new-devs-to-work-on-witcher-4-and-other-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50 more in March</a>.</p>







<p>In other news, Cyberpunk 2 might feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2-could-feature-online-multiplayer-new-job-listing-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online multiplayer</a>, according to a recent job listing.

<p>CD Projekt Red’s latest earnings call has revealed that Cyberpunk 2077 has sold 35 million unit.</p>



<p>All we have been hearing about in recent days is Cyberpunk 2077’s sequel. We recently saw Keanu Reeves asking the devs to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-creator-pondsmith-keanu-reeves-2077-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact him for the sequel</a>. There was also a job listing that suggested an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2-could-feature-online-multiplayer-new-job-listing-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online multiplayer feature</a> for the title. However, today is not about the sequel; it is about the original game that reached a spectacular sales milestone after overcoming many hurdles. </p>







<h2 id="h-cyberpunk-2077-surpasses-35-million-copies-sold">Cyberpunk 2077 Surpasses 35 Million Copies Sold</h2>



<p>Thanks to CD Projekt Red’s <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q3 2025 presentation</a>, we now know that Cyberpunk 2077 has sold 35 million copies. This number is as of November 26, 2025, and it includes copies of the game sold separately and those included in the Ultimate Edition bundle. CD Projekt Red is currently laying the foundation for Cyberpunk 2 by expanding its Boston team. They expect the developer team to reach 300 developers by 2027; it currently stands at just under 150.</p>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 hitting this sales milestone is truly an inspirational story for all game developers. Who remembers the game’s state when it was first released in 2020? The title was in the worst possible condition, making it almost unplayable for players and prompting refunds across all platforms. It was all thanks to the devs’ patience and hard work that they were able to bring the title back to life and deliver even more solid content with the Phantom Liberty DLC.</p>







<p>In other news, Cyberpunk 2077’s update 2.31 added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-31-autodrive-photo-mode-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AutoDrive and new Photo Mode updates</a>. Additionally, Cyberpunk Edgerunners 2 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-officially-confirmed-at-anime-expo-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially confirmed</a> at Anime Expo 2025.

<p>Sony has announced that five (!!) games are being made available in December as part of the monthly free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers.</p>



<p>Starting Tuesday, December 2 and running through Monday, January 5, PlayStation Plus members at any level can claim a mix of new and older games that you may have missed in recent years. </p>

<ul>
<li>LEGO Horizon Adventures | PS5</li>
