<p><strong>Pre-registration rewards for Where Winds Meet are unlocked as a community goal, with each stage of rewards requiring a total number of pre-registrations to be secured.</strong></p>

<p>The rewards available for pre-registration are cosmetic or currency-related, though the first two have not been detailed fully and are merely indicated as ‘gifts’ for now.</p>



<p>All the pre-registration rewards available for Where Winds Meet are detailed in the table below, along with their community goal requirements.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-highest-rated-multiplayer-shooter/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-is-the-highest-rated-multiplayer-shooter-in-almost-a-decade.1345297/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders continues to hold firm high up the leaderboards on almost every platform since being released on October 30. The third-person extraction shooter has proven to be a refreshing change of pace for many fans of the genre, introducing a post-apocalyptic landscape that encourages social interaction and collaboration rather than mindless combat.</p>



<p>It’s a sensational title that has proven it can hold its own against the titans of the genre, so much so that it has managed to earn high enough ratings to become the top-rated <span>multiplayer<strong>-only</strong></span><strong> </strong>shooter in almost ten years.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-is-the-shooter-of-the-decade">ARC Raiders is the Shooter of the Decade</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders has stumped up <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Metascore of 87</a>, which is admirable for a new IP created by a relatively young studio whose debut game earned a Metascore of 80. In terms of Metacritic alone, ARC Raiders is now the highest-rated multiplayer-exclusive shooter to hit the market in almost a decade.</p>



<p>It’s topped only by Overwatch (2016), which earned a Metascore of 91 and has a similar operating model in that it <strong>only </strong>accommodates multiplayer gameplay.</p>



<p>If it weren’t for Overwatch, ARC Raiders would be lining up to be the highest-rated multiplayer-only shooter <strong>to ever be released</strong>. It’s topped in the shooter categories by games that came before, like Halo 2 (95), Gears of War (94), and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (94), but they’re all games that feature other modes and elements, including single-player campaigns.</p>



<p>With a Metascore of 87, ARC Raiders is on par with some truly heavy hitters:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ghost of Tsushima</li>



<li>Subnautica</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</li>



<li>Batman: Arkham Knight</li>



<li>Forza Motorsport 6</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops</li>



<li>Halo Infinite</li>



<li>Kingdom Hearts II</li>



<li>Fallout 4</li>



<li>Silent Hill</li>
</ul>



<p>ARC Raiders also shines in the ‘User Score’ rating on Metacritic. At the time of publishing, ARC Raiders boasted a User Score of 8.9, which is <strong>glowing</strong>. That aligns it with games like Metal Gear Solid, Max Payne, Resident Evil, Half-Life, StarCraft, A Link Between Worlds, Bloodborne, Portal 2, and Mass Effect 2, to name just a few games.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has created something truly special in ARC Raiders, and as the studio plans to support the game for the next ten years, it’s likely it’ll be evolving for some time to come.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/david-jaffe-god-of-war-creator-xbox-grave-joke/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98this-is-an-xbox%E2%80%99-god-of-war-creator%E2%80%99s-graveyard-joke-draws-criticism.1345294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hours ago, a user on social media uploaded an image of their father’s grave, recalling memories of being bought their first Xbox and falling in love with gaming. By way of a tribute to that, the user had placed two Xbox controllers on the grave, saying that their late father could ‘play along from up there’.</p>



<p>David Jaffe, the creator of God of War and Twisted Metal, quoted the post and wrote ‘This is an XBOX’, echoing Microsoft’s recent marketing campaign and prompting many to criticize the developer for an ill-timed and inappropriate comment.</p>



<h2 id="h-was-david-jaffe-mocking-the-deceased">Was David Jaffe Mocking the Deceased?</h2>



<p>The recent post on social media by David Jaffe has not been met with a positive sentiment:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Jaffe was most recently in the news for uploading a YouTube video explaining that Connie Booth, a 34-year veteran of Sony, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/connie-booth-was-fired-from-playstation-its-claimed/">was <strong>fired </strong>out of the blue</a>.</p>



<p>Under the graveyard post on social media, Jaffe attempted to defend his position after gamers came for him, but his response just stoked the flames further:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Oh shut up, you f***ing babies. My parents are dead as well, it sucks. And even WHEN they died- my dad died on Halloween and you can BET we laughed about it- we tried to accept and grieve and mourn and at the same time we didn’t become a bunch of overly serious assholes<a href="https://x.com/davidscottjaffe/status/1986283772808138817"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The comments under the post cast aspersions, and while some understood that Jaffe might have meant something different, most bagged on his timing and the nature of his comment.</p>



<p>One user wrote, ‘How desperate for attention are you?’ While another said, ‘Just because you made fun of your dad dying, it does not give you the right to do it to other people, you stinky loser.’</p>



<p>Do you think David Jaffe was in the wrong for what he said? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/optic-process-release-date-confirmed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/optic-finally-has-a-release-date-for-the-process-and-it%E2%80%99s-three-hours-long.1345285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>OpTic is preparing to <strong>finally release </strong>this year’s edition of The Process, a feature-length documentary detailing the ascension of OpTic Texas in this year’s Call of Duty League and Esports World Cup tournaments.</p>



<p>It has been a long time coming, with fans sitting on the edges of their seats eagerly awaiting the drop. It has been more than four months since OpTic Texas won back-to-back CDL Championship trophies, and mere weeks later went on to win big at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<h2 id="h-trust-the-process">Trust The Process</h2>



<p>In a graphic uploaded on social media, the OpTic team revealed that The Process will be released on November 11. OpTic Roger later noted that the construction of the project was something monumental:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I genuinely appreciate the patience people have had for this project. I’ve sunk a countless amount of time into this movie and it getting the extra time made a difference. </p>



<p>18TB of footage all condensed into a 3 hour monster of a documentary. </p>



<p>Excited for you all to watch</p>
</blockquote>



<p>OpTic Texas won the Call of Duty League Championship in Canada in June, becoming the first team in COD esports history to claim back-to-back world titles. It came after a horrendous season that saw OpTic secure a historic losing streak, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-map-streak-kenny-lowest-kd/">failing to secure a map win</a> in <strong>eighteen attempts</strong>.</p>



<p>It was a horrific scene that had fans baulking at the squad’s prospects for the season, but a rejig of the roster seemed to turn things around when needed, and OpTic Texas stormed through the bracket at COD Champs.</p>



<p>I caught up with OpTic Texas in Kitchener during the Call of Duty League Championship, and Shotzzy, one of the team’s superstar players, informed me that winning at COD Champs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-shotzzy-completely-wash-year-champs/">would ‘wash the year’</a> of all the negativity.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Consider the year well and truly washed clean.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, it was revealed that around thirty Rockstar Games employees were fired by the company, under claims that the workers were participating in leaks and prohibited discussions about the development of GTA 6. Those dismissed by the company insist they were let go because they were unionizing.</p>



<p>In a bid to rebel, the IWGB, a UK-based workers’ union, has arranged a protest outside Take-Two’s London office, due to kick off today at 8 AM UK time.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-you-had-to-do-was-follow-the-law">All You Had to Do Was Follow The Law</h2>



<p>In a video uploaded to social media, the IWGB Union explained the lay of the land, telling how Rockstar Games had ‘betrayed’ the employees let go for unionizing.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Rockstar, makers of GTA, have crossed the red line. They’ve fired over 30 members of staff, all IWGB Union members, in a blatant act of union busting. They’ve done this for no other reason but to try to terrify and silence staff.</p>



<p>Not only is this illegal, but this is also a complete attack on workers’ rights and peoples’ well-being.</p>



<p>Instead of focusing on the development of the much-awaited GTA 6, Rockstar have chosen to take on the role of their classic game villains by breaking labor laws and firing hard-working staff making the game, betraying both workers and fans alike.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By way of a response, the IWGB has arranged a protest to take place outside Take-Two’s London office later this morning.</p>

</div></figure>







<p>In a recent report, it was claimed that the employees were dismissed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for leaking information</a> about Grand Theft Auto 6 on a ‘public forum’, but many have pointed out the coincidence that every employee let go is a member of the IWGB Union.</p>



<p>The situation has drawn a mixed response from social media users, with some suggesting that ‘they must have done something wrong’. Others backing the fired employees have suggested they sue or arrange a class action lawsuit against Rockstar Games and Take-Two.</p>



<p>Whatever the reason, the IWGB protest will go ahead this morning in London.</p>
