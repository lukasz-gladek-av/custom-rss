<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages’ release date has been leaked and will launch on May 15, 2025.</p>



<p>That’s according to an article released by Gamekult (article since removed), who’s seemingly released embargoed information ahead of the Xbox developer Direct.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that select media will be seeing previews of DOOM: The Dark Ages ahead of the official presentation.</p>



<p>The Xbox Developer Direct is scheduled to place on January 23rd, making the 23rd a somewhat hectic day in the world of gaming as Assassin’s Creed Shadows previews will also drop on the game day.</p>



<p>As already revealed by Xbox, three games; DOOM: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, and Expedition 33 are set to have “in-depth” showcases, while Xbox has also teased a fourth game, which we released the scuttlebutt of what the game is in the latest Insider Gaming Newsletter (sign up below).</p>



<p>As well as the four game announcements, a few other surprises will be announced during the event or in the coming days, Insider Gaming understands.</p>



<p>“You are the DOOM Slayer, the legendary demon-killing warrior and the super weapon in this never-before-seen dark and sinister medieval war against Hell,” the official DOOM: The Dark Ages description reads.</p>



<p>What do you think of DOOM: The Dark Ages releasing in May? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, the team at Battlestate Games rolled out a survey designed to poll Escape from Tarkov players on a variety of topics. In the last few weeks since the most recent wipe hit the game, players worldwide have been suffering under the weight of performance issues, network problems, bugs, and of course, vast swathes of cheaters plaguing the game.</p>



<p>The BSG team revealed that details and results from the most recent survey will be shared online in due course, but for now, they’ve pledged to ‘actively work to resolve’ the key challenges everyone is facing.</p>

<h2 id="h-big-promises">Big Promises</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1881773608764092783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on social media</a>, Battlestate Games explained that ‘several technical updates’ are set to hit Escape from Tarkov in the ‘near future’, correcting problems such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Issues causing FPS drops and stuttering in various locations</li>



<li>Issues that caused complete sound loss during raids</li>



<li>Instances where sound was not correctly played indoors</li>



<li>Fixes for issues when loading into a raid as a Scav</li>



<li>Issues where players couldn’t interact with the Lightkeeper due to incorrect spawn points for the Zryachiy and his guards</li>



<li>All causes of invisible bot spawns in raids</li>



<li>Visual adjustments aimed at correcting fog effects on various locations</li>



<li>Issues with item availability and in-game trader quests</li>



<li>Issues where players would receive empty crafts in the “Cultist Circle” module of the Hideout</li>



<li>Client freezing when posting an offer on the flea market for an item found via the “Linked Search” function</li>



<li>Adding a graphics settings parameter: “Disable frame limit in-game when Nvidia Reflex is turned off”</li>



<li>Incorrect functionality of the Cyclone “Shahin” 3.7x thermal scope.</li>
</ul>



<p>Fans were quick to jump on the post and suggest further changes and quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<p>Among the suggestions sat topics like new spawn locations and loot routes on certain maps, more intricate mechanics in the Hideout, and adding more features to PvE that <strong>are not </strong>included in the ‘offline’ mode.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov remains the most popular extraction shooter in the world, even if it is suffering with more than a few issues at present. As always, the cycle will continue – players will start dropping off now to enjoy other games, but by the time the next wipe arrives, they’ll be gearing up to come back.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-dmz-2026-rumour-claim/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>As Black Ops 6 surfaced last year, rumours started circulating online regarding the potential revival of DMZ. It was noted by some Call of Duty leakers that DMZ – the failed extraction shooter mode – would be returning in Call of Duty ‘2026’, but since then, the leaks have run relatively silent.</p>



<p>Earlier today, TheGhostOfHope stressed again on social media that DMZ is coming back with whatever Call of Duty game hits the market in 2026.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-time-to-raid">Time to Raid</h2>



<p>Call of Duty’s DMZ mode was released alongside Modern Warfare II and Warzone 2.0 in 2022, and it quickly became a fan-favourite game mode. In DMZ, players were tasked with entering Al-Mazrah, completing tasks, securing loot, killing enemies, and then extracting again without being wiped out.</p>



<p>It was a good enough mode, but the content train faltered very early on and it was ultimately discontinued before it had time to shine. It doesn’t help that it was overshadowed by the bigger and more impactful players in the extraction shooter space like Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>On Twitter (X), TheGhostOfHope posted a ‘small leak on the TL’, claiming:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>DMZ returns as third gamemode in COD2026</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By ‘third gamemode’, the leaker is referring to the mode that sits alongside the campaign and traditional multiplayer offering. In Black Ops 6, that’s a full-fledged COD Zombies offering.</p>



<p>DMZ was a unique enough mode in the Call of Duty space, giving players a massive battle royale map to explore like never before. It empowered users to team up, as well – PvP combat wasn’t the default way forward, and players were even <strong>punished </strong>for killing other raiders. </p>



<p>Do you think DMZ coming back would be a win, or is it a waste of time? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
