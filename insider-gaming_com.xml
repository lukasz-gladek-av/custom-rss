<p>Welcome everyone to Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast for February 28, 2025. In this week’s episode: Warner Bros. Games Implodes with Wonder Woman being canceled and studios closed, Delta Force is “too hard”, and Sony is being sued.</p>



<p>Mike, Grant, Albert, and Tom also discuss a topic that’s been making the rounds lately and that’s how much blame should be put on games media for the state of the industry and the struggles currently facing many studios. Tom is also here to tease new games and stories coming soon to Insider Gaming.</p>
