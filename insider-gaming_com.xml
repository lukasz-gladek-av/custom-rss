<p>No one saw the success of Ball X Pit coming. It’s a big win for Kenny Sun and Devolver Digital that the ball-bouncing title has been such a success, and to celebrate this achievement, the first free expansion is on the way—the Regal Update due for release.</p>



<p>The name doesn’t give much away, but in essence, you descend deeper into a pit and use an assortment of balls to bat away foes and bring home resources and success. The deeper you delve, the harder it gets, and the formula has been a rip-roaring success. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-devs-announce-3-free-content-updates-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ball X Pit</a> has cleared 1 million in sales (and counting), and it’s just getting started.</p>



<p>Time to find out what’s known about the Regal Update.</p>

<p><strong>January 2026 is the launch window for the Ball X Pit Regal Update, and while the exact date isn’t known, this is confirmed to be the release window for the Regal update.</strong></p>



<p>A post on the Ball X Pit <a href="https://x.com/BALLxPIT/status/2008986900657565711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> page was posted on January 7 to reassure game owners about the first proper new content:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’re back at full speed for our first free DLC release this month! More details are coming soon, but for now, we can confirm it will bring features many of you have been asking for since launch.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s January 8, as of writing, which means there shouldn’t be too many more days now between the debut of the update. Stay tuned for further updates and details on its arrival.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-included-with-ball-x-pit-regal-update">What’s Included With Ball X Pit Regal Update?</h2>



<p><strong>Kenny Sun hasn’t specified exact details for the Regal Update, but it promises community-driven features and at least two new characters.</strong></p>



<p>A general outlook on incoming features was revealed in the BALL x PIT Roadmap 2026 video. Updates include the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Balls</li>



<li>New Evolutions</li>



<li>New Buildings</li>



<li>New Characters</li>
</ul>



<p>There will be stuff in addition to this. It’s not made clear if all of these will appear in every update.</p>



<p>Ball X Pit came out of left field to be one of the year’s best and most fun indie games. Do you think we’ll see any more updates after the initial three? What could a sequel improve upon?
