<p>Assassin’s Creed Hexe’s creative director will be leaving Ubisoft, with the new Head of Content taking his place. </p>



<p>Vantage Studio recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassin-creed-franchise-announces-new-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new leadership</a> for the Assassin’s Creed franchise, with a trio tasked with taking the brand forward. The new roles included Head of the Assassin’s Creed Brand, Head of Content, and Head of Production Excellence, with the Head of Content serving as the new creative director on Hexe. </p>







<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-hexe-development-will-continue-with-new-creative-director">Assassin’s Creed Hexe Development Will Continue With New Creative Director </h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-hexe-director-clint-hocking-has-left-ubisoft-as-part-of-franchise-upheaval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> report, a spokesperson revealed that Assassin’s Creed Hexe’s creative director, Clint Hocking, will be leaving Ubisoft. The spokesperson also revealed that development on the title will continue “with a seasoned team” and the experience will be “something distinctive within the Assassin’s Creed franchise.” More information will be shared by the studio “in the future.”</p>



<p>The report states that there is a new creative director for Assassin’s Creed Hexe: Jean Guesdon, the new Head of Content for the franchise. Guesdon is an experienced creative director, having served in that role on both Assassin’s Creed: Origins and Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. </p>



<p>Most recently, we were informed that Assassin’s Creed Codename Hexe had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-hires-veteran-writer-christopher-grilli/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hired its lead scriptwriter</a>, who has worked on the scripts for Origins, Valhalla, and Mirage. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what is known about the game</a> is that it will be more like an old-school Assassin’s Creed game, with you playing as a female protagonist named Elsa, set in Central Europe during the 16th-century Holy Roman Empire. </p>







<p>In other news, Ubisoft has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that two Far Cry games and multiple Assassin’s Creed games are in development.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The original Final Fantasy 7 has re-released on Steam, and it doesn’t seem to be faring well with players due to some issues, as reviews have dropped to ‘Mostly Negative.’</p>



<p>For those unaware, Square Enix announced last month that Final Fantasy 7 will be re-released on Steam, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/original-final-fantasy-7-is-re-releasing-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replacing the 2013 version</a>. Today, the new version has arrived with some brand-new features; however, these seem to be causing many gameplay issues, which are hampering the experience at launch. </p>







<h2 id="h-original-final-fantasy-7-re-release-on-steam-seemingly-riddled-with-issues">Original Final Fantasy 7 Re-Release on Steam Seemingly Riddled with Issues</h2>



<p>To understand the problem, players will first have to know the new features that have arrived with the original Final Fantasy 7’s re-release on Steam. Players have received a <strong>3x Speed</strong> mode, which allows them to battle, travel, and participate in select events at three times the speed. There’s also an option to turn off random battle encounters, a <strong>Battle Enhancement</strong> mode that allows players to recover HP/MP during battles, max out the Limit gauge, and an <strong>Autosave</strong> feature. </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/completely-broken-square-enix-rushes-out-final-fantasy-7-patch-for-the-og-jrpgs-new-steam-version-following-fan-reports-of-dizzying-battle-speed-and-other-technical-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, the majority of complaints seem to be with the game’s new speed-up feature, with players <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3837340/FINAL_FANTASY_VII/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">highlighting</a> issues like “combat speed is completely broken”, “the FPS limit has been increased from 15 to 30, doubling the speed of fights and actions but without adapting the animations so the actions desyncs with the audio,” and more. Some others have mentioned issues with overlays, textures, and screen tearing.  </p>



<p>However, some reviewers have pointed out that Square Enix was prompt in releasing a patch the same day to fix the combat speed issue. But will this be enough to get the review rating back up?</p>







<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on the Switch 2 is not a PS4 port. Additionally, the multiplatform release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-multiplatform-release-wont-compromise-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not compromise the graphics</a> in FF7 Remake Part 3.
