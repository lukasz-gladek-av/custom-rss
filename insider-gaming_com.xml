<p>Rainbow Six Siege X showcase has kicked off and revealed a brand new 6v6 game mode, Dual Front. The new game mode can be tested today, with R6 Siege X closed beta beginning right after the stream.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-r6-siege-x-s-6v6-game-mode-dual-front">What is R6 Siege X’s 6v6 Game Mode, Dual Front?</h2>



<p>Revealed during the R6 Siege X Showcase, Dual Front is the new 6v6 game mode with an exclusive new map. Players can create teams that blend attackers and defenders as they complete dynamic objectives across the map. Moreover, R6 Siege X’s 6v6 game mode will consist of respawn, where players can return as their currently selected operator or change their operator for tactical adjustment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trailer also revealed some upgrades to the core Siege experience. Players will observe new environmental destruction, advanced rappelling, visual enhancements, an audio overhaul, and new animations like weapon inspection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>R6 Siege X’s 6v6 Dual Front mode will be a permanent game mode with “a brand new ever-evolving map” called District. District features two symmetrical fronts, each with three sectors. Each team has to capture one front while simultaneously defending their own as they progress through the sectors. The final sector will consist of a prototype that players need to destroy to win the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also a neutral sector with a timebound task that can change the tide of the battle. Each new season will bring a new assignment in Dual Front, introducing a new narrative, gameplay and neutral sector map updates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Publisher Focus Entertainment has announced that Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 is officially in development. The game will once again be developed by Saber Interactive.</p>



<p>“Your duty is not done,” the publisher posted on social media. “We’re pleased to announce that the development for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 has officially begun…”</p>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 released <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17120/warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to favorable reviews</a> from both critics and players alike. A follow up to 2011’s Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine, the latest game has sold more than 5 million copies as of November 2024.</p>



<p>“”We have been honored by the incredible response from fans following the launch of&nbsp;Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2,” John Bert, Deputy CEO of Focus Entertainment Publishing, said. “We will continue to support the game with exciting content and regular updates in the coming years.&nbsp;Today&nbsp;we are thrilled to announce that the adventure will continue with&nbsp;Space Marine 3. </p>



<p>“Players can look forward to an immersive campaign, a multiplayer mode, and innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games. Developed in close collaboration with Games Workshop,&nbsp;Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3&nbsp;will take the genre to new heights by introducing large-scale battles that are even more spectacular.” </p>



<p>While it took 13 years between releases of the first two games, it shouldn’t be expected to take that long between Space Marine 2 and 3. That said, details on the next game are limited due to it being so early in development. More information on the game will be revealed at a later date.</p>
