<p>I won’t sit here and tell you that I’m a totally stoic horror fan. I don’t miss the big ones, but I’m still a total wuss and trudge through the latest shockingly horrific games at night, which is the only time I get to play anything these days. As we all know, playing horror games in the dark is, like, ten times worse. But when you add more action into the experience, well, I’m all for that. Slitterhead promises action combined with horror, and I’m here for it. But how are the Slitterhead reviews panning out before release? Let’s take a look!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-slitterhead">What is Slitterhead?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, for those who stumbled upon this upcoming horror game, or Insider Gaming in general, let’s go over the nitty-gritty of Slitterhead. It’s certainly a unique name and immediately evokes images of horrific scenery and, in my eyes, body horror. Well, that’s apt, considering the game is primarily about body horror with brain-devouring parasite-like creatures that hunt and consume humans. But you, you’re unique. You’re a Hyoki, which means you can possess humans, too, but for good. You’ll use various blood-based abilities and possessed forms to defeat Slitterheads in all shapes and sizes as they wreak havoc on the city of Kowlong.</p>



<p>Slitterhead is out <span>on <strong>November 8</strong> on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</span>!</p>







<h2 id="h-should-you-play-the-horror-game-a-look-at-early-critic-reviews-of-slitterhead">Should You Play the Horror Game? A Look at Early Critic Reviews of Slitterhead</h2>



<p>Now, before you whip out your wallet, especially considering Slitterhead stems from one of the deranged minds behind the original Silent Hill, let’s take a look at a few early critic reviews of the horror game:</p>



<p><a href="https://gamingbolt.com/slitterhead-review-wonderfully-bizarre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingBolt</a>:</p>



<blockquote></blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>I&nbsp;say this as a compliment-&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>is one of the weirdest games I’ve played this entire console generation, and definitely the weirdest game I’ve played this year. Coming from Bokeh Game Studio – a new indie team formed by Keiichiro Toyama, the creator of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill, Siren,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Gravity Rush&nbsp;</em>– it has certain expectations to live up to, but rather than being a slave to those expectations, it carves out a unique identity for itself. It’s not without its issues, and it certainly isn’t a game that I’d recommend to anyone without any caveats- but if you&nbsp;<em>can&nbsp;</em>look past its issues, there’s a very different and interesting gaming experience on offer here.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/slitterhead-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s horrific, but the crux of Slitterhead is its moment-to-moment action. You’re not a helpless dad stumbling through the snowy town of&nbsp;Silent Hill&nbsp;with a lead pipe in hand, but a small militia of civilians armed with razor-sharp clubs conjured up from their own blood. It’s an incredibly ambitious game that reminds me of a time when this industry was far bolder.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slitterhead-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There is something of a honeymoon phase to Slitterhead’s early moments, as you admire Kowlown’s murkiness and the general grossness of the yoghurt monsters. Sadly, this haze also quickly starts to dissipate, replaced by a thick fog of jank. Like its namesake enemies bursting forth from an unfortunate meat puppet, Slitterhead eventually reveals its true nature, and reader, it isn’t good.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/slitterhead-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Part sci-fi body horror, part thrilling detective yarn, Slitterhead is a story of humanity versus monstrosity in a city where both are plentiful. Bokeh’s debut release bravely takes strides to manipulate, challenge, and evolve how we play horror games, and while some of these risks do not pay off as well as others, Slitterhead’s sheer creative ambition is impossible to ignore.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/slitterhead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PushSquare</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s quite a lot going on here, and sometimes the information is buried in tutorial menus. But it makes for a unique combat system unlike anything else you’ve ever played. One character can drop a blood vortex onto the stage, for example, sucking foes in; you can then switch to an unimportant human, prime them for detonation, run into the middle of aforementioned maelstrom, and possess a different body before they explode.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/slitterhead-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TechRadar</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Slitterhead won’t be for everyone due to its quirks, it’s a bit clunky and reuses content frequently. But behind its issues lies one of the most unique titles of the past few years. With a great mystery story, impressive world-building for a debut, and a possession mechanic that adds an extra strategic layer to combat. Slitterhead lives up to its pedigree.</p>

<p>Black Ops 6 has been on the market for more than a week, and players are busying themselves contending with everything from SBMM to the annual camo grind. It’s being mostly well received by the community, but there are a few niggling issues that are being steadily addressed by Treyarch and Co.</p>



<p>The latest Black Ops 6 patch has applied a few tweaks that will help to fix some of these issues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-early-changes">Early Changes</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 might only be a week old, but it’s already being adjusted left, right, and centre by Activision’s teams.</p>



<p>The most recent update has made it tougher for users to <strong>snake</strong>, which is where they adjust their stance rapidly to ‘bob up and down’ in a way that makes them hard to hit. Typically, they’ll do that behind cover, and for anyone trying to engage them, it becomes near impossible to land consecutive shots.</p>



<p>Treyarch has also adjusted flashbangs, reducing the amount of time you remain flashed by up to 20%, which is a huge win. Being ‘spam-flashed’ has become a common occurrence on smaller maps like Nuketown, especially with users running Tactical Expert.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the team has tweaked the effective damage range of SMGs to make them tougher at longer distances. Conversely, they’ve reduced the range of ARs and made their headshots less effective at close range, which… Doesn’t make much sense.</p>



<p>They’ve also adjusted spawn logic on several maps and added Nuketown to private matches, which means you can now hunt for easter eggs in earnest. Shotgun slugs have been nerfed, and Recon has been dramatically tuned down to be much less effective, which eradicates many of the ‘wallhack’ comments.</p>



<p>For those concerned about the XP earn rates during this Double XP weekend, Treyarch has adjusted Player XP and Weapon XP earn rates between various modes. </p>



<p>Basically, nothing was done to change Zombies because it’s already kind of perfect.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance is perhaps the most realistic medieval RPG ever made. It debuted in 2018 after several years of development that began with a Kickstarter project. In the time it has been on the market, ‘KCD’ has done remarkably well, and the developer, Warhorse Studios, has just revealed that the game has sold a whopping 8 million copies.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-henry-s-come-to-see-us">Henry’s Come To See Us!</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance is a phenomenal RPG set in a real-world location – and it even sticks to events that <strong>actually happened</strong>. In this wonderful game, players lose themselves in an adventure that could last hundreds of hours and is extremely accurate in its representation of the period.</p>



<p>From true-to-life sword combat mechanics to the need to scavenge, barter, and bargain to survive, Kingdom Come Deliverance is a brilliant game for anyone wanting to immerse themselves in 15th-century Bohemia.</p>



<p>On social media, Warhorse Studios shared a brief celebration of the latest milestone:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In February, the team at Warhorse Studios will release Kingdom Come Deliverance II, a direct follow-on from the 2018 title that promises to improve on every angle of the first game.</p>



<p>When I was at Gamescom, I was fortunate enough to play an extended, press-only trial of the game, and being a fan of the first game, I was blown away. It’s everything I hoped for – and I’ll leave it at that.</p>

<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure is finally here, bringing Max Caulfield back to our screens after almost a decade. Aside from a brief reappearance in the Before the Storm ‘prequel episode’, this is the first major appearance of Max Caulfield in a Life is Strange game since the first title debuted in 2015.</p>



<p>I had the phenomenal opportunity to sit down with Hannah Telle, Max Caulfield’s actor, to talk about the impact of returning to this iconic character after so many years.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-return-of-the-max">Return of the Max</h2>



<p>Double Exposure is already becoming a fan-favourite title studded with twists, turns, and emotional sequences—much like the other games in the series. It was assembled by Deck Nine over three years and is a direct follow-up to the episodic game released in 2015.</p>



<p>The difference is, that this is a one-shot game – there are chapters but no iterative episodes to download or wait for.</p>



<p>Hannah walked me through the changes she had to take on board to ensure that an ‘older’ Max Caulfield was properly represented in Double Exposure:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was so excited that people wanted to see more Max and that she was going to get to continue her story. I love this character and I hold her very dear to my heart.</p>



<p>I knew that there would be a lot of people who had very strong opinions about what they thought Max would be like as an older person. I had a lot of pressure and wanted to make sure that the fans would be happy. </p>



<p>I also wanted to make sure that I stayed true to this character’s organic trajectory, and I really related to her journey of experiencing some success as an artist.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While many people expected a new Life is Strange title, not many could have predicted the return of Max Caulfield. In our interview, Hannah explained how she had to go off the radar and become very vague about her life as Square Enix facilitated a relocation across the country from California to Colorado to work on Double Exposure in the utmost secrecy.</p>



<p>By the end of the development cycle, Hannah had spent three years working on motion capture and various avenues of voice acting for Double Exposure’s Max Caulfield.</p>



<p>It’s not the end for Max, though. At the end of Life is Strange: Double Exposure, players are advised that the character will return in the next game – but Hannah was tight-lipped about that:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In terms of the future, I don’t know anything, but I’m really, really excited, and I hope Max is coming back, and that we get to learn more about her future and her inner world, and I think she’s got worlds within her.</p>



<p>There’s so much to explore with her, and I’m just excited to see where she ends up. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>In case you were wondering, in a world where powers are possible, Hannah Telle would opt to become invisible at will, using that power to spy on people and be present without anyone knowing she was there. </p>
