            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bloober Team’s journey could easily be the plot of a Hollywood film. Since the release of Layers of Fear in 2016, the Polish studio has experienced a rollercoaster of hits and misses, often delivering titles that were met with mixed reactions from both players and critics.</p>



<p>But everything changed in 2024 with the launch of Silent Hill 2 Remake. Bloober nailed it—reviving one of the most iconic survival horror games with a fresh yet respectful approach. The remake’s success catapulted the studio’s reputation, establishing them as true craftsmen of psychological horror. Naturally, expectations for their next original IP, Cronos: The New Dawn, skyrocketed.</p>



<p>Thanks to an invitation from Bloober Team, I had the chance to play the first 30 minutes of the game during a hands-on demo at Gamescom 2025—and I couldn’t be more impressed.</p>



<h2 id="h-cronos-the-new-dawn-preview-meet-the-traveler">Cronos: The New Dawn Preview – Meet the Traveler</h2>



<p>In Cronos: The New Dawn, you play as the Traveler—a kind of soldier dispatched by an entity known as the Collective to a bleak future. Your mission? Travel back to 1980s Poland and rescue select individuals from a catastrophic event.</p>



<p>The opening moments are intentionally cryptic. Who are the Travelers? What is the Collective’s true role? And what exactly caused the event? The game throws these questions at you, trusting the narrative to unravel them gradually.</p>



<p>During my session, I came across several collectibles that added depth to the world and enriched the immersive storytelling Bloober is known for. Surprisingly, the combat reminded me a lot of <em>Dead Space</em>—in the best way possible.</p>



<p>The Traveler starts off equipped with a pistol capable of two firing modes: a standard shot and a charged blast that deals heavy damage and can interrupt enemy charges.</p>



<p>Ammo is scarce, so melee combat becomes essential. You can punch enemies to create space and escape quickly—especially since their reaction time is fast. One standout mechanic is “fusion”: if a living enemy reaches the corpses of two fallen foes, it can merge with them, becoming faster and more powerful. To prevent this, the Traveler can deploy a flame cylinder that burns bodies on the ground.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Deixar os inimigos se fundirem resulta em grandes problemas</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-intuition-and-isolation">Intuition and Isolation</h2>



<p>I don’t usually play survival horror games, but <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> made me reconsider—largely thanks to its smart level design. Exploration, environmental puzzles, and progression are all intuitive and never frustrating. With a bit of attention, even genre newcomers can navigate the world with ease.</p>



<p>The intuitive design is paired with a haunting sense of isolation. Cold color palettes dominate the environments, reinforcing the feeling of desolation. The world has ended—and chaos is all that remains. Complementing the visuals are eerie sound effects and a retrofuturistic soundtrack that blends synthetic tones with organic instruments.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-can-bloober-do-it-again">Can Bloober Do It Again?</h2>



<p>By the end of the demo, I didn’t want to stop playing. The immersive atmosphere, the unanswered questions, and the brutal, strategic combat left me eager for more. Based on what I played, Cronos: The New Dawn is shaping up to be another major win for Bloober Team.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we won’t need to wait long to see if the final game is great or not. <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> launches on September 5th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/davy-x-jones-hands-on-preview-a-new-take-on-the-pirate-legend.1281087/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At Gamescom 2025, I had the opportunity to try out Davy X Jones, the latest IP from Polish studio Parasight, thanks to a special invite. Right from the start, it’s clear the team has a passion for reimagining legendary figures from human history—always with their own unique twist.</p>



<p>Their previous title, Blacktail, retold the tale of Yaga (yes, Baba Yaga) through Parasight’s narrative lens. In Davy X Jones, as the name suggests, we step into the boots of the infamous Davy Jones, who’s on a revenge-fueled quest against Blackbeard. After being killed, Davy’s head is separated from his body—creating a bizarre but brilliant duo of protagonists.</p>



<p>This split isn’t just for laughs (though the banter between head and body is genuinely funny); it also plays a key role in gameplay. The head performs specific actions, like devouring orbs that restore health, adding a clever layer to combat and exploration.</p>



<p>Speaking of combat, it channels the frantic energy of the DOOM franchise. Each of Jones’s arms wields a weapon—a bladed hook and a pistol. While the ranged mechanics felt solid, the melee system could use some refinement. At times, hits lacked impact. Thankfully, the game still has time to polish things up, thanks to the early access launch plan.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>One thing that caught me off guard was the difficulty. You need to stay on the move constantly, dodging and parrying enemy projectiles—or you’ll be dead in a few hits. Sadly, the demo didn’t include any scenes with Abby, the whale-ship that serves as the game’s hub and crew management area.</p>



<p>Progression systems weren’t showcased either, so I didn’t get a taste of how character upgrades or gear improvements work. Still, I walked away impressed. Having played Parasight’s previous work, I can confidently say Davy X Jones feels more refined across the board—even in its pre-release state. I’ll definitely be diving into early access when it drops on August 28.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-going-nuts-as-fans-wait-for-battlefield-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-2042-is-going-nuts-as-fans-wait-for-battlefield-6-to-release.1281036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 beta ended far too long ago already, and fans are chomping at the bit for more fast-paced, destructive action. Instead of waiting until October 10 to get their hands on Battlefield 6, hundreds of thousands of players are pouring into Battlefield 2042, sending the game rocketing back up the sales charts almost four years after launch.</p>



<p>Battlefield 2042 was a rocky title from day one, and for a while, it threatened to bring about the ‘end’ of the franchise. It has been a dark few years for Battlefield fans, and while Battlefield 6 is expected to be the savior of the series, Battlefield 2042 is finally getting a long-awaited moment in the sun.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-2042-player-count-soars">Battlefield 2042 Player Count Soars</h2>



<p>Battlefield 2042 recently leapt up the charts on Steam, rocketing to 75,000 peak concurrent players and rivalling other top-tier shooters thanks to a) Battlefield 6 hype, and b) a staggering sale that dropped the game to record-low prices.</p>



<p>It was the highest peak player count Battlefield 2042 had secured on Steam <strong>since launch</strong>, provided you don’t count the free weekend in October 2023 that saw the game land 107,376 concurrent players.</p>



<figure><figcaption>That peak is really something (Source: SteamDB)</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s safe to assume similar numbers are circulating on other platforms, particularly as Battlefield 6 draws ever closer.</p>



<p>In the most recent release of the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a> newsletter, Battlefield 2042’s growth was studied by the team:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Battlefield 2042 <strong>sold almost 500,000 on Steam </strong>last week. While the hype for the imminent Battlefield 6 explains part of this, the real reason for its spike is a HUGE price drop, -95% to $2.99, its cheapest price yet on Steam.</p>



<p>EA often does massive fire sales like this on its legacy titles to give it revenues a boost ahead of its financials. The $1.4 million in Steam revenues from Battlefield alone is nothing to sniff at. Expect more at the end of Q3.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What’s sad is that folks will be pouring into Battlefield 2042, perhaps expecting a similar experience to Battlefield 6, which many would have recently run through when the open beta was live. What they’ll be getting isn’t <strong>bad</strong>, but it’s not a patch on Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Have you jumped into Battlefield 2042 in anticipation of Battlefield 6? Or did you pick it up just because it’s cheap? Either way, let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-content-will-no-longer-carry-forward-into-black-ops-7/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-content-will-no-longer-carry-forward-into-black-ops-7.1280991/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It appears Activision and Call of Duty’s teams have listened to the community’s cries. It’s been revealed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won’t feature a Black Ops 6 carry forward. This would’ve seen cosmetics from BLOPS 6 be available in BLOPS 7.</p>



<p>A recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-players-think-black-ops-6-purchases-carrying-over-to-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB summary hinted at Black Ops 6 purchases carrying over</a> into Black Ops 7. Despite claims that Call of Duty remains a realistic military shooter, this would’ve meant <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-adding-beavis-butt-head-operators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beavis and Butt-Head</a>, Squid Game, and various other novelty skins existing in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. This now appears to be off the cards.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-won-t-feature-black-ops-6-carry-over-content">Black Ops 7 Won’t Feature Black Ops 6 Carry-Over Content</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I mean, what is this? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>An August 26 news briefing on the Call of Duty <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> addressed the “Identity of Call of Duty.” It discussed Black Ops 7 being a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2. However, the statement also recognized new changes that will be reflected in BLOPS 7.</p>



<p>“Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from Black Ops 6 will no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7,” is the front-page story here. Activision has decided against the planned carry-forward from Black Ops 6 to Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>The statement continued:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Black Ops 7 needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting. That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7.&nbsp;Double XP tokens and GobbleGums will still carry forward,&nbsp;because we recognize your time and progression are important. This change applies only to Black Ops 7.&nbsp;Call of Duty:&nbsp;Warzone is not affected,&nbsp;and all your Black Ops 6 content stays usable there.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I can’t help but wonder if this is a response to Battlefield 6. EA and Battlefield Studios have already come out and said: “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-dev-hints-that-game-wont-have-unrealistic-skins-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 likely won’t have unrealistic skins &amp; cosmetics</a>. In any case, the negative reaction to Black Ops 7 has more than likely alarmed Activision. We’ll have to see if the company caters to any more feedback moving forward.</p>



<hr>



<p>What do you make of this bombshell? Is it the right call? Are we finally seeing the end of wild Call of Duty crossovers? Let me know what you think through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-lego-voyagers-can-be-completed-in-5-hours-and-features-friends-pass-mini-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-lego-voyagers-can-be-completed-in-5-hours-and-features-friends-pass-mini-games.1280985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Co-op gaming isn’t making a comeback; it never left. LEGO Voyagers is the latest title to feature two-player-focused adventuring in a fantastical world you’re encouraged to explore. I had the opportunity to play it at Gamescom 2025. I also had the pleasure of talking to (and playing the game with) Karsten Lund, who revealed LEGO Voyager’s potential 5-hour length and other features in a special interview.</p>



<p>Karsten is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO</a>‘s senior quality manager. He graciously kept me company as we journeyed together through a succinct LEGO Voyagers demo. He had likely played the demo to death when Gamescom 2025 was all said and done. However, I conducted a one-to-one interview all about the LEGO Voyagers demo.</p>



<p>He was more than happy to answer several key questions I had about the game and gave us all a sneak peek at the game’s motives and content.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-voyagers-is-something-everyone-s-ready-to-play">LEGO Voyagers is Something “Everyone’s Ready to Play”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We smashed it. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/games/lego-voyagers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LEGO Voyagers</a> doesn’t focus on a specific media license or property, or a talkative character with a riveting backstory. We care about two mute bricks who want to rescue a spaceship. Lund explained the dynamic and what the team wanted to achieve with Voyagers.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This time around, we focus on the brick; figuring out a way to put brick and brick building as the star of the show as opposed to the minifigure-based games that are also out there. So in this game, you actually play as a LEGO brick, a small one-by-one brick with an eye. Then you have to navigate the levels that are completely brick-built as well.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I did mention recent contemporaries that have excelled in the genre—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hazelight-is-already-working-on-its-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios</a>‘ work, in particular. Karsten says that “the way has been paved now, right?” in (presumably) reference to the likes of It Takes Two and Split Fiction. </p>



<p>Furthermore: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It’s something everybody loves to play and everybody’s ready to play.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like Hazelight’s games, LEGO Voyagers supports the Friends Pass system. This means only <em>one of you</em> needs to buy the game to play it in co-op. Future content hinges on the game’s success. With it being an easy and accessible co-op LEGO release appealing to a wide demographic, this probably won’t be an issue.</p>



<p>I also enquired about the game’s length and if there are any fun mini-games to break up the gameplay.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We have a game of tic-tac-toe in the middle of the game, so we’re giving lots of opportunities to play and hang out in the game. We’ve seen players complete this in four and a half to five hours, if they just run through it and solve the puzzles.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I gave my full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-voyagers-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Voyagers verdict in my complete Gamescom 2025 preview</a>, which I encourage you to check out!</p>



<hr>



<p>LEGO Voyagers is scheduled to release on September 15. Will you be picking it up straightaway? Do we need even more co-op games and fewer multiplayer-only titles?
