            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ahead of next week’s Xbox Developer Direct, the Forza Horizon 6 release date may have been leaked. An alleged screenshot has made its way online that appears to show when players will get their hands on the next installment in the popular racing series.</p>



<p>Early Wednesday morning, Xbox Infinite posted the screenshot online that says that the Forza Horizon 6 Premium Edition will open up for players on May 15. With the ability to “play 4 days early”, that would suggest a Tuesday, May 19 release.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-else-is-coming-with-forza-horizon-6">What Else Is Coming With Forza Horizon 6?</h2>



<p>In addition to the early access release date, the image, which looks like an ad for the game, mentions other features for those who buy the Premium Edition. Those include:</p>



<ul>
<li>VIP Membership</li>



<li>Welcome Pack</li>



<li>Car Pass</li>



<li>Time Attack Car Pack</li>



<li>Italian Passion Car Pack (coming post-launch)</li>



<li>2 Premium Expansions (coming post-launch)</li>
</ul>



<p>Players will also get a “pre-tuned and exclusive” Ferrari J50 if they preorder the game. </p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 was first announced in September at Tokyo Game Show. The game heads to Japan for the first time, and will feature more than 550 cars in what is being labeled as <strong>“Forza Horizon’s biggest open world driving adventure yet”.</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As always, none of this has been confirmed by Xbox or Playground Games, nor has it been independently verified by Insider Gaming. Until that happens, please take the information with a grain of salt.</p>







<p>The first look at gameplay for the upcoming racing title will come during the aforementioned Xbox Developer Direct showcase on January 22 at 1pm ET/6pm GMT. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the event and bring you all of the latest details. </p>

<p>Cygames has announced in a new statement that it will not implement GenAI in its products without prior notice and has apologised to the community. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Cygames announced that it will establish an AI studio, which is a subsidiary to develop and provide AI-based services and tools. The AI studio would participate in the research and development of its own models to offer services and tools for production sites. The studio has now backtracked on this, stating that GenAI will not be used to produce art for their products. </p>







<h2 id="h-cygames-releases-new-statement-on-ai-studio">Cygames Releases New Statement on AI Studio</h2>



<p>In a new statement on their official <a href="https://x.com/Cygames_PR/status/2011423096465682934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), Cygames has addressed the blowback they have received from the community since announcing their AI studio. The statement confirms that the “art produced from generative AI isn’t used in their products and will not be implemented “without prior notice.” The company added that it holds people who love games and the “dignity, passion, and heart of creators and artists” in the highest regard. </p>



<p>The company also stated that the art for all the current Cyfames and other products has been created by the “technical know-how and manual work” of their staff members. Cygames has apologized for the grief and anxiety it caused to the community and has pledged to “honor creators, as well as champion the free expression of people.”</p>







<p>In other news, NVIDIA’s CEO has stated that the constant negativity surrounding the AI industry is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-ceo-says-ai-doomer-narrative-is-hurtful/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extremely hurtful</a>”. Additionally, Nintendo has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/my-mario-marketing-did-not-use-ai-images-nintendo-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied claims</a> that generative AI was used in promotional images for its new “My Mario” toy line.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/imperialhal-controller-ban-algs-championship/</link>
            <guid>1405708</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Apex Legends Global Series 2026 Championship is set to take place tomorrow in Sapporo, Japan. Today, one of the game’s most prolific pro players, ImperialHal, revealed that his first-choice controller was <strong>banned </strong>and won’t be usable in the event. For a pro player, that’s one of the most critical changes to make at the last minute.</p>



<p>ImperialHal, who flies the Team Falcons banner, posted on social media that it has ‘got to be a joke, surely.’</p>







<h2 id="h-imperialhal-s-zd-ultimate-controller-is-banned">ImperialHal’s ZD Ultimate Controller is Banned</h2>



<p>The ALGS regulators have decided to <strong>ban </strong>ImperialHal’s chief controller, the ZD Ultimate, just one day before the ALGS Championship tournament takes place in Japan.</p>



<p>The ZD Ultimate is a lesser-known controller that boasts stacks of bonus features, including tri-connectivity, ultra-low latency, trigger switches, back paddles, extra buttons, and an RGB light strip. It currently costs $99.99 from the manufacturer.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, ImperialHal explained why it’s banned:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Because it has wireless capabilities that can be changed at any point via mobile and macro stuff that can’t be disabled.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also pointed out that during the Esports World Cup, ‘multiple players’ used controllers with similar functions, and they weren’t banned.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>My controller gets banned the day before 2 million Dollar tournament 😂😂😂</p><p>Gotta be a joke surely</p></div>— Falcons ImperialHal (@ImperialHal) <a href="https://twitter.com/ImperialHal/status/2011411052261699976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>ImperialHal has been competing in the Apex Legends space since 2019, making a name for himself while flying the TSM flag, but in 2024, he picked up a spot on Team Falcons’ developing roster. In 2023, he secured the top spot at the ALGS Championship, and a year later, hit a second-place finish at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>Last year produced a third-place finish at the ALGS Championship, so this is something of a redemption opportunity for the 26-year-old esports pro.</p>







<p>Do you think it’s right that the organizers banned ImperialHal’s controller so close to the start of the tournament? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
