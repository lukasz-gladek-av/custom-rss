<p>Amazon’s continued distance from traditional gaming has seemingly continue. According to a new report, the head of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/amazon-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Game Studios</a> is leaving the company.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3mdisznjdh22x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, Christoph Hartmann, Amazon Games vice president, is leaving after roughly eight years. It’s currently unknown where Hartmann is going or when he plans on wrapping up with the Seattle-based company. </p>







<p>He’s also yet to make any public comment on the matter, as of writing.</p>



<p>Under Hartmann’s leadership since 2018, Amazon Game Studios published games like Crucible, Lost Ark, New World, King of Meat, and others. Most recently, New World announced that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-aeternum-to-be-taken-offline-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set to go offline at the end</a> of January 2027. Right now, the studio has two Tomb Raider games in development along with a number of unannounced projects. Though, the status of those unannounced games remains unknown amid all the turnover.</p>



<p>Schreier added that Hartmann’s leaving comes as “Amazon continues its retreat from the PC and console video-game space in favor of its cloud gaming service Luna.”</p>







<p>Prior to joining Amazon, Hartmann spent 18 years with Take-Two Interactive. He even helped co-found 2K Games in the early 2000s after Take-Two acquired Visual Concepts. </p>
