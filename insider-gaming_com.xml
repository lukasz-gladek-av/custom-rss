<p>Shang Chi actor reveals that his dream has been to bring Sleeping Dogs to the big screen and then a sequel that players have been hoping for for years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>zengames44 recently tagged Simu Liu on <a href="https://x.com/zengames44/status/1884321313923424362" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, asking if he’s working behind the scenes to bring one of the fan-favourite games to the movies. To everyone’s surprise, Simu Liu replied to the post, stating that he is already “Working with the rights holders to bring Sleeping Dogs to the big screen.” However, fans are a bit confused, as it was shared during a recent interview that the Sleeping Dogs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donnie-yen-sleeping-dogs-movie-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">movie is dead</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly, in a <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/1885252869483340236" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent post</a>, Simu Liu doubled down on his plans with Sleeping Dogs, discussing his dreams for the franchise. Liu shared that only some movies can make it from the “pitch phase to greenlight” and that “it has been tiring” pitching the film to executives who do not understand the game. However, his dream remains: “First a movie, then a sequel game for everyone.”</p>



<p>“Sleeping Dogs,” released in 2012, was developed by United Front Games and published by Square Enix. Fans quickly fell in love with the game’s open-world setting, which allows players to explore a vibrant and bustling city set in Hong Kong. The combat and parkour mechanics are well-designed and intuitive, enhancing the overall experience. Additionally, the story centred around the Triads, the impressive visuals for a game from 2012, and the high-quality soundtrack were all standout features.</p>

<p>Sonderzüge Sabotage ramps up the difficulty in Resistance. There are enemy snipers everywhere, a multi-floor hotel crawling with Germans, and Sniper Elite Resistance’s Mission 3 Sonderzüge Sabotage has a tough Workbench (or three) for Harry to locate.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>‘s main levels have three Workbenches each. They can be up high or down below, you never know! They’re trapped behind locked doors and situated on crowded floors. But seeking them out is a delight, even if a waiting Nazi is destined to give you a fright. </p>



<p>But enough with the rhyming, Sonderzüge Sabotage awaits. Below is a detailed guide showing you the mission’s Workbench locations and how to get there. Furthermore, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-find-clues-superweapon-sonderzuge-sabotage-sniper-elite-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to find clues for the Superweapon in Sonderzüge Sabotage</a>, if you’re struggling.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-workbench-location-in-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-3-sonderzuge-sabotage">Every Workbench Location in Sniper Elite Resistance Mission 3 Sonderzüge Sabotage</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Keep referring back to this. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The screenshot above shows three circled symbols representing Sonderzüge Sabotage’s Workbenches.</strong> </p>



<p>They’re evenly distributed throughout the level, and looking at the location doesn’t always tell the story. Use each one as guidance if you’re off to find them yourself. If you want more granularity and detail, read on for complete guidance.</p>



<h2 id="h-mission-3-sonderzuge-sabotage-workbench-location-1">Mission 3 Sonderzüge Sabotage Workbench Location 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot One. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Start the level, go down the stairs, and head left along the path that dissects the grass. Head to the nearest Workbench symbol on the map we showed you under the “Every Workbench Location in <a href="https://rebellion.com/games/sniper-elite-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> Mission 3 Sonderzüge Sabotage” section.</p>



<p><strong>The Workbench is behind a locked door on the ground floor</strong>. Unless you’re already there, you probably need to go down some stairs to reach the ground. You’re in the right location if you can see a bike propped up against the wall, an enemy alarm, and a small statue surrounded by benches.</p>



<p>Screenshot One shows a locked door, and the Workbench is behind this. To the left of the door is a stack of boxes with <strong>Bolt Cutters</strong> resting against them. Use them to access the door quicker.</p>



<h2 id="h-mission-3-sonderzuge-sabotage-workbench-location-2">Mission 3 Sonderzüge Sabotage Workbench Location 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot Two. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>From Location 1, I recommend getting back onto the main road, <strong>going across the main bridge on the left</strong> (not the railway bridge on the right), and reaching the other side. Do this, reach the first intersection, and head down the road until you a <strong>barbed wire enclosure</strong>. Past it on the right is a set of stone stairs—go down them.</p>



<p>Carry on to the pier, turn right, and the Workbench is in an open building and you can’t miss it.</p>



<h2 id="h-mission-3-sonderzuge-sabotage-workbench-location-3">Mission 3 Sonderzüge Sabotage Workbench Location 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot Three. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Exit the building, go back up the stairs, head back out onto the main road, and head toward the railway bridge in the distance. Turn left at the red and white road barriers, and go right of the first sandbags you come to. <strong>There’s a long alley you can head down</strong>. Go to the very end, turn right at the white sheet covering, go up the stairs, and open the locked gate.</p>



<p>Carry on in a straight line against the wall with the road slightly leveling out as you go. <strong>Do a complete u-turn around the sandbags and spotlight and go past the red and white “HALT” barrier.</strong> Go into the building with white windows on the left and break open the locked door guarding the stairs. Ascend those very stairs and the Workbench is in the room at the top.</p>

<p>MultiVersus is coming to an end. After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-season-5-end-of-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors began to circulate</a> on Thursday that the game could wrap up after Season 5, it’s been announced that MultiVersus is shutting down.</p>



<p>In a post on social media and <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>, Warner Bros. Games and Player First Games announced that Season 5 “will serve as the final update for MultiVersus”. The season will run from February 4-May 30. After that day, the game will be taken offline with the game only playable in an offline state.</p>



<p>“At that point, there will be an option to play&nbsp;MultiVersus offline via the local gameplay mode, either solo against A.I. opponents or with up to three friends,” the blog post reads. “To do this, you’ll need to install/download the latest version of the game and log in during Season 5, any time between February 4 at 9 a.m. PST and May 30 at 9 a.m. PST. </p>



<p>“After logging in, a local save file will be automatically created connected to your PlayStation Network, Microsoft Store, Steam, or Epic Games Store account, allowing you to enjoy the game offline with all earned and purchased content moving forward.​”</p>



<p>Starting today (January 31) real-money transactions will no longer be available in the game. Everything, including the two new characters—Aquaman and Lola Bunny—will be unlockable by playing the game. Lastly, once Season 5 ends on May 30, the game will no longer be able to be downloaded from any marketplace.</p>



<p>As far as the future of developer Player First Games is concerned, that’s currently unknown. Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired the studio</a> in July 2024.</p>



<p>“This decision was not made lightly,” the developers said. “All of us on the Player First Games and&nbsp;Warner Bros&nbsp;Games teams have put our heart and soul into MultiVersus, creating a unique social and cooperative experience from the ground up that brings together a variety of popular characters and worlds.</p>



<p>“We are very proud of the game we have built and are incredibly thankful for the support of the MultiVersus community throughout this journey. Your passion and enthusiasm have been unmatched.”</p>
