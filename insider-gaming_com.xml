<p>Micron is completely shutting down its consumer brand Crucial, and is ending the line of budget-friendly RAM and solid-state drives (SSDs). </p>



<p>Announced on Wednesday, Micron said that the growth of AI has led to this “difficult decision”.</p>



<p><strong>“The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage,” </strong>Micron EVP Sumit Sadana said in the media release.<strong> “Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments.”</strong></p>



<p>Sadana continued to thank the “passionate community of consumers” the Crucial brand has had over the last 29 years.</p>



<p><strong>“This decision reflects Micron’s commitment to its ongoing portfolio transformation and the resulting alignment of its business to secular, profitable growth vectors in memory and storage,”</strong> the company added. <strong>“By concentrating on core enterprise and commercial segments, Micron aims to improve long-term business performance and create value for strategic customers as well as stakeholders.”</strong></p>



<p>Micron says Crucial shipments will continue until the end of February 2026, and they will work with partners and customers to provide warranty service. </p>



<p>The decision to end the entry-level Crucial brand comes at a time when AI and data center growth continue to harm the consumer sector. Because of larger companies buying up all the supply, consumer RAM <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-prices-have-soared-by-up-to-250/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prices have even risen by 250%</a> and beyond across different brands. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE – Eidos Montreal Was Working on a Legacy of Kain Reboot Before Embracer Buyout]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/legacy-of-kain-reboot-eidos-montreal/</link>
            <guid>1372021</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<div><p>Several CVs from past employees at Eidos Montreal have revealed that the developer was working on a ‘Dark Fantasy ARPG’ and was focused on reviving an established vampire IP, with a design emphasis on melee combat and parkour. The details have sparked a lot of speculation online, but Insider Gaming can confirm that it was a Legacy of Kain reboot and that its cancellation is a few years old at this point.</p><p>To make it clear, the current set of cancelled projects circulating around is years old and is not a part of the current layoffs.</p></div>







<p>The project was cancelled following Embracer’s acquisition of the studio, which was known internally as P16, as it was the 16th project to start development at Eidos Montreal.</p>



<p>Described to Insider Gaming as a ‘Legacy of Kain soft-reboot’, the game made it only around a year into development before Embracer pulled the plug to send the IP back to Crystal Dynamics. However, it’s currently unknown whether or not Crystal Dynamics did anything with the IP after it was transferred back.</p>



<p>Sources tell Insider Gaming that the project was going well, and despite only around a year of development, there was already some barebones gameplay.</p>



<p>P17 is, unfortunately, just one of many projects cancelled at Eidos Montreal in the last few years (as many as 7-8), with the studio seemingly being forced into a direction of being an outsourcing studio for the likes of Grounded 2 and Fable. Sources tell me that the developers were also previously asked to work on Kojima’s Overdose, but the request was refused because some of its developers would have had to move to Japan.</p>







<p>Currently, Eidos Montreal is also working on its own massive internal project, which started development around 2019 and has seen hundreds of millions of dollars pumped into it – a cost that sources say will unlikely to be recouped – but too much investment has already been made for it to be cancelled.</p>



<p>As for what this eventually means for Eidos Montreal is unclear, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-another-embracer-studio-suffers-large-scale-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs earlier this year</a> and now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-lets-go-staff-more-layoffs-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other subsequent rounds of layoffs</a> could mean that the future is dire for the studio. </p>



<p>If you’re a developer at Eidos Montreal and would like to speak further on the issues at the studio, you can email me securely and anonymously at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="96e2f9fbe2f9fbfef3f8f2f3e4e5f9f8d6e6e4f9e2f9f8fbf7fffab8f5f9fb">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></p>
