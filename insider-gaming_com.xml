<p>The director of Elden Ring’s film adaptation may be a bigger fan than we thought, given his script size. A recent article from The New Yorker sheds some insight as to how the upcoming A24 film came to be. Even more so, it does hint that the film may be in the right hands after all.</p>



<p>Winner of multiple Game of the Year awards in 2022, Elden Ring was a hit for Bandai Namco and FromSoftware. The intense gameplay and insane difficulty, much like the studio’s Dark Souls series, kept fans playing and is still regarded as one of director Hidetaka Miyazaki’s best. Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-movie-finally-confirmed-by-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a film adaptation was announced</a> from indie studio A24 and director Alex Garland. The filmmaker, known for Ex Machina and 28 Days Later, was an interesting choice given the game’s scope. However, we may actually be in luck if Garland’s obsession is true.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Image via FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an article on A24 from <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/09/01/a24s-empire-of-auteurs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The New Yorker</a>, head of film Noah Sacco chatted with Alex Barasch about the studio. While talking about it’s upcoming big blockbusters, Sacco mentions meeting with Alex Garland five years ago. Previously, the director did Ex Machina, Civil War, and Warfare with A24. While there, Garland showed off Elden Ring on PlayStation to Sacco and asked if they could adapt it for the studio. When Sacco agreed, Garland proceeded to write a 160-page script, alongside 40 illustrations, for his version of Elden Ring. The two flew out to Japan once it was done and showed it off to FromSoftware and director Hidetaka Miyazaki.</p>



<p>As you can tell, the deal went well and now the film is greenlit, with many original contributors like Game of Thrones’ George R.R Martin producing. Interestingly enough, this is the second video game film that A24 will produce. Death Stranding, directed by A Quiet Place: Day One’s Michael Sarnoski, is in the works. Regardless, given Alex Garland’s enthusiasm for Elden Ring, the film may turn out to be better than other game film adaptations.</p>



<p>Are you excited about A24’s Elden Ring adaptation? Do you think Garland is the right choice to direct? Let us know in the comments below and on the forums!</p>

<p>Crystal Dynamics, the studio behind the recent Tomb Raider games and a co-developer of the cancelled Perfect Dark reboot, has announced that it was holding layoffs.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> on Wednesday, the studio said it <strong>“made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions.”</strong></p>



<p>Crystal Dynamics says that the decision <strong>“was not made lightly”</strong>, but was one that it says was needed to <strong>“ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“To those impacted – we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion,”</strong> they said.<strong> “We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as the future of Tomb Raider, Crystal Dynamics says that it’s development is unaffected by the moves.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Crystal Dynamics for more context surrounding the layoffs, exactly how many people were being let go, and if the recent cancellation of Perfect Dark had anything to do with the decision. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>Konami has publicly addressed a number of launch issues for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater that have been reported by players.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Metalgear/status/1960740185957917022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Komani says that it has <strong>“received reports of several issues and are preparing a patch to address them.” </strong></p>



<p>The issues all center around game crashes and includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Performing an additional survival knife attack after completing a series of consecutive attacks to secure food may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Removing the Crocodile Cap from the Survival Viewer while it is equipped may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Collecting food when a hungry crocodile is nearby may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Transitioning from a roll into a crawl may result in the character model floating in mid-air under certain conditions.</li>



<li>In areas where the camera switches to Intrusion View, character movement may become restricted under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Opening the Radio Window under certain conditions may cause the game to crash.</li>
</ul>



<p>Konami doesn’t have a specific timeline for a release for the update, but says that it will “take a little longer to implement the fixes” as they investigate the causes.</p>



<p><strong>“We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause,”</strong> they said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hot off Gamescom, Silent Hill f has officially revealed the English voice cast. In it, there are plenty of RPG heavyweights, as well as some promising new actors. </p>



<p>Silent Hill f, the next entry in the acclaimed horror franchise, takes players to Japan. You play as Hinako, a high school student who’s town is now shrouded in an eerie fog. While it doesn’t take place in the town of Silent Hill like previous games, you’ll still encounter disgusting monsters and deadly situations. As the eight mainline title after 2012’s Silent Hill: Downpour, the series may be on it’s way to claim the horror crown again. Luckily, they have some great voice actors along with them on the journey.</p>



<h2 id="h-english-cast-of-silent-hill-f-features-final-fantasy-and-nintendo-voice-actors">English Cast of Silent Hill f Features Final Fantasy and Nintendo Voice Actors</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="First Look | SILENT HILL f English Voice Cast Interview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2ebMX6kV2w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a video from Konami, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2ebMX6kV2w">seen above</a>, it was confirmed that five voice actors will be performing in the English dub of Silent Hill f. The full list of actors can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Suzie Yeung as <strong>Hinako Shimizu</strong></li>



<li>Nicholas Leung as <strong>Iwai Shu</strong></li>



<li>Frankie Kevich as <strong>Nishida Rinko</strong></li>



<li>Courtney Lin as <strong>Igarashi Sakuko</strong></li>



<li>Caleb Yen as <strong>Fox Mask</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The most notable of the bunch is <strong>Suzie Yeung</strong>, who was confirmed last week at Gamescom Opening Night Live. So far, the actress has voiced several main characters in gaming, specifically RPGs. This includes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heres-the-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-voice-cast/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> as Yuffie, Persona 3 Reload as Fuuka, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-teases-deadpool-daredevil/">Marvel Rivals</a> as Invisible Woman. She will voice Silent Hill f’s protagonist, Hinako.</p>



<p>In addition to Yeung, the rest of the cast are fairly new to the VA scene, like <strong>Nicolas Leung</strong> and <strong>Frankie Kevich</strong>. <strong>Caleb Yen</strong>, who plays Fox Mask, starred as the protagonist of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/play-these-games-after-metaphor-refantazio/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, which earned a fair share of awards last year. <strong>Courtney Lin</strong>, interestingly enough, is now the new voice of Princess Peach for Nintendo, first playing the role in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-all-characters-in-mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>. Overall, it seems like a great lineup and one many will enjoy hearing when it launches on September 25th, 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/judas%E2%80%99-creative-director-talks-villainy-system-and-development-progress.1282362/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Judas’ creative director Ken Levine has broken Ghost Story Games’ silence on the state of the game, offering the a new look at how the game is shaping up. Instead of waiting months between trailers and “fancy imagery”, Levine says these “lo-fi” updates will give players more frequent insights into development while the team keeps its main focus on finishing the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-judas-villainy-and-relationship-system">Judas’ Villainy And Relationship System</h3>



<p>One of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the biggest updates</a> comes in the form of a new feature called Villainy. Unlike BioShock or BioShock Infinite, where the antagonist was fixed, Judas will let players determine who the villains are. The game’s “Big 3” characters can be drawn to the player as friends and allies, but if ignored, they may turn into enemies. </p>



<p><strong>“From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals,”</strong> Levine says.</p>



<p>The update also reinforced the game’s focus on character-driven storytelling. Inspired partly by Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis System, Judas aims to take things deeper by making relationships with the Big 3 emotionally meaningful. Characters will try to earn the player’s trust through bribes, saving them in fights, gossiping about rivals, or even sharing secrets. Losing one of them is meant to feel like losing a friend.</p>



<p>In contrast to BioShock Infinite’s Elizabeth, who players came to know well but who didn’t really know the player, the Big 3 in Judas will actively observe your actions. They’ll react to how you handle combat, crafting, hacking, and especially how you treat the others.</p>



<p>As for when players can get their hands on Judas, the team isn’t ready to commit. While development is moving forward and milestones are being hit, the studio says it wants to avoid announcing a release date that could slip. </p>



<p><strong>“But we know Judas is not really a game until the players get their hands on it, and that’s a day everyone on the team is working toward,”</strong> he said.</p>
