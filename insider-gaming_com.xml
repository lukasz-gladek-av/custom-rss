<p>The revived Hytale project also comes with an early access release date. Hypixel Studios is hard at work on the casual sandbox title, and it needs a lot of rigorous testing before it can be officially launched to the public.</p>



<p>One of 2025’s coolest moments was the announcement that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was back</a>. OG founder Simon Collins-Laflamme managed to reclaim the rights to the game, and work began to restore and improve upon a 4-year-old build. This means there is a <em>lot</em> to do, much work to carry out, making early access a necessity for Hytale.</p>



<p>If you want to get involved, play, and contribute to its ongoing development, you should buy and play Hytale early access.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-early-access-release-date">Hytale Early Access Release Date</h2>

<p><strong>You can start playing Hytale early access from January 13, 2026, and it’s available to pre-purchase right now.</strong></p>



<p>It’s been quite a hasty turnaround for Hytale’s fortunes. It was only mid-November when Hypixel Studio—led by Collins-Laflamme—let the world know that development resumed. Soon after, the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC performance &amp; system requirements were revealed</a>, and now we’re already talking about early access starting.</p>



<p>Early access sounds like a must for Hytale, and you might want to get used to this fact.</p>

<figure><figcaption>You would not want these with your chips. Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Founder and creator Simon Collins-Laflamme has confirmed that the full 1.0 launch won’t be happening for “at least a few years.”</strong></p>



<p>Hytale will be a 10-year project for the team, and will not use investors, publishers, or any other external source of funding. This is a tight-knit team working hard on a pure passion project to realise the game that was thought dead not long ago.</p>



<p>In a Hytale <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a>, the game’s full launch was addressed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Early access duration:</strong>&nbsp;Expected to last at least a few years; no rush to 1.0.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s no pulling the wool over an early access patron’s eyes here; the developer is giving Hytale Escape From Tarkov-levels of early access to ensure it’s as ready as can be come the 1.0 release. Hypixel Studios has ample time to craft the perfect sandbox experience and execute its vision.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a massive hack, Ubisoft has temporarily shut down the servers for Rainbow Six Siege and its marketplace on all platforms. The hack resulted in players getting multiple developer-only skins, billions of credits, and, in some cases, a ban.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege has been one of Ubisoft’s most successful outings in the multiplayer field. Filling stadiums with fans for eSports competitions and multiple updates make it still a popular title. However, <a href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2004901721336590703?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports of a possible hacking</a> arose this morning, with players being banned and seeing multiple messages of server-wide bans spelling out lyrics and controversial statements. In addition, some recieved rare and developer-only skins for characters and billions of in-game credits, amounting to tens of thousands of dollars. Now, Ubisoft has spoked up about it, resulting in a temporary server shutdown.</p>







<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-siege-temporarily-shut-down-on-all-platforms-after-incident-claims-ubisoft">Rainbow Six Siege Temporarily Shut Down on All Platforms After ‘Incident’, Claims Ubisoft</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>While fans saw the damage of the hack prior, Ubisoft started to investigate the ‘incident’ before, an hour later, <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004943312390926740" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcing a shutdown of the servers</a> for Rainbow Six Siege and the Marketplace. Fans did note that the company <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004917731829948808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">did not claim</a> it was a hack, which undermines the potentially harmful situation. Regardless, it’s unclear how long the shutdown will be in effect and who/what may have been responsible.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for Ubisoft, as discussed before, the damages are quite large, with players getting billions of credits and rare skins, all in-game purchases. Hacks in the gaming scene <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-hacking-incident-reveals-major-security-flaw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aren’t too common</a> and, sadly, the Rainbow Six Siege one is quite harmful. It couldn’t have come at a worse time, as many are on Holiday break and now have time to play. However, given the circumstances, it may be for the best, as it’s unclear the extent of the hack and how it’ll affect players.</p>







<p>What do you think of the Rainbow Six Siege hack? Did you see it happen? Do you think Ubisoft will recover from the damage?

Players are also able to pull off signature moves that only the best football athletes can perform.</p>



<h3 id="h-south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</h3>

<figure></figure>



<p>If you are a fan of skating games or are just looking to get into one, then this could be your go-to.

It also features cross-platform multiplayer, expanded Create-A-Skater and Create-A-Park modes, and simple-to-learn controls. </p>



<h3 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-nbsp">Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong was arguably the most anticipated game of 2025 and also one of the best indie games to come out this year. It also won the best action-adventure award at The Game Awards 2025, beating nominees like Death Stranding 2, Ghost of Yotei, and more. You get to play as the lethal hunter Hornet, who was kidnapped and taken to an unfamiliar world. You will be tasked to fight against some serious enemies, unearth huge secrets of your past, discover new powers, and more, all while ascending to this kingdom’s peak.

            <title><![CDATA[Insider Gaming’s Best Shooter Game of the Year 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gamings-best-shooter-game-of-the-year-2025/</link>
            <guid>1392937</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2025 wasn’t incredible for new shooters, in all honesty. There’s still a lot of reliance on existing live-service shooters, but the year did manage to throw up some amazing new highlights. Insider Gaming has identified one shooter that stood above the rest in 2025.</p>



<p>Between first-person shooters and third-person shooters, there’s a lot to feast on. 2025 might have been dominated by action-adventure games and indie darlings, but the gaming community is still being treated to AAA shooters capable of delivering immense action and gunplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a>‘s 2025 shooter of the year might cause some debate, but there’s plenty of cause to agree.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-shooter-game-of-2025-winner-battlefield-6">Best Shooter Game Of 2025 Winner—Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Boom, headshot! Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 was considered the point of no return for EA and the iconic shooter. Battlefield 2042 did almost irreparable damage to the Battlefield name, and if BF 6 didn’t completely deliver, it was probably over. Thankfully, Battlefield 6 is a gargantuan first-person shooter that reminds us all why players crave an alternative to standard point-and-aim shooters.</p>



<p>Yes, the campaign is underwhelming and fairly forgettable, if not worth a brief jaunt to warm you up for the online multiplayer. Everyone knows this is where Battlefield thrives. Some maps could be a tiny bit bigger, but this will come with time. It does mean you get the most intense and exhilarating action around you: Whether it’s the majesty and splendor or vehicles crashing bullets and shells on metal, a jet soaring overhead straight out of bounds because no one knows how to fly them, or the earth-shaking destruction of a crumbling building.</p>



<p>There’s a reason why Best Audio Design at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> went to Battlefield 6. There’s absolutely no title in history that captures the second-by-second thrill of war. It was tough to see if we’d ever get another strong BF game again, and with the addition of RedSec’s Battle Royale and free content, EA has delivered the full package.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-shooter-game-of-2025-nominations">Best Shooter Game of 2025 Nominations</h2>



<h3 id="h-arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</h3>



<figure><figcaption>ARCs are scary. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>This was a close one, in all honesty. ARC Raiders has been the viral shooter sensation of 2025. Initial reactions to playtests were very positive, almost too positive. Embark Studios shrugged off suggestions that the initial hype couldn’t continue, and the October 30 launch was an instant hit.</p>



<p>Two months after launch and ARC Raiders was still hitting well above six figures in player count. The extraction shooter gained a reputation as a friendly addition to the merciless genre—Escape From Tarkov and Gray Zone Warfare are no free lunch—and might be the most accessible extraction shooter around.</p>



<p>After all, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-invented-a-whole-new-genre-and-nobody-noticed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders did create a new genre</a>.</p>







<h3 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</h3>



<figure><figcaption>No one messes with Doomguy. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>DOOM is in a weird spot at the moment. The 2016 reboot was phenomenal, and it’s a matter of taste if you prefer DOOM: Eternal’s parkour-centric elements. One thing most agree on is that DOOM: The Dark Ages is a slight step back from the pair—but it’s still a brutal and bombastic affair. The Dark Ages’ prequel aesthetic and decision to lean more heavily into the story and cutscenes are hit and miss. DOOM isn’t one of the most celebrated shooter franchises ever because of its narrative storytelling, let’s face it.</p>



<p>But the core gameplay remains punchy and powerful. The parry mechanic and Saw Shield add nice variation; on the other hand, the dragon sequences are gimmicky and unnecessary, and in trying to change too much, some of DOOM 2016’s implicity has been lost. Still,  you’re assured a breathless ride, and fingers crossed the next DOOM reins in the creativity a smidge.</p>



<h3 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You’d be psycho not to play it. Image via Gearbox</figcaption></figure>



<p>Whereas Borderlands 4 throws a lot of new ideas at the wall, and mostly scores. The open-world design works, and you can find unopened cans of chaos around every corner. The template remains unchanged: Four Vault Hunters to choose from with different abilities, saving the world, finding vaults, and collecting enough guns to use on the fire for Winter!</p>



<p>It would be interesting to see how Borderlands 4 fared at launch had Gearbox released the game in a fully working state. The performance issues destroyed the game’s chances of ubiquitous fanfare from all corners. Borderlands 4 shows that Gearbox has more ideas up its sleeves—the Grapple Hook and jetpacks are fun—and even more is needed if the next game is to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">break 100 million units</a>.</p>



<p>Did any shooter that’s not Battlefield 6 get your vote for best shooter of 2025? Is it something that didn’t even make it onto our list, like a certain Black Ops 7? Be sure to let IG know through the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>
