<p>ARC Raiders has some surprisingly deep lore behind the raid-and-repeat nature of the extraction shooter, and it all revolves around the ARC. These advanced robots have overtaken the Earth’s surface, but it all started with the First Wave. </p>



<p>That was all long ago in the history of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-aggression-based-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, but the remains are still seen scattered across the various in-game maps. As is the nature of the game, these First Wave Husks can be looted for ARC materials, but knowing where to look is key.</p>







<p>Follow along with this guide to learn what to look for when searching for First Wave Husks, as well as the best places you can find them in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-patch-removes-out-of-map-exploit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-first-wave-husks-in-arc-raiders">What Are First Wave Husks In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>First Wave Husks are the older remains of ARC, as opposed to the freshly destroyed parts of ARC killed by raiders. </strong></p>



<p>Visually speaking, they stand out due to their more rusted and decrepit appearance. They’re often found half-buried in the ground, indicating that they’ve been there a long time. </p>



<p>There are three types of First Wave Husks you can find in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-copy-tarkov-flea-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>. These are: </p>



<ul>
<li>Wasp Husks</li>



<li>Rocketeer Husks</li>



<li>Baron Husks</li>
</ul>



<p>The first two should seem familiar, since they’re both ARC you’ll commonly fight during a raid. The Baron Husks are a bit different, though. These large, spindly Husks have yet to be seen in fighting form, but you’ll find a good few of them on various maps. </p>



<p>Each of these First Wave Husks can be breached to find some ARC materials inside. That’s easy enough for the Wasp and Rocketeer Husks, but to breach a Baron, you’ll need to climb to the top of its head and breach. Once that’s done, flames will emit, so make sure you jump off and wait for the fire to subside before claiming your loot. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-places-to-find-first-wave-husks-in-arc-raiders">Best Places To Find First Wave Husks In ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s an easy place to get to. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>First Wave Husks can be found on four of the five maps in ARC Raiders, with Stella Montis being the only exception. </strong></p>



<p>These <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-teases-multiple-maps-coming-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps</a> include: </p>



<ul>
<li>Dam Battlegrounds</li>



<li>The Blue Gate</li>



<li>Spaceport</li>



<li>Buried City</li>
</ul>



<p>Typically, there’s a chance they can spawn littered across all of these maps, but there are a few more concentrated spots if you’re looking to find a solid batch at once. Generally speaking, though, you will want to search areas where it’s clear a battle has happened before. These wind up being ARC graveyards, of sorts, and contain a variety of First Wave Husks to search. </p>







<p>If you’re looking for some guaranteed locations, here are a few POIs to check out in ARC Raiders:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">POI Name</th><th data-align="center">Map Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Old Battleground</td><td data-align="center">Dam Battlegrounds</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Water Tower</td><td data-align="center">Spaceport</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vehicle Maintenance</td><td data-align="center">Spaceport</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Barren Clearing</td><td data-align="center">The Blue Gate</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Adorned Wreckage</td><td data-align="center">The Blue Gate</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Broken Earth/Ridgeline</td><td data-align="center">The Blue Gate</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Additionally, two map modifiers can help increase the spawn rates of First Wave Husks. These are <strong>Husk Graveyard</strong> and <strong>Electromagnetic Storm</strong>. Husk Graveyard is an event across all four maps, and it vastly increases the spawn rates of Husks, but it doesn’t offer the x2 points modifier for Trials since it’s only a minor map condition. </p>



<p>Electromagnetic Storm, on the other hand, does offer the x2 points modifier, whilst also increasing the spawn rates of Husks. However, it’s not available on Buried City, so keep an eye out for it on the other three maps. </p>

<p>ARC Raiders update 1.12.0 removes the out-of-map exploit from Stella Montis, along with duplication and other issues. </p>



<p>For those unaware, the out-of-bounds map glitch in Stella Montis was getting out of hand. So much so that last week, we learned that a trio of players was using this glitch to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ceiling-glitch-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exact revenge</a> on another trio that was using the same glitch. It seems that Embark Studios has had enough of it now and has finally patched the exploit. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-arc-raiders-patch-1-12-0">What’s New in ARC Raiders Patch 1.12.0?</h2>



<p>It seems that the ARC Raiders patch released today, update 1.12.0, is focused on removing the exploits players have been using to gain an unfair advantage in the game. First and foremost, the duplication glitch has been fixed, stopping players from duplicating items and ammo. </p>



<p>Next, players were previously taking damage through the map’s geometry, but this issue has now been resolved. Lastly, the ARC Raiders bug that hindered players has been fixed, along with several out-of-bounds map exploits on Stella Montis. This should hopefully put an end to players taking advantage of them.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-patch-notes-for-arc-raiders-update-1-12-0">All Patch Notes for ARC Raiders Update 1.12.0</h2>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an item duplication exploit.</li>



<li>Fixed an ammo duplication exploit.</li>



<li>Fixed some cases where players were able to damage others from behind geometry.</li>



<li>Fixed various out-of-bounds map locations on Stella Montis.</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Razer CEO Explains Why Grok Powers Its New ‘Waifu’ Hologram]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/razer-waifu-holograms-why-powered-grok/</link>
            <guid>1410502</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>That’s a pretty interesting and loaded title. Recently, Razer unveiled Project AVA, an AI-powered desktop device that houses a holographic representation of what has been described as a ‘waifu’. The cylindrical device uses Grok AI and dynamic personality metrics to embody a 3D hologram with ‘human-life vision’ and ‘full contextual awareness’.</p>



<p>The <strong>conceptual </strong>device has been described as an ‘enthusiastic gaming wingman,’ and it sits on your desk, organizes your day, and keeps you company with a conversational model backed (at least initially) by Elon Musk’s Grok AI.</p>



<p>Recently, the firm’s CEO explained why they’re leading the way with Grok, given all the recent scandals.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-is-project-ava-using-grok-because-it-s-the-best">Why is Project AVA Using Grok? Because It’s the Best</h2>



<p>Project AVA was unveiled by Razer at CES, emerging as one of the most innovative (and perhaps invasive) inventions at the show. It’s a small, Razer Chroma-backed tubular device that has minimal inputs and maximum practicality, apparently. It has an HD camera, microphones, an LED system, and, most importantly, a 5.5-inch, 3D holographic avatar projection system.</p>



<p>Razer has unveiled a string of ‘companions’ that users can pick from to power their wingman device. It’s a relatively bizarre lineup, but it’s worth stressing right now that there’s no release date for the device. Razer has <strong>no idea </strong>when Project AVA will leave the conceptual stage.</p>



<p>First, there’s AVA, a throbbing circle of Razer-branded energy that doesn’t take a human form. There’s Kira, your traditional anime waifu model, dubbed the ‘loveliest gaming partner’, and then there’s Zane, a muscular, traditionally handsome, and tattooed male model.</p>



<p>The roster continues with Lee “<em>Faker</em>” Sang-hyeok, one of the most recognizable esports pro players in the world and a certified GOAT of the League of Legends space. Finally, you’ve got SAO, a corporate female character modelled on <strong>kawausosuki0513</strong>, a Japanese ‘office lady’ creator.</p>



<p>Right now, the biggest point of contention around Project AVA is the fact that <strong>Grok </strong>is the AI engine powering its development. In recent weeks, Grok has come under intense fire as the AI model has been stripping people naked on Twitter (now known as X) at the simplest request.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent interview</a>, Razer’s CEO, Min-Liang Tan, explained <strong>why </strong>the company had gone with Grok first:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Well, I think for Grok, you know… We picked Grok also because it’s got the best conversational AI at this point, for us. At least from a conversation, personality side of things, and that’s one of the things that we looked at from a tech perspective. Now, ultimately, however, we do see Ava as an open platform, right? </p>



<p>If somebody wants to be able to use a different model, it’s one of the things that we’re taking into consideration. And we are multi-model, right? But I think from a perspective of an avatar, from a conversational AI for CES, we feel that Grok has a really great conversational AI model at this point. So that’s one of the reasons why we picked Grok.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When asked how Razer can ensure user safety, Tan said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think we’re still in the early days. Now, the question, I think, where it’s going to lead to is something that we need to discover, right? And, of course, we need to discover it in a responsible manner to figure out how we do that, and put the right guardrails in. What do we do in terms of AI, in terms of this? That’s something that we’re learning.</p>



<p>Now, maybe it’s even a hardware lock that we need to put in. We don’t know, right? Or it’s more software guardrails that we have to put into place at this point in time. </p>



<p>That’s one of the reasons why we decided to put it as a concept first out there, to get the feedback. And we’re not gonna be able to think of everything, but we would like to be able to get as much thought, concern, and care into the product before we actually launch it.</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/six-invitational-2026-groups-unveiled/</link>
            <guid>1410496</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has revealed the group draw for the Six Invitational 2026, setting the stage for one of the largest esports events in the entire business. What has been uncovered reflects a stunning selection that should make for some exciting match-ups straight out of the gate.</p>



<p>As usual, the tournament begins with four groups of five teams competing for spots in the playoffs. The two-bracket split will be populated by these teams, but not <strong>every organization </strong>in the group stage will advance to the final round. Four teams will be eliminated before they can make it anywhere close to the final stage.</p>







<h2 id="h-six-invitational-2026-groups-confirmed">Six Invitational 2026 Groups Confirmed</h2>



<p>The group draw for the Six Invitational 2026 was completed recently by Ubisoft:</p>



<p><strong>Group A:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Weibo Gaming</li>



<li>M80</li>



<li>FEARX</li>



<li>Ninjas in Pyjamas</li>



<li>Project Zero</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group B:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Elevate</li>



<li>Wildcard</li>



<li>Daystar</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group C:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Shopify Rebellion</li>



<li>DPlus</li>



<li>Black Dragons</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group D:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Spacestation</li>



<li>Team Secret</li>



<li>Fluxo W7M</li>



<li>ENTERPRISE Esports</li>



<li>Oxygen Esports</li>
</ul>



<p>It could be argued that Group C is the most energetic and unpredictable of the bunch. FaZe Clan, G2, and Shopify Rebellion are all the most legitimate contenders for the trophy, and we’re sure to see sparks fly in Paris before the playoffs even kick off.</p>



<p>Group D is also bursting with potential. Every team there has a credible playoff claim, with Team Secret especially coming in as the Esports World Cup 2025 champions.</p>



<p>As always, the Six Invitational will remain relatively hard to pin down. It has one of the largest single prizes in the esports space, so you’d best believe every team taking to the stage will fight tooth and nail to secure the biggest chunk of it.</p>







<p>Which team do you have taking the win in Paris next month? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
