<p>Minecraft has received a Dragon Ball Z DLC out of nowhere, adding Goku, Vegeta, and more to the game with different battle game modes. </p>



<p>Minecraft has been receiving really extensive DLCs lately, which don’t just add cosmetics, but new worlds and gameplay elements to the title. We saw this with the Superman DLC in September, where players could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-players-can-use-supermans-abilities-in-new-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use the Man of Steel’s abilities</a>. Now, the Dragon Ball Z DLC has arrived, and it is receiving a similar treatment. </p>



<h2 id="h-minecraft-s-dragon-ball-z-dlc-will-let-players-enter-solo-co-op-or-5v5-free-for-all-showdowns">Minecraft’s Dragon Ball Z DLC Will Let Players Enter Solo, Co-Op, or 5v5 Free For All Showdowns </h2>



<p>Minecraft’s Dragon Ball Z DLC is available now to purchase for 1,510 Minecoins on the Minecraft <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace/pdp/cyclone/dragon-ball-z/4730409a-ba78-416b-9589-6d089218047c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marketplace</a>. In this DLC, players will receive 11 new characters: Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Piccolo, Frieza, Trunks, Krillin, Android 18, Cell, Android 17, and Majin Buu. Some of these characters will also have Super Saiyan forms. Moreover, several iconic locations from the popular anime will make their way to the game, too, including Cell Games Arena, World Martial Arts Tournament Arena, Planet Namek, Capsule Corp, and more. </p>



<p>Furthermore, these are not just cosmetics; players will be able to bring out their inner Z warrior with the new Dragon Ball Z DLC for Minecraft. From the trailer, we could see that players will be able to use not only Ki Blasts, but special moves for different characters, including the Kamehameha for Goku, Gallick Gun for Vegeta, Special Beam Canon for Piccolo, and more. Each character brings their own moves, ultimate attacks, and custom VFX. </p>

<p>Two new freebies will be included as well, the first is ‘Become Saiyan’, where players can stay in character inside their “own Minecraft world with this skin pack that includes every famed combatant from Goku, Gohan, and Piccolo, to Vegeta, Bulma, and Frieza.” Second is the Scouter Character Creator item, which makes players look like a member of the Frieza Force. </p>

<p>New data from Alinea Analytics reveals that Battlefield 6 has sold over 10 million copies across all platforms. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has taken the gaming world by storm, hitting new heights of player numbers on Steam with both the full release and the battle royale mode. We already knew that BF6 had become the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest launch in series history</a>, selling over 7 million copies. Now, it seems that the game has reached a brand new sales milestone. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-10-million-copies-may-not-be-enough-to-overturn-call-of-duty-s-overall-market-dominance">Battlefield 6’s 10 Million Copies May Not Be Enough to “Overturn Call of Duty’s Overall Market Dominance”</h2>



<p>Rhys Elliot from Alinea Analystics revealed that Battlefield 6 has surpassed 10 million copies sold across all platforms during a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-far-behind-battlefield-6-on-steam-preorders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameIndustry.Biz</a>. However, he feels that this momentum is not enough to overtake “Call of Duty’s overall market dominance – this year, at least.” Elliot added that Battlefield 6 has gained a lot of popularity amongst the PC players; however, Call of Duty is a “multi-platform powerhouse” whose sales base “extends far beyond Steam and the PC market.”</p>



<p>Elliot explains that Battlefield 6 is experiencing “a huge amount of goodwill” from the community, thanks to all the improvements they have made from the previous title, Battlefield 2042. Call of Duty, on the other hand, is experiencing a “perception problem” due to the inclusion of “Fortnite-esque cosmetics” and excessive repetition within the series. However, these factors will not significantly impact COD’s sales. </p>



<p>The analyst elaborated that Call of Duty has established a massive audience across PC and consoles, with a vast number of casual players comprising this player base. These casual players end up purchasing the game “each year out of habit and brand loyalty.” Moreover, Call of Duty’s casual player base “dwarfs” Battlefield’s, and thanks to the integration with Warzone, “millions of players are constantly exposed to marketing, in-game promotions, and social tie-ins that convert attention into purchases.”</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6 developers have confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-aim-assist-changes-are-coming-devs-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aim assist changes</a> are coming shortly. Additionally, here are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-final-pc-specs-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the final PC specs</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s console/controller design lead has confirmed that they are reverting to open beta aim assist settings. </p>



<p>It has been close to a month since Battlefield 6 released, and over a week since their battle royale mode REDSEC went live. Now it’s time to implement some changes and fixes to the game to enhance the overall community experience. As revealed by the devs, BF6’s console aim assist is one of the features that will receive a significant change soon. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-will-revert-to-open-beta-aim-assist-settings">Battlefield 6 Will Revert to Open Beta Aim Assist Settings</h2>



<p>The confirmation about Battlefield 6’s aim assist nerf comes through a reply by the game’s console/controller design lead, Matthew Nickerson, on <a href="https://x.com/The_n0ttus/status/1985520194148802793" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). Nickerson recently responded to a post on X, which discussed BF6’s aim assist, bringing a noticeable change to gunfights, with players recognizing when they are battling against controller players. Nickerson responded to this comment, stating that “we are reverting back to OB AA settings here shortly.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are reverting back to OB AA settings here shortly.</p>— Matthew Nickerson (@The_n0ttus) <a href="https://twitter.com/The_n0ttus/status/1985520194148802793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>When asked how BF6’s open beta aim assist settings differ from the full release, Nickerson explained that it has “far less stickiness”, which will not create the “rotational persistence” that players are currently facing. The console design lead also explained that “recoil reduction is a separate system” from aim assist and that it will also be adjusted once the open beta aim assist settings go live. In a later reply, Nickerson also confirmed that the devs “are not resetting player’s currently set values that they have.”</p>



<p>In other news, here’s what Battlefield 6’s ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-take-a-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take a shower</a>‘ screen means. Additionally, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-casual-mode-added-with-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casual mode</a> has been added to BF6 with 32 bots in each match.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Valve has officially rolled out a new feature for the Steam Deck that allows users to download games and updates while the screen is <strong>switched off</strong>, improving battery life, reducing screen burn, and boosting convenience. The ‘Display-Off Low-Power Mode’ means that users no longer have to keep their device powered on and live while installing things.</p>



<p>This marks the delivery of one of the most asked-for features since the Steam Deck was first released in 2022.</p>



<h2 id="h-valve-releases-display-off-low-power-mode-for-the-steam-deck">Valve Releases Display-Off Low-Power Mode for the Steam Deck</h2>



<p>The new Display-Off Low-Power Mode enables the Steam Deck to continue downloading content even when the screen is turned off. Once downloads are complete, the device will enter a sleep mode <strong>automatically</strong>, which is similar to how modern consoles like the PlayStation 5 operate.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a further evolution, it was confirmed that a status screen is accessible by pressing a button or moving one of the joysticks, allowing users to check on their download progress without fully waking their Steam Deck. The Deck will revert to full sleep mode if the battery drops below 20% (unless you’ve got it plugged in or docked).</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-enable-display-off-low-power-mode">How to Enable Display-Off Low-Power Mode</h3>



<p>The feature Valve has added is available in the Beta and Preview channels. To activate it, you’ll need to follow these steps to switch it on:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel</li>



<li>Opt into the Beta or Preview Channel</li>



<li>Navigate to Settings &gt; Power to configure display-off downloads</li>
</ol>



<p>You can then further tweak the setting to choose whether downloads continue when the device is reliant on battery power.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to comment positively on social media when Valve posted the news, which marks a great step forward for the Steam Deck as plenty of other handheld devices swarm.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mindseye-devs-introduce-%E2%80%98arcadia%E2%80%99-alongside-a-song-begging-people-to-play-the-game.1344079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the latest episode of Build a Rocket Boy and MindsEye, the team has made several changes to the base game and introduced ARCADIA, an integration that allows players to access a repository of missions, races, and challenges. It’s the UGC platform at the heart of MindsEye, and it appears to be a rebranding of the ‘Everywhere’ product marketed by BARB.</p>



<p>While deploying the update that revealed the ARCADIA brand, BARB removed free roam mechanics from MindsEye and added some new movement abilities, like dodge rolls.</p>



<h2 id="h-they-could-have-picked-a-better-song">They Could Have Picked a Better Song</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, Build a Rocket Boy published a short trailer introducing ARCADIA, an ‘ever-expanding world of missions, races, puzzles, and challenges.’</p>



<p>MindsEye is now subtitled as being <strong>powered by ARCADIA</strong>.</p>



<p>However, fans with sharp ears were able to listen to the song that backed the ARCADIA trailer, picking out the most questionable lyrics imaginable. The closing line of the song goes, ‘<em>Play my game is all I’m asking</em>.’</p>



<p>In the six days since the trailer was uploaded on the MindsEye channel, it has picked up just 9,000 views, which is indicative of the complete lack of interest in BARB’s debut title.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Mere weeks ago, past and present MindsEye developers were accusing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/past-and-present-mindseye-developers-accuse-build-a-rocket-boy-of-mistreatment/">Build a Rocket Boy of mistreatment</a> during the development process of the game. More than 100 developers came forward with accusations. </p>



<p>In July, not too long after the game’s launch, it was announced that MindsEye would be ‘relaunched’ after internal struggles and issues with the game were fixed, and that might be what the introduction of ARCADIA is approaching.</p>



<p>It was also the same time that Leslie Benzies, CEO of BARB and former Rockstar North president, suggested that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-relaunch-as-ceo-blames-saboteurs/">‘saboteurs’ had impacted</a> MindsEye’s disastrous launch.</p>



<p>Do you think MindsEye should just fade out of existence, or did you actually enjoy the game? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>In an update posted on social media, the TSM leadership team revealed that the organization had stepped back from VALORANT esports after being in the scene since the game dropped in 2020.</p>



<p>The organization failed to make waves in VALORANT since joining the space five years ago, coming in first place in a handful of minor events, and never managed to gain too much traction.</p>

<p>In 2020, TSM joined VALORANT esports with an entertaining and competitive roster that is fondly remembered to this day. We pushed for co-streaming permissions for Myth to watch party our team before it became a staple of VALORANT as it is today. We signed a main team, a high-level academy team, and were one of the first organizations to sign a Game Changers roster – all with the goal of developing teams and talent from the ground up.</p>



<p>Throughout the last three years, we have continuously navigated the Challengers circuit in the hopes of finally reaching Tier 1. We improved gradually, year over year, culminating in an Ascension Grand Finals berth in 2025.</p>



<p>Now, after half a decade in VALORANT, we plan on exiting the space with no immediate return in sight.</p>



<p>We would like to thank Riot for their coninued attempts to restructure the Tier 2 ecosystem for the better, and for creating a game we all love. We extend our deepest appreciation to all our players over these past five years who have made our history within this esport possible.</p>



<p>Thank you to the fans of the black-and-white who followed us on our journey through VALORANT. Through all the ups and downs, and the barriers placed before us, we always tried to make you proud.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>TSM was one of the first organizations to invest in VALORANT, but it never amounted to much.</p>



<p>This exit follows other strategic shifts the company has made recently. The brand’s LCS spot was sold recently, and it tried to break into emergent games like The Finals, from Embark Studios.</p>



<p>While TSM remains active in the overall industry, the withdrawal from VALORANT marks a broader recalibration for the team.</p>

<p>When you think about North Korea, the last thing on your mind is probably <strong>esports games</strong>. From a dictator-led regime to a fiercely censored way of life, North Korea has long remained a mysterious territory that few people see the reality of.</p>



<p>One social media user traveled to Pyongyang, North Korea, and managed to dispel some of that mystery, stumbling upon a gaming café packed with talented esports players enjoying games like Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<p>It goes against everything we’ve been led to believe about North Korea.</p>



<h2 id="h-north-korea-s-gaming-cafes-look-fantastic">North Korea’s Gaming Cafés Look Fantastic</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, a user named Sally Yin uploaded images of a high-tech gaming café in North Korea, specifically in the region of Pyongyang. It’s a far cry from the drab, miserable images we’re used to seeing in the West, which have long been named ‘propaganda’ by those supportive of North Korea.</p>



<p>Sally went on to explain that the café she found was only opened back in April, and at the start, it was restricted <strong>only </strong>to North Korean locals. Since then, the center has opened up to tourists and foreigners residing in the country.</p>



<p>Back in April, Kim Jong Un, the North Korean Supreme Leader, visited the ‘game house’ and approved of the site and the potential it would bring to young people in the area.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Reportedly, more than 70 games could be selected from the PCs available in the gaming café, which can be used on a pay-as-you-go or a membership basis. The list included top esports titles like Counter-Strike 2, Rainbow Six Siege, and Dota 2.</p>



<p>Bizarrely, the café also featured games like Call of Duty and Far Cry, which often portray themes of overthrowing dictators or oppressors, which might be considered ironic for a North Korean business. It was noted that accessing the internet is prohibited in the café and that applications like Steam can’t be accessed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FaZe Clan’s run at IEM Chengdu 2025 ended in heartbreak as expectations were shattered – and <strong>not in a good way</strong>. The Counter-Strike 2 powerhouse of a squad (or <em>former powerhouse</em>) bowed out in last place following an early loss against Virtus.pro, marking a new all-time low for the roster. It has been an inconsistent year for FaZe Clan, to say the least, but the Chengdu loss is a fresh concern for fans.</p>



<p>What happened to FaZe Clan in IEM Chengdu?</p>



<h2 id="h-sudden-collapse">Sudden Collapse</h2>



<p>FaZe opened the series with promise, securing a map win over Virtus.pro on Overpass, which was ironically their opponent’s pick. It was a dominant opener that had the roster feeling confident, but Virtus turned things around, flipping the script and forcing a decider on Inferno.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan faltered, Virtus.pro became methodical, and the series fell apart. For FaZe Clan, it was a quick ticket home with a 0 -2 win-loss record at IEM Chengdu.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that IEM Chengdu wasn’t an isolated stumble, but the latest in a string of underwhelming results for FaZe Clan through 2025. They’ve had a rocky 12 months in tournament placements, failing to secure a truly major victory since <strong>last year’s </strong>IEM Chengdu in April 2024.</p>



<p>It was argued after the eviction from IEM Chengdu that recent roster changes weren’t necessarily to blame, but systemic concerns within the organization are playing a bigger part in the wider picture.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan’s elimination from IEM Chengdu is more than just another loss—it’s a <strong>wake-up call</strong>. The organization, which was once one of the winningest and most dominant brands in Counter-Strike, faces something of an identity crisis. Ahead of the 2026 season, fans are concerned that not enough bold decisions will be made to change the woeful flow.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-5-878/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-878-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-wednesday-november-5.1344037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You’ve made it (so far) to the middle of the week, but whatever tribulations you’ve been through, you still need to overcome today’s challenge. The NYT Connections puzzle for today is a tricky one, but that’s where I come in. Below, I’ve shared the best NYT Connections hints you need to wrap your puzzle up nicely and quickly.</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections solutions you need for today.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #878:</p>



<ul>
<li>KNIGHT</li>



<li>COAT</li>



<li>BUTCHER</li>



<li>BAKER</li>



<li>FLACK</li>



<li>KNIFE</li>



<li>CANDLESTICK</li>



<li>MAKER</li>



<li>FRANKLIN</li>



<li>FOREST</li>



<li>BOW</li>



<li>BLOW</li>



<li>SPOIL</li>



<li>WRENCH</li>



<li>BOTCH</li>



<li>ROPE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of verbs that describe messing something up—whether it’s a recipe, a plan, or a performance.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These are the classic implements you’d find in a whodunit board game. Colonel Mustard would know.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Last names only—each belongs to a legendary artist whose vocals defined a genre and an era.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word completes the phrase “rain_____” to form something familiar, poetic, or practical.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 5.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-5-878">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 5 (#878)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BLOW, BOTCH, BUTCHER, SPOIL</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CANDLESTICK, KNIFE, ROPE, WRENCH</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BAKER, FLACK, FRANKLIN, KNIGHT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BOW, COAT, FOREST, MAKER</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Nintendo isn’t planning on stopping movie adaptations of its games. Even more so, according to a new sales report, it’s going to be a more common thing.</p>



<p>For the longest time, video game adaptations were a curse on Hollywood. It never seemed to work out, no matter what form it took, from animated (like Final Fantasy) to live-action (like Max Payne). However, the 2020s proved to show it off in style, having massive successes like Sonic the Hedgehog, Fallout, Arcane, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-tv-show-receives-high-praise-from-critics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a>. One of those hits was Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which raked in more than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-bros-movie-record-breaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one billion dollars</a> at the box office. With a sequel and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action Zelda film</a>, it’s on one heck of a hot streak. Fortunately, it doesn’t seem like it wants to slow down at all.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-involved-in-multiple-movies-based-on-company-ip-in-development">Nintendo Involved in Multiple Movies Based on Company IP in Development</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a sales report from Nintendo Japan</a>, the company talked about its success with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-10-million-sales-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its plans for the future. One big part of its strategy is multimedia, with a big push for films. Nintendo states that it’s currently involved in multiple projects on its IP in various stages. No specifics were given as to what franchises those are, but they’ll be releasing after The Legend of Zelda in 2027.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Nintendo plans to be heavily involved in all of the films, from production to financing. Given how well the collaboration worked with Mario, having the creators on the team always leads to a better adaptation. It’ll be interesting to see what the future for Nintendo’s films will look like, whether it be in-house, like it teased with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75JEwjP_GD8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Close to You</a>, or licensed. Either way, we may see series like Metroid or Animal Crossing make it onto the silver screen soon.</p>
