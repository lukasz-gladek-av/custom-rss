<p>Team Spirit’s rising star (if you don’t count him as arisen yet, anyway), Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets, has penned his name even deeper into the Counter-Strike history books at the Starladder Budapest Major. The young competitor threw out a stunning performance on Train against Team Liquid in the third (ongoing) stage of the Major in Hungary.</p>



<p>The Russian rifler opened up the clash with a pistol ace, setting a dominant tone and sending viewers wild. That performance persisted throughout the unravelling of the map, and by the time the dust had settled, donk had racked up his <strong>best map performance ever </strong>at a CS2 Major.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the Starladder Major Budapest 2025. Visit <a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a> to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>

<h2 id="h-a-new-benchmark-for-donk-and-everyone-else">A New Benchmark for Donk – And Everyone Else</h2>



<p>By the end of regulation against Team Liquid, donk had amassed a whopping 30 kills and only 11 deaths, but that’s just where these stunning stats <strong>begin</strong>. His HLTV rating came out at 2.38, the highest of his Major run thus far, and he was considered a huge force of momentum for Team Spirit’s win.</p>



<p>This Train performance surpassed his previous benchmark, which he set on Mirage against Imperial at the Copenhagen Major in 2024.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Donk’s pistol ace in Budapest is an easy notch on his belt, and it’s yet another clipped onto his total run of aces at the Majors he has attended. In Shanghai in 2024, the young competitor put up a massive <strong>four aces in a single tournament</strong>, which included an awe-inspiring 1v5 slam.</p>



<p>Team Spirit closed out the map against Team Liquid with a 13:8 victory, pushing further through the third stage of the Starladder Budapest Major.</p>



<p>For donk, this was more than just another win; it was another career-defining moment that showcases his consistency and ability to deliver. Right now, it’s obvious to see why many regard him as a growing GOAT of Counter-Strike.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#908)—Clues and Answers for Friday, December 5]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-5-908/</link>
            <guid>1373584</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Friday, and while that means the weekend is within spitting distance, it also means that you’ve got a whole new NYT Connections puzzle to dominate today. Fortunately, I’ve arrived with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions that you need to get the puzzle resolved as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Read on to get the notes and hints you need to wrap up today’s NYT Connections puzzle without too much fuss.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #908:</p>



<ul>
<li>SORRY</li>



<li>TOUGH</li>



<li>DEAL</li>



<li>BABY</li>



<li>SWEET</li>



<li>STICKY</li>



<li>PILLOW</li>



<li>STORY</li>



<li>MASTERMIND</li>



<li>SMALL</li>



<li>DELICATE</li>



<li>OPERATION</li>



<li>COMPLEX</li>



<li>STATUS</li>



<li>MOUSE TRAP</li>



<li>SITUATION</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of situations or problems that aren’t straightforward.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>These are terms you’d use when describing “how things stand” in a given moment.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are titles you’d recognize from family game nights or childhood play.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – E<em>ach of these words pairs naturally with “talk” to form a familiar expression.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 5:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-5-908">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 5 (#908)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– COMPLEX, DELICATE, STICKY, TOUGH</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DEAL, SITUATION, STATUS, STORY</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – MASTERMIND, MOUSE TRAP, OPERATION, SORRY</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BABY, PILLOW, SMALL, SWEET</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Romeo is a Dead Man Release Date Leaked Ahead of Announcement]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation may have leaked the official release date of Romeo is a Dead Man. The leak comes only a day before the game’s dedicated presentation by the developer.</p>



<p>Revealed during June 2025’s State of Play, the action-packed Romeo is a Dead Man is the next title from Grasshopper Manufacture. Led by No More Heroes creator Suda51, it looks like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/romeo-is-a-deadman-avoiding-firm-release-date-because-of-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a wild thrill ride</a>, fitting for the creator and his resume. The bloody action title was met with positive reactions from fans and critics after an initial preview. A presentation regarding the game is set for December 5th, but it seems PlayStation might have leaked one of the big announcements: its release date.</p>







<h2 id="h-romeo-is-a-dead-man-releasing-in-february-playstation-leak-states">Romeo is a Dead Man Releasing in February, PlayStation Leak States</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Romeo is a Dead Man release date leak comes from <strong>PlayStation itself and the PlayStation app</strong>. It was first spotted by <a href="https://x.com/HazzadorGamin/status/1996636997373644861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HazzadorGaming on Twitter/X</a>. When you click on the game on the app, instead of the 2026 or ‘Just Announced’ filler used for the icon, it says <strong>February 11th, 2026</strong>. Furthermore, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official PlayStation store</a> <strong>mentions the date as well</strong>, giving more leeway to it. However, it’s important to note that is is not official yet, so take it with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>It’s likely PlayStation jumped the gun on the reveal, which would’ve likely been revealed at the presentation. The ‘Grasshopper Direct’ is only five minutes and solely focused on Romeo is a Dead Man. Regardless, fans will still see new gameplay and such, so not all has been spoiled. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> slowly approaching, hopefully, no other games will get release date leaks. Even still, this does mean that, if true, players can add Romeo is a Dead Man to their 2026 must-plays.</p>
