<p>The original Fallout was created as a sequel to EA’s 1988 title, Wasteland, Interplay’s former co-founder has revealed. However, they did all they could to avoid being sued by EA. </p>



<p>The original Fallout title came almost a decade after (1997) the first Wasteland game (1988), and both games had the same developers, Interplay. However, Wasteland was published by EA, and Fallout was developed and published by Interplay. Now, Interplay’s co-founder has revealed that many people are unaware that Fallout was a sequel to Wasteland. </p>



<h2 id="h-interplay-did-everything-to-avoid-being-sued-by-ea">Interplay Did Everything to Avoid Being Sued by EA</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-was-a-sequel-to-wasteland-says-interplay-co-founder-and-we-did-everything-we-could-not-to-be-sued-by-electronic-arts-after-the-devs-had-to-pivot-out-of-the-follow-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Brian Fargo, the co-founder of Interplay, revealed new details about Fallout and Wasteland during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjeRn2eA3y4&amp;t=2766s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mr.MattyPlays</a>. Fargo explicitly stated that a lot of people don’t know that Fallout “was a sequel to Wasteland.” Fargo explained that players are unaware of the story behind it, but “that’s why it went from tunnels and trolls and then we needed a system – mercenaries, spies, and private eyes – and then that’s how we got the skill-based system with Wasteland, and then that went to Fallout.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The former co-founder explains that while developing Fallout, even though it took heavy inspiration from Wasteland, Interplay did everything they could “not to be sued by Electronic Arts”. Fallout even had “your life ends in the Wasteland”, Fargo stated. However, he loves that the game has an origin story that he is very proud of, and he learned a lot from his time on the original Wasteland. </p>



<p>Fargo eventually did make sequels for the Wasteland series as the studio head at inExile Entertainment, with Wasteland 2 releasing in 2014 and Wasteland 3 releasing in 2020. </p>

Additionally, Fallout 5 has reportedly been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-bethesda-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fully greenlit</a>, according to a recent claim.

<p>Gears of War: Reloaded embraces unity and squad goals. With multiplayer available, implementing crossplay is a must, but it isn’t always easy. This handy guide has answers to all key crossplay and cross-progression questions.</p>



<p>The Coalition could have simply brought back Gears 1’s campaign, and that’s it. But no, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> has the campaign, co-op, and authentic multiplayer. It’s the complete package for one of the most beloved shooters of our time.</p>



<p>The second you mention multiplayer, the word ‘crossplay’ usually follows. Many games utilize crossplay, so let’s see if Gears of War: Reloaded is the same.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-crossplay-in-gears-of-war-reloaded">Is There Crossplay in Gears of War: Reloaded?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>My brother. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Gears of War: Reloaded boasts complete crossplay functionality at launch, meaning you can hop into online campaign sessions and multiplayer matches with players from other formats.</strong></p>



<p>It really is the total package, isn’t it? The Coalition has confirmed through the official <a href="https://www.gearsofwar.com/games/gears-reloaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reloaded</a> website that the game has: “Crossplay across platforms, allowing you and your friends to squad-up wherever you play.”</p>



<p>There’s nothing wrong with you flying solo. However, if you desperately need allies to help you complete the impossible Insane difficulty, crossplay allows you to team up and take down Locusts without restrictions.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-cross-progression">Does Gears of War: Reloaded Have Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p><strong>Cross-progression is available for Gears of War: Reloaded, which allows you to transfer your save data across compatible platforms.</strong></p>



<p>We’re two for two so far in this guide! We defer to Reloaded’s official site once more on this one: “Jump from one platform to another and your campaign saves as well as multiplayer progression will come with you.”</p>



<p>This is two-fold:</p>



<ul>
<li>You can save your campaign progress on one format and resume where you left off elsewhere.</li>



<li>Your online multiplayer data you’ve accrued is also transferable across Reloaded’s applicable platforms.</li>
</ul>



<p>You’re not hindered by one platform. Let me explain more about that below for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-platforms-is-gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-compatible-with">Which Platforms is Gears of War: Reloaded Crossplay Compatible With?</h2>



<p><strong>Gears of War: Reloaded’s crossplay and cross-progression functions apply to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>You can buy and own Reloaded on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. In short, any save data on one console can be loaded on another or a PC. I know many of you own multiple platforms in this day and age, so it’s nice to see The Coalition fully embrace this.</p>



<p>Sorry to Nintendo Switch 2 owners, it doesn’t look like there’s any love for you guys right now.</p>



<hr>



<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has everything and more. Is it an easy day-one purchase for you? What’s the first thing you’ll do when you get it? Let me know through the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sniping looks incredible in Battlefield 6, but there has been a consistent complaint: Sniper Glint. A Battlefield 6 dev has addressed this via social media and promises big changes coming to the game mechanic.</p>



<p>Nearly everything about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-phantom-edition-contents-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has looked impressive. Battlefield Labs has been an eye-opening experience, with hundreds and thousands of matches taking place. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-peaks-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BF6 beta</a> opens up the player pool significantly, and we can see for ourselves what it looks and feels like.</p>



<p>But gameplay leaks and official footage have already shown how extreme Sniper Glint is.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-sniper-glint-will-be-toned-down">Battlefield 6 Sniper Glint Will be “Toned Down”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I’m blind. Image via Battlefield Studios </figcaption></figure>



<p>Being a sniper is all about stealth and secrecy. Ensuring your position isn’t compromised so the enemy can be neutralized without a fuss. A social media post from <a href="https://x.com/TheBFWire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Wire</a> shows how exposed snipers are when aiming down their scopes.</p>



<p>It’s so distinct that the page even asked: “Do you think that Battlefield 6 should have Sniper Glint?”</p>







<p>Well, it caught the attention of Florian Le Bihan AKA DRUNKKZ3—a former player turned Principal Game Designer for DICE. They replied: “Yes. It’ll get toned down in scale a bit but it’s here to stay.”</p>



<p>Sniper Glint isn’t going anywhere. This is a good thing, as no Sniper Glint would be unfair. With no killcams and expansive maps, while snipers could do what the role asks of them very well, it could be too OP.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Yes 🙂 It’ll get toned down in scale a bit but it’s here to stay</span></p></article></div>



<p>We don’t know the scale of the Sniper Glint nerfs. It’s likely DICE will tweak the glint until the developer and player base are happy with the changes. How problematic do you think Sniper Glint is in its current state? How much is too much? Let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-age-assurance-security-settings-leaks-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-age-assurance-security-settings-leak-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1263150/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Reports of GTA Online adding new age verification measures were recently leaked. Now, a new claim has shown the GTA age assurance settings with preview screens that aren’t live in Grant Theft Auto just yet.</p>



<p>Age verification has gone from being a concept to a full-blown enforcement of the practice. The UK has seen a huge clampdown on certain content—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/uk-age-verification-laws-online-safety-act-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including gaming websites</a>—and it could be spreading to gaming. It was recently claimed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-will-soon-require-age-verification-to-play-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online was gearing up to add age verification</a> to the game.</p>



<p>A new development shows it’s more than likely happening.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-online-age-assurance-preview-leaks">GTA Online Age Assurance Preview Leaks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What does this mean for the future of GTA? Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Trusted source <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tez2</a> was the one to break the initial age assurance story. Now, the leaker has shared “A preview of age assurance in-game,” but said, “This is not active yet.”</p>



<p>The first screenshot shows a new screen for GTA Online saying: “Verify Age – Please verify your age to access online features.”</p>



<p>Whereas the second screenshot shows ‘Additional Settings,’ which include the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Verify Age</li>



<li>Online Access (On/Off)</li>



<li>Store Access (On/Off)</li>



<li>Snapmatic Upload (On/Off)</li>
</ul>



<p>This information should be taken with a pinch of salt as it is a leak. Until Rockstar Games officially announces the introduction of age assurance and verification methods, it’s not absolute. However, Tez2 is rarely wrong, and we’ve already seen the code in the game files.</p>



<p>Plans could always change, so stay tuned.</p>



<div><article><p><span>A preview of age assurance in-game. This is not active yet.
</span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTAOnline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GTAOnline</a></p></article></div>



<p>I think this is only the beginning of age verification across the UK and the rest of the world. Many apps, games, sites, and pieces of content won’t be safe from these new rules and regulations. Will age assurance stop you from enjoying the content you like? Or will you go ahead and do it anyway? We’re keen to hear your thoughts over at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Destruction has always been a big selling point in Battlefield. With EA, DICE, and Battlefield Studios as a whole working hard to develop and market Battlefield 6, we know there’s a huge helping of destruction in the game, but you should temper your expectations.</p>



<p>My life changed the day I properly got into Battlefield: Bad Company, being my introduction. I’d only ever known using doors to enter a room, not grabbing a grenade launcher and blowing a gaping crater into the side of a house. Whereas Battlefield 4’s Levelution is still some of the most visually impressive gaming I’ve ever seen.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-took-huge-inspiration-from-bad-company-2s-destruction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 takes inspiration from Bad Company 2’s destruction</a>, that’s a fact. It’s been confirmed BF6 won’t let you flatten maps, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-dice-wants-interesting-scene-changes-in-battlefield-6">DICE Wants “Interesting Scene Changes” in Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Automated wrecking balls. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GNN</a> (through <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1952869411125100656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Bulletin</a>) learned many new details about Battlefield 6 through a special multiplayer event.</p>



<p>The game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-time-to-kill-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time-to-kill system</a> was covered in great detail—an ever-controversial topic in the community. But additional details about the game’s destruction were discussed.</p>



<p>GNN managed to grab an interesting quote on BF6 destruction: “We’re not aiming for complete destruction of entire areas, like turning a battlefield into a parking lot with nothing left. Instead, we aim to create interesting, environmentally stimulating effects through destruction – primarily creating interesting scene changes.”</p>



<p>If you have a village of houses, for example, I think it’s fair to assume you won’t be able to destroy them all until they resemble nothing but rubble. Certain houses might have scripted destruction or limitations—one house will only let you blow holes through the floors and walls, maybe?</p>



<p>Either way, we’ve seen from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-reveal-will-contain-3-hours-of-multiplayer-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer reveal event</a> and other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leak-shows-battle-royale-map-poi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay leaks</a> that Battlefield 6 doesn’t skimp on the level of chaos and anarchy you can inject into every match.</p>



<p>Is it a good thing that you can’t fully destroy entire maps? Or should it have specific maps and modes where this is possible? Let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. Worst case, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-upgrade-players-build-own-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Portal</a> should have something along these lines.</p>
