<p>During CES 2025, Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku revealed a 35-second snippet of in-engine gameplay from the ‘New Virtua Fighter Project’ that was unveiled during The Game Awards 2024. The glimpse of this developing title <strong>isn’t </strong>a gameplay sequence, but it’s a perfect representation of what RGG is aiming for with the first new Virtua Fighter game in almost 20 years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pre-development-only-no-gameplay">Pre-Development Only, No Gameplay</h2>



<p>It’s important to stress that the 35-second clip aired by Sega <strong>is not </strong>gameplay. It’s pre-development footage taken from the game’s engine.</p>



<p>In the short video, we get a look at two characters fighting in a marketplace after a brief introduction,. They trade blows for a few seconds, kicking each other into destructible elements of the environment before the sequence fades to black and the Sega logo flashes up.</p>



<p>Check it out here:</p>

<iframe title="“New VIRTUA FIGHTER Project” pre-development concept video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtLRfES1YQU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s little more than a conceptual thing, but it admittedly looks brilliant, and that’s coming from someone who has never enjoyed a fighting game. The small details like the NPCs milling around in the background are super, and the intro sequence is interesting, taking players outside of the typically tiny environments that players fight in.</p>



<p>At The Game Awards 2024, RGG unveiled the ‘New Virtua Fighter Project’, which will be the first new VF game in the series since 2006. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/acer-nitro-blaze-11-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/acer-has-revealed-the-nitro-blaze-11-an-enormous-gaming-handheld.1075728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/acer-nitro-blaze-11-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Acer’s recently revealed Nitro Blaze 11 is a new handheld, but they’re cutting it close with the dimensions of this thing. With a massive 10.95-inch display, the Nitro Blaze 11 is by far the chunkiest gaming handheld on the market, and it weighs more than three times as much as a Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>It’ll be a forearm workout just wielding the thing, regardless of how powerful or capable it is under the hood.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-high-performance-portable-gaming">‘High-Performance Portable Gaming’</h2>



<p>Acer’s Nitro Blaze 11 is a certified handheld device, but the portable aspect might be coming under question, given the size and weight of the thing. Once you’ve factored in the casing, the Nitro Blaze 11 is going to be 12 or 13 inches across, which trumps the ASUS ROG Ally X by a couple of inches.</p>



<p>It also weighs a staggering 1050g, while the Ally X, which is widely seen as the industry leader, weighs just 670g. That means a lot when it comes to a portable device. Do you really want to spend a lot of time gaming on something that weighs more than a kilo?</p>



<p>Size aside, the Nitro Blaze 11 is more than capable. It features a 120Hz display, an AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS processor, and up to 2 TB of storage. It also has detachable controllers in case you want to take the weight off, and it accommodates WiFi 6E and USB 4.</p>



<p>In the product’s blurb, Acer wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nitro Blaze 11 smoothly transitions between daily tasks and gaming. Whether you’re browsing, working, or playing, this handheld adapts seamlessly with precise Hall Effect sticks, a sturdy built-in stand, and detachable controllers that provide flexibility for solo or connected play with the included connector. The front camera makes video calls and streaming easy, ensuring you stay connected wherever you are.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Also, the gigantic screen will likely be a monumental drain on the relatively small battery. The Acer Nitro Blaze 11 comes with a 55 Wh battery, which is nothing compared to the Ally X’s 80 Wh battery.</p>



<p>Finally, the price point isn’t ideal. The Acer Nitro Blaze 11 will set you back a whopping $1199, making it the most expensive gaming handheld on the market right now. It’s hard to see a real selling point for this device if I’m being honest.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/former-bethesda-dev-tired-massive-games/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/former-bethesda-dev-tired-massive-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bethesda is the king of the castle when it comes to expansive, enormous games. Over the years, the company has produced the likes of Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, and most recently, Starfield, all massive open-world titles with hundreds of hours of content. However, one developer who contributed to many of these creations has suggested that players are ‘fatigued’ by these types of games.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Kiwi Talkz on YouTube, Will Shen, former lead quest designer on Starfield, said just that. He believes that players are growing tired of 100-hour campaigns and gargantuan worlds that can’t possibly be explored in their entirety.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-tall-order">‘A Tall Order’</h2>



<p>Speaking exclusively to Kiwi Talkz, Will Shen explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re reaching a point where people are fatigued — or a large section, a growing section of the audience, is becoming fatigued at investing 30-plus, 100-plus hours into a game.</p>



<p>They already have the games that they will continually come back to, and adding another one to that list is a tall order. It’s always a tall order.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Shen was instrumental in the delivery of Starfield, the biggest game that Bethesda Game Studios has ever produced. It features more than 1000 planets, all of which can be explored by the player at will. Before that, he worked on Skyrim and Fallout 4, which are gigantic games in their own right, if not by map size then at least by the amount you can do in them.</p>



<p>He mentioned that you can ‘pretty much play (these games) forever’, which is true for many Bethesda titles.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview for your perusal:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="#181 - Will Shen Interview (Designer On Skyrim, Fallout 4, 76 &amp; Starfield)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PCYpt9Zg7cM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Will Shen left Bethesda Game Studios after a 15-year stint in October 2023, just a month after the release of Starfield. He moved into Something Wicked Games to work on Wyrdsong, and since August 2024, he has assumed a lead designer role at Unknown Worlds Entertainment.</p>

<p>ASUS ROG has revealed the 2025 ROG G700 gaming desktop, a stunning device with more power under the hood than you could dream of. It comes equipped with either an Intel Ultra 9 or a Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor and an all-new NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, packing a whopping 32 GB of VRAM.</p>



<p>It’s a purpose-built device that features ‘hyper-efficient cooling’, ‘tool-less entry’, and ‘flagship-level performance’, per the release from ASUS ROG.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-last-pc-you-ll-buy">The Last PC You’ll Buy</h2>



<p>During CES 2025, ASUS ROG unveiled the <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-rog-g700-gaming-desktop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2025 G700 desktop</a>, uncovering a PC with unparalleled gaming power.</p>



<p>Featuring the latest innovations in PC hardware, the G700 can rock the newest Intel and AMD processors, which go hand-in-hand with the recently revealed NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU. This powerhouse of a unit features 32 GB of GDDR7 VRAM, which will provide gamers with a blistering gaming experience.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the G700 features up to 64 GB of DDR5 RAM and a 2 TB PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD.</p>



<p>If you want to tweak, expand, or upgrade (yeah, right) the G700 desktop, you can do so with ease. One of the selling points of the G700 is that it boasts tool-less entry and standard-sized components that make maintenance a breeze.</p>



<p>If you’re concerned about the heat that’ll be generated by the top-of-the-range CPU, GPU, and the 1000W PSU, fear not. The team has promised hyper-efficient cooling that can be customised to suit either an air-cooled or water-cooled preference, as well as dust filters and a unique airflow path. </p>



<p>The price point of the G700 is yet to be revealed, but would you consider making a massive investment in this PC? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Samsung has lifted the lid on a staggering piece of gaming technology at CES 2025 – the Odyssey OLED G60SF. It’s the world’s first 500Hz monitor, and it’s a stunning OLED device with the lowest response time in the business at just 0.03ms. It’s a new bar for high-end monitor manufacturers to aim for, and it’s set to change gaming experiences worldwide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-evolution">The Evolution</h2>



<p>Samsung’s Odyssey range has long been known as a pinnacle of technology, but the latest devices revealed during CES 2025 are borderline ridiculous.</p>



<p>The G60SF is set to shatter expectations, delivering a world-first 500Hz experience in 4K. It’s a VESA DisplayHDR TrueBlack 400-certified unit, which means the depth of contrast and colour will be unparalleled. It’s a 27-inch monitor that’ll blow your hair back, and it comes with HDR10+ capabilities.</p>



<p>Alongside the new G60SF, Samsung also revealed the Odyssey 3D, a glasses-free 3D display that utilises light field display technology to give you an immersive experience, the likes of which are currently unseen in the industry. It’s a hyper-ergonomic monitor with stacks of adjustment options, plus a 4K resolution and 1 ms response time to boot.</p>



<p>Also, Samsung took the opportunity to show off the Odyssey G7. This all-new, 40-inch display boasts a 21:9 resolution over a super-sized, widescreen profile. It’s the industry’s first 40-inch gaming monitor, and it’s enormous. If you want to cut down the number of screens you’re using, why not opt for one giant display with the Odyssey G7?</p>



<p>The price point for the 500Hz OLED G60SF is yet to be revealed, but you can bet your last dollar it’ll be a pretty penny. It’s one of the most innovative and incredible monitors I’ve ever seen, so you can be sure it’ll break the bank.</p>

<p>Recently, a slew of leaks and reveals surfaced online from the Marvel Rivals universe. Since being released on December 6, Marvel Rivals has established itself as a powerhouse title, maintaining a solid player base and refusing to stop growing, soaring up the charts as players dive in to experience the free-to-play, Marvel-backed shooter.</p>



<p>The most recent reveal showcased Reed Richards’ ‘The Maker’ skin, which will arrive with the introduction of the Fantastic Four on January 10. In a series of leaks, the Invisible Woman was detailed further, with her Malice skin being revealed alongside gameplay snippets.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-fantastic">That’s Fantastic</h2>



<p>In a leak posted online by Rivals_Leaks, a promotional image of Malice and The Maker was revealed. These skins, which are tied to Sue Storm and Reed Richards respectively, are now half-confirmed. Following the leak, NetEase posted a short clip showcasing The Maker, the skin for Mr. Fantastic that’ll arrive when the team enters the game on January 10:</p>

<p>Malice is yet to be unveiled in the same fashion, but NetEase did show the full promotional image at the end of the short trailer above. However, Sue Storm’s character was shown fighting bots while wearing the skin in a quick leak, also posted on socials by Rivals_Leaks (originally from RivalsLeaks):</p>











<p>The Fantastic Four will be the latest in a long line of iconic characters to make their way into Marvel Rivals. The game has a stunning lineup of characters and given how expansive the Marvel universe is, there’s a roster to pick from that’ll keep NetEase busy for quite some time.</p>

<p>WWE 2K25 has been teased by 2K and WWE during RAW’s first show on Netflix. The grandiose event, which was backed by a star-studded cast featuring John Cena, Roman Reigns, The Rock, and CM Punk, served as the official welcome for WWE on Netflix.</p>



<p>More information will be revealed by 2K on January 28, but the game can already be wishlisted on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-grand-reveal">Grand Reveal</h2>



<p>The upcoming reveal of WWE 2K25 has fans energised, and it comes just days after WWE 2K23 was finally taken offline, leaving just WWE 2K24 in a fully playable state.</p>



<p>Here’s the statement offered by 2K in the wake of the tease:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>WWE 2K returns bigger, bolder, and better than ever in a breakthrough year for the franchise! WWE 2K25 is preparing to charge down the ramp with all the authenticity and action fans love from the best in sports entertainment.</p>



<p>Discover game-changing features, iconic Superstars, and more details on&nbsp;<strong>January 28th, 2025.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The expectation is that WWE 2K25 will follow a similar release pattern to last year’s instalment, dropping in April 2025 – but that’s speculation and nothing more. </p>



<p>Following the teasers, Xbox took to social media to reveal the first screenshots of the game:</p>











<p>This tells us that at least CM Punk, Damien Priest, Liv Morgan, and Cody Rhodes will appear in the game, but that’s hardly a revelation in itself. What fans are most curious about is who will feature as the cover star for WWE 2K25. Last year, it was Cody Rhodes, and the year before that, John Cena took centre stage. </p>



<p>Given that all the recent talk is centred around John Cena’s epic retirement tour, could the superstar make yet another appearance on the cover of a WWE game? </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-chinese-military-blacklist/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-united-states-just-added-tencent-to-a-%E2%80%98chinese-military-blacklist%E2%80%99.1075680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-chinese-military-blacklist/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been reported that the United States has added Tencent Holdings Ltd. to a blacklist identifying companies as having ties to the Chinese military. This story was shared by Bloomberg, and as the revelation broke online, Tencent’s shares declined. Tencent was joined by CATL, a tech manufacturer linked with Tesla.</p>



<p>Tencent is China’s most valuable company and has a reach that covers some of the biggest video game companies on the planet, such as Epic Games, Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Riot Games, and SuperCell.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pentagon-warning">Pentagon Warning</h2>



<p>The ‘blacklist’, backed by the Pentagon, indicates whether a company is inherently linked to China’s military or the nation’s ‘defence industrial base’. In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s recent report</a>, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s unclear whether either company deals regularly with the PLA. Beyond direct ties to the government, US officials have pointed to laws that require Chinese companies to share information with Beijing on matters deemed relevant to national security.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tencent’s stock value took a dive as the Pentagon’s designation hit the airwaves. It was followed up by a statement from Tencent’s representatives:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was suggested <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9q78wn9g8zo">by the BBC</a> that the Pentagon had been ‘pressured’ to add more Chinese companies to the blacklist, which is how CATL, a company that contributes to the manufacture of electric cars, ended up on the list.</p>



<p>Historically, companies have challenged the Pentagon’s decisions regarding this damning blacklist. For instance, DJI and Hesai Technologies took the intelligence agency to court but at the time of publishing, both remain on the list. In 2021, Xiaomi successfully petitioned for a removal from the blacklist.</p>

<p>Recently, rumours started circulating online regarding a Steam Deck 2, powered by AMD’s Ryzen Z2 processor, revealed just hours ago. The source of this speculation came from VideoCardz.com, which was the first site to share slides containing tech specs for the new processors, one of which mentioned that Valve’s Steam Deck would be a recipient of the Z2.</p>



<p>However, a Valve employee has taken to social media to declare that there is not and ‘will be no Z2 Steam Deck’, clearing the air and setting the story straight.</p>

<h2 id="h-for-now">For Now?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lf36y66ggs2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, Valve employee Pierre-Loup Griffais wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There is (not) and will be no Z2 Steam Deck. Guessing the slide was meant to say the series is meant for products like that, not announcing anything specific.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The slide in question also mentioned the Legion Go and Asus ROG Ally, which already feature AMD’s Z1 processor range. It’s easy to see how the assumption could have been made that it would be <strong>the next Steam Deck </strong>that would house the Ryzen Z2, but that’s not the case.</p>



<p>In a report by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, it was highlighted that AMD wouldn’t confirm either way whether the Z2 would be implemented in a Steam Deck 2 unit, nor would it mention <strong>any </strong>definite home for the new hardware – Lenovo, Asus, MSI, or whatever else. These conversations took place at CES, the ultimate stage for tech announcements. </p>



<p>With all that being said, there <strong>is </strong>a Steam Deck 2 on the horizon – Valve has made it clear that it intends to produce one at some point, such as the natural lifecycle of any gaming device. Only time will tell what hardware powers the device, though. For now, it doesn’t look like it’ll go hand-in-hand with an AMD Ryzen Z2 processor.</p>
