<p>Welcome everyone to Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast for February 28, 2025. In this week’s episode: Warner Bros. Games Implodes with Wonder Woman being canceled and studios closed, Delta Force is “too hard”, and Sony is being sued.</p>



<p>Mike, Grant, Albert, and Tom also discuss a topic that’s been making the rounds lately and that’s how much blame should be put on games media for the state of the industry and the struggles currently facing many studios. Tom is also here to tease new games and stories coming soon to Insider Gaming.</p>

<p>Triumphant Light is the second-ever mini-set in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket. Every card is new, each one is hotter than a Charmander’s tail, and secret missions and rewards await if you can collect specific ones.</p>



<p>Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket consistently ushers new sets into the mobile title. We’ve had a healthy mix of main sets and mini-sets, each one trying to outdo the last. The meta keeps changing, features keep being added—hello <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-ranked-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-period-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Battles</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-trade-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading</a>—and Pokémon&nbsp;Pocket keeps growing.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-officially-announced-ranked-battles-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a> triumphantly landed in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket on February 28. It has an extensive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-triumphant-light-card-list-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">card list</a> to tick off, but it also has many secret missions and rewards.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Here we go again. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are four secret missions in total to complete. Each Triumphant Light secret mission requires you to collect certain cards from the mini-set. Many of them are Full Arts and Rares, meaning it could take time to collect every single one.</p>



<p>You might be able to trade to get the harder-to-obtain cards, but until then, you need to hope luck is on your side.</p>

<p>Do you think Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket needs to give us different ways to earn the rarest cards? Or is it better being a complete lottery about what you can pull from packs? Let us know if you have any ideas.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-hits-1-3-million-concurrent-players-on-steam-in-12-hours.1121844/</guid>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has already hit 1.3 million concurrent players on Steam in just 12 hours after its release.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2246340/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the game is currently in the number one seller spot, despite having a ‘Mixed’ review rating from 9000+ reviews.</p>



<p>The concurrent player player count currently places Monster Hunter Wilds in seventh place, with sixth and fifth place (Dota 2 and Lost Ark) only within an additional 30,000 players. </p>



<p>Traditionally, Friday game releases usually see a bigger concurrent growth number on the weekend, so it’s currently unclear on where the game will finish with its player count.</p>



<p>As mentioned, the games release hasn’t been without its problems though, with many players complain of poor performance issues and a lack of opimisation.</p>



<p>“This game is absolutely amazing – but has the worst optimisation I’ve ever seen,” said one Steam user.</p>



<p>He continued, “I understand that new games are becoming more demanding and people are expected to upgrade, but this is absurd. I’m aware this isn’t the first instance of new games having poor performance on launch, because the same thing happened with World, but it feels inexcusable at this point.”</p>



<p>Another user said, “How does a game manage to run perfectly fine in the Open Beta AND I receive an Excellent rating score on the benchmark but the actual product that costs ACTUAL MONEY runs like absolute sludge. I have legit never encountered a game that wasn’t at worst playable. I have never seen a game run this poorly while still looking this bad.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a> has since <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1895397927557980292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a> to the complaints on X (formerly Twitter), with suggestions on how to improve performance. </p>



<p>“Hunters! If you’re experiencing any initial issues with Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam, please try updating your graphics driver, turning off compatibility mode, and then readjust your settings,” they said.</p>
