<p>Catly developers SuperAuthenti have released gameplay of its game following allegations that the game used AI for its trailer that was shown during 2024’s The Game Awards.</p>



<p>Despite SuperAuthenti shooting down the allegations repeatedly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/catly-devs-no-ai-used-in-the-trailer-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the developers seemingly couldn’t escape accusations</a> that the game had used AI and web3 technologies. A PR representative said, “We are very surprised by such speculations. We do not think there are any existing AI tools that can produce a video like that. Industry experts have echoed this opinion.”</p>



<p>The developers have since uploaded gameplay <span>to its&nbsp;</span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987350/Catly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><span>St</span>eam page</a>, which shows that the game is real and uses Unreal Engine 5.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Catly’s game description reads, “An open-world adventure filled with surprises and joy, side by side with Cats! Build your dream island, meet various characters, and enjoy caring for your cats, dressing up, building, farming, racing, skiing, and much more! Explore freely and have endless fun with your furry companions!”</p>



<p>As for whether the original reveal trailer used AI or not remains to be seen, but the recent gameplay trailer release begs the question of why the developers didn’t release it in the first place. After all, there should have been some internal concerns that the original reveal trailer looked somewhat dodgy. </p>



<p>What do you think of Catly’s gameplay video? Have the developers regained trust with its recent trailer? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/top-call-of-duty-players-to-watch-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty League’s 2025 season is in full flow, and there are plenty of players on the board eager to prove themselves this year. It has been a mixed bag of matches to kickstart the competitive season, and some shockers have been handed out. In the opening weeks of the CDL 2025 season, Atlanta FaZe plummeted to the bottom of the table, sending shockwaves through COD’s community.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m going to break down the top Call of Duty players to watch in 2025. From the upcoming rookie talent to the future world champions, this list covers everyone worth watching this season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mixed-bag">Mixed Bag</h2>



<p>Here are the players you should keep an eye on as the competitive season unfolds.</p>



<h3 id="h-isaiah-gwinn-gwinn">Isaiah ‘Gwinn’ Gwinn</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Gwinn hit the ground running this year with the Carolina Royal Ravens. He served an instrumental role in the team being propelled to the top of the table, securing a perfect record in the opening weeks against some capable squads, including Atlanta FaZe. He was pivotal in handing FaZe the first 0 – 3 loss the team has secured in almost two years.</p>



<p>By mid-December, Gwinn was sitting on a KD of 1.34, leading the pack and standing atop some of the best Call of Duty players in the world.</p>



<h3 id="h-thomas-scrap-ernst">Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Scrap’s ascension has been a glorious thing to watch. He started as a loud-mouthed rookie on Toronto Ultra, beefing with anyone who would look in his direction. He eventually mellowed and became much more rounded out as a player, but the Call of Duty League Championship has remained out of reach for him two years in a row.</p>



<p>With a second-place finish in 2023 and a third-place finish in 2024, it’s only a matter of time before this world-class player secures his trophy, and this year, he’s backed by a killer team on LA Thieves.</p>



<h3 id="h-anthony-shotzzy-cuevas-castro">Anthony ‘Shotzzy’ Cuevas-Castro</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s impossible to jot down the most electrifying competitors in COD esports and <strong>not </strong>include Shotzzy. For years, this young pro player has been a superstar of the game, securing two world championships and dominating from every angle. He’s one of the most entertaining players to watch, and many consider him to be godlike on the sticks.</p>



<p>Last year, he secured the world championship with OpTic Texas, and he’s already started strong this season. In Black Ops 6, Shotzzy can make the most of Omnimovement, flying around the map with reckless abandon, and even if he doesn’t go back-to-back at CDL Champs, he’s one of the most hilarious players to watch, period.</p>



<h3 id="h-khalid-khhx-almadhi">Khalid ‘Khhx’ Almadhi</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Khhx is one of the newest players in the Call of Duty League, entering the fray with the Vegas Falcons, an all-new squad backed by a Saudi Arabian investment. Fans wrote off the Vegas Falcons ahead of the competitive season, and a donut hasn’t helped the squad gain much traction, but a standout member of the team is Khalid ‘Khhx’ Almadhi.</p>



<p>At the time of publishing, the Vegas Falcons boasted a 0 – 4 win record and a 14% map win percentage, which is woeful, but Khhx has been working like gangbusters to escape the bottom of the leaderboard.</p>



<p>His debut match against the Royal Ravens was a loss, but it saw him secure a solid opening KD, and per the stats, he went on to hit a 1.28 KD in his second spin, becoming the first player to kickstart his tenure in the CDL with two matches above a 1.2 KD. To open the season, he sat above the likes of Dashy and Pred in terms of overall KD.</p>



<h3 id="h-paco-hydra-rusiewiez">Paco ‘HyDra’ Rusiewiez</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>HyDra has been a phenomenal player year in, year out since debuting with the New York Subliners in 2021. In the Modern Warfare II season, he skyrocketed to success with the squad, securing two Major wins and a world championship victory, along with a smattering of MVP awards.</p>



<p>Last season, he snatched a second-place finish at COD Champs, securing some of the most exhilarating plays in the wider tournament and cementing himself as one to watch for years to come. This year, he’s flying the LA Thieves banner alongside Envoy, Scrap, and Ghosty, which many consider to be one of the greatest potential-filled rosters <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>He has opened the season with a 1.18 overall KD and a perfect record of 4 – 0, at the time of publishing. Few players are more worthy of your time or attention than HyDra.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Naoe Will Be ‘The Fastest Assassin We Ever Made’, Ubisoft Says]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/naoe-fastest-assassin-ever/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/naoe-will-be-%E2%80%98the-fastest-assassin-we-ever-made%E2%80%99-ubisoft-says.1066056/</guid>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released early next year, and already the game has started splitting the community down the middle. Since the title was revealed by Ubisoft earlier this year, it has proven to be a divisive game, and nobody truly knows how to feel about it. It was given a significant pushback by Ubisoft already, as it was supposed to be released in October 2024.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Ubisoft’s Jonathan Dumont took a deep dive into Naoe, one of the game’s lead characters who fights alongside Yasuke, the first assassin in the series based on someone who <strong>actually existed</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-super-speedy">Super Speedy</h2>



<p>In the interview with Entertainment Weekly, the creative director of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Jonathan Dumont, explained the advantages of Naoe, a ‘shinobi’-style character with insane agility levels:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Naoe’s the fastest Assassin we ever made. She runs super fast, she has a lot of gadgets to keep her stealth so that she doesn’t have to fight often. We wanted to satisfy that for players that come in for that ninja-Assassin game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Assassin’s Creed fans spent years begging for a title to surface set in Japan, but when it was finally revealed, it left many feeling disappointed. Given that Ubisoft was beaten to the punch by the likes of Ghost of Tsushima, a high bar has been set that the current Ubisoft formula might not be able to reach.</p>



<p>The proof will be in the pudding, though.</p>



<p>In 2023, Ubisoft released Assassin’s Creed Mirage, and it was taken in remarkably well by fans because it was a small-form game that was seen as a return to the more classic AC experience. In AC Shadows, it’s back to the gargantuan open-world RPG model.</p>



<p>In Shadows, Naoe’s story is all about self-discovery and the betterment of her character and those close to her. Dumont explored that in the interview with <a href="https://ew.com/assassins-creed-shadows-naoe-backstory-fastest-assassin-we-ever-made-exclusive-8762696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>She will start a bit of a path of vengeance or fulfilling a promise that she made to her family. As she discovers a world in need, she begins to really value the community values her father taught. Can she make a better world?</p>



<p>The Hidden Blade is given by her father, and we’re going to learn a little bit more what that means.</p>



<p>She does feel like a panther looking at her prey.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will launch amidst a packed release window on February 14 – are you looking forward to the game? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
