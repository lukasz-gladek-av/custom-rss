<p>The Daily Mail has shared new looks at Sophie Turner in the role of Lara Croft in the upcoming Tomb Raider series for Prime Video.</p>



<p>On February 6, 2026, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15534645/Sophie-Turner-stunts-set-Tomb-Raider.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Daily Mail </a>shared photos of Lara Croft in action, showing Sophie Turner parachuting over a lake and running through the woods. Instead of Croft’s signature green top and shorts, she wore athletic wear and cargo pants for the scene, which was filmed in the rain in Surrey.</p>



<p>As of yet, there’s no release date for the upcoming series, which will also feature Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs, and began filming in January. However, Sophie has already encountered some challenges while filming the role. She stated on the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSLuQpWjlj4&amp;pp=ygUeanVsaWEgY3VubmluZ2hhbSBzb3BoaWUgdHVybmVy"> Julia Cunningham Show</a> that she’d become aware of back issues during Tomb Raider training.</p>



<p>“I’ve learned I have a perpetual back problem, but I also realised that it’s much easier to kind of build muscle if you’ve ever worked out before in your life, which I never had,” she said.</p>
