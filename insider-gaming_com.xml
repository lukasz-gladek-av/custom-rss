<p>OpTic Gaming announced a major change to their OpTic Texas Call of Duty roster today, but it‚Äôs one fans have seen before. For the second time in just a matter of months, OpTic Texas has removed Amer ‚ÄúPred‚Äù Zulbeari in favor of Cuyler ‚ÄúHuke‚Äù Garland.</p>



<h2 id="h-huke-in-pred-out-of-optic-texas-to-kick-off-another-call-of-duty-rostermania-period">Huke In, Pred Out of OpTic Texas to Kick Off Another Call of Duty Rostermania Period</h2>



<p>OpTic officially said thank you (and goodbye) to Pred today, thanking him for his ‚Äúpassion and energy.‚Äù Back in December, just months after OpTic Texas claimed the CDL championship, Pred moved to the inactive roster, needing a break to ‚Äúhandle personal issues‚Äù and fix his mental health. Days later though, he confirmed that he was a free agent, though still under contract with OpTic.</p>



<div><article><p><span>A World Champion with passion and energy for the game that is truly special ‚ö°

Always a part of our legacy. Thank you </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Pred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Pred</a></p></article></div>



<p>In his place, Huke returned to the OpTic lineup after being away for more than a year. Following his CDL Championship with Dallas Empire in 2020, Huke had bounced around different spots, picking up stints with LA Thieves, LA Guerillas, the Seattle/Vancouver Surge. OpTic struggled early this season with Huke in the lineup, but even after Pred returned to the starting squad this past February, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-map-streak-kenny-lowest-kd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the results got even worse</a>.</p>



<p>Before the Stage Two Major last weekend, OpTic Texas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-skyz-new-official-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought in Cesar ‚ÄúSkyz‚Äù Bueno</a>, after a struggling Kenneth ‚ÄúKenny‚Äù Williams chose to step down. Now after a second major change, the OpTic Texas roster will look ahead to the Stage 3 Major Qualifiers at the start of April. However, don‚Äôt expect OpTic Texas to be the only teams to make roster moves before the next CDL stage begins.</p>



<p>Is this the right call for OpTic Texas? Let us know in the comments or on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Black Ops 6 fans can jump into Season 3 content 24 hours early, it‚Äôs been announced. A free trial is also being offered, but Warzone fans are likely to be disappointed with the news.</p>



<p>Call of Duty‚Äôs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 content was delayed</a> a while back. Activision needed more time to perfect the nuances of the content. There‚Äôs also a suspicion that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> needed extra time and care.</p>



<p>But it seems the Black Ops 6 development team is looking for an early start. BLOPS 6 Season 3 launches a day earlier than planned on April 2‚Äîbut it comes with a minor caveat.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-season-3-amp-verdansk-still-launches-on-april-3">Warzone Season 3 &amp; Verdansk Still Launches on April 3</h2>

<p>There‚Äôs no doubting the star attraction of Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3, and that‚Äôs the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-warzone-2-verdansk-pois/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a>. However, players eager to jump back into the classic battle royale map have to wait for the previously announced delayed date.</p>



<p>‚ÄúSeason 03 of #BlackOps6 will be dropping early on April 2nd with a 24 hour free trial,‚Äù posted the official <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty X page</a>. This is great news for Black Ops 6 fans and potential newcomers eager to try the FPS out.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, if you want Verdansk a day early, you‚Äôre out of luck. The message also went on to say: ‚ÄúDuring that time Call of Duty: Warzone will go offline in preparation for the launch of Verdansk on April 3. Anyone who opens the Call of Duty: Warzone game menu during that time will receive the Kilo 141 for free.‚Äù</p>

<p>We‚Äôve heard about Mortal Kombat content heading to Fortnite already. However, a new leak has pulled back the bloody curtain to reveal that March 28 potentially brings emotes, pickaxes, and skins to finish us (or anyone).</p>



<p>There was a time when I used to be shocked by Fortnite‚Äôs collaborations. It went out the window quickly once the likes of Kratos and Halo started dropping into Tilted Towers. Now, anyone who‚Äôs anyone can make an appearance‚Äîcheck out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sabrina-carpenter-might-be-the-next-playable-fortnite-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter</a> dialog if you don‚Äôt believe me. </p>



<p>But there‚Äôs something surreal about the brutal nature of Mortal Kombat entering a new realm. Alas, after initial talk of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-mortal-kombat-mythics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat content turning up for a fight in Fortnite</a>, it‚Äôs reportedly the case.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Get over here, Fortnite. Credit to NetherRealm</figcaption></figure>



<p>Renowned leaker <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a> has dropped a finishing blow on the MK and Fortnite conversation. They posted to their official X channel about the nature of the content coming to the battle royale shooter.</p>



<p>They provided a bullet-point list outlining some of the key inclusions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Scorpion (MK3) Skin: 1.500 vbucks</li>



<li>Kitana (MK3) Skin: 1500 vbucks</li>



<li>Raiden (MK3) Skin: 1500 vbucks</li>



<li>Scorpion‚Äôs Flame Skull backbling: 800 bucks</li>



<li>Raiden‚Äôs Amulet backbling: 400 vbucks#</li>



<li>Raiden‚Äôs Staff pickaxe: 800 bucks </li>



<li>Scorpion‚Äôs Katana Duo pickaxe: included with the backbling</li>



<li>Kitana‚Äôs Steel Fan pickaxe: 800 bucks</li>



<li>Kitana‚Äôs Fan Bear: included with the pickaxe</li>



<li>Kitana‚Äôs Fan Fado emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>FLAWLESS VICTORY emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>Toasty! emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>Test your strength emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>Guiding Staff Mark emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>Raiden‚Äôs Victory emote: 300 bucks</li>
</ul>



<p>They finish by saying to expect the items on <strong>March 28</strong>. You can check out the full message here.</p>

<p>This may be the beginning of a fun and fatal partnership. Take the leaks with the usual punch of salt, but there‚Äôs every chance you can start preparing your best kombos to drop onto unsuspecting Fortnite players.</p>



<p>The Mortal Kombat collab isn‚Äôt the only rumored to be in the works: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-collaborating-with-dragon-ball-daima-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Ball Daima</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-getting-a-kendrick-lamar-emote-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick Lamar</a> might be boarding the bus soon enough.</p>

<p>Fortnite might have another Dragon Ball collaboration in the works, and this time, it‚Äôs with the latest Daima series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As revealed by <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1904609271561805956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Loolo_WRLD</a> on X (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fortnite-reportedly-getting-dragon-ball-daima-skins-collaboration-crossover-item-shop-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>), ‚Äúan ID related to a new Dragon Ball wave‚Äù has been spotted in the Fortnite files, and it seems it could hint at new Daima skins. Reliable leaker Spheshal_Nick has added more information, stating that he has also recently heard about this collaboration. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Daima is the latest addition to the popular anime franchise, and players would love to see characters from the series come to Fortnite Island. Daima features some of the most hyped characters of the series, such as Vegeta Super Saiyan 3 and Goku Super Saiyan 4. It also has new fan-favourite characters like Glorio, the Tamagamis, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite has already collaborated with Dragon Ball in the past, with skins for Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Beerus, Goku Black, Piccolo, Cell, Bulma, Trunks, Android 17, Android 18 and Frieza present in the game. These characters also come with their own set of accessories and emotes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the cosmetics, Fortnite also had notable additions to gameplay for the Dragon Ball collaborations, including the Kamehameha and Nimbus Cloud (Kintoun) items in Battle Royale. They had also introduced a Dragon Ball Adventure Island where players could explore iconic locations from the series. It will be interesting to see if Fortnite receives additional themed gameplay for the alleged Daima collab.&nbsp;</p>
