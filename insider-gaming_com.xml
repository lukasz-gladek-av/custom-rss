<p>Isabela Merced is slated to star in a movie adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega’s </a>House of the Dead franchise.</p>



<p>It seems like video game franchises are being adapted for film and TV at a rapid pace. Not only are video game stalwarts like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog starring in brand-new movies, but more recent video games such as The Last of God and Uncharted are being adapted for TV series.</p>



<p>As first reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/isabela-merced-house-of-the-dead-film-adaptation-last-of-us-1236711085/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Isabela Merced, known for her work in the aforementioned The Last of Us TV series, will be in a leading role in a new film about the House of the Dead. Paul W.S. Anderson will write and direct the project. He previously adapted the Resident Evil franchise for the big screen over 20 years ago.</p>



<p>He also adapted the Monster Hunter series for a 2020 film, but it was not nearly as well-received as the Resident Evil movies.</p>



<p>In 2003 and 2006, two House of the Dead films were released, but they were critically panned.</p>



<h2 id="h-history-of-the-house-of-the-dead">History of the House of the Dead</h2>



<p>How’s the dead began life in 1997. It was originally a light gun arcade game. Games were regularly released up until House of the Dead 4 in 2005. An arcade release in 2018 was titled “Scarlet Dawn.”</p>



<p>There were also spin-offs, such as 1999’s The Typing of the Dead, designed to improve typing; it was later re-released for the Sega Dreamcast and PlayStation 2. 1999 also saw the arcade release of Revenge, a beat-’em-up take on the franchise.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming will keep you up to date with all the latest news regarding the House of the Dead movie.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another short trailer for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/" id="3170">Super Mario Galaxy movie</a> just dropped, and Yoshi again takes center stage, taking out one of Bowser’s most well-known minions in the most Yoshi way possible.</p>



<p>The new trailer, with the tagline “Level Up,” features previously seen clips of Bowser Jr., Mario, and Luigi. However, there are also new images of Princess Peach with Toad in a cyberpunk-looking environment, and at one point, they appear to enter a bar, with several low-level enemies from Mario video games giving them a dirty look.</p>



<p>Yoshi is also shown riding a motorcycle, similar to what Mario and Luigi did in a previous trailer. He also confronts Kamek, swallows him whole, lays an egg with Kamek’s glasses on it, and then pilots the vehicle Kamek had been piloting. Princess Rosalina is also seen in a brief action shot towards the end.</p>

<h2 id="h-this-movie-takes-inspiration-from-several-generations-of-super-mario-video-games">This Movie Takes Inspiration From Several Generations of Super Mario Video Games</h2>



<p>This movie is named after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/super-mario-galaxy/" id="2961">Super Mario Galaxy</a> video game, which was released on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-wii/" id="1031">Nintendo Wii</a>. but takes inspiration from many Mario games that came before and after the classic game from 2007.</p>



<p>A previous trailer showcased Birdo and Mouser from Super Mario Bros. 2. Baby Mario and Baby Luigi were also on display, being carried by Yoshi as they ran away from the realistic dinosaur featured in Super Mario Odyssey.</p>



<p>There has been no sign yet of Donkey Kong or any of the Kongs that were featured in the first Super Mario movie.</p>







<p>The movie is slated for release on April 1. It was previously noted that the movie was in post-production after animation was completed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s time for the weekend to roll around, but before you can start relaxing or doing whatever you planned to do today, you need to complete today’s NYT Connections puzzle! That’s why I’m here, actually. I’ve got the quickest and best NYT Connections hints and answers that you need to dominate today’s challenge.</p>



<p>Just read on to get the NYT Connections solutions you need for today, February 7!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-7">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 7)</h2>



<p>Today’s NYT Connections is <strong>really </strong>weird. It’s not words, but symbols, which means it’s one of the toughest NYT Connections puzzles I’ve ever seen. Here’s what you’re trying to solve today:</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Roll the dice</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – It’s all just mathematics</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Used in grammatical fields</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Simple letters</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 7:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-7-972">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 7 (#972)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DIVIDED BY, EQUALS, MINUS, PLUS</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – COLON, ELLIPSIS, PERIOD, QUOTATION MARK</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – I, L, T, X</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Prepare for some different nightmares in REANIMAL, with the review embargo set to lift in February. It’s a new stomping ground but familiar territory for Tarsier Studios, and fans of the studio will be hoping the developer can catch new lightning in a bottle.</p>



<p>When a new game arrives in all CAPS LOCKS, you know it’s game over. If you don’t know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tarsier-studios/" id="1858" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tarsier Studios</a>, it’s the genius company behind the sleep-interrupting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/little-nightmares/" id="985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares</a> I &amp; II. A subtle blend of horror, puzzles, and psychological warfare: So family-friendly, then. </p>



<p>If you want to know if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/reanimal/" id="170941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REANIMAL</a> is for you, then read on.</p>







<h2 id="h-reanimal-review-embargo-date-explained">REANIMAL Review Embargo Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Run! Credit to Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Insider Gaming has been told that the review embargo for REANIMAL is February 11.</strong></p>



<p>The good people at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/thq-nordic/" id="1461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">THQ Nordic</a> have informed Insider Gaming that you can look forward to reviews dropping on the 11th—two days before launch day!</p>

</ul>



<p>As usual, many reviews will be dropping, and you’ll quickly be able to get a sense of what REANIMAL’s about, with Metacritic and OpenCritic rounding up reviews and giving you the critical perspective.</p>



<p>Everyone knows that critics don’t know what they’re talking about, though! So, make sure to give REANIMAL a fair crack of the whip, whatever happens, and judge for yourself. If you don’t, it might come back to haunt your dreams.</p>







<h2 id="h-reanimal-review-embargo-release-times">REANIMAL&nbsp;Review Embargo Release Times</h2>



<p><strong>The review embargo for REANIMAL follows a similar release time pattern to most other big releases, dropping at 8 PM PT. If you’re based elsewhere, the time will differ slightly.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>Enough chit-chat, here’s a table showing you the review embargo release times for key regions.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center"><strong>Region / Time Zone</strong></th><th data-align="center"><strong>REANIMAL Review Embargo Dates &amp; Release Times</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">8:00 AM—February 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">10:00 AM—February 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">11:00 AM—February 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">4:00 PM—February 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">3:00 AM—February 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT)</td><td data-align="center">5:00 AM—February 12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>To reiterate, there’s ample time until REANIMAL’s February 13 release date. If the company’s previous work on Little Nightmares is anything to go by, some pretty good scores are inevitable.</p>
