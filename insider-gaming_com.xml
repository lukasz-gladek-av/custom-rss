<p>Call of Duty’s anti-cheat program, RICOCHET, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-anti-cheat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may not be perfect</a>, but it’s the only thing standing between cheaters and both Black Ops 6 and Warzone. With Season 03 about to start, the team that works on RICOCHET provided a progress report today, detailing all the strides made and the impending changes coming this season.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-3-anti-cheat-updates">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3 Anti-Cheat Updates</h2>



<p>Here are the key highlights from the latest RICOCHET Anti-Cheat update ahead of Season 03 of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p>



<h3 id="h-successes-so-far">Successes So Far</h3>



<p>Since the launch of Black Ops 6, Call of Duty’s anti-cheat efforts have put “over 20 cheat makers and dozens of cheat resellers” out of business. The RICOCHET team has issued over 228,000 bans since the game released and has claimed that 23% of cheaters were removed before even playing their first match. The team has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-anti-cheat-not-good-enough/">admitted in the past that the anti-cheat wasn’t good enough</a> when Ranked Play launched. They plan to improve their numbers with new systems to enhance their aim bot detection and “Machine Learning” system.</p>



<h3 id="h-killcam-improvements">Killcam Improvements</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The RICOCHET team says that there are many inaccurate reports of players who are simply have an intel advantage. To help combat this, the killcam in Season 03 will be outfitted with additional information, including a full list of detailed attackers, and new status messages. If you were revealed by the Live Ping perk, by UAV, or by firing an unsuppressed weapon, that information will show up in the killcam.</p>



<h3 id="h-ranked-skill-rating-refunds">Ranked Skill Rating Refunds</h3>



<p>In Season 03, Call of Duty will follow the trend set by other competitive shooters like CS2 and VALORANT, and provide rank rating refunds to players that lost to cheaters. When a cheater in ranked play is banned, anyone who they defeated recently will receive a Skill Rating refund. Initially, this will cover the most recent two weeks prior to the ban. Additionally, players who are playing with cheaters may also have SR taken away.</p>



<p>The SR refund system will go live for Black Ops 6 ranked shortly after the launch of Season 03, with a similar system planned for Warzone when ranked play finally goes live. </p>



<h3 id="h-stop-spamming">Stop Spamming</h3>



<p>Finally, RICOCHET provided the community with a piece of advice: stop spam reporting. The Anti-Cheat team says that spam reporting provides no additional insight, and will also “reduce the trust we have in future reports from an account and may result in punitive measures.”</p>



<p>The full list of announcements from the Call of Duty RICOCHET Anti-Cheat Season 03 update can be found <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-ricochet-black-ops-6-warzone-season-three-anti-cheat-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Season 03 goes live on April 2nd.</p>

<p>Developer Build A Rocket Boy has announced the release date for MindsEye. The game is currently scheduled to release for PC and current-gen consoles on June 10. IO Interactive Partners will serve as the publisher of the game.</p>



<div><p>One of the main reasons for the hype surrounding the game is the involvement of Leslie Benzies, the former producer of the GTA franchise. Check out the synopsis of the game:</p><p>“<em>Play as Jacob Diaz, a former elite soldier fitted with The MindsEye, a mysterious neural implant that haunts him with fragmented memories of a covert mission that changed his life forever. Fight to uncover the truth in a world where AI, high-tech experimentation, and unchecked military power shape every encounter. Jacob isn’t the only one searching for answers, forces working from the shadows may be more powerful and dangerous than he ever imagined</em>.”</p></div>



<p>Accompanying the release date reveal was a new cinematic trailer, offering a deeper glimpse into Redrock City’s society and its key players. The trailer introduces characters like the visionary tech magnate Marco Silva and the ambitious Mayor Shiva Vega, hinting at the complex power dynamics that will drive the game’s narrative.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-us-retailer-documents-shed-light-on-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans.1148157/</guid>

<p>Retailers are expecting that they will run out of pre-order units for the Nintendo Switch 2 on day 1, despite Nintendo allegedly accumulating a large quantity for launch.</p>



<p>That’s according to internal emails and documents provided to Insider Gaming from a large US retailer, who are anticipating they will sell out of the Switch 2 on the same day they open up the pre-orders due to a limited unit allocation from Nintendo.</p>



<p>According to the documents, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 is scheduled to release in June</a>, a release month that has already been a widely rumoured and was a highly talked about by developers at this year’s GDC.</p>



<p>However, the documents do add a little confusion as to when the pre-orders go live, especially following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-open-april-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Buy Canada “leak” </a>earlier this week that revealed they’d go live on April 2nd.</p>



<p>According to the documents from the US retailer, pre-orders are set to go live on April 9th, one week after the Nintendo Switch 2 direct. The documents include a messaging strategy following the direct to include “Pre-Order Coming Soon” messaging and a Countdown Clock that will end on April 9, with an exact time to be confirmed by Nintendo on April 2.</p>



<p>The documents also included details on a exclusive collectible coin for those who pre-order the console.</p>



<p>Whether or not Best Buy Canada’s “leak” was a mistake or not is unclear, but the company did promptly remove the information after it started circulating online. In any case though, pre-order’s are almost certainly going to live within a week of the direct.</p>



<p>Will you be buying the Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1783/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Developer Pearl Abyss has announced that it is ending support for Black Desert Online on last-gen consoles.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.console.playblackdesert.com/News/Notice/Detail?boardNo=19140&amp;countryType=en-US&amp;boardType=0&amp;searchType=&amp;searchText=%C2%A4tPage=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video going over</a> the plans, the studio revealed that the game’s native update for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will launch on June 26, 2025. At that point, the game will “shift to an exclusive PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S service”. This will result in support for the game on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4—both of which received the game in 2019—officially coming to an end.</p>



<p>“Gameplay on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will no longer be available after the porting update on June 26,” said Brian Choi, Black Desert console’s live service manager.</p>



<p>He continued to assure players that all game data will be saved and stored. Account information as well as all entitlements to Black Desert Online will be accessible when players decide to make the jump to the current-gen console version of the game.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“We understand that this news may be disappointing to many of you,” Choi said. “Black Desert has been consistently updated to provide a better experience for adventurers. However, as we mentioned in our previous video, despite the ongoing efforts to optimize and update content for older generation consoles, we have reached the point where hardware limitations make it increasingly difficult to deliver the latest content smoothly.”</p>



<p>When the update is released, it will be available at no additional cost for players who are making the jump to the current-gen systems.</p>
