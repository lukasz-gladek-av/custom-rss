<p>Football Manager 26 wouldn’t have reached its current level of polish and quality if last year’s entry hadn’t been scrapped, so says Sports Interactive Design Manager Ant Farley.</p>



<p>The game marks a significant step for the franchise as it leaves behind the Sports Interactive Operating System engine in favor of the Unity engine. This change saw Football Manager 25 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/">suffer through</a> multiple delays <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and feature cuts</a> before <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-cancelled-after-multiple-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimately being cancelled</a> to focus on making sure the game was up to the standards that players have come to expect from the 20+ year franchise.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/interview-football-manager-26-definitely-benefited-from-fm25-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Gaming Zone</a>, Farley says that canceling last year’s game wasn’t an easy choice to make, but it was necessary.</p>



<p><strong>“There’s no way we’d have been able to reach the same level of quality that FM26 currently has if we shipped FM25,” </strong>Farley said. <strong>“Some of the decisions where we rethought and changed direction, we’d have had to push them out there if we released FM25. And, once they’re out in the world, it becomes difficult to rethink it. We probably would have needed to fix them, rather than rethink them.”</strong></p>



<p>He added that instead of building a complete game, they would’ve been spending more time fixing bugs than anything else. But with the focus shifting towards Football Manager 26 instead, it gave them even more determination to make the best game possible. </p>



<p><strong>“The original disappointment [of the cancellation] “was tangible, but it quickly made way to an attitude of ‘let’s crack on now, we’ve got a chance to make something we are really proud of, ‘”</strong> he said. <strong>“We weren’t proud of FM25, we didn’t think it offered good value for money for our playerbase, and that’s our real motivating factor.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“When we had news of the cancellation, it gave us the determination to get it right for FM26.”</strong></p>



<p>Football Manager 26 launches on November 4. An open beta will be <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/exclusive-football-manager-26-open-beta-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking place starting October 24</a>, with progress being able to be brought over to the full game post-launch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 is Great, But There’s Still One Feature I Want Back]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-feature-i-want-back/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-is-great-but-there%E2%80%99s-still-one-feature-i-want-back.1329490/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 continues to impress gamers, and there’s still an immense amount of life left in a roadmap that’s yet to deliver the game’s first multiplayer season and a free-to-play battle royale component. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my review</a>, I rated Battlefield 6 highly on account of its stellar multiplayer platform, but points were detracted for the less-than-desirable campaign portion of the game.</p>



<p>As I play Battlefield 6, I can’t help but find myself lusting after a feature from bygone days that hasn’t been seen in a Battlefield game since 2018’s Battlefield 5. It’s something I adored in the World War II shooter that added a layer of immersion and ownership, but it’s not present in Battlefield 6, and I mourn the loss of it.</p>



<h2 id="h-i-want-to-fortify-objectives-in-battlefield-6">I Want To Fortify Objectives in Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>In Battlefield 5 (2018), users could take over an objective in a mode like Conquest or Breakthrough and set about <strong>fortifying it</strong>. They’d pull out their toolkit and construct everything from tank traps to sandbag walls. They could board windows, dig trenches, install machine gun nests, and set up barbed wire fences.</p>



<p>It was all pre-determined and linear, but it gave players a sense of ownership over an objective. They could capture the spot and then fully fortify it, preparing for the inevitable retake attempt from the opposing team.</p>



<p>It was also a nice way to earn an extra chunk of experience points, with the game’s support class having abilities that allowed them to craft fortifications faster.</p>



<p>Sadly, this feature was removed going into Battlefield 2042 (because the game lacked destruction), and it hasn’t resurfaced in Battlefield 6, which was released on October 10.</p>



<p>This is a shame, as Battlefield 6 has wonderful destruction that can see buildings razed to the ground, and I could imagine fortifications becoming progressively ramshackle as objectives crumble to dust under the weight of incoming fire.</p>



<h6><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-should-battlefield-6-take-from-battlefield-5/">What Should Battlefield 6 Take From Battlefield 5?</a></strong></h6>



<p>The idea came to me again while occupying objective ‘D’ on Liberation Peak, which is a site set in the middle of a road flanked by houses, all of which are begging for fortifications. It would be the best spot to lay some tank traps to prevent vehicular pushes from either end of the street, and the ruined houses are perfect for sandbagging and trenches.</p>



<p>I can fully appreciate why this <strong>isn’t</strong> a thing, of course. Battlefield 6 is a fast-paced game with immense destruction mechanics, and any fortifications would likely be taken out the second they’re built. It’s not worth the development time to implement something that can so quickly be destroyed.</p>



<p>Being an objective player, I’ll forever wish for the integration of fortifications. It’s the perfect way to gain a sense of ownership over an objective, and it’s a way for players less skilled in the gunny space to earn extra experience points and complete challenges.</p>



<p>Do you wish Battlefield 6 had fortifications? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-wild-zone-3-spawns/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-wild-zone-3-spawns-alpha-pok%C3%A9mon-locations.1329454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A has a different approach to other Pokémon games regarding spawn locations, with some fixed odds available across Lumiose City, and we’ve got a breakdown of all the Pokémon you can encounter in Wild Zone 3.</p>



<p>In total, Lumiose City has 20 Wild Zones to explore in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which are unlocked periodically throughout story progression, with unique spawns scattered throughout, with many Pokémon only being obtainable at one specific location.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for missing Pokémon from Wild Zone 3, we’ve got all the important details here.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Lots to find. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Just like Wild Zone 2, Wild Zone 4 is unlocked in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A as soon as you reach Main Mission 5 and progress through the introductory points of the game.</strong></p>



<p>There are six species in total that are found in Wild Zone 3, all of which need to be caught to complete Mable’s Research Tasks, one of which has Mega Evolution potential later in the story. However, others can still be core members of your party, particularly through early periodsd of the game.</p>



<p>In the table below, we’ve listed all the Pokémon that spawn in Wild Zone 3, the time of day they appear, and notes on the specific location where they can be found.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pokémon</th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Espurr</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Northeast corner</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Flabebe</td><td data-align="center">Day</td><td data-align="center">Central</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Litleo</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Northwest corner</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pancham</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Northwest corner</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pikachu</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Southeast corner</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Skiddo</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Southwest corner</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>Wild Zone 3 in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A has one guaranteed Alpha Pokémon</strong> <strong>that is present in the same spot both day and night.</strong></p>



<p>However, every Pokémon in Legends: Z-A has a fixed chance of spawning as an Alpha, while others have set spawns that can be rotated with other Pokémon. In WIld Zone 3, however, there’s only one guaranteed Alpha spawn that you will encounter whenever you visit the area.</p>



<p>All the details you need on Alpha Pokémon in Wild Zone 4 are below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pokémon</th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Alpha Litleo</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Eastern building</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s no secret how popular ARC Raiders has been all year. The extraction shooter has undergone a bunch of playtests and betas, and the Server Slam open beta arrived just before launch. If you’re wondering whether the latest ARC Raiders playtest is still going, when it ends, and if there’s another on the way, we’ve got answers to every question.</p>



<p>You only have to look at how many playtests Embark Studios has conducted this year to see how steadfast the developer is in its desire to get <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> right. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape From Tarkov is finally ready for its 1.0 release</a>, but this has possibly been pushed forward by the success and interest in ARC Raiders—its new extraction shooter competition.</p>



<p>If you’ve enjoyed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-final-open-beta-server-slam-test-start-date-how-to-play-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Slam playtest</a> and want to play more, we’ve got details on the beta and the game’s future.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-over">Is The ARC Raiders Server Slam Playtest Over?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You don’t have to look over your shoulder for a while. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The ARC Raiders Server Slam Playtest officially ended on October 20, and confirmation came from official ARC Raiders social media to end all hopes of the beta being extended.</strong></p>



<p>There’s always an optimistic instinct in all of us that we might get more. An extra day off, a bit more money in a paycheck, or anything equivalent. That was the feeling in the ARC Raiders community with the Server Slam test. Even though this was a last-minute beta before launch, the thought of waiting nearly two weeks for the game is probably an eternity.</p>



<p>We’ve seen people frantically looking up to see if the playtest had been extended. This is where we break your heart and say that this particular beta has conclusively ended.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-another-arc-raiders-playtest">Will There Be Another ARC Raiders Playtest?</h2>



<p><strong>Embark Studios’ stance is that the Server Slam playtest was the final beta of any sort before ARC Raiders finally launches on October 30.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s what the official <a href="https://x.com/arcraidersgame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Raiders</a> account on X had to say: “The Server Slam has now officially ended. Thank you so much for joining us to test the servers before the big day. Speranza awaits you on October 30th, Raiders!”</p>



<p>As you can see, there’s no mention of a final final playtest. It’s safe to say we’re ready to go for launch. It’s been a long journey to get there—what the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-delay-explained-embark-game-not-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay</a> and all—but, hopefully, it’s all worth it!</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>📡The Server Slam has now officially ended.<br>Thank you so much for joining us to test the servers before the big day.</p><p>Speranza awaits you on October 30th, Raiders! <a href="https://t.co/U3rCPTjctn">pic.twitter.com/U3rCPTjctn</a></p></div>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1980191120442441772?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios is bringing serious competition to the extraction shooter genre in 2025 with ARC Raiders. The futuristic shooter has all the hallmarks of a classic PvPvE experience, and it would score more points if it were free to play and didn’t have a price to pay. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-steams-most-popular-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders became Steam’s most popular Extraction Shooter</a> with the release of its final test phase before launch—the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-final-open-beta-server-slam-test-start-date-how-to-play-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open beta Server Slam Test</a>. Developer Embark Studios (known for The Finals) has worked very hard to ensure it learns from its mistakes and stands a chance of survival at release.</p>



<p>One way to get more people on board is to make ARC Raiders free-to-play. Foregoing a price might be a financial gamble, but there would be benefits. Let’s raid the information cabinet for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-arc-raiders-free-to-play">Is ARC Raiders Free-to-Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nothing is free in this world. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>ARC Raiders will not be a free-to-play online multiplayer experience, and you will have to pay an initial one-time fee to set foot in Speranza and beyond!</strong></p>



<p>There’s a definite line in the sand when it comes to online shooters now: Those that are free-to-play, and those that want a fee upfront. Naturally, games like Concord have only stoked the fires of the debate more. When you have a Warzone, a Fortnite, a Marvel Rivals, or an Apex Legends charging nothing to play the base game, it’s only natural to question if other new releases should follow suit.</p>



<p>However, EA and Embark Studios have decided against making ARC Raiders free-to-play. It doesn’t mean it won’t make the transition in the future, but for now, you need to dip into your pockets to play it.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-price-explained">ARC Raiders Price, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The base edition of ARC Raiders costs $39.99 or £30.99, whereas you need to stump up $59.99 or £49.99 for the more expensive Deluxe Edition.</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, you don’t need to buy the upgraded version, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-deluxe-edition-content-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deluxe Edition content and bonus rewards</a> are pretty tempting. The Standard Edition offers the thing you’re after the most—the game.
