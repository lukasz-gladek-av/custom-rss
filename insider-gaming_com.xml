<p>No one saw the huge rebranding of Overwatch coming in 2026, and the revised identity comes with plenty of actual new identities. We’re taking a look at every new character, the voice actors behind the fresh-faced heroes, and more.</p>



<p>Aside from the rather unfortunate business surrounding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatchs-anran-set-for-redesign-after-community-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch’s Anran undergoing a redesign after community backlash</a>, the new cast of characters has been well-received, particularly a certain flying feline.</p>



<p>Props to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/blizzard/" id="1092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-overwatch-heroes-added-in-2026">All Overwatch Heroes Added In 2026</h2>



<p><strong>Blizzard has added five new Heroes to the rebranded Overwatch in 2026: Anran, Domina, Emre, Jetpack Cat, and Mizuki.</strong></p>



<p>There were the first new faces of 2026, with a few more to be added throughout the year. They range from expert warriors to…a cat…with a jetpack. More cats, please.</p>

<h2 id="h-who-voices-anran-in-overwatch">Who Voices Anran In Overwatch?</h2>



<p><strong>Farheea Andersen is the voice actor for Anran in Overwatch.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>The Twitch streamer and content creator was given the honour of playing Anran for Overwatch, and to be fair to her, she didn’t hold back in her assessment of Anran’s original design, citing the character as an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-anran-actor-bags-on-ozempic-chic-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Ozempic Chic Character Design.’</a></p>



<p>This is believed to be Andersen’s debut role in gaming, movies, and TV.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-domina-in-overwatch">Who Voices Domina In Overwatch?</h2>



<p><strong>Overwatch’s Domina is voiced by Taj Atwal.</strong></p>



<p>Atwal is a British actress who has racked up acting credits across a multitude of TV shows, from Line of Duty to Hullraisers. It’s not her first foray into voice-over work, though, as she played Dr. Neema Chandra in Surgeon Simulator 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-emre-in-overwatch">Who Voices Emre In Overwatch?</h2>



<p><strong>Actor Kerem Erdinc has confirmed on social media that he is the voice of Emre.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2026-roadmap-all-overwatch-2026-content-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch 2026 Roadmap—All Overwatch 2026 Content, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/KeremIsWhelmed/status/2021461358743855562?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X post</a>, he said: “The best thing about being the voice actor for Emre is people just let me pick him in the lobby. Gotta show up for the squad if I’m the one taking Emre for a spin. First match of the night, play of the game? Oh yeah, me and Emre were made for each other.”</p>



<p>Erdinc has plenty of other video game work under his belt, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/delta-force/" id="878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Force</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/ready-or-not/" id="1170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ready or Not</a>, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, and much more.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-mizuki-in-overwatch">Who Voices Mizuki In Overwatch?</h2>



<p><strong>The masked Mizuki is represented by Julian&nbsp;Cihi.</strong></p>



<p>Unless the facts are wrong, that seems to be Cihi’s debut into the world of video gaming voice-over work, too! Before grabbing the role of Mizuki with both horns, Cihi has appeared in several shows, such as Only Murders in the Building.</p>
