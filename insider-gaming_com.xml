            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-return-amax-kilo-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, Activision took to social media to promote International Women’s Day with a Call of Duty trailer focused on female characters. The punchy montage showcased some of the most popular female streamers and in-game operators, but it also let slip a few key details about the future of Call of Duty.</p>



<p>In a couple of sequences in the montage, we see current operators running around with AMAX and Kilo assault rifles. These instantly recognisable weapons were firm favourites when Verdansk was rolling around in Warzone between 2020 and 2021, and it looks like they’re coming back.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-hit-the-nostalgia">Hit the Nostalgia</h2>



<p>It was mentioned recently that if Verdansk’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/">return to Warzone is a flop</a>, Warzone itself could be on the rocks and scheduled for closure. At the very least, Activision will scale back resources and prepare to keep Warzone afloat with a skeleton crew, as the downfall of the battle royale has been unravelling over the last couple of years.</p>



<p>When season three arrives in Call of Duty next month, following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/">a sizeable delay</a>, it should bring with it the original Verdansk map from 2020. That’s not all, though – according to the recent Call of Duty montage released by Activision, we’re also set to get some OG weapons back, too.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>BREAKING: The Kilo 141 and AMAX are officially returning to Warzone with Season 03! </p><p>Confirmed by todays IWD trailer posted by Call of Duty! <a href="https://t.co/RWxBbxw8zv">pic.twitter.com/RWxBbxw8zv</a></p></div>— Task Force News (@TaskForceNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/TaskForceNews/status/1898397599930986953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>I’m holding out hope that the Grau makes a return, but I’ll settle for the AMAX and Kilo. There are so many ‘meta’ weapons that Activision’s teams could bring back to Warzone, but I <strong>really hope </strong>the DMR and Mac-10 combination is kept well away from this iteration of the battle royale game.</p>



<p>It’s not confirmed, but featuring the weapons front and center in a trailer this close to the launch of season three is pretty telling. If the original timeline were being adhered to, we’d be just ten days away from the launch of the game’s third season. Instead, we’ll need to wait until April 3rd.</p>



<p>What weapons do you want to see returning to Warzone this year? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-4-is-%E2%80%98too-easy%E2%80%99-and-blizzard-is-preparing-to-make-it-tougher.1129290/</guid>

<p>During a recent campfire stream, Blizzard’s developers working on Diablo 4 reflected on the most recent season, suggesting that things didn’t pan out as expected. They confirmed that the game has become far too easy and revealed that players are levelling up in ‘half the time’ compared to previous seasons, even on harder difficulty levels.</p>



<p>As someone new to Diablo, I can attest to that. I’m usually awful at challenging games, but even after cranking it up a few levels, I’m having no issues whatsoever with Diablo 4.</p>



<p>That’s set to change, though.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-hell">Prepare for Hell</h2>



<p>When the next season rolls around in Diablo 4, players will find themselves levelling up slower and facing a tougher grind compared to the current season, which is focused on the Vessel of Hatred expansion.</p>



<p>In the recent campfire stream, Blizzard’s Colin Finer revealed that players are ‘chewing through some of the content’ much too quickly, hitting level 60 and securing their Paragon classification far too rapidly and with too few struggles.</p>



<p>In season 8, players will find that they’re levelling slower through the first 25 levels of a new character and that rarer loot – such as Legendary items – will be much harder to find.</p>



<p>Here’s the full campfire chat with Blizzard:</p>

<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/536470/diablo-4-blizzard-too-easy-season-8-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The team revealed that ‘too many’ players have found their way into the highest difficulty level of the game in record time, which represents a kind of imbalance in the player base.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Just from a philosophy standpoint, we really want whatever the hardest Torment tier is — in this case Torment 4 — to be aspirational, and to us that means around 10% (of players).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Presently, around 50% of the players in the Vessel of Hatred season have made it to the highest difficulty level. To battle back against that issue, Blizzard will be adding new, more challenging boss characters in the new season, and existing bosses will have their abilities cranked to the max.</p>



<p>It’ll be a while before all that arrives, though. The next season of Diablo 4 isn’t expected to drop until April 29.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer-expansion-of-story/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the latest trailer for the second season of The Last of Us, we’re given a brief glimpse at the expansion of the story established in the 2020 game. It has been known for a while that the sheer amount of meat on the bones has given way to the second game having a two-series split in terms of the live-action adaptation, but that hasn’t stopped the showrunners from creating fresh storylines.</p>



<p>In particular, we’re given an extended look at the attack on Jackson—Ellie and Joel’s home haven in the game—by vast swathes of infected. This sequence isn’t replicated in the game, but some of the perspectives are reminiscent of No Return, the additional mode added with the release of The Last of Us Part II Remastered.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-content-galore">Content Galore</h2>



<p>The Last of Us Part II has plenty of inspiration to draw from when it comes to creating extra content for the live-action adaptation. In 2023, with the launch of the first season, viewers were treated to an entire episode that explored the backstory of Bill and Frank – and that sequence alone won the show an Emmy Award.</p>



<p>In the latest trailer, we get the idea that Craig Mazin, Neil Druckmann, and everyone else involved is following a similar pattern in the second (and assumedly the third) season of the HBO show.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Last of Us Season 2 | Official Trailer | Max" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_zHPsmXCjB0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Once again, the cinematics smack of the most faithful recreation possible, and we can now see that a fair amount of flashback content will be included in season two. For instance, we’ll be heading back to the prequel scenes that see Ellie and Joel explore a museum on Ellie’s birthday, ultimately discovering a building packed with dinosaurs, spacecraft, and <strong>danger</strong>.</p>



<p>We also get an extended look at the Seraphites, but it doesn’t look like Lev and Yara are being revealed just yet. We do see some other sequences that suggest the Seraphites and their background will be explored further in the show, which would help to set up a little more lore for those uninitiated in the story thus far.</p>



<p>The WLF is front and centre, too – as is Abby’s band of antiheroes heading to Jackson for no particular reason whatsoever.</p>



<p>The Last of Us season two drops on April 13 in full – are you going to binge watch this one? Let me know in the comments or over on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>A new FAQ from Playground Games has revealed that to play Forza Horizon 5 on the PlayStation 5, players will need a Microsoft account.</p>



<p>The news, which has started to be picked up online (thanks <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/03/08/a-microsoft-account-will-be-required-to-play-forza-horizon-5-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XboxEra</a>), shows in the <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/03/08/a-microsoft-account-will-be-required-to-play-forza-horizon-5-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ</a> that the upcoming port will require a Microsoft account.</p>



<p>It reads, “Q: Do I need a Microsoft account to play Forza Horizon 5 on PlayStation 5?”</p>



<p>“Answer: A: Yes, in addition to a PSN account you’ll need to link to a Microsoft account in order to play Forza Horizon 5 on PS5. This process begins the first time you start up the game on your console.”</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time that an Xbox game coming to the PlayStation 5 has required an account, though, so this isn’t new. A Microsoft account is needed for the likes of Sea of Thieves and similarly, even for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 version of Minecraft.</p>



<p>So fear not, this isn’t a new requirement just for Forza Horizon. However, we have contacted Xbox in the hopes to receive comment to clear the air just in case this was a mistake. Should clarification be given, we’ll update the article.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 5 is set to release for the PlayStation 5 on April 25, 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-turned-hans-capon-into-a-superstar-streamer-in-one-month.1129101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hans-capon-superstar-streamer-kingdom-come/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was released little more than a month ago, storming up the charts and becoming known far and wide as a contender for many Game of the Year awards. It stunned players with its depth, visual splendour, and intense realism, and with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dense roadmap ahead</a>, the game has plenty of life left in its medieval lungs.</p>



<p>Since Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 hit the market, one of the game’s most prolific actors, Luke ‘LordHansCapon’ Dale, has positively exploded. He has become a superstar streamer in a matter of weeks, pulling in and retaining an audience and securing solid accolades in no time at all.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-content-fit-for-a-lord">Content Fit for a Lord</h2>



<p>Luke Dale portrays Hans Capon in the Kingdom Come universe, and he’s front and centre as the game kicks off, with many of the second title’s most pivotal moments revolving around his existence. In the first game, which dropped back in 2018, he was someone to be hated, but in KCD2, he’s a lovable rogue who you’ll go to great lengths to keep safe.</p>



<p>In the days that followed the launch of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on February 4, Dale kickstarted a streaming campaign that saw his popularity levels skyrocket across Twitch and YouTube.</p>



<p>In January 2025, the talented actor streamed the first Kingdom Come title in anticipation of the follow-up, netting a peak viewer count of around 350 viewers. Little more than two weeks later, he was picking up peak figures of 20,000 viewers. In one post on social media, Dale revealed he was in the 0.01% of streamers on Twitch by numbers alone.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Dang. I’m in the top 0.01% of streamers in the world 🫶 

Shall we get to number 1? </span><a href="https://twitter.com/KaiCenat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@KaiCenat</a><span> I’m coming for you bro 👊 </span></p></article></div>







<p>It didn’t end there, though.</p>



<p>Luke Dale, who went so far as to get a Kingdom Come tattoo while live, went from 32,000 subscribers on YouTube when the game dropped to 102,000 subscribers at the time of writing. He racked up 15,000 followers on Twitch in around two weeks and managed to secure a Twitch Partner spot after streaming Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 just <strong>eight times</strong>.</p>



<p>Before 2025, he’d streamed just three times, <a href="https://streamscharts.com/channels/lordhanscapon/streams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to StreamsCharts</a>. That’s one hell of a hot streak.</p>



<p>It helps that Dale is genuinely a nice guy with a penchant for performing, and his role as Hans Capon in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is fantastic and bursting with clippable, quality sequences.</p>



<p>If you want to follow Luke Dale’s latest streams, you can find him on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LordHansCapon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lordhanscapon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a>.</p>
