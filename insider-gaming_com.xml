<p>Resurgence may be getting a new map after Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s release, one rumor claims. The eagerly anticipated next entry in the Call of Duty franchise has many excited, both for the campaign and multiplayer. However, it looks like Warzone fans may have something to look forward to come its November 14th, 2025 launch. </p>



<p>The Resurgence mode in Warzone has been around since Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War back in 2020. It’s been present in both Warzone 1.0 and Warzone 2.0, as well as at launch for Warzone Mobile. The mode is a different take on the typical Battle Royale mode, with more players and heightened intensity plays. So, the rumored new map is sure to get some back into the Resurgence game.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-to-add-extended-liberty-falls-map-during-season-1-of-black-ops-7-says-credible-leaker">Warzone To Add Extended Liberty Falls Map During Season 1 of Black Ops 7, Says Credible Leaker</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a tweet from credible Call of Duty leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1960001313422659979">TheGhostofHope</a>, they state that they have learned a new Resurgence map is in the works. Furthermore, it appears to be an extended version of Liberty Falls. The map, which debuted in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 as a Zombies level, is a rather interesting choice. Still, given TheGhostofHope’s track record, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/">Black Ops 7’s release date</a>, there’s a strong chance we may hear about it soon. </p>



<p>Currently, the Multiplayer reveal for Black Ops 7 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-next-announced-september-2025/">slated to happen</a> on September 30th, 2025. As the rumor ties to Season 1 of the upcoming shooter, it’s more than likely we’ll get confirmation there. Until then, fans can get into Resurgence in Warzone and practice before the new map comes along.</p>



<p>What do you think about Liberty Falls being the next Resurgence map in Warzone? Was there one you think deserved it more? Let us know in the comments and on the forums. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Toxic Commando HANDS-ON PREVIEW – The Co-Op Shooter That I Wanted]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/toxic-commando-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/toxic-commando-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-the-co-op-shooter-that-i-wanted.1279905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At Gamescom 2025, we were invited by Focus Entertainment to try out John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando, a cooperative shooter developed by Saber Interactive.</p>



<p>And if you’ve somehow never heard of John Carpenter—maybe you’ve been living under a rock—he’s one of the most legendary names in horror cinema, responsible for classics like Halloween, The Fog, and The Thing. His influence is all over Toxic Commando, especially in the group banter and cinematic cutscenes throughout the missions.</p>



<p>The story pays homage to 1980s horror films, which should resonate strongly with fans of titles like Left 4 Dead and Killing Floor. In the game, a scientific experiment goes horribly wrong, unleashing the Sludge God upon Earth. This monstrous entity begins a process of terraforming, threatening all life on the planet.</p>



<p>To clean up the mess, the scientist enlists the help of the Toxic Commandos—battle-hardened mercenaries tasked with stopping the apocalypse.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="John Carpenter's Toxic Commando - Official Gameplay Trailer | gamescom 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eknbu0SKGzI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-toxic-commando-is-surprisingly-satisfying">Toxic Commando Is Surprisingly Satisfying</h2>



<p>During my play session, I teamed up with three other members of the press, and we communicated entirely through the in-game voice chat. To my surprise, the chat worked flawlessly—clear audio, no dropouts, and smooth coordination.</p>



<p>In games like this, communication is everything, and having a reliable voice system is a huge win. Our mission dropped us into an open map with the objective of clearing out specific zones. Each Commando has a unique class, and while we couldn’t choose our roles during the demo, one teammate deployed a protective dome, while my character generated a healing aura—each ability felt distinct and useful.</p>



<p>Saber Interactive’s experience with Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is immediately noticeable. At several points, we were swarmed by massive waves of zombies, all powered by Saber’s impressive Swarm Engine. In Toxic Commando, you’ll even be able to use vehicles for traversal and crowd control, adding a layer of mobility and chaos to the action.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Gunplay is another highlight. Weapons feel punchy and responsive, and enemies aren’t bullet sponges—a common pitfall in co-op shooters. The open map design also encourages optional exploration, which becomes essential for survival. With ammo running low and hordes closing in, scavenging becomes a strategic necessity.</p>



<p>Speaking of hordes, enemy variety is solid, mixing standard grunts with elite threats that require more coordination to take down.</p>



<p>The climax of our mission involved defending a structure from three massive waves of zombies. With over 200 enemies on screen and multiple points under attack, tension ran high. Thankfully, we managed to coordinate our class abilities and pull through.</p>



<h2 id="h-progression-amp-monetization">Progression &amp; Monetization</h2>



<p>Since the demo focused solely on gameplay, I didn’t get to explore the progression systems. However, a Focus Entertainment representative told me that players will be able to upgrade both their classes and weapons. More details on that will be revealed later.</p>



<p>As for monetization, information was limited. The current plan isn’t to push players into spending real money on cosmetics or similar items. It’s likely Saber Interactive will follow a model similar to Space Marine 2, with a battle pass offering cosmetic rewards.</p>



<p>John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando is set to launch in early 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series, with full crossplay support across all platforms. Based on my experience, it checks all the boxes I look for in a co-op shooter—and I’ll definitely be keeping an eye on it.</p>



<p>If you’ve been missing the chaotic fun of <em>Left 4 Dead</em> or <em>Killing Floor 2</em>, this one should be on your radar too.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Borderlands 4 Coming to Xbox Game Pass?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-borderlands-4-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1279881/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Borderlands 4 is one of the biggest launches taking place before the end of 2025, and part of modern gaming means some players are probably wondering whether it will be included on Xbox Game Pass. We have the details.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 12</a>, Borderlands 4 will have more than enough to whet the appetite with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-will-feature-30-billion-guns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 30 billion guns</a>, and we were impressed with the title after a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re yet to secure a copy of Borderlands 4 and are wondering if you can avoid splashing out due to a Game Pass subscription, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-borderlands-4-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Borderlands 4 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not yet. Image via Gearbox</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Borderlands 4 will not be available to play with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on September 12th</strong>.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is not a first-party Xbox title, which would result in automatic inclusion in the service, and there has not been any announcement of it joining the catalog.</p>



<p>Though Microsoft has not announced the first wave of titles coming to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a> in September, any announcement for Borderlands 4’s inclusion would have likely been made well in advance, as it would have been a huge coup.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-borderlands-4-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Borderlands 4 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Borderlands 4 is likely to come to Xbox Game Pass in the future, although any inclusion is likely to be a long way away.</strong></p>



<p>Gearbox has a history of releasing titles on Game Pass, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-more-games-leaving-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 3 leaving the service</a> on August 31 ahead of the launch of the new title. Borderlands 3, including all of the DLC for the title, joined the Game Pass catalog in April, resulting in a four-month stint on the service.</p>



<p>That shows that Gearbox is more than happy to embrace the platform, though it’s likely the inclusion period was decided upon to raise interest in Borderlands 4. Therefore, it would be surprising if the new title were to join the service anytime soon.</p>



<p>Given Borderlands 3 was first released in 2019, it took six years for the title to join Game Pass earlier this year. As such, don’t expect Borderlands 4 to feature for a long time, potentially not until post-2030, especially with plenty of DLC planned for the future.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon GO Level Cap Being Massively Raised For The First Time in Five Years]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-raising-the-level-cap/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-go-level-cap-being-massively-raised-for-the-first-time-in-five-years.1279848/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Avid Pokémon GO players have been desperate for the level cap to be raised for ages. Niantic has sounded the klaxon and is finally making it happen. An October 2025 update will see Pokémon GO’s level cap receive a huge increase.</p>



<p>It’s hard to remember a time when the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-water-festival-2025-all-spawns-timed-research-collection-challenges-raids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon GO</a> level cap wasn’t 50. This is because the level cap has remained this way since it was increased in November 2020—just under five years ago. We moved from 40 to 50, and it’s stayed like this. Not for long, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-go-level-cap-will-be-80-from-october-15">Pokémon GO Level Cap Will be 80 From October 15</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A seismic leap. Credit to Niantic</figcaption></figure>



<p>The shocking announcement came from the Pokémon GO X account on August 25: “This October, we’re increasing the level cap from 50 to 80, while rebalancing the overall leveling up journey.”</p>



<p>Closer inspection of the Pokémon GO <a href="https://pokemongo.com/en/post/pgo-leveling-update-announce-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> reveals even more details: ”&nbsp;On Wednesday, October 15, 2025, Pokémon GO will release an update that increases the level cap from 50 to 80. This update will make the leveling journey more fun and engaging by celebrating leveling milestones with new rewards, new cosmetics, and more. And with this update, a number of players can expect to jump in level based on their total earned XP. But don’t worry, no player will go down in level!”</p>



<p>The leveling system is being tweaked overall. According to the blog: “Players can earn levels more frequently,” and “some players may automatically jump in level on October 15.” </p>



<p>No one will move down levels, so you don’t need to worry about this.</p>

<p>Delta Force is finally available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and while many had been excited for the free-to-play shooter, there is one feature missing that has fans concerned. Black Hawk Down, Delta Force’s campaign mode, offers players the option to either go alone or play in co-op. At least, that’s what it is on PC.</p>



<p>Loading into the mode on console only gives players the option of “Fighting Alone”. A visit to the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2507950/discussions/0/608668448981185838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s community page</a> on Steam and Discord reveal multiple discussions on the matter. However, neither the game’s developer Team Jade or publisher TiMi Studio Group have commented publicly.</p>



<p>“[It’s] sad because they said on 3 months ago crossplay and co-op campaign on consoles,” one user on the game’s Discord wrote. “[It’s] like they lie us [sic]”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to both Delta Force’s developer and publisher for comment on the missing co-op option. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>What do you think of Delta Force’s Black Hawk Down campaign not having co-op at launch? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>
