            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming is officially going mobile. After months of development and plenty of requests from readers, the Insider Gaming App is <strong>now available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.insidergaming.app">Android through Google Play</a>.</strong> The <strong>iOS version will follow next week</strong> on the App Store, giving players on both platforms a faster and more personal way to stay connected to the gaming world.</p>



<p>“The Insider Gaming App is not just the next evolution of Insider Gaming, but the next logical step in gaming media.” – <strong>Tom Henderson</strong></p>



<p>The goal was to create something that felt better than using a browser on your phone. Something quicker to load, easier to navigate, and designed around the way people actually read news on mobile.</p>







<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-a-better-way-to-browse-insider-gaming">A Better Way to Browse Insider Gaming</h2>



<p>Once you open it, the app immediately feels built for everyday use. It’s simple, fast, and puts everything in one place without extra clutter. Readers will find all of Insider Gaming’s reporting and features organized in a way that makes browsing more enjoyable.</p>



<p>Here are some of the features available at launch:</p>



<h3 id="h-app-features">App Features</h3>



<ul>
<li>Free to download and use</li>



<li>Fewer ads compared to the website</li>



<li>All gaming, esports, tech news, and guides in one place</li>



<li>Push notifications for the biggest breaking stories</li>



<li>A built-in gaming calendar to track upcoming releases and events</li>



<li>Available in English or Portuguese</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the major things we wanted to focus on with the app is a better experience, and I think we can all agree that ads are horrible but are unfortunately one of the few ways media outlets have left to stay afloat. While the Insider Gaming App will have ads by default, they will be limited, but relevant to what our readers want.</p>



<h2 id="h-premium-and-premium-plus-new-ways-to-personalize-the-experience">Premium and Premium Plus: New Ways to Personalize the Experience</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the app release, Insider Gaming is also introducing Premium and Premium Plus. These memberships are available exclusively through the app and give readers new tools, personalization options, and access to exclusive content.</p>



<p>“Almost everyone in gaming media has adopted the subscription model, and instead of just a Patreon, we wanted to bring something a little different to the table. Our Premium offering takes how you get your gaming news to the next level, allowing you to personalise what you want to read about. Do you only like Xbox news? No problem. Hate leaks and only want to get official news? Easily done with a couple of clicks. For people wanting to take their support to the next level, we also have Premium+, which currently has four time-exclusive podcasts, with more to come in the future.” <strong>– Tom Henderson</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-insider-gaming-premium-3-99-month">Insider Gaming Premium – $3.99/month</h3>



<p>Premium gives subscribers more control over how they read and follow the news. It includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ad-Free Experience</li>



<li>A personalized news feed based on selected platforms and genres</li>



<li>Custom push notifications based on your interests</li>



<li>A special Discord role with access to exclusive channels</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-insider-gaming-premium-plus-6-99-month">Insider Gaming Premium Plus – $6.99/month</h3>



<p>Premium Plus includes everything in Premium, along with a lineup of exclusive podcasts created just for members.</p>



<p>These shows include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Party Chat</strong>: a guest-focused podcast featuring journalists, creators, developers, and industry voices</li>



<li><strong>Insider Access</strong>: an extended after-show for Insider Gaming Weekly</li>



<li><strong>Access Grant’ed</strong>: a one-on-one interview series hosted by Senior Editor Grant Taylor Hill</li>



<li><strong>Straw and Order</strong>: Senior Editor Mike Straw tackles one major question in gaming and delivers his final verdict</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-a-thank-you-and-a-look-to-the-future">A Thank You And A Look To The Future</h2>



<p>The launch of the app is just the latest step in growing Insider Gaming to be the one-stop destination for all things gaming news. </p>



<p>More customization, new tools, expanded community features, and additional content formats are already in development for future updates.</p>



<p>“Launching a new website in an industry that was consolidating, turns out, wasn’t easy. But with a great team and a fantastic community, we’ve been able to build something great in just over three years. What’s more exciting is that we have a lot more to give, and I can’t wait for everyone to experience what we have been building for the past several months.” <strong>– Tom Henderson</strong></p>



<p>Lastly, the entire team at Insider Gaming wants to thank you, the community. Without your support, this isn’t possible at all. You want the best news and original reporting, and it’s our goal to bring even more of that in 2026 and beyond. Again, thank you for helping make Insider Gaming what it is today after just three years. We can’t wait to show you what else is in store.</p>



<p>The Insider Gaming App is available now on Google Play, and the iOS version will launch next week.</p>
