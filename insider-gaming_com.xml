<p>With the absolute smash month that is February 2025, in which we see the release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Civilization VII, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, and Avowed, March may appear like a lightweight initially. The month does feature a few big releases, like Two Point Museum and Atomfall, but they’re more niche. No matter, the biggest video game releases in March 2025 still look enticing!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-hottest-game-releases-of-march-2025">The Hottest Game Releases of March 2025</h2>



<p>If you’re looking for a slew of AAA releases in the month of March, then you’re going to be sorely disappointed. But if you want a few indie and AA titles to round out your library and provide a little break from the big studio releases before summer, then March definitely has you covered!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Two Point Museum</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 4, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Split Fiction</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 6, 2025</li>



<li><strong>FragPunk </strong>(PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 6, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 18, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</strong> (Nintendo Switch) – March 20, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch) – March 21, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls </strong>(PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 21, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Tales of the Shire</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch) – March 25, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Atomfall </strong>(PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S) – March 27, 2025</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, a handful of titles are expected in March 2025 but with no official release date, including <strong>Commandos: Origins</strong>, <strong>Football Manager 25</strong>, and <strong>Killing Floor 3</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-looking-forward-to-april-2025">Looking Forward to April 2025</h2>



<p>Before anyone gets too excited, April looks like a light month—at least for now. The most significant releases aren’t that major and include:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Last of Us Part II Remastered (PC)</li>



<li>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</li>



<li>Tempest Rising</li>
</ul>



<p>This is the lull before summer pops off; just wait and see!</p>
