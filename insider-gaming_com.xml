            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2 has received a fresh wave of reinforcements in the fight to spread democracy following the Xbox release, and there’s a host of Warbonds available to purchase.</p>



<p>Warbonds are regularly released in Helldivers 2, with the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dust Devils Premium Warbond</a> on the horizon, which can make it difficult to decide which to pick up. Fortunately for you, we’re here to help.</p>



<p>Whether you’re looking to spend your Premium Warbond Token or are mulling over splashing some extra cash on more unlocks, we’ve got a breakdown of the best Warbonds available in Helldivers 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-best-warbonds-listed">Helldivers 2 Best Warbonds, Listed</h2>



<h3 id="h-democratic-detonation">Democratic Detonation</h3>



<figure><figcaption>For democracy! Image via Arrowhead Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>For those just starting out in Helldivers 2 and looking to give their arsenal a boost, there isn’t much better than the Democratic Detonation. With three pages of rewards, you’ll receive useful weapons, armor, and an armor passive, along with the usual cosmetics.</p>



<p>The G-123 Thermite grenade is great for taking out Terminid enemies, while both the Grenade Pistol and Exploding Crossbow can also be used to take out swarms of enemies. Just beware you don’t also take out the rest of your squad.</p>



<p>Add in some nice cosmetics and a return of 100 Super Credits, and it’s the ideal starting point.</p>



<h3 id="h-cutting-edge">Cutting Edge</h3>



<p>Initially one of the weakest Warbonds in the game, the benefit of the Cutting Edge Warbond has increased significantly following the introduction of the Illuminate to the game.</p>



<p>The Arc Resistance Passive is the perfect counter to the Illuminate, offering a huge amount of damage reduction. If you’re struggling to overcome that specific enemy time, take a look at this option.</p>



<p>Also in the Warbond are Stun Grenades, the Sickle Assault Rifle, and the Blitzer Shotgun, with both weapons having infinite ammo.</p>







<p>The biggest addition from the Urban Legends Warbond is the Anti-Tank Emplacement, the perfect tool to take out Strider Convoys and large groups of enemies.</p>



<p>With the Siege-Ready passive, you will benefit from quicker reload speeds and the ability to carry 20% additional ammunition, which is a boost for any combat situation.</p>



<p>There’s also a Stun Lance, a Flame Sentry, and a Directional Shield which, although not as stong as other options, can still come in useful.</p>



<h3 id="h-halo-odst-legendary-warbond">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dropping in hot. Image via Arrowhead</figcaption></figure>



<p>Not only is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</a> stocked full of unlocks that will release a wave of nostalgia, it also marks the historic moment of Helldivers 2’s Xbox release—the first Sony title to make the jump to the rival platform.</p>



<p>With four new weapons, two armors, a new armor passive, and a bunch of other cosmetic items, the Halo ODST Legendary Warbond is a solid pick-up for those looking to expand their collection with exclusive items. </p>



<p>The downside, however, is that you can’t use a Premium Warbond Token to unlock this, so you will have to splash out some extra cash. </p>



<h3 id="h-servants-of-freedom">Servants of Freedom</h3>



<p>Those looking for the ultimate weapon should look no further than the Portable Hellbomb, the perfect tool to issue damage to a large area or to clear out an objective.</p>



<p>The Ultimatum sidearm can also clear out huge groups of enemies, with huge explosive damage that is on par with an Orbital Precision Strike.</p>



<p>If that’s not enough, the Double-Edged Sickler has a larger heat sink than the original and increased damage penetration the longer you fire, though the downside is you could catch alight too.</p>



<h3 id="h-truth-enforcers">Truth Enforcers</h3>



<p>Any players who prefer their combat to be up close and personal should head straight to the Truth Enforcers Warbond, which features some of the strongest close-range weapons in the game.</p>



<p>The SMG-32 Reprimand Heavy and the SG-20 Halt Shotgun are the two guns in question, the latter being able to switch between armor-piercing ammo and stun rounds, giving you more versatility in the field.</p>



<p>Capping things off is the PLAS-15 Loyalist Plasma Pistol, a decent sidearm option if you’re looking for something new, and it’s particularly useful against heavy enemies.</p>



<h3 id="h-steeled-veterans">Steeled Veterans</h3>



<p>Ask any Helldivers 2 player for their favorite weapons, and the SG-225IE Breaker Incendiary Shotgun will more than likely be mentioned.</p>



<p>Dishing out huge damage and setting enemies on fire, the Breaker Incendiary Shotgun is the perfect tool for dealing with large swarms of enemies, and there’s also the P-4 Senator Pistol to consider, too.  </p>



<p>Also included in the Warbond is the AR-23C Liberator Concussive that, although highly situational, can be a powerful asset to stun large enemies.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 has seen a fresh surge in the push to spread democracy around the universe following a long-awaited Xbox launch, which came alongside a boost in players on Steam.</p>



<p>Initially released on PlayStation 5 and PC, Sony made the big move to push the title onto Xbox Series X|S on August 26, marking a historic moment with the first time a Sony first-party exclusive made the jump to Microsoft. As part of the launch, a huge collab was added with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</a>.</p>



<p>Though it was expected that the servers would be flooded with new players on Xbox, the release also led to a huge boost on Steam to secure the highest concurrent totals in over a year.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-hits-highest-steam-concurrents-since-april-2024">Helldivers 2 Hits Highest Steam Concurrents Since April 2024</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big boost. Credit to Arrowhead Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Data from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/#3y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a> shows the total number of concurrent players on Steam on August 26 hit 167,795, the highest amount since April 2024—which came just before a huge drop following an account-linking controversy.</p>



<p>The numbers are higher than the peaks seen after both the Omens of Tyranny and Heart of Democracy updates, showing that the impact of the Xbox launch spreads beyond just one platform.</p>



<p>Players have seemingly not been put off by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lack of cross-progression</a> in the title, with the crossplay support allowing new players on Xbox to join up with friends on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>



<p>Steam numbers usually peak at the weekend too, so Helldivers 2 could see another boost in the coming days in the first weekend following the launch on Xbox. Following that, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh update lands next week</a>, adding more content to the game.</p>

<p>Hell is Us is a brand-new action game headed up by Rogue Factor and supported by Nacon. It’s launching in a busy 2025 period and competing against some real AAA brutes. Nevertheless, if you’re hyped for it, let’s check out the Hell is Us release date and announced start times.</p>



<p>You take the reins of Rémi in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-is-us-release-date-confirmed-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hell is Us</a>. You fight Hollow Walkers, and the supernatural gameplay and storytelling are a major part of the game’s fabric. It leans into the ‘punishing’ aspect of combat, but from what I’ve seen so far, it looks to be infinitely rewarding. With 2025 building up to a stacked climax, Hell is Us has got its work cut out.</p>



<p>I’ve got everything you need to know about Hell is Us’ release date, and start times for major time zones. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-hell-is-us-coming-out">When is Hell is Us Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Slice and dice. Credit to Nacon</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Rogue Factor’s Hell is Us is scheduled to release on September 4 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>As I’ve said, September 2025 is a crazy one for gaming releases. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> are just some of the blockbuster launches on the way.</p>



<p>A new IP like Hell is Us is going to have a tough time competing. But if you’re into your action games, chances are this supersedes other releases anyway!</p>



<h2 id="h-hell-is-us-start-times-amp-early-access-launch-information">Hell is Us Start Times &amp; Early Access Launch Information</h2>



<p><strong>We believe Hell is Us Standard Edition goes live at 1 AM PDT on September 4, and early access starts 72 hours ahead of time on September 1.</strong></p>



<p>There’s an early access incentive for Hell is Us. If you choose to do this, you essentially jump the queue by three days. This does require you to shell out even more cash for the Deluxe Edition, though. It all depends on how keen you are for Hell is Us and its release date.</p>



<p>While you contemplate this, here are the release date and start time details across key US time zones, the United Kingdom, and Australia—thanks to the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP6665-PPSA09259_00-HIU0000000000000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>.</p>
