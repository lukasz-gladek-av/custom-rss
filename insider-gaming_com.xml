<p>Hours ago, a claim surfaced on social media suggesting that ‘talk of a Fortnite movie’ that was originally passed on would be rethought given the success of Minecraft, which is enjoying the highest opening weekend <strong>ever </strong>for a video game movie.</p>



<p>It wasn’t too long after the claim had surfaced on Twitter (X) that it was shot down unceremoniously with a single word from the CEO of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-nope">Nope.</h2>



<p>In a now-deleted post on Twitter, DanielRPK wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You just know Fortnite is next. There was already talk of a Fortnite movie, but some studios passed on it. That’s obviously gonna change now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1908540590255382632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interjected with a single word</a> reply: ‘False.’</p>



<p>DanielRPK has since <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1908582823256338548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">followed up</a> by addressing Sweeney directly, asking whether it’s true that Sony ‘passed on the opportunity to make a Fortnite movie a few years ago.’ Sweeney has yet to respond to this comment at the time of publishing.</p>



<p>Minecraft has turned heads this weekend, scoring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-mine-craft-movie-biggest-ever-video-game-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a record of $58 million</a> on its first day at the box office. This has defied expectations, with many thinking the film would bomb because of it starring Jack Black and looking bizarre in early impressions and previews. </p>



<p>In recent years, live-action adaptations of video games have soared. The likes of Fallout and The Last of Us have dominated the charts and won prestigious awards, becoming known as some of the top titles in the space to make it to the silver screen.</p>



<p>It appears that Fortnite isn’t one of the games that’s set to get a movie adaptation any time soon, though.</p>



<p>Do you think Fortnite would work as a movie? Let me know what you think in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>‘A Minecraft Movie’ has now become the biggest-ever opening day video game movie with a $58 million opening day.</p>



<p>The movie has also become the biggest opening day so far in 2025, surpassing ‘Captain America: Brave New World’ at $40.9 million.</p>



<p>It’s an impressive start for a movie that was forecasted to hit around $70 to $80 million in its opening weekend, but now updated forecasts predict that it will pass $150 million, 200% more than initial predicted. </p>



<p>The new forecast puts it in the running to surpass the biggest three-day opening ever for a video game movie, which is currently held by ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie’ at $146 million. Though, it should be worth noting that ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie’ released on a Wednesday and had already grossed $58 million before the weekend.</p>



<p>The film stars Jack Black, Jason Momoa, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, Sebastian Eugene Hansen and Jennifer Coolidge.</p>



<p>That being said, ‘A Minecraft Movie’ will likely turn a profit after its first week, with the film having a $150 million production budget plus marketing and distribution costs.</p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie’s staggering numbers does come as a bit of a shock to those familiar with the game, with many fans criticising the games trailers. Yet, the game is one, if not, the most popular video game ever, so it’s success isn’t too surprising to most.</p>



<p>The video game has sold over 300 million individual copies worldwide since its release in 2011, with its success attracting the eyes of Microsoft, who purchased Mojang (Minecraft’s developers) in 2014 for $2.5 billion.</p>

<p>If you’re here, it’s almost certain that you’re trying to figure out what is the best weed recipe in Schedule 1. To start, it can be fairly complicated to start growing, but there’s big money to be had with some of the better recipes in the game. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-weed-recipes-in-schedule-1">Best Starting Weed Recipes in Schedule 1</h2>
