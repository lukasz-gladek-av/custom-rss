<p>Xbox has teased that Spyro will be added to Xbox Game Pass in the near future.</p>



<p>The tease came from the official Xbox Game Pass X handle (formerly Twitter), which posted a <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/1855973786547601437" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">27-second short video</a> on a chest from Spyro. Several minutes after the post, the official Spyro X handle replied with <a href="https://x.com/SpyroTheDragon/status/1855974931156054091" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">several eye emojis</a>, suggesting that an announcement was on the horizon.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-activision-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors surfaced that several Activision games</a>, including Spyro, would be coming to Game Pass, but the exact timeframe could never be determined.</p>



<p>In October, Game Pass saw the addition of Call of Duty to the service, which some analysts believed increased the service’s subscriber count by several million. Now, though, it seems like Xbox and Activision are gearing up for another huge release in the form of your favorite purple dragon.</p>



<p>Activision announced in 2007 that the Spyro The Dragons series sold over 20 million units, but as of September 2023, the Spyro Reignited Trilogy sold over 10 million units across all consoles.</p>



<p>Xbox typically likes to announce and release its Game Pass games on a Thursday, so keep your eyes peeled later this week.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see Spyro coming to Game Pass? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> introduces players to a brand-new 6v6 game mode known as Ransack. It’s an objective-based mode with a unique goal that sees players collecting and protecting loot, and it can be played on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every 6v6 map in the game</a>, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-maps-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new ones arriving</a> with the first season.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in the full details about Ransack in Black Ops 6, here’s how the mode works.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-ransack-work-in-black-ops-6">How does Ransack work in Black Ops 6? </h2>



<p><strong>Ransack sees two teams of 6 fighting to collect gold bars from crates dotted around the map</strong>. Once players have the gold bars, they must transport them back to their team’s stash, which must be protected at all costs. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Wildcards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD blog</a>, the enemy team can find and raid your stash, so you’ll need to make sure it’s well-guarded. The team that reaches the score limit or has the most gold bars when the time limit has been reached will win the match.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s important to maintain a balance of attack and defense, as you don’t want to fully focus on one or the other. So, Perks and Scorestreaks that aid your speed and knowledge of the enemy team’s location will be essential, as they’ll allow you to move quickly in either attack or defense and see if the enemies are trying to raid your stash.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-ransack-in-black-ops-6">How to play Ransack in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Ransack will be <strong>available to play just like any other game mode in Black Ops 6 Multiplayer</strong>, and it’s not a limited-time mode. You will be able to select it when you filter the game modes you wish to play when finding a match. When Season 1 drops, it’s also likely that the new mode will have its own playlist too so you can easily find and play it.</p>



<p>This is a completely new game mode for Call of Duty, making its debut in Black Ops 6 Season 1. It seems like a mix between Capture the Flag and Grind, where you had to collect tags and bank them before dropping them upon death.</p>



<p>The new Ransack mode arrives alongside Prophunt and limited-time modes in Season 1. Players are also getting some new maps to sink their teeth into, as well as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge update for Warzone</a>. </p>

<p>Genshin Impact’s update version 5.2, dubbed “Tapestry of Spirit and Flame,” will be released on November 20.</p>



<p>Genshin Impact’s update 5.2 introduces two new Natlan tribes, the Flower-Feather Clan and Masters of the Night-Wind. The elite warriors of this tribe are Chasca and Ororon, and they can be transformed into Saurian companions for players to move and fight mid-air. At the same time, you get to explore the ancient, ruined city of Ochkanatlan while investigating a mysterious incident in the region as a part of the leading seasonal event of the update.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-take-to-the-skies-in-genshin-impact-update-5-2-nbsp">Take to the Skies in Genshin Impact Update 5.2&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Two new species of Saurians will arrive with this update, Qucusaurs and Iktomisaurs. The Qucusaurs are known to be the best rides in the Flower-Feather Clan. They have an accelerated guiding mode that allows you to cover a lot of distance. You can also use Phlogiston to gain altitude or perform horizontal rolls in mid-flight.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Iktomisaurs, on the other hand, are known for reaching vertical heights rather than travelling horizontally. At the same time, they have a unique ability to see, which helps them discover hidden objects. The Iktomisaurs are known as the guides of the Master of the Night Wind. They can also draw energy from Phlogiston-infused objects or craft special items from graffiti patterns.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-new-characters-in-genshin-impact-update-5-2-nbsp">New Characters in Genshin Impact Update 5.2&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Genshin Impact introduces Chasca and Ororon in update 5.2. Chasca is known as the great warrior and peacemaker in the Flower-Feather clan and is a 5-star Anemo bow wielder. The characters use a Soulsniper as their firearm and can float in the air while firing different elemental bullets at enemies. Chasca can also use homing bullets for a lethal strike and restore Phlogiston by eliminating enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ororon, on the other hand, is the four-star Electro bow wielder from Masters of the Night Wind. Brought up by Iktomisaurs, this character also can rise in the air and have a keen sense of perception. Ororon can also enter Spiritspeaker state while charging an aimed shot, which allows the character to extract power from the graffiti and runes in Natlan. Lastly, having him on your team increases your gliding speed, too.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-other-features-and-content">Other Features and Content</h2>



<p>Genshin Impact’s update 5.2 will continue the story with Archon Quest Chapter V: Interlude, “All Fires Fuel the Flame, with Captain and Kansan assisting the tribe to recover from the damage caused by the Abyss. New threats and a boss called “Tenebrous Papilla” can be found in Natlan, and this monster has been powered by absorbing memories from the corrupted Ley Lines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have added the Imaginarium Theater, Serenitea Pot, Artifacts, and other key gadgets with this update.&nbsp;Check out the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/10/20241111-genshinimpact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> for complete details.</p>

<p>FromSoftware’s parent company, Kadokawa Corporation, recently confirmed that they have 26 games actively in development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1637630.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameWatch</a> (via <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1637630.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Kadokawa Corporation confirmed these games during their latest earnings report. Out of the 26 titles, 20 are being developed for consoles, and the other six are being created for mobile. FromSoftware, Spike Chunsoft, Gotcha Gotcha Games, Acquire, VIC GAME STUDIOS, and more will develop these games. Acquire from the Tenchu series was acquired by Kadokawa in December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FromSoftware has several anticipated games on the horizon. Popular franchises like Armored Core and Dark Souls already have multiple instalments, so fans can expect new entries in these series. Additionally, FromSoftware may develop new sequels for titles like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Elden Ring. Moreover, there is a possibility of receiving remasters or remakes of some of their classic games.</p>



<p>In other news, FromSoftware recently increased their base salaries <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-increasing-salaries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by 11.8% and offered more to new graduates</a>. Also, I learned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-final-boss-nerf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC saved the Kadokawa corporation</a> from cyberattack losses.
