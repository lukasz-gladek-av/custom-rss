<p>A new report says a new Xbox Partner Preview is scheduled for November and will focus heavily on Xbox Play Anywhere games. </p>



<p>Xbox has been in the news recently due to fresh details about its next-gen consoles. The president has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-president-confirms-series-x-s-successors-are-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the successors to the Series X/S consoles are in development, and a new report also says that games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-insomniacs-spider-man-will-be-playable-on-next-xbox-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War and Insomniac’s Spider-Man will be playable</a> on them. It has now been revealed that a partner preview event is scheduled for next month. </p>



<h2 id="h-november-s-partner-preview-event-will-focus-on-xbox-play-anywhere-games">November’s Partner Preview Event Will Focus on Xbox Play Anywhere Games</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-has-a-partner-preview-event-slated-for-november-with-xbox-play-anywhere-as-the-headline-act" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WindowsCentral</a>, Jez Corden’s sources at Microsoft have revealed that a Partner Preview showcase is scheduled for November; the date hasn’t been confirmed. Moreover, third-party titles from Microsoft’s publishing partners are going to be a focus of this event, and “will feature almost entirely (if not actually entirely)&nbsp;Xbox Play Anywhere&nbsp;titles.” </p>



<p>The report also mentions other upcoming events where Xbox will have a presence. The first event is this month itself, with IGN hosting the ID@Xbox showcase on October 28, 2025. This event will also focus on Xbox Play Anywhere and should feature announcements for Game Pass, Cloud Gaming, PC, and console players. </p>



<p>Moreover, Xbox is expected to have some kind of presence at The Game Awards, scheduled for December 11, 2025. However, it is not known what Microsoft will feature at the event. And then, there’s the Developer_Direct event, which will be hosted in January 2026 and should feature some big announcements.</p>



<p>In other news, Xbox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-will-not-mandate-the-use-of-ai-confirms-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not mandate the use of AI</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A has sucked in trainers from across the world, and Season 2 of Ranked is now right around the corner with a fresh batch of rewards to claim.</p>



<p>The first Pokémon release on Nintendo Switch 2, albeit still available on the original console, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-week-sales-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached some impressive sales milestones</a>, and the four-player PvP offerings have sucked plenty in for the grind.</p>



<p>If you’re ready to dive back into Ranked in pursuit of the next batch of rewards in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Earn the right. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Season 2 of Ranked in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A begins on November 4, immediately following the conclusion of Season 1 Ranked.</strong></p>



<p>It may seem like it has come around swiftly, with it only being a few weeks since the release of Legends: Z-A, but it appears, at least initially, that Ranked seasons in the title will transition rather quickly.</p>



<p>Based on the information we have from Season 1, each season in Ranked will last for around four weeks. However, this may be extended later in the game’s lifespan, depending on what else Game Freak have cooking.</p>







<p><strong>Although not officially announced, we expect Season 2 of Ranked in <strong>Pokémon</strong></strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A to begin at 6 AM UTC on November 4—the same time that Season 1 began.</strong></p>



<p>The table below shows a breakdown of when you can expect Season 2 of Ranked in Legends: Z-A to begin in your time zone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Season 2 Ranked Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Nov. 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Nov. 4</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>The biggest reward available in Legends: Z-A’s Season 2 of Ranked is Delphoxite, which is required to unlock Mega Delphox in the game.</strong></p>



<p>Just like Greninjite in Season 1, Delphoxite is exclusively available in Ranked play during Season 2, meaning you’ll have to delve into online play against players around the world to unlock the reward.</p>



<p>It’s yet to be confirmed, but we expect the requirements to be the same as earning Greninjite in Season 1, meaning you’ll have to reach at least Rank K to obtain the item.</p>



<p>Other rewards include Rare Candies, EXP. Candies, and items will also be distributed as rewards for reaching the various levels of ranked, but full details will be shared upon release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox players will be able to access PlayStation exclusives like God of War and Insomniac’s Spider-Man series on the next console, the latest reports state.</p>



<p>The next-gen era for Microsoft and Sony is on the horizon, despite the fact that many developers continue to support last-gen consoles like the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and there looks to be a titanic shift in terms of exclusive titles.</p>



<p>Xbox has already manoeuvred away from first-party exclusives, bringing the likes of Starfield, Forza Horizon 5, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo to PlayStation</a>, while Sony has eased slightly, as indicated by the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox earlier this year.</p>



<p>There are still some big exceptions, notably on PlayStation’s side with the likes of God of War, Insomniac’s Spider-Man, and Ghost of Tsushima, but that’s set to change in the new era.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-exclusives-coming-to-xbox-in-new-era">PlayStation Exclusives Coming to Xbox in New Era</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming to Xbox? Image via Sony</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Central’s Jez Cordon</a>, Microsoft’s plans for the next era of Xbox will bring the console more in line with PC, including the addition of various storefronts onto the console. Here’s what he wrote on the matter:</p>



<p>“You will be able to run PlayStation’s PC titles like God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, and Spider-Man on the next Xbox, purchased via Steam or Epic Games. You will be able to play&nbsp;World of Warcraft&nbsp;on the next Xbox, via Battle.net. You’ll also be able to install practically any game that runs on Windows, giving you access to decades upon decades of content all on a single device.”</p>



<p>Some steps toward that goal have already been taken with the ROG Ally X, which includes support for the likes of Steam and Epic Games Store, and the next Xbox console will have similar support.</p>



<p>With the addition of Steam and Epic storefronts onto the console, the door will be opened for titles that were previously PlayStation console exclusives, like God of War and Spider-Man, onto the Xbox platform—even though it won’t be a direct release and will lack established Xbox features, like Gamerscore and Achievements, for example.</p>



<p>The blurring of the waters in regards to exclusives has been difficult for players to get their head around, with the term exclusive now being looser than ever, but, in general, it’s good news for consumers.</p>

<p>Kratos Actor Christopher Judge has expressed his thoughts about going to Egypt for the next God of War game.</p>



<p>We keep hearing updates on spin-off and mainline God of War games, but we have yet to receive an official announcement. We recently saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshots</a> of the canceled multiplayer game emerge online, and now Kratos’ actor has expressed interest in traveling to Egypt for the next mainline release. </p>



<h2 id="h-going-to-egypt-for-the-next-god-of-war-would-be-a-completion-of-my-circle">Going to Egypt for the Next God of War “Would be a Completion of My Circle’ </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/god-of-war-actor-christopher-judge-says-he-hopes-a-potential-sequel-will-take-place-in-egypt-but-i-have-no-doubt-that-no-matter-what-pantheon-it-is-it-will-be-great/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Kratos actor Christopher Judge spoke about going to Egypt for the next God of War game at a panel at MCM London Comic Con. Judge stated that travelling to this location “would be a completion of my circle”, as he is highly popular for playing Teal’c from Stargate. Judge said “but whatever is decided”, before tracking back and stating “if there is another game”, he has “no doubt that no matter what pantheon it is, it will be great.”</p>



<p>Egypt, as the next location for a God of War game, has been a topic that has surfaced online many times in the past. And it makes sense to do so as well, as Kratos has already conquered Greek and Norse pantheons, it’s time for him to face off against a new set of gods. There was also a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> earlier this year that Sony was casting Middle Eastern actors for an unknown AAA game, which could be the next God of War title set in Egypt. </p>



<p>In other news, Amazon’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-casting-call-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casting call</a> for its God of War TV series has leaked. Additionally, the long-rumored Greek God of War game has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/greek-god-of-war-game-pushed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly delayed to 2026</a>.
