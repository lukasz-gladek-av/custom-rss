<p>FromSoftware’s newest project is an interesting tie-in with Bandai Namco. Let’s find out everything we know about Elden Ring Nightreign, its release date, price tag, and much more.</p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign gets more surprising by the second. The Game Awards 2024 took everyone by surprise with the announcement of Nightreign. It was even more shocking to realize it’s a collaboration between FromSoftware and giants Bandai Namco! But we’ve learned from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/after-technical-problems-more-elden-ring-nightreign-test-sessions-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightreign Network Test</a> the new Souls title is a fascinating battle royale and roguelike hybrid.</p>



<p>It’s not a full-scale release, but it has enough content to keep you busy for a few months. That said, let’s dig through the dirt.</p>

<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign is gearing up for a May 30 release date worldwide.</strong></p>



<p>Early indications suggest Early Access isn’t happening for <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>. None of its editions or pre-order incentives include mention of playing Nightreign early. This makes May 30 a global launch for FromSoftware and Bandai Namco’s joint title. </p>



<p>Let the wait for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign’s release date</a> commence—Tarnished.</p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-platforms">Elden Ring Nightreign Release Date Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Old-gen users will be pleased to learn Elden Ring Nightreign is debuting on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>2022’s Elden Ring also launched on the mentioned formats. However, it’s three years later, and many developers and publishers now opt to skip the PS4 and Xbox One. It’s not the case here, so if you’ve been able to play Elden Ring before, you’ll be able to endure the nightly grid of Elden Ring Nightreign without a fuss.</p>



<p>Additionally, I<em> </em>would be remiss to mention the Nintendo Switch misses out. It’s not much of a shock, but there’s no mention of Nightreign coming to Nintendo Switch. We’ll keep our Two Fingers crossed for a future port to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-editions-amp-price">Elden Ring Nightreign Release Date Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign Standard Edition, Deluxe Edition, Seeker’s Edition, and Collector’s Edition are releasing to give fans a tough decision over which one to buy. They clock in at $39.99/£34.99, $54.99/£47.99, $59.99/£49.99, and $199.99/£179.99. </strong></p>



<p>There’s no typo here: <strong>Four editions</strong> are available for Elden Ring Nightreign. Each caters to the level of satisfaction you want from your Nightreign experience.</p>



<p>Check out every edition below and its price for a quick table to consult.</p>

<hr>



<p>I’m looking forward to Nightreign as a Souls fan. I’m obviously never getting a Bloodborne remake, so a new Elden Ring spin-off should suffice. Should this be the end of Elden RIng after this, freeing up FromSftware a new title?</p>

<p>Split Fiction encourages co-op, and adding cross-platform play would facilitate this wonderfully. Hazelight Studios has a sterling reputation for letting you play its games with friends, and crossplay would make exploring Split Fiction’s vibrant and volatile world a pal-friendly pleasure.</p>



<p>Gaming’s interconnectivity has changed for the better in the last few years. It’s gotten to the point where more games have crossplay and cross-platform integration than those that don’t. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>‘s co-op-centric ideology encourages players to join together as the game has to be played with another player.</p>



<p>You can play Split Fiction together on the same console, but let’s see if crossplay is enabled.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-split-fiction-have-crossplay-or-cross-platform">Does Split Fiction Have Crossplay or Cross-Platform?</h2>

<p><strong>Split Fiction includes complete crossplay and cross-platform features—allowing you to enjoy the co-op romp with another player playing on a different format.</strong></p>



<p>In layman’s terms, if you want to play Split Fiction and you have a PS5, but your friend is on Xbox Series X, crossplay allows you to join forces, despite playing on different consoles. The same goes if you’re on PC and your buddy is on PC, and so forth.</p>



<p>The news comes courtesy of <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/ea-originals-discussion-en/announcement--faq-split-fiction%E2%84%A2---launching-march-6-2025---pre-order-now/5037251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction’s official FAQ</a>. Under the “<strong>Will the game be available to play online?</strong>” question, the answer succinctly states “You can play the game online with cross-play enabled.” You don’t need to worry about <em>how </em>you own Split Fiction or owning two copies!</p>



<h2 id="h-does-split-fiction-have-friend-s-pass">Does Split Fiction Have Friend’s Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Hazelight Studios brings back the Friend’s Pass scheme for Split Fiction, allowing one person to own the game and invite another player to enjoy the title for free.</strong></p>



<p>Friend’s Pass is also available for the developer’s other titles: A Way Out and It Takes Two. Both are acclaimed co-op games, and Friend’s Pass ensures you can play with another player without you both needing a copy of the title.</p>



<p>You’d think this might affect sales, but quite the opposite. A Way Out has reportedly sold over nine million copies and counting.</p>



<div><article><p><span>A Way Out has now sold more than 9 million units! 💥

The development was a wild ride and the game was already a success back when it released. But even then, we never dared to dream of THIS many people playing our game! 😍

With that said, we will continue to look back at… </span></p></article></div>



<p>Whereas It Takes Two went one better in every way. Not only did it scoop multiple Game of the Year awards in 2021, but it’s also sold a staggering 20+ million copies!</p>



<div><article><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ItTakesTwo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ItTakesTwo</a><span> HAS SOLD OVER 20 MILLION!!!

You’re the best fans in the world, how you have embraced our game is blowing our minds! ❤️

We’re so grateful to every one of the millions upon millions who have enjoyed their time with Cody and May 😍 </span></p></article></div>



<p>Split Fiction looks to be another winner for Hazelight Studios. It has Friend’s Pass—meaning only one of you needs to own it—and looks to recapture the magic of its predecessors.</p>



<hr>



<p>So, Split Fiction has crossplay and cross-platform compatibility and has Friend’s Pass. It’s a win-win all around, and Split Fiction should be in the GOTY conversation come the end of 2025. Or do you disagree? Offer your thoughts if you feel different.</p>

<p>Liquid Swords, the video game studio founded by Avalanche Studios founder Christofer Sunberg, has announced its plans to hold layoffs at the company.</p>



<p>The announcement was made via a post on the <a href="https://www.liquidswords.com/news/liquid-swords-announces-proposed-workforce-reduction-amid-business-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio’s website</a>.</p>



<p>According to the announcement, the decision was made after an “evaluation of Liquid Swords’ financial situation and the present challenges of the video game industry.” It was added that the moves are being done to “ensure the studio’s long-term sustainability”.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-exclusive-10-10-games-employees-offered-no-severance-layoffs-happened-while-on-holiday-and-more">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/1010-games-employees-offered-no-severance-laid-off-while-on-holiday-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXCLUSIVE: 10:10 Games Employees Offered No Severance, Layoffs Happened While On Holiday, And More</a></h6>



<p>“I promised our employees and shareholders success and to build a studio redefining game development with a small, expert-driven team and a sustainable work model,” Sunberg said. “While we achieved much of this, shifting market conditions prevented us from succeeding within our timeframe. As a result, we must part ways with talented individuals who have been instrumental in our journey. This is incredibly difficult, but we remain committed to our vision and will continue to work on our IP and first game with a dedicated team.”</p>



<p>There was no mention of the number of people being let go nor how many people remain with the company. Insider Gaming has reached out to Liquid Swords for clarification after this round of layoffs.</p>



<p>Sundberg added that the studio “remains focused” on its vision of “simplifying the game development process to create exceptional gaming experiences for players.”</p>



<p>Liquid Swords is currently working on its first game, which is described as “a narrative-driven, open-world, hardboiled AAA revenge story” that is developed in Unreal Engine 5. No other details on the game are known.</p>



<p>In 2025, there have been <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 1,000 estimated jobs</a> lost due to layoffs a cross 30 companies. </p>
