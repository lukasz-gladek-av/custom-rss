<p>Remedy Entertainment, the creator of Alan Wake 2, released its financial results today, revealing that the game has sold over 2 million units.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remedy revealed what actions it took in the second half of 2024 to help Alan Wake 2 reach the milestone of 2 million copies sold. The developers first released The Lake House expansion in October, which received a positive reception. In addition, players received a physical retail release for Alan Wake 2 Deluxe Edition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few months later, the developers provided a PlayStation 5 Pro update for the game, alongside other updates to improve the game’s quality across all platforms. Lastly, they released a physical Collectors Edition for enthusiasts in partnership with Limited Run Games. Thanks to these actions, Alan Wake 2 enjoyed long-term sales and recouped the costs incurred. Remedy “has started to accrue royalties” from the game’s sales towards the end of 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remedy also outlined <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=de036915-53b0-4bfc-8564-7ce4872914e5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">its plans</a> for Alan Wake and Control, which are linked through the Remedy Connected Universe. The upcoming games in these franchises will be self-published, and growing and expanding them is the key focus for their future. The developers aim to “be a highly regarded creative studio with sustainable, significant commercial success” by the end of 2030.&nbsp;</p>
