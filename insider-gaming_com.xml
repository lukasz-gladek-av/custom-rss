<p>It’s easy to look at 2026 as a year that will be dominated by the release of Grand Theft Auto 6, assuming there isn’t another delay from Rockstar, but while that stands as the biggest overall release of the year, 2026 itself could be defined by the life-sim genre.</p>



<p>Games like The Sims and Stardew Valley have achieved vast success over the years, with the genre now being extremely popular and attracting huge franchises into the scene, as seen with Disney Dreamlight Valley, but 2026 is going to be bigger than ever before.</p>



<p>Several big players are entering the scene with fresh games in the genre, the indie environment continues to grow, and fans are poised for news from arguably the biggest franchise in the entire genre.</p>



<h2 id="h-big-players-enter-the-scene">Big Players Enter The Scene</h2>

<p>The mammoth year for life-sim gamers kicks off on January 15 with the release of the Nintendo Switch 2 edition of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which adds new content for all players, regardless of system, alongside Switch 2 exclusive features like gamechat and multiplayer with up to 12 players.</p>



<p>Gamers will be hoping that this isn’t the only piece of big Animal Crossing news in 2026, with all eyes cast towards Nintendo for details on the next entry in the series following the launch of Switch 2, which could certainly come next year. Even if a release of a new Animal Crossing isn’t on the 2026 calendar, it’s still set to be a huge year on Nintendo.</p>



<p>In March, Pokémon enters the genre with the release of Pokopia, where players take control of a humanoid Ditto, bringing life back to a depleted region. Fans believe this is a post-apocalyptic version of Kanto, where players attract new Pokémon into the environment, learn new skills, and build a complete Pokémon village.</p>



<p>Pokémon’s entry into the genre makes a lot of sense, particularly with the franchise branching out into new experiences, and Pokopia could be one of the biggest hits of the year. However, The Pokémon Company isn’t the one big player set to make moves into the life-sim genre.</p>



<p>HoYoverse, the developers behind hit games including Genshin Impact, Zenless Zone Zero, and Honkai: Star Rail, is expected to launch Petit Planet in 2026, following the start of the closed beta in November 2025. While a precise release date has not been shared, it’s anticipated to land in the next 12 months, and, with the power of HoYoverse behind it, Petit Planet could be a huge hit.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-host-of-options">A Host of Options</h2>



<p>While the likes of Nintendo, Pokémon, and HoYoverse are set to make waves in the life-sim genre in 2026, they’re far from the only developers looking to make a splash, and there’s set to be an embarrassment of riches for those looking for their fix in the genre.</p>



<p>Starsand Island is due to release on multiple platforms on February 1, having raised over $300,000 in a Kickstarter campaign, presenting players with a new world to experience and various career paths to choose from, including an angler, explorer, farmer, or rancher. While the game is a new player on the scene, excitement levels are rising, and the success of games developed in China in recent years shows this isn’t a title to ignore.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Neverway, from Coldblood Inc, is also due to release in 2026, and has strong Stardew Valley aesthitics with the art style and lore, though there’s a fresh approach as the player-character, Fionna, becomes indebted to a dead god, becoming its immortal herald—which makes Tom Nook from Animal Crossing look extremely tame.</p>



<p>Both of those titles merely scratch the surface of what’s to come; however, with other releases to keep an eye on, including Moonlight Peaks, Sunkissed City, and Fields of Mistria, the latter of which has been in early access since 2024 and is poised for a full 1.0 release in 2026.</p>



<p>With so many titles to choose from in 2026, life-sim gamers will be spoilt for choice, so much so that the eventual release of GTA 6 could go unnoticed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite is the undisputed king of collabs, regularly featuring huge crossovers with major franchises in the world of movies, TV, and gaming, but there’s still plenty of routes of collaborations to go down and skins that would be great additions in 2026.</p>



<p>From the world of movies to the major gaming franchises, Insider Gaming has selected the biggest Fortnite collaborations that would set 2026 alight.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-fortnite-collabs-we-d-love-to-see-in-2026">Biggest Fortnite Collabs We’d Love to See in 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-avengers-doomsday">Avengers: Doomsday</h3>



<figure><figcaption>New era. Image via Marvel</figcaption></figure>



<p>Admittedly, this one is probably a guarantee for the back-end of next year, but Avengers: Doomsday is arguably the biggest movie release in decades, marking a huge shift in direction for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and a Fortnite crossover in 2026 would be perfect.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s approach in Chapter 6 to deliver themed mini-seasons could be perfect for Avengers: Doomsday, which releases in December 2026, as Epic Games could introduce a Battleworld-themed map to star as the closing part of Chapter 7, featuring callbacks to various iconic moments and locations from MCU history.</p>



<p>There has already been a major Marvel collab with Doctor Doom as the main villain, however, so perhaps the best route for the collab would be to look back over MCU history, rather than solely tying into the film, but still having hints of what fans can expect from the huge movie.</p>



<h3 id="h-shrek">Shrek</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Swamp. Image via Dreamworks</figcaption></figure>



<p>Shrek returns to the big screens in 2025 with the release of Shrek 5, and it’s about time everyone’s favorite Ogre appeared in Fortnite, as it stands as one of the biggest animated movie franchises yet to be given an Epic Games’ makeover.</p>



<p>While skins and accessories would be a big hit, tying into the game directly and having a POI for Shrek’s swamp on the map would be excellent, especially if it came alongside the iconic voiceline of Shrek screaming ‘what are you doing in my swamp!?’ at any player who approaches.</p>



<p>The introduction of Sidekicks also opens the door for other characters like Donkey and the Gingerbread Man to feature, though I’d personally love to see Lord Farquad as a Sidekick, just for fun.</p>



<h3 id="h-toy-story">Toy Story</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You’ve got a friend in me. Image via Disney</figcaption></figure>



<p>Disney’s close relationship with Epic Games has brought a ton of major franchises and animated stars into Fortnite already but, so far, Toy Story hasn’t been touched, and 2026 is the perfect time to change that with yet another film in the franchise due to hit the big screens.</p>



<p>Toy Story is another great contender to feature in a larger collab with Fortnite in a full-island takeover, particularly if other Pixar titles are involved, but Disney, understandably, may be reluctant to allow Woody and Buzz Lightyear to run around with rifles, pistols, and other weapons.</p>



<p>Again, this is where Sidekicks could come in, as smaller versions of fan-favorite characters would be immensely popular, especially if they flopped to the floor when you stood still. Andy’s coming!</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon">Pokémon</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The very best. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>We can dream, right? Nintendo is famously extremely protective of its IPs, and previous attempts to bring the likes of Samus from Metroid into Fortnite have failed due to Nintendo’s apparent desire to keep the franchise as platform-exclusive, but it’s Nintendo whoi really misses out from this.</p>



<p>If Nintendo was to relent and ease their restrictions, Pokémon would admittedly be much further down the list of obvious franchises to feature, as it’s highly unlikely we’d see Ash Ketchum running around with a rocket launcher anytime soon, but, again, this is where Sidekicks could come in.</p>



<p>Having popular Pokémon like Pikachu, Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Charmander available as Sidekicks would be a huge boost, and, as the characters wouldn’t be directly involved in combat, it would save face for Nintendo.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-boys">The Boys</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Needed. Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>



<p>Superhero collabs are a dime a dozen in Fortnite, with pretty much all of the biggest faces making appearances over the years, but, so far, The Boys is yet to star. With the final season of the popular series due to air in 2026, there’s no better time for the franchise to make a Fortnite debut.</p>



<p>Skins for the likes of Homelander, Starlight, Billy Butcher, Queen Maeve, and Hughie Campbell would definitely be big sellers in the Item Shop, and having Mythic weapons spawning on the map during a collab would be iconic, though I doubt there’s the potential of being able to pick up a baby and using it’s laser vision.</p>



<p>Regardless, it’s staggering that The Boys is yet to feature in Fortnite, and that needs to change in 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-super-mario">Super Mario</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It’s-a-me. Image via Universal</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ok, we’re back to the Nintendo problem again, and there would be a lot of logistics to sort out with a collab, but if Nintendo and Epic Games were to get on the same page, surely Super Mario would be near the top of the list.</p>



<p>There are some obvious issues surrounding the heights of characters like Mario and Luigi, but others, like Bowser, could instantly be made into a skin, and there’s a potential for the collab to include Mario-inspired skins for Fortnite characters, rather than direct copies. Princess Peach Hope anyone?</p>



<p>The potential in-game is also great, with yellow question mark blocks replacing chests, Goomba’s to stomp on to receive loot, and a Mario Kart POI would be iconic.</p>



<h3 id="h-wwe">WWE</h3>



<figure><figcaption>More needed. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>WWE and Fortnite partnered for a small collab in 2025, bringing The Undertaker and Cody Rhodes into the game, but they were sub par. Frankly, how could you have Cody’s ‘WOAH’ Emote without the actual song lyrics? Rather than a brief collab, Fortnite should go all in.</p>



<p>The Fortnite x WWE roster includes the aforementioned duo along with The Rock, John Cena, Bianca Belair, and Becky Lynch, but there’s much, much more that could be done. Imagine the potential, with the likes of Rey Mysterio with various mask styles, Roman Reigns’ imposing figure, and R-Truth being hilarious.</p>



<p>If WWE and Fortnite were to really put their heads together, there are endless opportunities, even going as far as a full-on Fortnite Festival collab with a heap of entrance music made available.</p>



<h3 id="h-minecraft">Minecraft</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Block party. Image via Mojang Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>It does feel like that if we haven’t had a Minecraft collab in Fortnite yet, we’re never going to get one, particularly as LEGO Fortnite made the games a direct competitor, and the obvious opportunity for a collab with the release of the Minecraft movie in 2025 has passed.</p>



<p>Still, there are endless opportunities, and the chance for both iconic franchises to benefit. Skins for Minecraft characters would be a big win, though I can’t shake the feeling of how good a full-on Minecraft-inspired Battle Royale island would look like, featuring all the beloved biomes.</p>



<p>The likelihood of a Minecraft collab in Fortnite does seem extremely slim, but we’ll hold out hope anyway.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2026 is set to be a huge year for gaming, and Xbox players have plenty to be excited for with a host of first-party titles landing on the platform as part of a Game Pass subscription, alongside major multi-platform releases.</p>



<p>The past year was a bit of a mixed bag for Xbox, with several major delays hitting the platform hard, and, overall, 2025 felt a lot like a transitional year for gaming as a whole. Still, it’s certainly laid down the groundwork for 2026 to be huge, with more releases to enjoy than you can count.</p>



<p>With so many big releases coming in 2026, Insider Gaming has selected the biggest games in the next 12 months that Xbox players can’t miss.</p>



<h2 id="h-8-biggest-xbox-games-coming-in-2026">8 Biggest Xbox Games Coming in 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Japan awaits. Credit to Playground Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Though Forza Horizon 5 still stands as the best racing game available on the platform, the open-world adventure turns five in 2026, and a successor is overdue. Step forward Forza Horizon 6, with the setting of the game already announced to be in Japan, something that players have wanted for a long time.</p>



<p>Although the Horizon franchise is no longer Xbox exclusive, with the fifth game released on PlayStation 5 in 2025, Xbox remains the best place to play the title due to the Game Pass release. Additionally, a release on other platforms, including PlayStation, could come after an initial Xbox release.</p>



<h3 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Delayed. Image via Rockstar</figcaption></figure>



<p>The long, long wait for the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 is finally coming next year, assuming there are no further delays from Rockstar, and, with anticipation for GTA 6 being so high and the wait being so long, the eventual release will spread further than the usual sphere of gaming and will make a significant impact in media as a whole.</p>



<p>There are still many unanswered questions surrounding GTA 6, and we should start to see more about the game revealed, edging closer to a release, but expect Fall 2026 to be dominated by GTA 6 entirely, with other developers frantically moving things about so their release doesn’t clash with the titan.</p>



<h3 id="h-fable">Fable</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Long wait. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Initially slated for a release in 2025, Playground Games’ Fable relaunch was delayed until 2026 back in February 2025, and there are still some questions on whether that release window will be met. Regardless, the relaunch of the franchise is a big deal for Xbox in a period where its big in-house projects have fallen short of expectations on many cases.</p>



<p>It’s been an extremely long wait for Fable to emerge, and the stakes are high as the initial games have such a high amount of popularity, so reaching the high bars that have been set may be tricky. Either way, Fable will go down as one of the must-play games on Xbox in 2026, assuming it isn’t delayed again.</p>



<h3 id="h-subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Splashdown. Image via Unknown Worlds Entertainment </figcaption></figure>



<p>Another title that was initially due to release into early access in 2025, a delay pushed that period for Subnautica 2 back into 2026, and eyes are cast towards Krafton following a messy situation that has seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/subnautica-2-developer-unknown-worlds-sues-former-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unknown Worlds suing its former leadership</a> and co-founders with claims of sabotage and abandonment.</p>



<p>While all that rumbles on in the background, excitement for the next entry in the Subnautica franchise continues to rise. Both the initial game and Below Zero made a big impression in the open-world survival action-adventure genre, setting high expectations for the third game in the franchise.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Prequel. Image via The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Set 14 years before the events of the original Gears of War, which was re-released as Gears of War: Reloaded in August 2025, a move that brought the franchise onto PlayStation for the first time, E-Day is set on the events of Emergence Day when the Locust first reared their ugly heads.</p>



<p>It’s fair to say the more recent entries in the Gears of War franchise were not quick as impactful as the first three, but the prequel provides the opportunity to detail more background into the original trilogy, as well as bringing characters that were killed off in later games back into the fray.</p>



<h3 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Beginning. Image via Xbox Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Similar to the Gears of War franchise, the last few Halo games released were not quite as big as hits as the initial games in the franchise, which is now going back to the beginning with Halo: Campaign Evolved. While another remake has attracted criticism in some corners, it does provide the platform to build the next generation of the franchise.</p>



<p>Focusing on the campaign only has been controversial, but the up-to-date tools used will bring the original Halo game to life once again in different ways from before, and will surely help development of future games. Even if you still play the Masterchief Collection regularly, Campaign Evolved is worth some effort.</p>



<h3 id="h-high-on-life-2">High on Life 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sequel. Image via Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Squanch Games’ sequel to the original game of the same name, High on Life 2 is set for release on February 13, and will be available day one for Xbox Game Pass subscribers. With the early months of next year looking slightly barren in places, it’s a great opportunity for High on Life 2 to shine.</p>



<p>The comedic shooter is definitely a can’t-miss game of 2026 for Xbox players and, if you never played the first game, there’s still time to rectify that before the release date.</p>



<h3 id="h-call-of-duty-2026">Call of Duty 2026</h3>



<figure><figcaption>New start? Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another year, another Call of Duty title, surely it’s the same old thing? Perhaps not, as a big update was provided in December that confirmed back-to-back releases of titles in the franchise will be scrapped, after two years of Black Ops titles drew criticism and fatigue.</p>



<p>Not much is known about 2026 yet, and it remains to be seen whether it will bring a new Modern Warfare title or a new direction entirely, but the confirmation of a change in direction shows Activision is listening to the community, which should raise hopes for the 2026 Call of Duty title.</p>

<p>PlayStation surely wants a massive 2026 as the PS5 generation starts to wind down, and the key to the PS5 being a success is having another long list of incredible PlayStation games launching in 2025. Insider Gaming has picked out the biggest and best PlayStation games.</p>



<p>PS5’s exclusive games are becoming even fewer and farther between as we get scarily close to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS6</a> era. It’s not helped by the fact that the age-old ‘exclusive’ is dying as the world’s biggest gaming brands are intent on making the most money possible, and this requires a game to launch on all major platforms. Still, Sony has some bona fide PlayStation weapons up its luxurious 2026-tailored sleeves.</p>







<p>If you’re looking to fill your gaming calendar with the hottest exclusives and releases, this article has everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-ps5-exclusives-coming-in-2026">Biggest PS5 Exclusives Coming In 2026</h2>



<p>One entry on this list stands out as being a bit ‘sus,’ but for the most part, these are the biggest PS5 games coming out for PlayStation in 2026. Obviously, between Summer Game Fest, Sony State of Play showcases, and special announcements, we could always see more PS5 exclusives revealed throughout the year. Stay tuned for more.</p>



<h3 id="h-saros">Saros</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Housemarque</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s always a good day when Hosuemarque is working on a new game. It’s the company that literally never misses, and is responsible for legendary PlayStation games such as Super Stardust, Resogun, and 2021’s incredible Returnal. From Dead Nation to Alienation and Nex Machina, the developer only deals in premium, polished packages.</p>







<p>Saros is a spiritual successor to Returnal and looks like an evolution in every aspect. From the bright and beaming balls and bullets boomed at you by elusive foes in true bullet-hell fashion, to the incredible attention to detail in the visuals and sound design. It’s hard to see Saros being anything but a system-selling, Game of the Year contender come the end of 2026.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Saros | Gameplay Trailer | State of Play" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T4MEo0YYoW8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-marvel-s-wolverine">Marvel’s Wolverine</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you thought Insomniac was going to hold back on Wolverine’s violence, then you can tuck your adamantium tail between your legs and go and find something a bit more casual. Wolverine is Logan in his most primal and animalistic form. Insomniac kept a cloak over him for quite a while after the initial reveal, but now we’ve seen that this beast has claws.</p>



<p>The combat-centric action that the studio has mastered with the Marvel’s Spider-Man series plays a part here. But expect a deeper, darker, and more disturbing array of moves for the massacre-making mutant. It’s destined for 2026 and will likely be Sony’s <em>big </em>exclusive of the year.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-nioh-3">Nioh 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p>Team Ninja took a brief hiatus from Nioh to work on new IPs: Wo Long Fallen Dynasty and Rise of the Ronin. It also resurrected long-time fan favorite Ninja Gaiden, with the fourth mainline release in 2025. Now, it’s time for another dose of Soulslike samurai action with Nioh 3. </p>



<p>While FromSoftware rightfully gets the credit and acclaim for its Souls games, the Nioh games are incredibly deep, which is to be expected from the sick geniuses at Team Ninja. Nioh 3 is a slight outlier here as it’s technically releasing on PC as well as PS5, but not Xbox or Nintendo, so it can be given a pass.</p>

<p>This could easily be the shortest entry of any on this list. What else needs to be said about Grand Theft Auto 6? Depending on how you count Tetris, GTA 5 is the second or third best-selling game in history. GTA 6 is expected to go one better, and it’s probably the biggest and most important video game that will ever be made.</p>



<p>Who knows, it could be the final GTA game. Considering how long it takes Rockstar to make new games now, and with a Red Dead Redemption 3, or another new or revived IP hovering around, who knows how long it’ll be until a potential GTA 7—if ever.</p>



<p>This is <em>the </em>game of 2026…unless it’s delayed AGAIN.</p>

<h3 id="h-resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Capcom’s Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth mainline game in the franchise. You return to a bombed-out Raccoon City, following its devastation at the hands of a planned missile strike at the end of Resident Evil 3. Grace Ashcroft (daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft) is the unfortunate character in the hot seat this time around—although the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-makes-interesting-comment-on-leon-kennedy-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon Keneddy rumors</a> are growing.</p>



<p>You’ll be chased by another Tyrant-like monster, and there will be a big emphasis on running and survival. This should be music to the ears of you old-school Resident Evil fans. You can’t go wrong with a new Resi game, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-shown-exclusively-in-japan-reveals-new-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked Requiem gameplay</a> shows that a real biohazard awaits you.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Credit to IO Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>It feels weird to see IO Interactive’s name attached to something not Hitman-related. The Danish studio has been given the unenviable task of offering the world a new portrayal of James Bond and has a fully fledged license to thrill. The story focuses on Bond’s formative years as an agent, meaning we’re getting to see the youngest, most unpolished, and easily inexperienced version of the world’s most coveted and acclaimed secret agent.</p>



<p>Gameplay footage suggests that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-lights-combat-and-physicality-is-inspired-by-the-daniel-craig-era-of-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">007 First Light</a> won’t be a complete departure from Hitman, and there are clearly some nuances and stylish licks politely borrowed for good measure.</p>

<p>The day Forza Horizon 5 became available on PlayStation 5 was a very strange one; it felt like a noticeable shift in the industry. Gears of War: Reloaded plunged us further into the rabbit hole of incredulity, and now Halo is coming to PlayStation 5—the console wars are <em>officially </em>over.</p>



<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved marks the near-25-year franchise’s first appearance on a PlayStation console. It’s only the campaign, but for lifelong Sony fans (such as myself), this is a chance to start from the ground up. PS5 owners can see what the fuss is all about and see why Xbox dominated the shooter scene for years.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming has been reporting on the long-rumored Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake for years. While early AC games—such as Assassin’s Creed 2—get a lot of love, there’s something undeniably special (daresay perfect) about Black Flag.

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Player Count Doubts Debated as ARC Raiders Hits Huge Numbers]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-arc-raiders-player-count-debate/</link>
            <guid>1395364</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There’s a new player-count-related debate spreading like wildfire throughout the gaming space, and it concerns the success of ARC Raiders compared to the relative failure of Battlefield 6. In recent days, fans of both titles have been actively engaging in a debate to determine why one is soaring while the other can’t seem to do anything right.</p>



<p>This stems from Steam player counts (where else?), which paint a telling tale. Two months after release, ARC Raiders has managed to retain 91% of its peak player count on Steam, while Battlefield 6 has witnessed an 85% <strong>plummeting drop</strong> in the numbers.</p>



<p>Where do you stand on the debate?</p>







<h2 id="h-steam-isn-t-the-ultimate-litmus-test-for-gaming-numbers">Steam Isn’t the Ultimate Litmus Test for Gaming Numbers</h2>



<p>Too many people are still reliant on Steam’s figures for the picture of health for a game, but extrapolation is king. It could be considered woefully unfair to use <strong>a single platform </strong>to determine the overall health of a game like Battlefield 6, given that on PC, that’s arguably not even the most popular launcher for the game.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter much, as the debate rages, and Steam data is all we have to go on when it comes to facts and figures.</p>



<p>In the most recent news, it was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/12/31/arc-raiders-has-kept-91-of-its-playerbase-battlefield-6-has-lost-85/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forbes</a> that drew attention to the numbers, pointing out that ARC Raiders has retained 91% of its player base after two months. On the other hand, Battlefield 6, which was released in proximity to Embark Studios’ new extraction shooter, has plummeted by more than 85%.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a fractured debate for many reasons.</p>



<p>First, the live-service model for ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 is quite different. The former operates on delivering new missions, progression paths, unlocks, boss characters, maps, and events, which represent much more <strong>meat </strong>than what Battlefield offers. EA’s new first-person shooter is focused more on new maps, modes, and battle pass bundles than anything else.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders, being an extraction shooter, has a ‘reset loop’ that ensures players can come back every few weeks and restart their playthrough, which isn’t a thing in Battlefield 6, a typical multiplayer shooter. There’s point two in the argument against this debate.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders also represents something new and exciting in the gaming space: a truly accessible extraction shooter. At the same time, Battlefield 6 is just a first-person shooter with a boots-on-the-ground military setting, and they’re a dime a dozen. Folks came, saw, enjoyed the game, and departed for greener pastures when things started going south.</p>



<p>That’s <strong>the third point</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The <strong>fourth point </strong>against the argument is that ARC Raiders has simply been doing things better where Battlefield 6 is failing. In recent weeks, some of the new maps, modes, and bundles released in the Battlefield 6 space have left players disappointed, and controversies have surfaced regarding gen-AI art that have gone unexplained by Electronic Arts.</p>



<p>It’s simple, really. While Battlefield has a peak of 747,440 on Steam, it’s mostly comprised of players edging with curiosity into a game that marked a potential resurgence for a failing franchise. They dipped their toes in the water, and many of them decided to ultimately move on.</p>



<p>Conversely, ARC Raiders operates on a concept that many hadn’t ever experienced before it dropped. They’ve tried it, liked what’s on offer, and more have decided to hang around. It also helps that you can invest in ARC Raiders for as little as $30, and everything after that point, bar cosmetics, is free.</p>



<p>So, it’s safe to say we can cap this debate and move on. It’s a non-starter, apples and oranges, chalk and cheese, and something barely worth addressing.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Shroud Predicts ARC Raiders Will Be ‘Bigger Than Fortnite’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-arc-raiders-fortnite-hot-take/</link>
            <guid>1395358</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a statement that some have dubbed a hot take, popular streamer and former esports pro, Shroud, has suggested that ARC Raiders is <strong>bigger </strong>than Fortnite. He suggested that, going forward, Embark Studios’ extraction shooter will be <strong>bigger than </strong>the likes of Fortnite, VALORANT, and Apex Legends, prompting many to doubt his knowledge of ball.</p>



<p>Shroud has found plenty of success streaming ARC Raiders since the game dropped on October 30, but this latest comment is a tricky one, and it has fans debating how serious the content creator was.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-arc-raiders-be-bigger-than-fortnite">Will ARC Raiders Be Bigger Than Fortnite?</h2>



<p>During <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/2006425120722792795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent stream</a>, Shroud plainly stated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This game is definitely the biggest game since Fortnite for sure. The only other game I can think of along the way is maybe like VALORANT and Apex. But I think this game is bigger than both those games and will be bigger as time goes on.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was a hot take, and it has since been met with some ridicule, even from fans of ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>The extraction adventure title, which was released by Embark Studios on October 30, has proven to be one of the biggest hits of 2025. It’s one of the most popular extraction games ever made, and two months after release, it is effortlessly retaining enormous player counts across all platforms where other, similar games have faltered and fallen.</p>



<p>To say it’s bigger than Fortnite is a stretch, though. It’s no big secret that Fortnite is the most successful live-service shooter of all time, and the most popular battle royale title ever created. It has peaked at more than 40 million concurrent players, while ARC Raiders has managed a peak concurrent user count of 481,000 on Steam. </p>



<p>Embark Studios remains committed to expanding and evolving ARC Raiders and has already pushed out some engaging events and updates since the game dropped. Before ARC Raiders dropped, Embark Studios pledged <strong>years </strong>of support, and it’s easy to see that happening given what we already know about the game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/harada-tekken-dead-veteran-dev-final-message/</link>
            <guid>1395349</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Katsuhiro Harada has bid farewell to more than thirty years of working under the Bandai Namco banner, moving on from Tekken after decades of developing the series. In a new social media post, Harada ushered in 2026 by stressing that he’s ‘no longer a developer/creator of the TEKKEN series’.</p>



<p>At the start of December 2025, Harada and the Bandai Namco team shared the news that the legendary developer would be parting ways with the firm after 31 years.</p>







<h2 id="h-katsuhiro-harada-has-moved-on">Katsuhiro Harada Has Moved On</h2>



<p>In a new post on social media, Katsuhiro Harada shared the following message:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’m no longer a developer / creator of the TEKKEN series.</p><p>Harada_TEKKEN is completely dead.</p></div>— Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/2006390358859809229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The iconic developer was quick to update his bio, writing, ‘Former Game Director and Chief Producer of action and fighting games.’</p>



<p>On December 8, Harada shared the revelation with fans worldwide that he would be stepping down from his tenured spot at Bandai Namco:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans shared their sentiments in the comments under Harada’s post. One drew comparisons to the series that Harada was pivotal in creating, saying, ‘Heihachi ‘died’ like 4 times. Kazuya came back from a volcano. We know how this works in the Tekken universe. See you in the next patch notes, boss.’</p>



<p>Others offered more simple, heartfelt messages: ‘We will always think of you, Harada-san, thank you for everything.’</p>



<p>Harada worked in production and direction roles on the Tekken series since Tekken 3 debuted in 1997, and was a driving force in the space ever since. He’s set to appear one last time in the Tekken space at some upcoming esports events, but then the world afterwards is his oyster.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-1-935/</link>
            <guid>1395343</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I haven’t seen you since last year! It’s 2026, and it’s time to keep moving forward with stacks of NYT Connections hints, solutions, and tips. If you’ve burst into 2026 with a desire to keep your NYT Connections streak running, I’m here to help you achieve that resolution. Below, you’ll find the solutions for today’s puzzle.</p>



<p>Let us know in the comments below what your resolutions are for 2026 and how you plan to hold yourself to them!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-1">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 1)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #935:</p>



<ul>
<li>SHUCK</li>



<li>SCOTCH</li>



<li>HEAD</li>



<li>RAT</li>



<li>CURSE</li>



<li>SKIN</li>



<li>NUT</li>



<li>FLY</li>



<li>HOUND</li>



<li>FINGERS</li>



<li>SPELL</li>



<li>SHELL</li>



<li>CHARM</li>



<li>BUFF</li>



<li>PEEL</li>



<li>HEX</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about the small, concentrated forms of supernatural influence — the kind of mystical actions that show up in fairy tales, fantasy novels, or folklore.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Imagine you’re prepping food in a kitchen — or working with anything that has a natural outer layer</em>.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are the words you attach to someone who is REALLY into a topic — the kind of person who knows every detail, every fact, every obscure bit of trivia.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Picture the word “butter” followed by another word to form a familiar phrase or compound.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 1:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-january-1-935">NYT Connections Answers for Today, January 1 (#935)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CHARM, CURSE, HEX, SPELL</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – PEEL, SHELL, SHUCK, SKIN</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BUFF, HEAD, HOUND, RAT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – FINGERS, FLY, NUT, SCOTCH</li>
</ul>
