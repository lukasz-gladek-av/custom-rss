<p>Like other games, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has Shinies. These are extremely rare and differently color-paletted versions of their regular counterparts. If you’re worried about the game’s auto-save ability making it so that you miss out on rare Shiny encounters, then you can breathe easy and use Sleep Power on yourself.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/are-starters-shiny-locked-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shinies</a> are the holy grail of Pokémon. Legendaries are great, but the feeling of finding a Shiny version of a Pokémon is like pulling a Charizard from a Pokémon pack—wilder than anything that inhabits Viridian Forest. Shinies are usually liable to disappear if you don’t reach them in Pokémon games, but this isn’t the case in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pre-order-bonus-redeem-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>

<p>Players are learning that if you hear or see a Shiny Pokémon in Legends: Z-A and it’s in your game world, you have infinite time to catch it—providing you don’t go over the Shiny limit.</p>



<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AustinJohnPlays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Austin John Plays</a> does a great job of explaining how Z-A approaches Shinies. Despite the game’s auto-save system, once a Shiny appears in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, it will remain until you interact with it: Fighting it or trying to catch it.</p>



<p>Austin John Plays explains that “Up to 10 Pokémon, who are Shiny, will be preserved in the game’s memory.” This means you have ample time to catch or reach a Shiny Pokémon,</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The mechanics and theory have been tested by other Pokémon Legends: Z-A players, too. A subreddit thread explained how the OP encountered a Shiny Magikarp, went away, changed the time of day, came back, and it was still there.</p>



<p>They did several other actions—also involving the passage of time and/or traveling—and the Shiny Magikarp didn’t budge.</p>

<p>This is what we call a good quality of life feature. You don’t have to worry about games or loss of connection ruining your chances of capturing a rare Shiny.

<p>Battlefield 6 has been out for nearly a week, and Electronic Arts (EA) is calling it the biggest launch in series history.</p>



<p>In a press release posted on the studio’s website, EA says that Battlefield 6 has sold “over 7 million copies and counting” since release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. They added that there have been over 172 million online matches played with over 15 million hours watched during the first weekend.</p>

From the initial concept through to the implementation of Battlefield Labs and into the record-shattering Open Beta we have been obsessed with player feedback. Together, with our players we’ve had a singular goal: to craft the best Battlefield ever. And this is just the beginning – our first season of new content is just 12 days away.”</strong></p>
