<p>Battlestate Games, the developer behind the legendary extraction shooter, Escape from Tarkov, has teased the game being released on Steam at some point. The thinly-veiled nod came from Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, as well as the official BSG social channels earlier today.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov: Arena came to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Epic Games Store</a> earlier this year, but Escape from Tarkov has never been accessible anywhere other than directly from Battlestate Games and through a proprietary launcher.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-tarkov-coming-to-steam-soon">Is Tarkov Coming to Steam Soon?</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Nikita Buyanov, arguably the face of Escape from Tarkov, posted a cryptic GIF of a man jetting ‘steam’ from an iron. This was followed up by the Battlestate Games team publishing a simple post featuring a single emoji – <strong>a steam cloud</strong>.</p>











<p>One social user noted that the above GIF appears in the top five listed when you search for ‘Steam’.</p>



<p>It’s entirely open to interpretation and conjecture, but it’s almost certainly not anything other than a Steam release. In November, Escape from Tarkov <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">will graduate to a 1.0 state</a> after being in a beta state since 2017. It’s the ultimate step for Escape from Tarkov, and it’s one that Battlestate Games has spent a decade preparing for.</p>



<p>It makes complete sense for Escape from Tarkov to diversify its reach and deploy on other launchers and storefronts moving forward, especially as it’s finally being released as a ‘full game’.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that this is completely unconfirmed at present, and I’ve reached out to Battlestate Games to try and get a little clarification on what the posts might mean. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Gameplay footage of Battlefield 6’s Operation Firestorm map has leaked online from the game’s recent playtests.</p>



<p>Battlefield began its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-testing-is-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs playtests again this week</a>, following its hugely successful <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-record-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Beta</a>. As expected, the leaks are coming thick and fast. The most recent leak is of Operation Firestorm, a map that was first featured in Battlefield 3.</p>



<p>You can watch some of the gameplay footage below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Operation Firestorm is currently the only named remade map to be featured in Battlefield 6, but other maps, including the highly popular Operation Metro, are most certainly going to make a return during the game’s life cycle.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – How To Sign Up For Battlefield Labs and Test Battlefield 6<br></a></strong><br>Operation Firestorm was first featured for Battlefield 6 during the game’s reveal trailer, which showcased what the map was popular for – aerial combat.</p>



<p>Other leaks from the Battlefield Labs playtests are also coming in thick and fast, including the addition of the server browser in Battlefield Portal. As of the time of writing, the developers have only committed to bringing the server browser to Portal and will leave standard multiplayer for standard matchmaking. </p>



<p>Developers behind Battlefield 6 – DICE, Motive, Criterion, and Ripple Effect have said that Battlefield 6 was the most successful Battlefield Beta to date. The stats include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Total Matches Played: 420,127,450</li>



<li>Hours of Gameplay: 92,351,578</li>



<li>Enemies Killed: 4,928,771,770</li>



<li>Friendlies Revived: 30,936,675</li>



<li>Final Destruction Receipt: $196,760,386,367</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-2026-dates-location-and-ticket-sales-when-is-gamescom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamescom-2026-dates-location-and-ticket-sales%E2%80%94when-is-gamescom-2026-happening.1284702/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gamescom 2025 was a phenomenal event that broke records, seeing more exhibitors and guests pop up in Cologne than ever before. Next year’s show promises to be an even more ambitious event, and in this guide, we’re breaking down the Gamescom 2026 dates, location guides, and information regarding ticket sales.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in heading to Germany to check out Gamescom 2026, look no further than this guide to learn everything you need to know.</p>







<p>It has been confirmed that Gamescom 2026 will take place between August 26 and 30, 2026. This is later than usual; later than <strong>ever before</strong>, in fact. It’ll be the first Gamescom since 2009 to be held that close to the end of August.</p>



<p>Here are the dates of previous Gamescom events:</p>



<ul>
<li>(Gamescom 2026: 26 – 30 August)</li>



<li>Gamescom 2025: 20 – 24 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2024: 20 – 24 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2023: 23 – 27 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2022: 24 – 28 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2021: 25 – 27 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2020: 25 – 29 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2019: 20 – 24 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2018: 21 – 25 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2017: 22 – 25 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2016: 17 – 21 August</li>
</ul>



<p>This means that Gamescom 2026 will start on Wednesday and run to Sunday, which follows the same format as the 2024 Gamescom. It hasn’t been confirmed, but it’s a very safe bet that Gamescom 2026 will kick off with the <strong>Opening Night Live </strong>showcase, which draws in millions of viewers from around the world.</p>







<p>Gamescom 2026 will take place at the Koelnmesse complex in Cologne, Germany. This sprawling venue plays host to more than 2,000 conferences every year, and Gamescom is arguably the gem of the bunch. It’s a complete takeover that seizes control of a dozen conference halls and expands across the entire city in many ways.</p>



<p>Gamescom has been held at the Koelnmesse since the first iteration in 2009, which drew the attention of 245,000 visitors.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Cologne <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/gamescom-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">isn’t the only location</a> for Gamescom events, as we now have Gamescom Asia and Gamescom LATAM.</p>



<p>Gamescom Asia is set to take place in Bangkok, Thailand, from October 16 – 19, 2025. Gamescom LATAM will appear in São Paulo, Brazil, from April 29 to May 3, 2026.</p>







<p>Gamescom 2026 tickets are not on sale at present and likely won’t be for quite some time. In 2025, tickets went on sale for the August showcase in April, four months before the event took place.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that the same structure will be followed for the 2026 show.</p>
