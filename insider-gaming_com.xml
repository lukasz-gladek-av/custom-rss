<p>PureArts is now accepting pre-orders for one of the most remarkable Assassin’s Creed collectables ever marketed. The ‘Assassin’s Creed Animus: Jacob &amp; Evie’ statue, which stands at a whopping 24 inches tall and weighs a hefty 39lbs, is available to order now and will be shipped Q4 2025.</p>



<p>If you want to secure an exclusive edition that comes with a wearable replica of Jacob Frye’s necklace, you’ll need to move fast – only 250 will be made.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-greatest-collector">The Greatest Collector</h2>



<p>This is an item that only the most hardcore fans will consider copping.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate was released in 2015 to a relatively stellar reception, emerging as the last of the ‘original formula’ games that were sunsetted when Origins was released in 2017. It saw players assume control of two protagonists – Jacob and Evie Frye – as they explored Victorian London.</p>



<p>The setting was superb, the map was meticulously created, and the story was great – if a little predictable. It had brilliant expansions, and for me, it was on home turf, so that was a bonus.</p>



<p>PureArts’ Jacob and Evie statue is 1/4 scale, which means it’s <strong>massive</strong>. For $1,299, you’re getting a hefty polyresin figure with incredible details. It has onboard LED lighting, a ‘hyperdetailed’ sculpt, and the most accurate thing you’ll see from the game short of downloading it and pressing ‘play’.</p>



<p>The Jacob and Evie statue joins a long line-up of similar figures from PureArts, who historically has poured effort into creating some of the finest collectables from the world of Assassin’s Creed.</p>



<p>Could you see yourself parting ways with $1,299 in celebration of Assassin’s Creed Syndicate? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
