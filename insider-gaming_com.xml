<p>We may see more Clair Obscur games in the future in the future, according to the game’s director. In a recent YouTube interview, Sandfall Interactive’s Guillaume Broche, talked about the RPG’s massive success. However, it seems he hints at there being more in store for the Clair Obscur series outside of Expedition 33.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Sandfall Interactive’s first-ever title, took the world by storm earlier this year. With incredible turn-based combat, stunning visuals, and intense storytelling, it was a hit with fans and critics alike. In fact, many have already called it the best game of 2025. So, it’s not too surprising to hear that the team wants to return to it, though not in the same way.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The interview in question comes from YouTuber MrMattyPlays. Due to the success of Clair Obscur, Expedition 33, director Guillaume Broche <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZEP5kjw-w4&amp;t=321s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sat down with the YouTuber</a> to chat about it. During the talk, the question came up about there being more of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In response, Guillaume Broche said the following:</p>



<p>“Clair Obscur is the franchise name. Expedition 33 is one of the stories that we want to tell in this franchise,” states Broche. “Exactly what it will look like and what the concept will be is still too soon to announce, but what is sure is that this is not the end of the Clair Obscur franchise.”</p>



<p>Also during the interview, Broche mentions sequels, so we could return to Expedition 33, alongside new stories. As he does mention, what those new games will look like, narrative-wise, is too soon to say. The ending of Expedition 33 does leave room for more, so it’s only <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developers-thinking-of-plans-for-next-game/">a matter of time</a> before we see what that may be.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-is-up-for-the-challenge-of-bringing-back-college-basketball/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-is-%E2%80%9Cup-for-the-challenge%E2%80%9D-of-bringing-back-college-basketball.1282155/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>College Basketball video games are coming back, but fans shouldn’t expect to see something in the too near future.</p>



<p>While the series’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-announces-return-of-college-basketball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return was already confirmed</a> earlier this summer—after <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1869824116339159465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first being reported</a> that talks were taking place back in December—EA Sports’ vice president of business development Sean O’Brien spoke to USA Today about where things sit, and the exact stage the game’s return is at.</p>



<p>O’Brien <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2025/08/26/ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game/85645694007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told the outlet that EA</a> is <strong>“up for the challenge”</strong> of bringing college basketball back to video games for the first time since 2009.</p>



<p><strong>“[We’re] in the process of trying to figure out how that could come together,”</strong> he said.</p>



<p>O’Brien then confirmed that EA’s plan is to have all Division I men’s and women’s college basketball programs in the game. It’s something he called a “daunting task”, but one that the company is up to after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-remains-2024s-best-selling-video-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the successful return</a> of College Football last year. O’Brien said that EA “captured lightning in a bottle” with College Football, and that they <strong>“would love to try to do the same for college basketball.”</strong></p>



<p>This isn’t the first time an EA executive has publicly commented on a return for College Basketball. Back in July, EA CEO Andrew Wilson spoke on the game during the company’s earnings report. </p>



<p>At the time, he said that he couldn’t “say too much yet” about the game, but that EA wants to <strong>“[capture] the action on the field or the court, representing the energy, pageantry, the traditions, and celebrating the unique sights and sounds and stories of every school and rivalry.</strong>“</p>



<p>EA Sports College Basketball isn’t expected to launch until the 2028-29 season per Extra Points’ Matt Brown and Insider Gaming’s own sources. </p>



<h2 id="h-it-s-not-just-ea-sports-after-college-basketball">It’s Not Just EA Sports After College Basketball</h2>



<p>While EA Sports is at the front of the college gaming world at the moment, competitor 2K sports has also been teasing its involving with College Basketball.</p>



<p>Just after EA’s announcement, 2K teased it’s own, saying “the campus has been quiet for too long”. Not long after that reports surfaced that 2K originally wanted <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2k-sports-wants-to-add-college-basketball-to-nba-2k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">college modes and teams as paid DLC</a> for the NBA 2K franchise before <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/report-2k-sports-plans-college-basketball-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sports Business Journal reported</a> that they then shifted to pitching a stand alone game. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out multiple times over the weeks for clarification on 2K’s stance regarding college basketball, and how it would work. Each time, the company has declined to provide an official statement.</p>

<p>EA Sports has announced the first title update for Madden 26, bringing along with it a number of fixes and changes to various of the game.</p>



<p>The biggest updates come in the form of fixes to a zone defense, including Cover 2 and Cover 3 concerns where players were falling back too deep, leaving areas of the field open. Also added to the game are three new international stadiums in Germany, Spain, and Ireland. </p>



<p>You can check out the full list of changes coming in the August Madden 26 Title Update below courtesy of <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/title-update-august-28-2025?utm_campaign=mad26_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_m26-title-update-x&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=85681&amp;ts=1756310856340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA Sports</a>.

<h2 id="h-august-madden-26-title-update-details">August Madden 26 Title Update Details</h2>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Gameplay</h3>



<ul>
<li>Cover 2 Tampa – The middle defender now gets deeper, maintaining better leverage position against deep threats, especially vs. 3×1 formations.</li>



<li>Cover 2 Hard Flats – Addressed an issue with Hard Flats where defenders were dropping too deep and too far inside before reacting to flat routes. Defenders now drop more accurately with their zone responsibilities, improving coverage consistency in the shallow flats.</li>



<li>Cover 3 Match: Logic improvements for Defenders when reacting to Slot WRs attempting to outleverage the defense on deep routes. This includes Buzz Mable and Zone Blitz 3 playcalls</li>



<li>Cover 6 &amp; Cover 4 Palms – Fixed an issue where Outside Quarters CBs in Cover 6 and Cover 4 Palms were oftentimes losing the press giving up easy touchdowns. We adjusted the CBs alignment so they will no longer attempt to press the WR.</li>



<li>Zone coverage defenders now drop back quicker when shading coverage ‘overtop’.</li>



<li>Fixed a post play animation defect where a defender would do “read steps” when standing in place after the whistle.</li>

<p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is now available to Xbox Insiders with Xbox Game Pass Core and Standard. The mode, which lets players stream and play their Xbox Game Pass games anywhere, has opened its doors for all Xbox Insiders. In addition, select PC titles can now be played.</p>



<p>Previously, only those subscribed to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate could make use of Xbox Cloud Gaming. While the movement is only for Xbox Insiders, it does look promising that it may go into effect in the future.</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-cloud-gaming-and-select-pc-games-now-available-for-xbox-insiders-with-game-pass">Xbox Cloud Gaming and Select PC Games Now Available for Xbox Insiders with Game Pass</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/27/xbox-insiders-can-stream-and-play-in-new-ways-with-xbox-game-pass-starting-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post on Xbox Wire</a>, the Xbox Insider Team posted about the new addition to Xbox Cloud Streaming. The service allows players to access Xbox Game Pass wherever they want, like from their PC, browser, or even TV. In addition, you can stream games, letting you not have to download the game and get right into playing. All you have to do is sign in to Xbox.com or to Xbox Cloud Gaming on whatever device you use and play away.</p>



<p>Alongside the Xbox Cloud Streaming, select PC titles will now be available for Xbox Insiders to play, regardless of their Xbox Game Pass tier. In order to make sure you can play, you’ll have to download the Xbox PC app and sign into Xbox. From there, you’ll have a few titles to choose from. </p>



<p>It’s important to note that this is only for Xbox Insiders and has not been released to the public yet. To become an Xbox Insider, you’ll need to download the app on Xbox and/or PC and sign up. You’ll then get access to surveys, previews, and such and help test out new features and updates, like Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see Xbox Cloud Gaming come to all of Xbox Game Pass? Have you tried it before? How do you like it? Let us know in the comments below and on the forums!</p>

<p>As revealed in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-psychonauts-2-stardew-valley-viewfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, three titles are available to download for free throughout September, which we’ve detailed here.</p>



<h3 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h3>



<p>The beloved indie title lands on PlayStation Plus for September, with an adventure full of farming, mining, fishing, and even romance in the offing.</p>



<p>Still one of the most popular games on platforms like Steam, Stardew Valley continues to go from strength to strength, while developers are working hard on the next title, The Haunted Chocolatier. </p>



<p>Plucked straight into work after inheriting your grandfather’s farm, you start with basic tools and a few coins. From there, the world is truly your oyster.</p>



<h3 id="h-psychonauts-2">Psychonauts 2</h3>



<p>For those looking for a new platform-adventure game to keep you occupied in the wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong, look no further than Psychonauts 2.</p>



<p>With a variety of missions, a cinematic style, and customizable psychic powers, Psychonauts 2 puts players in control of Raz “on a journey through the minds of friends and foes on a quest to defeat a murderous psychic villain.”</p>



<h3 id="h-viewfinder">Viewfinder</h3>



<p>Any player wanting to test themselves with challenging puzzles can do exactly that with Viewfinder, where you use an instant camera’s viewfinder to bring photos, paintings, and sketches to life.</p>



<p>All three titles will be available from September 2, meaning there’s just a few days left to download August’s titles; Lies of P, Day Z, and My Hero One’s Justice 2.</p>



<p>Which of these titles are you planning to pick up and play next month? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
