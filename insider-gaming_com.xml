<p>Several reports indicate that Battlefield 6’s anti-cheat software is asking players to remove Valorant from their systems. </p>



<p>Electronic Arts announced that Battlefield 6’s open beta was their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-biggest-ever-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest open beta to date</a>. However, the test version of the game was plagued by cheaters, with BF6’s anti-cheat engine blocking over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-blocked-cheating-attempts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">330,000 cheating attempts</a>. Interestingly, the same cheat engine seems to be facing an issue with Valorant. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-anti-cheat-wants-players-to-uninstall-valorant">Battlefield 6 Anti-Cheat Wants Players to Uninstall Valorant </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/battlefield-bf-battlefield-6-bf6-anti-cheat-valorant-conflict/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, several reports about Battlefield 6’s anti-cheat engine facing issues with Valorant have surfaced on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mlwcbl/battlefield_6_just_told_me_to_uninstall_valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/Battlefield</a>. All the reports include a screenshot of the same ‘Security Violation’ pop-up, which states that BF6 failed to launch due to ‘general software incompatibility’. The pop-up further asks players to “uninstall the conflicting software, or adjust its settings”, and the software in question is Valorant. </p>

<p>A post by Revolutionary Sun on <a href="https://x.com/_WCS_/status/1954339677647040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> states that Battlefield 6’s anti-cheat engine, Javelin and Valorant’s anti-cheat engine, Vanguard, are clashing due to secure boot kernel-level access. </p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6 Open Beta surpassed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500,000 concurrent players</a> on Steam, crossing Call of Duty’s all-time high. Additionally, the former Blizzard boss thinks that BF6 will “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-is-going-to-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-this-year-according-to-former-blizzard-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boot stomp</a>” Call of Duty this year, which in turn will be better for FPS games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The developers of Pokémon TCG Pocket, DeNA, have revealed that they are aiming to release a ‘major update’ in 2025. </p>



<p>During the latest earnings <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/2432/ir_material3/256980/00.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>, DeNA revealed several details about Pokémon TCG Pocket’s progress over Q1 FY2025 and their future actions. The report states that average monthly active users for the first quarter were approximately 39 million. Close to 60% of the virtual currency consumption came from international markets, and subscriptions are seeing “steady demand”.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-s-major-update-will-focus-on-retention-and-login-frequency">Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Major Update will Focus on Retention and Login Frequency</h2>



<p>Regarding future actions, DeNA states that “New user acquisition remains steady”; however, the retention rate of existing users is decreasing compared to the initial launch period. Maintaining a monthly active user base has become a priority for them. The developers have recognised “initiatives to improve retention rate and login frequency, such as enhancement of collection experience.”</p>



<p>The developers are now planning and developing a “major update” for Pokémon TCG Pocket, which will focus on improving the retention rate and login frequency of users. The details of this update will be announced later; however, we do know that DeNA is planning to release it “within this calendar year”. </p>



<p>In other news, Pokémon TCG Pocket has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-removes-artwork-from-new-set-after-plagiarism-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed Ho-oh &amp; Lugia Artwork</a> from the Wisdom of Sea and Sky A4 set after claims of plagiarism emerged on social media.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-is-getting-the-skywalker-saga-treatment-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-batman-is-getting-the-skywalker-saga-treatment-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1266852/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A recent claim suggests that a LEGO Batman game inspired by LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is scheduled to release in 2026. </p>



<p>The last LEGO title players received was Horizon Adventures, based on PlayStation’s popular series. Since then, we have received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-party-announced-for-september-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> for a new game, LEGO Party, which is an upcoming 4-player party game. Now, reports indicate that a LEGO Batman game is in development, scheduled for release in 2026. </p>



<h2 id="h-lego-batman-will-cover-multiple-movies-in-skywalker-saga-style">LEGO Batman Will Cover Multiple Movies in Skywalker Saga Style</h2>



<p>Details about the LEGO Batman title, following the style of The Skywalker Saga, come from LEGO Game News on <a href="https://x.com/LEGOTtNewsI/status/1954565600816107616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). The account had previously reported on a <a href="https://x.com/legottnewsi/status/1947420735846420926" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rumour</a> that stated the next LEGO game by TT Games will follow multiple movies based on Batman. Moreover, the game could potentially be revealed at Gamescom 2025’s Opening Night Live. </p>



<p>Their new post follows up on the previous rumour, stating “The next Game is a Skywalker Saga styled LEGO Batman that is not connected to the original trilogy (Due Spring 2026).” In the comment section, the user has also stated that there’s a strong chance that this game will feature “one Gotham city and you can choose the era.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>ICYM: Here’s an overall review of the 2023 TT Games RUMORS that occurred in January of that year with little more extra context. </p><p> – LEGO Disney and the LEGO Marvel Guardians Game was cancelled</p><p> – A ‘Skywalker Saga’ styled LEGO Harry Potter Game was in the pitch stage, but… <a href="https://t.co/1Pz5PCH2xH">pic.twitter.com/1Pz5PCH2xH</a></p></div>— LEGO Games News (@LEGOTtNewsI) <a href="https://twitter.com/LEGOTtNewsI/status/1954565600816107616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga was a title that allowed players to start playing from any trilogy and included all nine films. Players were also able to visit different popular locales from the Skywalker Saga films, with the game allowing them to unlock and explore 23 other planets. </p>



<p>The same post also provides players with information on other LEGO games that were cancelled. It seems LEGO Disney and LEGO Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy were scrapped. Furthermore, there was also “A ‘Skywalker Saga’ styled LEGO Harry Potter Game” being pitched, but it never went past it.” Players should approach these details about the LEGO Batman game and other titles cautiously, as they lack official confirmation.</p>



<p>In other news, a LEGO Nintendo Game Boy set is scheduled for release in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-nintendo-game-boy-price-pre-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early October</a>. Also, here’s Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-party-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a> of LEGO  Party!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first Battlefield 6 open beta has ended after an intense weekend of record-breaking action, but that’s not the end of the line for the game. Electronic Arts has lined up a second test that’ll come later this week, but <strong>when does the Battlefield 6 beta end </strong>for good? And when it does, what are your options?</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know about the Battlefield 6 beta end times and where it goes from there.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-beta-end-times">Battlefield 6 Beta End Times</h2>



<p>The next Battlefield 6 open beta is scheduled to run from August 14 (08:00 UTC) to August 18 (08:00 UTC). That means the end time for the next Battlefield 6 open beta is at 01:00 PT / 04:00 AM ET on August 18. You’ll get an entire four-day window to play Battlefield 6, but it could be your last chance until the game comes out on October 10.</p>



<p>That brings me to your options going forward.</p>



<p>Once you’ve enjoyed the Battlefield 6 beta, you’re free to sit back and wait until October to get your hands on the full game, <strong>or </strong>you can try your luck with Battlefield Labs, which <strong>should </strong>reopen following the end of the Battlefield 6 beta.</p>



<p>Here’s a guide explaining <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/">how to get into Battlefield Labs</a>.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 beta went nuts during the first weekend of play, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/">more than 500,000 players</a> joining the fun on Steam <strong>alone</strong>. It skyrocketed on platforms like Twitch, hitting almost 900,000 concurrent viewers, far more than any Call of Duty game (except Warzone) has ever managed.</p>



<p>The second round of the Battlefield 6 beta isn’t expected to be any different from the first, but feedback gathered during the opening window will help shape some of the balancing tactics going into the second stage.</p>



<p>Have you already been enjoying the game and are wondering when the Battlefield 6 beta ends? Let me know if you’re disappointed that it’ll be over soon on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioware-wanted-a-dragon-age-trilogy-remaster-but-ea-wouldn%E2%80%99t-fund-it.1266828/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dragon Age, like Mass Effect, didn’t have the best time when its most recent title was released. In October 2024, BioWare and Electronic Arts dropped Dragon Age: Veilguard, which wasn’t well received by audiences, much like 2017’s Mass Effect: Andromeda. However, Mass Effect has an advantage over Dragon Age in that the series boasts a trilogy remaster.</p>



<p>When recently challenged on why Dragon Age doesn’t have a trilogy remaster, or a ‘Legendary Edition’, former BioWare executive producer of more than 20 years, Mark Darrah, explained what’s up.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-do-it-with-the-money-you-have">‘Do It With The Money You Have’</h2>



<p>Mark Darrah departed BioWare in 2022 after spending 24 years rising through the ranks at the company. He saw some of the most popular games of certain eras go out the doors at BioWare, including the Mass Effect ‘quadrilogy’ and every Dragon Age game bar last year’s Veilguard.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with MrMattyPlays, Darrah got onto the topic of a Dragon Age trilogy remaster (not remake) in the vein of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition, explaining why it probably won’t ever be a thing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I honestly think they should do – I don’t think they will – but I think they should do a remaster of the first three. One of the things we pitched at one point, pretty softly, was to retroactively rebrand the first three games as if they were a trilogy and call it the Champion’s Trilogy.</p>



<p>Maybe you do that, and as a first step, you take those three games (and maybe Veilguard), you shine them up, you re-release them, probably remaster, not a remake, see what happens, and then maybe go from there.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Darrah highlighted the stark similarities between the ‘states’ of the Mass Effect franchise and the Dragon Age franchise, but admitted that the latter is much harder to remaster than the former. Not only that, but there’s <strong>no money </strong>coming from EA to support the idea:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>EA has said this publically, they’re kind of against remasters. I don’t really know why, it’s strange for a publically-traded company to seem to be against free money, but they seem to be against it, so that’s part of it.</p>



<p>The other problem is that Dragon Age is harder than Mass Effect to do.</p>



<p>One of the earliest things was, let’s do Frostbite Tools, and then let’s find a mod house that seems talented and just uplift them and pay them to do a remake of Dragon Age Origins.</p>



<p>There were lots of pitches around it, is there a way we can bring Dragon Age Origins forward?</p>



<p>The studios ruin their financials within themselves. I think, to some degree, EA’s stance was, ‘Sure, go ahead and do it, but do it with the money you already have.’ We couldn’t do it with the money that we already have, because we’re doing all these other things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full interview can be seen here:</p>

<iframe title="BioWare BOMBSHELL: Veilguard's Hidden Truth &amp; Lost &quot;Origins&quot; Remaster | Mark Darrah Opens Up" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Pd9OG3HmN0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Dragon Age: Veilguard scored well in the review stakes when it was released last year, but failed to resonate with the general audience, as reflected in its low aggregate scores on platforms like Steam. </p>



<p>Do you think a Dragon Age trilogy remaster could revive the franchise a little? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One player has gone viral for spending an astonishing $32,000 in NBA 2K25 in just five months on microtransactions.</p>



<p>The clip was posted to <a href="https://x.com/Troydan/status/1953657155896095112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, which showed YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2KOGGaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2KOG</a> going through his microtransaction purchases for NBA 2K25 on the PlayStation Store, where he revealed that he’s spent an astonishing $32,831.68 on the game.</p>



<p>The clip reveals that transactions started on March 31, 2025, and ended on August 5, 2025, the date the clip was recorded. All of the transactions are for the game’s Virtual Currency Pack, with the highest costing $160.48 each.</p>



<p>You can watch the full clip below:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The YouTuber himself revealed that he’s learned his lesson from spending such a large amount of money, and warned others that it’s not worth chasing cards or spending large amounts of money for content creation. </p>



<p>What’s worse is that despite him spending $32,000, he’s still not obtained all of the best cards in the game. In fact, just by watching his video, he would probably need to spend an equal amount of money to get near completion.</p>



<p>“One things for sure, I will not spend this much again, because you don’t get rewarded for it. As much as I spent, I should have everything in the game, but it’s not even close,” he said. </p>



<p>NBA 2K26 also releases on Setpember 5, 2025, which will make all of his purchases pretty useless if he was to move on to the next game.</p>

<p id="block-71facd75-48bc-4681-8b38-170ac6015e01"><strong>As of August 2025, there are no active Roblox ThrottleX codes.</strong></p>



<p id="block-5a6e016a-35cd-4f08-b847-96caa6e5c4f4">However, this likely won’t be for long, as Roblox games add new codes all the time, so check back soon to see if any have been added.</p>

<p id="block-4a71d319-73ea-4b45-91a4-006a34339f07"><strong>As no codes have been added to ThrottleX</strong> <strong>so none have expired yet.</strong></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-biggest-ever-ea/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98biggest-open-beta-ever%E2%80%99-is-celebrated-as-success-continues.1266555/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Last night, the Battlefield 6 open beta hit more than 500,000 concurrent players <strong>on Steam alone</strong>. It shattered records held by Call of Duty and pushed past 850,000 peak viewers on Twitch, widely representing the fact that <strong>Battlefield is back</strong>.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the Battlefield team reiterated that this is the largest open beta in Battlefield history, as if we didn’t already know that. The hype is skyrocketing, the excitement is at unprecedented levels, and the future of Battlefield is (finally) looking bright.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-peak-times">Peak Times</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1954179027834474694" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post</a> on social media, EA’s Battlefield Comms team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is Battlefield’s biggest Open Beta ever. </p>



<p>Peak time is approaching and queues will be expected. We’re working on entry times to the game, but appreciate your patience as you wait for your time to arrive. </p>



<p>We want everyone to experience a smooth and fair Open Beta, including those currently within the game too. </p>



<p>Thank you for your continued excitement for Battlefield 6’s Open Beta!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Even issues with Battlefield 6’s first cheaters haven’t hampered the fun too much. The Javelin anti-cheat engine is doing a great job at nipping that in the bud, with almost half a million attempts at cheating being caught by the system. <span>Some will inevitably</span> get through, but after many hours in the beta, I’m happy to say I’ve seen no suspicious behaviour.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is set to drop on October 10, which could be mere weeks before the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The performance of the beta has given fans a renewed sense of adoration for the series, and there’s now a hope that this will be the year that Battlefield batters Call of Duty in the leaderboard stakes.</p>



<p>Have you jumped into the Battlefield 6 beta yet? Let me know what you think on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
