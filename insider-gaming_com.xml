<p>The Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) marketing train is getting ready to get into full gear. </p>



<p>As part of the company’s <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">quarterly earnings report</a> on Tuesday, Take-Two Interactive confirmed that marketing for GTA 6 will begin this summer. </p>







<p>On top of that, CEO Strauss Zelnick address concerns about a lack of a physical version of the game when it launches in the fall. </p>



<p>In speaking with Variety, Zelnick was asked about the claims that Take-Two Interactive was going to withhold from a physical release of GTA 6 until 2027 in order to prevent leaks before launch. To that notion, Zelnick bluntly said that it was<strong> “not the plan”.</strong></p>







<p>GTA 6 is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 on November 19, 2026. Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-release-date-earnings-call/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaffirmed the release date</a> as part of the same earnings report. </p>
