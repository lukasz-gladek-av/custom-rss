<p>Recently, a trailer surfaced on YouTube for a new Satisfye product called the Zengrip 2, a case for the Nintendo Switch 2 — or whatever it’s going to be called. The trailer was quickly deleted, but not before eagle-eyed users snapped shots of the footage, which showcased what could be the first look at a finished Switch 2.</p>



<p>It’s highly likely it’s a shot of a mock-up produced by Satisfye based on leaks and Nintendo-provided dimensions, but it <strong>could </strong>also be our first look at Nintendo’s upcoming console.</p>

<h2 id="h-bait-and-switch-2">Bait and Switch (2)</h2>



<p>The assumed leak was spotted on Twitter by ‘DP19’, who captured a grainy image of the trailer before it was taken down by Satisfye:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Other users then followed up with successive shots of the same video <a href="https://x.com/nRAYm2002/status/1866295996785074518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">that were a little clearer</a>. Presently, the driving notion behind this being a real Switch 2 is that the ‘Joycons’ featured in the trailer have ‘the extra button’ that’s sitting front and centre on leaked designs.</p>



<p>Even if it is the Switch 2, it’s almost too blurry to make out any major details. Many have quipped that it ‘looks like a Switch’, which is fairly obvious. It was never expected that Nintendo would make any great or innovative strides when piecing together the next generation of the popular handheld console.</p>



<p>Do you think the Switch 2 leak is to be believed, or could it be a marketing ploy by Satisfye? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The FTC has announced that the ‘first wave’ of refunds resulting from a $245 million fine to Epic Games <span>is being distributed&nbsp;<strong>now</strong>. In March 2023, Epic Games was ordered to pay back players ‘duped’ into spending money by mistake, and the first round of refunds—totalling $72 million—has</span> started being handed out.</p>



<p>When the dust had settled in the FTC vs. Fortnite case, the gaming titan was found to have been promoting a ‘counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration’ that subsequently led to millions of players making purchases they didn’t want.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-are-you-owed-a-fortnite-refund">Are You Owed a Fortnite Refund?</h2>



<p>In recent years, the United States Federal Trade Commission has been hot on these tactics, which typically involve ‘clever placement’ of buttons and prompts to encourage users to buy things in digital stores without them necessarily meaning to.</p>



<p>The FTC claimed that Epic Games was knowingly allowing children to ‘rack up unauthorised charges without any parental involvement’. It’s not the first company to adopt these tactics, nor will it be the last, but it’s one of the firms hit the hardest by legal action pursued by the Federal Trade Commission.</p>



<p>By way of a resolution, Epic Games agreed to discontinue the use of these shady tactics, and it noted that it would put in place a prompt requesting consent from the consumer before making any purchase. </p>



<p>Next week, 629,344 customers will be refunded an average of $114 – and this is just the first stop of the refund train.</p>
