<p>Co-operative gameplay and teamwork are emphasized in Little Nightmares 3. You have two characters to escort to safety after all. Considering the previous entry neglected any form of two-player integration, it’s natural to wonder if Little Nightmares 3 includes co-op or multiplayer, and we have the answer.</p>



<p>One of the biggest differences between the first Little Nightmares and its successor is the characters. Little Nightmares 1 was a story around a small child called Six. Little Nightmares 2 went one step further and gave Six a co-op pal—Mono. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-release-platforms-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>, both are out, and in come Low and Alone for a new torturous tale.</p>



<p>With Supermassive Games running the ship, things are changing for the threequel. That being said, let’s find out if co-op, multiplayer, or something in between debuts.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-little-nightmares-3-in-online-co-op">Can You Play Little Nightmares 3 in Online Co-op?</h2>

<p><strong>Little Nightmares 3 introduces online co-op for the first time and allows you to unravel the unknown with another human player.</strong></p>



<p>Adding a second main character in Little Nightmares 2 hinted at this possible new direction. Co-op seemed to be an inevitable inclusion if <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a> also had a second protagonist to control. This had turned out to be the case, and both Low and Alone can be controlled by two different players.</p>



<p>You need an online connection, and someone else with a copy of the game, but the opportunity for online co-op is there.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-little-nightmares-3-have-local-co-op">Does Little Nightmares 3 Have Local Co-op?</h2>



<p><strong>Little Nightmares 3 does not feature local co-op in any way and it’s one of the more baffling omissions from the horror title.</strong></p>



<p>A 2023 interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/little-nightmares-3-preview-hands-off-gamescom-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamesradar</a> explained the studio’s decision to go against local co-op. Game director Wayne Garland said: “Couch [co-op] is something that we considered, but again, when you come back to the atmosphere and the immersion that we’re trying to elicit through Little Nightmares, I think it was important for us that we stuck to our online co-op only rather than traditional more party aspects.”</p>



<p>There you have it. Supermassive Games wants co-op, but still wants you to feel like you’re on your own. It’s an immersion thing, although I still feel it’s not quite enough justification as I’d love to play it in local co-op. This might just be me though! Who knows, it might get added as a feature well after release. We’ll have to see.</p>



<hr>



<p>I don’t think I even need to ask if you’re disappointed about a lack of local co-op. With so many titles advocating the concept, it seems baffling to omit it from Little Nightmares 3 altogether. Are you hoping it’s added later on as part of an update? Let us know.</p>

<p>Lumiose City is the home of Pokémon Legends Z-A and the successor to Legends Arceus. The release window is out in the tall grass, and the Pokémon Legends entry could pose stern competition to its contemporaries.</p>



<p>There was a year between <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-releasing-worldwide-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A’s announcement</a> at the 2024 Pokémon Presents showcase and the first full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-gets-release-window-extended-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer</a> at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 edition of Pokémon Presents</a>. It may have taken a while, but the wait was worth it, and we’re beholden to The Pokémon Company for revealing the scope of Lumiose City.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A looks to have taken feedback regarding Legends Arceus, so let’s see how long we’ve got to wait until we get our hands on it.</p>

<p><strong>Pokémon Legends Z-A is scheduled to release in Late 2025—but it doesn’t have a concrete launch date for now.</strong></p>



<p>The Pokémon Presents presentation on February 27 is where we learned about the title’s release window. The word “late” is vague, but it might not be hard to decipher if we consider previous Pokémon titles. Scarlet and Violet, Sword and Shield, Sun and Moon, and the Pokémon Brilliant Diamond&nbsp;and&nbsp;Shining Pearl remakes all came out in November of their respective years.</p>



<p>Yes, Pokémon Legends Arceus released in January 2022. But we’ve not had a new game for a while, so a <strong>November 2025</strong> is a likely release window for <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-legends-z-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>.</p>







<p><strong>Pokémon Legends Z-A is a Nintendo exclusive, meaning the only way you can play Legends Z-A is either through a Nintendo Switch—or the Switch 2 if the console is available at the time.</strong></p>



<p>Sadly, Pokémon games don’t release on formats other than Nintendo hardware or mobile. Despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-xbox-exclusive-games-coming-to-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation and Xbox’s escalating partnership</a>, don’t expect to see <strong>Pokémon Legends Z-A</strong> on another console. </p>







<p><strong>Pokémon Legends Z-A is still only advertised as a wishlist item, but with this being Nintendo, expect Pokémon Legends Z-A to cost $59.99 or £49.99.</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo notoriously doesn’t discount games easily. It also launches all new AAA titles at full price. It’s almost a lock Legends Z-A will cost $59.99 or £49.99. You’d better save up your <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-will-discontinue-my-nintendo-gold-points-in-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Gold Points</a> before they’re discontinued.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s going to take some beating for Pokémon Legends Z-A to overtake Legends Arceus. What are your impressions of Pokémon Legends Z-A so far? Will the Switch’s technical performance hinder the title’s chances of being more Legendary than any Kanto birds could dream of?</p>
