<p>Battlefield 6 developers have already made changes to the Rush mode, which was introduced during the second Open Beta weekend. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s Open Beta weekend 2 is now live, and it has instantly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-huge-player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought in a vast number of players</a>. Many players must be looking forward to the weekend, as they will have two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-gets-new-map-and-modes-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new modes and a new map</a> to try out. However, one of the modes released this weekend, Rush, has already received a fix from BF6 developers. </p>







<p>The latest post from Battlefield Comms on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956355268972867585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) states that new balancing changes have been made to Breakthrough and Rush. The defender respawn timers in both Breakthrough and Rush have been fixed to 12 seconds; previously, they were set within the 6-12 second range. Also, in Breakthrough, fewer players are needed to capture an objective. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Balance Changes to Breakthrough and Rush</p><p>We’ve just made some balancing changes: In Breakthrough, it now takes fewer players on an objective to speed up capture.

<p>A couple of hours ago, the Battlefield Comms account posted another update for Battlefield 6’s Rush mode. The Rush mode’s MCOM timer was reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to improve the balance between attacking and defending players. The developers will continue to monitor the game mode and make further balancing adjustments as needed. </p>

<p>Since open beta weekend 2 began, several players have raised concerns about Battlefield 6’s Rush Mode. Popular Battlefield content creator, Westie, has been voicing their opinions about BF6’s Rush mode on <a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1955978800648319332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>. According to them, there are massive balancing problems across each map, and there is no space between MCOM locations. Players on the r/Battlefield subreddit also have issues with the game mode being locked to 12v12 games. </p>



<p>The new timer changes do help, but players are asking for more balancing improvements for BF6’s Rush mode, including adding “<a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1956262080064921803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sufficient space</a>“, among other things. However, players should keep in mind that Battlefield 6 is still in beta, and the beta was intended to identify problems like these, which could be addressed before the full launch. </p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield and Call of Duty ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-and-call-of-duty-complement-each-other-says-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complement each other</a>‘, according to BF6 developers. Additionally, many Battlefield 6 players have experienced issues with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-dlss-dlaa-not-working-issue-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLSS and DLAA</a>.

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won’t be landing on Nintendo Switch 2 at launch, though that doesn’t mean the door is closed to the platform permanently, according to a new report.</p>



<p>Set to be officially revealed at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live, Black Ops 7 will launch in November, once again part of the Xbox Game Pass catalog, but Nintendo Switch 2 players will miss out initially.</p>



<p>Though the improved performance of the Switch 2 has opened the door for releases on the platform for the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws, Black Ops 7 won’t be joining them in November.</p>



<h2 id="h-unclear-whether-activision-plans-black-ops-7-on-switch-2-in-future">Unclear Whether Activision Plans Black Ops 7 on Switch 2 in Future</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No arrival yet. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/non-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ne-sera-pas-disponible-sur-la-nintendo-switch-2-a-sa-sortie-60383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a> confirms that Black Ops 7 will not arrive on Switch 2 when it launches in November, instead landing on PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Crucially, though, the report says it’s “unclear whether Activision plans a future port” to Switch 2 in the future, so it’s not known yet whether the door has been closed entirely for Switch 2. Earlier this year, Activision told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-its-working-with-nintendo-to-get-call-of-duty-on-switch-but-will-black-ops-7-be-on-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> they were “committed to getting the franchise on Switch.”</p>



<p>Nintendo has not had a Call of Duty game on its platform since the release of Call of Duty: Ghosts on the Wii U in 2013, and, if that barren run is to come to an end with Black Ops 7, players will have to wait a while longer after the release date.</p>



<p>Should Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 come to Nintendo Switch 2 in the future? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3312/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest weekend in the Pokémon calendar is here with the World Championships 2025 taking place in Anaheim, which of course means a closing ceremony that could bring plenty of news. Here are all the details.</p>



<p>Pokémon is set for a big year in the next 12 months with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> edging ever closer and 2026 marking the franchise’s 30th anniversary, which is expected to include the long-awaited release of Generation 10. Could we see some news and hints in Anaheim?</p>



<p>Whatever Pokémon has up its sleeves to showcase at the closing ceremony, you don’t want to miss it, so here’s everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-pokemon-world-championships-2025-closing-ceremony">When is the Pokémon World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony?</h2>

<p><strong>The Pokémon</strong> <strong>World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony takes place on Sunday, August 17. As the name implies, it brings the event in Anaheim to a close.</strong></p>



<p>Action in Anaheim for the Pokémon World Championships 2025 begins on Friday, marking the start of three days of action from the TCG, VGC, and everything else in between.</p>



<p>The closing ceremony in previous events has featured news about upcoming titles and releases, so it should not be missed by fans.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-is-the-pokemon-world-championships-2025-closing-ceremony">What Time is the Pokémon World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony?</h2>



<p><strong>The Pokémon</strong> <strong>World Championships Closing Ceremony begins at 7:00 pm PDT, meaning a late night for anyone on the east coast of the United States or elsewhere in the world.</strong></p>



<p>It is expected to begin bang on schedule, though it could be delayed if any of the finals earlier in the day run longer than planned. </p>



<p>Here’s an easier way to see the start times for the closing ceremony in your timezone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">19:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">21:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">22:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">03:00 (Aug. 18)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)</td><td data-align="center">12:00 (Aug. 18)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p><strong>The Closing Ceremony at the Pokémon</strong> <strong>World Championships 2025 will be broadcast live online through multiple platforms, including directly on the Pokémon</strong> <strong>website, on Twitch, and on YouTube.</strong></p>



<p>In our experience, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> is the best place to watch as the streams are slightly ahead of other platforms, so tune in here if you don’t want to see any spoilers. All the big announcements will also be shared on social media.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-the-pokemon-world-championships-2025-closing-ceremony">What to Expect From The Pokémon World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony</h2>



<p><strong>Previous announcements at the Pokémon World Championships Closing Ceremony</strong> <strong>have included details for upcoming releases across games and the physical TCG, as well as news on future World Championship events.</strong></p>



<p>The Closing Ceremony almost always announces the location of the following World Championships, though there will be no such reveal for 2026 as we already know the World Championships are heading to San Francisco next year. That announcement was made in Honolulu last year.</p>



<p>We could see more reveals for the Pokémon TCG, with last year revealing the return of Trainer’s Pokémon to the game, but all eyes will be cast towards Pokémon Legends: Z-A news. After the reveal of Mega Dragonite in the recent Pokémon Presents showcase, could we get another reveal?</p>



<p>The Closing Ceremony could also bring news of upcoming updates to existing live-service titles like Pokémon TCG Pocket, Pokémon Cafe Remix, and Pokémon EX Masters. Crucially, we could see more details of Pokémon Champions, which is set to be the formula used for future VGC events.</p>



<p>Pokémon does like to keep surprises up its sleeve, however, so it’s difficult to predict exactly what will be shown off.</p>
