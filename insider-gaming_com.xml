<p>Activision <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-new-maps-modes-updates-announcement#season-01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has confirmed</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 will begin on November 14, and, with it, comes what it calls a “massive content drop”.</p>



<p>According to the publisher, the start of Black Ops 6 Season 1 will add a “colossal amount of free content like all-new Multiplayer maps and modes, a terrifying new in-season Zombies map, as well as the introduction of Omnimovement and&nbsp;Black Ops 6&nbsp;weapons and Loadout features to&nbsp;Call of Duty: Warzone!”</p>







<p>The confirmation of the start of the first season comes after the date was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently leaked thanks to Little Caesars pizza</a> promo. </p>



<p>As far as what Black Ops 6 Season 1 will include, full details will come shortly before it’s start date. When it comes, Activision says it will break down “all the new maps, modes, weapons, features, and more across Multiplayer, Zombies, and&nbsp;Call of Duty: Warzone.”</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-gets-second-update/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Gets Second Update</a></h6>



<p>Aside from Season 1’s start date, Activision announced the return of the Infected game mode that is available for all players along with confirming, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nuketown-black-ops-6-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">again</a>, that Nuketown will launch on November 1.</p>



<p>“Built by Veteran Treyarch Map designer Adam Hoggatt and released as part of&nbsp;Call of Duty: Black Ops&nbsp;in November 2010, this remaster remains extremely faithful to the original design and layout of the map, even down to the precise placement of parked vehicles and other scenery harking back to the original three-lane design,” Activision said. </p>



<p>“This is Nuketown in its most original form, with a bright and bleached desert landscape, and even a double rainbow to gaze at, taking you all the way back to where it all began.”</p>



<p>What do you think Season 1 will include? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/call-of-duty.12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>Team Quadrant, a UK-based esports organisation founded by Formula One driver Lando Norris, has announced a sudden withdrawal from the Halo Championship Series and, by extension, the esports industry in general. This news comes mere days after Quadrant finished in seventh place at the Halo World Championship in Seattle, Washington.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-quick-comedown">Quick Comedown</h2>



<p>In January 2024, Quadrant announced a massive seven-figure investment round and partnerships with some sizeable content creators. In 2023, the organisation was able to secure a streak of positive financial updates following strong collaborations and apparel sales, and it was soaring in the esports space.</p>



<p>That quickly soured, though.</p>



<p>On October 1, it was reported that Quadrant had ‘slumped into the red’ after reporting negative total equity in a company filing. Now, the organisation has reported a complete withdrawal from the esports industry to instead focus on creative content, fashion, and motorsport culture, leaning still on Lando Norris for brand recognition.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As of today, Quadrant announces that we are departing the Halo Championship Series and wider direct involvement in esports to continue with full focus on our exciting mission of being a brand rooted at the intersection of motorsport culture, fashion, and creative content.</p>



<p>We are deeply proud of whwat we have achieved during our time in esports and would like to share a special thank you to our HCS players, 343 Industries <em>(now Halo Studios)</em>, and Microsoft for theiur devotion and commitment to the game we love – we wish you the best moving forward.</p>



<p>To our fans, we thank you for your incredible and unwavering support. You have been a constant and passionate reminder of why we wntered into this space in the first place, and we hope we have given you as many memories as you have provided us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is the second UK-based esports organisation to suffer on a financial front of late. Recently, Guild Esports, which is represented by David Beckham as a brand ambassador, was acquired in full by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/guild-esports-acquired-by-dcb-sports-for-just-130000/">a US-based firm for just $130,000</a>.</p>



<p>In recent months, the UK has also withered in the gaming space as two of the region’s biggest gaming and esports events disappeared into nothing.</p>
