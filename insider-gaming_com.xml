<p>A new trademark has been filed for the upcoming open-world game mode set to launch with EA FC 27. </p>



<p>The discussions, leaks, and rumours about EA Sports introducing an open world with their upcoming title have been circulating for months now. Back in November 2025, we even saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-ea-fc-open-world-gameplay-has-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay leaks</a> for this mode, with the open world looking pretty similar to NBA 2K’s. Now, the developers have trademarked the name for this mode. </p>







<h2 id="h-ea-fc-27-s-open-world-mode-trademark-surfaces-online">EA FC 27’s Open World Mode Trademark Surfaces Online</h2>



<p>Spotted by Matheus Gamer on <a href="https://x.com/gamer_matheusx/status/2015964505176441211" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) via <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/ea-sports-trademarks-name-for-ea-fc-27s-open-world-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FGZ</a>, EA Sports FC registered the name ‘FC The Grounds’ for their open-world game mode on January 23, 2026. The website, <a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/996/11/fc-the-99611789.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Justia Trademarks</a>, features a description for this patent, which states the following: “The mark consists of the stylized letters’ FC’ set in a triangular shape tilted on an angle, with a small triangle at the left corner and the words’ THE GROUNDS’ in stylized letters.” </p>



<p>For those unaware, an <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/exclusive-ea-fcs-planned-open-world-release-window-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive report</a> from FGZ confirmed that EA Sports will introduce its highly anticipated open-world mode in EA FC 27. The new game mode will feature explorable areas known as Districts, each inspired by a prominent footballing nation. Since most EA FC titles are released in September, players can anticipate the next title around that time. Hopefully, an official announcement regarding the new mode should arrive before the release date.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Trophy Display Project Guide—All Requirements & Rewards, Explained]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Headwinds update for ARC Raiders is here, and perhaps the star of the show is the new Project, the Trophy Display. Similar to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-flickering-flames-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flickering Flames Project</a> that arrived with the Cold Snap update, it has five stages for you to complete, and if you couldn’t tell by the title, you’ll be hunting a lot of ARC.</p>



<p>It’s not all for glory, though, as there are some genuinely exciting rewards up for grabs this time around. However, it won’t come easily, as it’ll have you pitted up against a whole variety of ARCs; from small Ticks to feisty Leapers, you’ll need to keep your wits about you.</p>







<p>If you don’t want to waste any time and make your raids efficient, then you’re in the right place. Follow this guide to see every requirement and reward tied to the Trophy Display Project in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-arc-raiders-meta-guns-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, along with how long you have to complete it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-the-arc-raiders-trophy-display-project">How To Complete The ARC Raiders Trophy Display Project</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It starts off simple enough. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five stages to the Trophy Display Project in ARC Raiders, with each one having four requirements to fulfil. </strong></p>



<p>Frustratingly, you cannot cycle through the stages to see what you’ll need down the line, and since the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-release-date-times-confirmed-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headwinds update</a> is so fresh, only the first stage of the Project is visible. However, as more and more of the Trophy Display Project is unveiled, Insider Gaming will be sure to update the guide with the next stages.</p>



<p>For now, though, here’s every known stage of the Trophy Display Project, including the requirements as well as the rewards:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Project Stage</th><th data-align="center">Project Requirements</th><th data-align="center">Project Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 1: Roaming Threats</td><td data-align="center">– 3 Rusted Bolts<br>– 15 Pop Triggers<br>– 15 Tick Pods<br>– 5 Surveyor Vaults</td><td data-align="center">– 10 Mod Components<br>– 3 Power Rods<br>– 10 Raider Tokens<br>– 1 Light Gun Parts Blueprint</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Project Completion</td><td data-align="center">Complete all 5 Stages</td><td data-align="center">– Howl Emote<br>– 1 Legendary Jupiter Sniper Rifle<br>– 1 Acoustic Guitar<br>– 5 Energy Clips<br>– 300,000 Coins</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>There’s an incredible incentive to complete the project, with the likes of 300,000 Coins and a Jupiter Sniper Rifle up for grabs—and that’s not including the Blueprints and Raider Tokens along the way! It’s undeniably an exciting Project, but do you need to rush through it to claim the rewards before time runs out?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-end">When Does The ARC Raiders Trophy Display Project End?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You won’t want to miss these rewards. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, there is no expiry date on the Trophy Display Project in ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>That means you can take as long as you’d like to grind through the Project and earn the rewards, and it’s a welcome change when compared to the rush that was the Flickering Flames Project. Embark Studios also confirmed that progress will not be reset between Expedition resets, so there’s no risk heading out on the next departure if you’re only halfway through the Project.</p>







<p>That doesn’t mean that an end date won’t be added to the Project in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future</a>, though. It could be months away yet, but it might be best not to leave it too late, especially as it seems like there’s a solid grind on the cards here. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch Online Leak Hurts Hope of Metroid Prime 2 Remaster]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Walmart has leaked two titles coming to the Nintendo Switch Online service, including the addition of Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, damaging hopes that a remake was in the works.</p>



<p>Fans have been clamouring for a remake of Metroid Prime 2 ever since the release of the original Metroid Prime remaster in 2023, with many speculating the absence of the second title on the Nintendo Switch Online service was due to the game being set to receive similar treatment.</p>







<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-2-amp-pikmin-2-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online">Metroid Prime 2 &amp; Pikmin 2 Coming to Nintendo Switch Online</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Leaked. Image via Walmart</figcaption></figure>



<p>An image on the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/brand/nintendo/10030719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Walmart website</a> advertising the Nintendo Switch Online subscription showcases several of the major games available in the service, though two of those have not been officially revealed.</p>



<p>The image shows that Pikmin 2 and Metroid Prime 2 are due to be added to the service, and with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors of a Nintendo Direct being showcased next week</a>, official confirmation could be on the horizon.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 2 would join the slew of titles from the franchise available in the service, though Metroid Prime itself is not available, with those who want to play the title instead having to splash out on the remaster.</p>



<p>Given that Nintendo would be highly unlikely to release a classic version of Metroid Prime 2 into the Nintendo Switch Online catalog if a remake of the title was planned, the news means that, at the very least, a remaster is still a way off, if it’s even in the pipeline at all.</p>
