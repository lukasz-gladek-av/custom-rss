<p>Eidos-Montreal wants to bring back Deus Ex, and it’s been looking for ways to do so. </p>



<p>While working on details regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-another-embracer-studio-suffers-large-scale-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent layoffs</a> at the Montreal, Quebec-based studio, it was learned that the company had been actively pitching to external partners and publishers a new Deus Ex game.</p>



<p>According to multiple sources close to the studio’s plans, Eidos-Montreal was pitching the new game regularly, but it hasn’t led to any commitments from publishers. </p>



<p>One source said that there was a belief from a couple possible partners that the series was “too niche” at this stage. Another said that it became clear after a few meetings that publishers aren’t willing to take on the financial risk that comes with the Deus Ex franchise at the moment.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Not much is known about the details behind this new Deus Ex game being pursued. However, it was said that the concept for the game had “charm and novelty”, but that it didn’t match up with the “expectations or standards typically associated with the Deus Ex brand”.</p>



<p>To make it clear, this game, sources say, is different from the one that had been in development for two years <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-cancels-deus-ex-game-lays-off-eidos-montreal-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before Embracer canceled</a> it in early 2024 as part of the parent company’s restructuring efforts. It was also said that the lack of agreement for the pitched game had nothing to do with the layoffs. Insider Gaming is working on more information surrounding what led to 75 people losing their jobs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Eidos-Montreal ahead of publishing this story. As of publishing, however, no response has been received. Should one come in, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>Call of Duty Warzone in 2025 has Verdansk, and the world is a better place for it. The best Meta Loadout in Warzone is the perfect combination of firepower, precision, and fun, and we’ve got it.</p>



<p>Warzone is partying like it’s 2020 again with the reintroduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/with-verdansk-return-call-of-dutys-player-count-jumps-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a>. Players wanted it for years, the community pleaded, and Activision listened. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-season-03-patch-notes-warzone-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 and Warzone 2 Season 3</a> brought back the nuked and nullified map. Veterans are hopping back in, and newbies are jumping into the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-warzone-casual-in-call-of-duty-battle-royale-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Mode</a> before getting the itch for full-scale, human-focused battle royale.</p>



<p>You need the right loadout once you’re ready for Normal and Ranked Warzone in Verdansk. I’m here to drop you our ultimate loadout. Forget multiple variations or options, as this is the best Warzone Meta loadout that should serve you well.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Tried and trusted. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>We think the CR-56 AMAX Assault Rifle is unbeatable and the best meta primary weapon to use in Warzone’s Verdansk battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>The AMAX has been a fan-favorite in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/warzone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warzone</a> before, and it’s still the same in 2025. Various trackers of Warzone gun data show the AMAX is the most-used gun and (debatably) the most powerful if you have the perfect loadout.</p>



<p>I know you’re here for it, so this is the optimal Warzone CR-56 AMAX Assault Rifle Meta Loadout for Verdansk:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Otero Red Dot</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Monolithic Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Gain-Twist Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Vertical Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Extended Mag II</li>
</ul>



<p>You might need to level up a bit to unlock these attachments, but rest assured, it’s worth it!</p>







<figure><figcaption>Good times are here again. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Our secondary weapon of choice is the HDR Sniper Rifle in CoD Warzone.</strong> </p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-hdr-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a> is back, and Sniping feels back, and you can one-shot-down players if you’re accurate. The HDR has incredible range, damage, and mobility, and it gives you an option at longer distances. While you can go with something smaller and nimble to assist the AMAX, we feel the AMAX is perfectly viable at close and mid-range.</p>



<p>We want a long-range option, and a one-shot gun at any distance is a no-brainer, so here’s the best loadout:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Monolithic Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Gain-Twist Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Combat Stock</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong> Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods:</strong> 108MM Suppressed</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>We’ve gone with the Survivor, Quick Fix, and Ghost Perks for our best Warzone Verdansk Meta Loadout.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick list showing our selections:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong> Survivor</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong> Quick Fix</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong> Ghost</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Survivor </strong>regenerates health quickly, and you revive allies faster. We think this is necessary for either solo or team-based play. We also need ways to survive and tank enemy damage, so Survivor gets the vote here.</p>



<p>For Perk 2, <strong>Quick Fix</strong> gets the nod, and it wasn’t a hard choice. This is another Perk based around health regeneration. Plus, it comes with the huge benefit of <strong>plating up with one hand</strong>—freeing you up.</p>



<p>Finally, the third slot goes to <strong>Ghost</strong>. It’s not quite as powerful as it was in the original Verdansk days, but we need it. As long as you’re on the move, you can’t be detected by UAVs or radar ping technology. Anything keeping us covert is fine by us.</p>







<p><strong><strong>Overkill is our Wildcard pick to equip a primary and secondary weapon.</strong></strong></p>



<p>The only other realistic contender is Gunfighter, but that’s being considerate to its feelings. If we’re being a cold-hearted killer like we want to be in Warzone, go with Overkill.</p>

<p>A new report has revealed that Nintendo has acquired a third anti-Palworld patent, and a fourth one is almost about to be granted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/nintendo-secures-two-more-anti-palworld-u-s-patents-might-file-multi-patent-u-s-lawsuit-against-pocketpair-in-a-matter-of-months-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesFray</a>, Nintendo now has three anti-Palworld patents—the first two mentioned in an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier report</a>. The latest one, 12,246,255, was granted on March 11, 2025. It concerns smooth switching between flying and land traversal objects. Also, Nintendo’s request to interview the patent examiner was approved, and it seems a fourth patent will be granted soon.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-nintendo-s-anti-palworld-patents-mean-for-pocketpair">What do Nintendo’s Anti-Palworld Patents Mean for Pocketpair</h2>



<p>Nintendo will soon have four anti-Palworld patents in the United States, which could mean a lawsuit could be filed against Pocketpair soon. The latest approved patent was initially filled in September 2022, but Nintendo has made amendments to it over the years, even after Palworld’s launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo’s interview with the USPTO examiner was successful. Out of the 23 patent claims, Nintendo has been able to add additional requirements to independent and dependent claims. It has dropped two claims and made limited changes to a claim. Moreover, Nintendo and the Pokemon Company have added a 24th claim, which talks about interacting with a character that a player either battles with or captures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GamesFray believes it is “fairly likely” that Nintendo and The Pokemon Company will file a patent infringement complaint in the US. However, it is not certain, and depending on how things go in Japan, there’s always a chance that the lawsuit will never come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pocketpair’s CEO came ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-ceo-under-attack-japan-pocketpair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under attack in Japan</a> every day’ when Palworld was released. Also, the game could be released on the Switch 2 if the console is ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-on-switch-2-is-a-possibility-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beefy enough</a>’. What are your thoughts on Nintendo acquiring more anti-Palworld patents?
