<p>Nvidia is gearing up to announce its next-gen GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards, and with it will come the next era of Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). According to a leaked store listing, Nvidia DLSS 4 is set to release alongside the new GPUs.</p>



<p>Spotted on social media by <a href="https://x.com/GawroskiT/status/1874834447046168734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tomasz Gawroński</a>, a European listing for an Asus RTX 5080 card retailing for €1,699.95 mentions the previously leaked GDDR7 VRAM along with “DLSS4”. While many assumed that the image was fake, noted hardware leaker <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/1875039748122878433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kopite7kimi</a> confirmed that DLSS 4 was accurate.</p>



<p>No other details about DLSS 4 were provided. Features along with compatibility for last-gen RTX 40 Series cards should be announced when it’s officially revealed.</p>



<p>Nvidia is scheduled to announce the first RTX 50 Series graphics cards at CES 2025. CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote presentation on January 6 at 930pm ET/ 630pm PT. </p>



<p>You can check out the rumored specs for the first three cards in the next-gen lineup below. It’s worth noting that until details are official, the specs should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>The Falcons organization officially announced the signing of Bosnian Counter-Strike superstar Nikola “⁠NiKo⁠” Kovač today, successfully bringing on the star that once rebuked them. The first significant domino to fall during the latest post-CS2 Major transfer window has fallen. </p>



<p>The plethora of resources available to the Saudi organization have finally led to the star they’ve always wanted, and the move has drastically altered the competitive CS2 landscape.</p>



<h2 id="h-second-time-s-the-charm">Second Time’s The Charm</h2>



<p>This is Falcons’ second time going after NiKo, having spent most of 2023 pursuing one of Counter-Strike’s greatest riflers. Though at the end of 2023, NiKo pivoted and chose to remain with G2 Esports for the 2024 season. G2 and NiKo fell just short of winning the Major that still eludes them, but the 2024 campaign was still a successful one. Russian AWP prodigy Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blossomed into one of the best players in the world</a>, and G2 capitalized on the signing of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-to-watch-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guatemalan sensation Mario “malbsMd” Samayoa</a>. G2 lifted trophies at IEM Dallas, the BLAST Fall Final, and the BLAST World Final in 2024.</p>



<p>Despite the presence of the legendary Emil “Magisk” Reif, Peter “dupreeh” Rasmussen, and coach Danny “zonic” Sørensen, it was a turbulent and forgettable 2024 season for Falcons. The roster struggled throughout the year, even with Oleksandr “⁠s1mple⁠” Kostyliev playing with them on loan. The nail in the coffin was failing to qualify for the Perfect World Shanghai Major, prompting Falcons to discontinue s1mple’s loan and bench everyone not named Magisk.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Falcons are <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40627/sources-falcons-in-talks-over-heroic-trio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly considering</a> the trio of Damjan “⁠kyxsan⁠” Stoilkovski, René “⁠TeSeS⁠” Madsen and Abdul “⁠degster⁠” Gasanov, who all currently play for Danish organization Heroic. But this is the result of another instance in which Falcons have been denied the player they really want, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g2-will-reportedly-keep-cs2-superstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G2 has reportedly closed off talks for previously mentioned m0NESY</a>.</p>



<p>With the big NiKo domino now fallen, and the post-Major break ending in less than two weeks, many more new signings and transfers are expected over the next few days. </p>
