<p>The community has had an explosive time with Battlefield 6 Season 1, but the time will come for it to make way for Season 2. Read on for full details about Battlefield 6 Season 2’s start date, times, and more.</p>



<p>Even though <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>‘s player base has dropped quite dramatically since launch, you better believe there are still thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of players going into battle across <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation/" id="81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" id="131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/pc/" id="4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>. Battlefield 6 Season 1 dropped a decent amount of content, but Season 2 is creeping over no man’s land toward us.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Time to evac. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 Season 1 finally comes to an end on February 17</strong>.</p>



<p>This means you’ll have experienced four months of Season 1. Technically, it doesn’t mean you’ve been bereft of content for four months, as EA has slowly dripfed live-service content through mini-releases: Rogue Ops, California Resistance, Winter Offensive, and even the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-battlefield-6-season-1-january-27-bonus-content-frostfire-bonus-path-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 27 Frostfire Bonus Path content</a>.</p>



<p>The original end date was actually supposed to be January 21, but an unexpected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay</a> struck.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-battlefield-6-season-2-start">When Does Battlefield 6 Season 2 Start?</h2>



<p><strong>You can look forward to Battlefield 6 Season 2 starting on February 17, the same time that Season 1 ends.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re a regular live-service player, you get the gist of the transition between seasons. One season ends, another begins right away. Season 1 comes to a close on February 17, and Season 2 picks up where its predecessor left off.</p>



<p>We’ve already started to learn about S2 aspects as well, such as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-battlefield-6-map-leaked-ahead-of-season-2-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Battlefield 6 map leaking ahead of the S2 reveal</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-2-start-date-amp-times">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Start Date &amp; Times</h2>



<p><strong>Season 2 is expected to begin on February at 8 AM PT, with the start time varying in other regions.</strong></p>



<p>If you have a hard time understanding time zones, or just want a quick reference about the season’s start time and date, this table has everything you need below.</p>



<p>It includes time zones across America, Europe, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Phasmophobia devs have revealed a new roadmap for 2026 as they work towards the 1.0 update. </p>



<p>Phasmophobia developers, Kinetic Games, made an announcement earlier this month; however, it wasn’t related to the game. Instead, it was revealed that they are launching a new publishing label, <span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phasmophobia-dev-launches-game-publishing-label/" target="_blank">Kinetic Publishing</a>, which</span> will&nbsp;collaborate with small teams and individual developers worldwide. </p>







<h2 id="h-phasmophobia-will-get-new-major-updates-new-map-amp-reworks-and-events-in-2026">Phasmophobia Will Get New Major Updates, New Map &amp; Reworks, and Events in 2026</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to the new <a href="https://kineticgames.co.uk/news/phasmophobias-roadmap-for-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the developers of Phasmophobia are planning significant updates throughout 2026, categorized into three sections: major updates, maps, and events.</p>



<p>Players can expect major updates, including a complete overhaul of their character, reworked horror elements, a lore update for Phasmophobia 1.0, the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, and the Unity 6 and Netcode update.</p>



<p>Regarding maps, the developers will initially focus on updating older maps to meet current standards. The first of these will be an improved version of Tanglewood Drive, followed by Willow Street, which is set to be released in 2026. Additionally, a new map will be introduced this year, featuring a fresh style of location for the game.</p>



<p>In 2026, the popular in-game community events will return, featuring Cursed Hollow, Crimson Eye, and Winter’s Jest at approximately the same times as before. Furthermore, the team is developing a new limited-time event, with details to be announced at a later date.</p>



<p>In other news, check out Highguard’s roadmap, which reveals an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-roadmap-reveals-year-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entire year’s worth of content plans</a>. Additionally, the ARC Raiders roadmap <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-four-months-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contains four months of content</a>, including new events, maps, ARC enemies, and more. </p>
