<p>With less than a week until its launch, the Battlefield 6 Season 1 trailer has been released, previewing what’s to come for players. </p>



<p>The trailer, which you can watch below, gives players a first look at the new Blackwell Fields map along with the Strikepoint game mode.</p>



<p><strong>“Season 1 rolls out in three phases with new hardware, gadgets, maps, and monthly drops for Portal,”</strong> EA said. <strong>“Blackwell Fields spans besieged facilities and homesteads under a burning horizon, supporting all combat sizes with land and air. Eastwood turns a quiet villa and golf retreat into a frontline, with land vehicles and helicopters in play.”</strong></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 Season 1 starts with the aforementioned new map and mode, along with three new weapons, a new attachment, and a new vehicle. The new weapons coming to the game are the SOR-300SC rifle, GGH-22 pistol, and the Mini Scout sniper rifle.</p>

<p>Build A Beehive’s October 2025 monthly codes can be used to redeem various rewards in the game, with cash being the most sought-after resource. Read on to find out what the latest Build A Beehive active codes are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Build A Beehive is a popular simulation-based tycoon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-ink-game-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game where the player is in charge of the complete operation of a bee farm. This includes activities like growing plants, attracting and tending to the bees, producing honey, and, in the end, selling the honey that’s been produced for the maximum possible profit. Players begin the game with a tiny plot of land and are tasked with buying some flavors to plant. </p>



<p>These flowers attract different kinds of bees, and maintaining the right balance is of utmost importance. Although simply progressing through the game will give players the resources they need to upgrade both their land as well as their farm, using some Build A Beehive codes to get a small boost will certainly be worth the while.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Redeeming codes in Roblox Build A Beehive is a fairly straightforward process, as the developers do not impose any prerequisite steps on the players. Some Roblox games nowadays require players to complete certain tasks, such as following the game’s socials or joining the official Discord server, before the code redemption feature is unlocked for them. This game, however, has no such steps, and it’s just a matter of inputting one of the codes into the correct text box by navigating through the menus. </p>



<p>For players who may be new to the Roblox ecosystem, here’s a step-by-step guide to redeeming these codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Build A Beehive.</li>



<li>Click the Shop icon on the left side of the screen.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes into the ‘Codes’ text box.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Redeem’ button to claim your rewards.</li>
</ol>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-playstation-xbox-nintendo-console/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-escape-from-duckov-on-playstation-xbox-or-nintendo-switch-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-console-status-explained.1331578/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape From Duckov may sound suspiciously like another game, but it’s very different. It’s why the game has sold like hotcakes, PC players can’t get enough of it, and why its indie status has PlayStation and Xbox owners don’t know if it’s on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>At first glance, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-preview-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape From Duckov</a> sounds like a novelty rip-off movie from the mid-2000s where everyone was trying to do their own Scary Movie imitation. However, at the core of Escape From Duckov is a very competent extraction shooter with a cute and cuddly theme that bolsters its game world, rather than hindering and overshadowing it.</p>



<p>It rightly takes the bill at launch, and we’re going to duck here so we don’t catch any strays from Escape From Tarkov fans. If you want to know if Escape From Duckov is coming to consoles—specifically PlayStation, Xbox, and PC—let’s take a look at what we know.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-escape-from-duckov-on-ps5-or-ps4">Can You Play Escape From Duckov On PS5 Or PS4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t lose sleep or feathers over this. Credit to Team Soda</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As of writing, you can’t play Escape From Duckov on any PlayStation consoles, and this includes the PS4, the PS5, and any of the PlayStation Pro models.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not a matter of consoles being unable to run Escape From Duckov, so you can toss that theory into the pond. Quite simply, Escape From Duckov was coded and developed with PC in mind. First and foremost, it’s a PC title, and it needs to be coded differently for PS4 and PS5 consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-escape-from-duckov-on-xbox-one-or-xbox-series-s-x">Can You Play Escape From Duckov On Xbox One or Xbox Series S|X?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s the same dilemma for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S owners as Escape From Duckov isn’t on any Xbox device, but the possibility of it arriving in the future can’t be ruled out.</strong></p>



<p>If Escape From Duckov is a huge success (which it more than likely will be), it would make complete sense for a console release. This means the extraction shooter flying onto PlayStation, as well as Xbox consoles—maybe on Game Pass?</p>



<p>We’ll have to wait and see.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-escape-from-duckov-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play Escape From Duckov On Nintendo Switch Or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo fans are also down bad for Escape From Duckov as the shooter isn’t available on Nintendo Switch or the Switch 2.</strong></p>



<p>It’s pretty much a case of rinse and repeat for Escape From Duckov on either Nintendo generation. Team Soda’s extraction shooter is probably testing the waters on PC first, and then all console ports could arrive later down the line.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have the latest news on this as and when it happens.</p>



<p>We’ll have the newest details if Escape From Duckov does get a console port right here. Given that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-duckov-sold-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 200,000 copies in 24 Hours</a>, and still continues to smash it, we don’t see why it won’t happen.

<p>Electronic Arts (EA) is seemingly shutting down Call of Duty-inspired Battlefield 6 Portal maps.</p>



<p>At least one instance seems to show a map based on the Call of Duty map Shipment. In what appears to be a warning email from EA, the company says that after reviewing the user’s account, it saw content it deemed <strong>“inappropriate”</strong> due to it referencing <strong>“third party products in Battlefield 6.”</strong></p>



<p>When going into <a href="https://x.com/GhostGamingG/status/1980936800303468657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more details</a>, the warning specifically mentions <strong>“Shipment first test”</strong> that had a description of “Shipment 2019 edition”.</p>



<p>The email goes on to say that the user can still play, but any future violations will have restrictions put on the account, such as “temporarily or permanently” removing access to EA games and services.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out directly to EA and Battlefield Studios for comment on whether they’re removing all references to other games in the Battlefield 6 portal or if it’s specific to Call of Duty. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>
