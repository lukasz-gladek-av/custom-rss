            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite has officially revealed its collaboration with South Park, featuring a return of the Stick of Truth, unique battlegrounds, and a limited-time Quints playlist. Don’t forget to bring a towel.</p>



<p>Epic Games officially dropped the trailer for the upcoming collaboration with South Park. Scheduled to go live on Friday, January 9, the Born in Chaos Pass will add new skins for Cartman, Kyle, Kenny, Stan, and Butters to the Fortnite shop. Butters’ attire is inspired by his Professor Chaos persona, while Cartman sees a return to his AWESOM-O robot from the classic season 8 episode of the Comedy Central series. Series favorite Towelie will also be appearing as a sidekick.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-stick-of-truth-returns-to-south-park">The Stick of Truth Returns to South Park</h2>



<p>The trailer featured a short animation of the characters all playing Fortnite, but leaving Butters out of the fun. To get some revenge and ensure that the other boys play with him, Butters suits up as Professor Chaos and wields the Stick of Truth, the titular item from the 2014 South Park RPG, to force them to play with them. They are then transformed into the game, and we see gameplay in Cartmanland, a new, limited-time area. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that Quints, a new five-person playlist, will be available as part of the collaboration through February 5.</p>
