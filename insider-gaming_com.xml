<p>Activision has lifted the lid on the Call of Duty League 2025 season Operator skins, and they’re… Well, they’re not good. They’re pretty basic and almost nothing seems to have influenced their design beyond basic colour schemes, but at least Boston Breach has a demonic face mask.</p>



<p>The smattering of skins hasn’t impressed COD League fans worldwide, but they’ll of course sell because Call of Duty players love to represent their favourite team in-game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cod-league-skins-confirmed">COD League Skins Confirmed</h2>



<p>All 12 COD League skins have been revealed by Activision, but they’re not very innovative. That’s a surprise considering how inventive teams have been with other Operator skins in Black Ops 6 thus far, and the Season One Battle Pass continues that trend in earnest.</p>



<p>Here are the teams competing in the Call of Duty League 2025 season:</p>



<ul>
<li>Atlanta FaZe</li>



<li>Boston Breach</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Cloud9 New York</li>



<li>LA Guerrillas</li>



<li>LA Thieves</li>



<li>Miami Heretics</li>



<li>Minnesota Rokkr</li>



<li>OpTic Texas</li>



<li>Seattle Surge</li>



<li>Toronto Ultra</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>
</ul>



<p>The design follows the ‘backwards-cap-and-goggles’ aesthetic that has been present in the Call of Duty League skin circle for years. It’s about time something changed, but at least the team branding is on point. </p>



<p>Some of the flashier skins have been reserved for Boston Breach and OpTic Texas, while the LAG and C9 skins have a full-body colour change on deck – everyone else is just wearing a standard black outfit.</p>



<p>Traditionally, teams have very little input in the design of these skins. They can choose colours, the locations of said colours, and usually the design of the central flash that makes up the skin’s core identity, but that’s it. They’re not going to have Rokkr’s skin wearing a horned helmet or have the Royal Ravens’ skin boast a set of wings now, are they?</p>



<p>The COD League skins will be released later in Season One.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-battle-pass-how/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>From November 14, Black Ops 6 players can invest in the Season One Battle Pass, an optional add-on that’ll reward them with countless boosts and bonuses as they rank up throughout the season. It has changed a little compared to recent years, with Activision’s teams opting for a page-by-page system, as opposed to the ‘tac-map’ system deployed in recent games.</p>



<p>That means unlocking things in the Black Ops 6 Season One Battle Pass works a little differently – but not much.</p>



<p>Read on to learn about this new Battle Pass and how it all works.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-black-ops-6-season-one-battle-pass">How to Get The Black Ops 6 Season One Battle Pass</h2>



<p>If you wait until November 14, the Season One update for Black Ops 6 will be deployed, and the game’s first Battle Pass will come along with it.</p>



<p>Once you’ve secured the update, you can unlock the Season One Battle Pass by parting ways with 1,100 COD Points – either the COD Points that are already in your account, or points that you buy fresh for the Battle Pass. If you’re willing to invest a little more in your game, you can get the ‘Battle Pass Bundle’ for 2,400 COD Points, which includes 20+ Tier Skips.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-the-new-battle-pass-work">How Does The New Battle Pass Work?</h2>



<p>In Black Ops 6, the Battle Pass is like a book, with content such as Double XP Tokens, Free COD Points, weapons, and charms all being spread across 17 pages. As soon as you buy the Battle Pass (or the BlackCell Battle Pass), you’ll blitz through a couple of pages, and then after that, you’ll be working your way through every other reward.</p>



<p>Once you’ve completed every page, you’ll gain access to an exclusive ‘Completion Page’ that houses the season’s most aspirational rewards.</p>



<p>It works like this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Earn Battle Pass XP to unlock more Tokens for the Pass</li>



<li>Use these Tokens to unlock rewards on the pages of the Battle Pass in whatever order you want</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s it – if you open a page and see a free camo that you’d like before the charms, loading screen art, or Double XP Tokens, then simply click to secure that camo. If you’ve not invested in a Battle Pass, you’ll still be entitled to a few free rewards in Black Ops 6 – so don’t worry about being left out (you just don’t get access to the Token system). </p>



<p>As you flick through the pages, you’ll regularly unlock ‘HVT Tiers’. These are revealed when you complete a page, and they’re usually more sizeable rewards like a new Operator. If you’re a BlackCell owner, you’ll have the advantage of unlocking pages in a non-linear fashion, which regular Battle Pass owners won’t be able to do.</p>



<p>Are you going to invest in the Season One Battle Pass in Black Ops 6?</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I’ll probably spend most of my time in Farming Simulator 25 planting and harvesting crops. I do the same in games like Stardew Valley. Now and then, however, I’ll specialize in a playthrough, focusing on a specific animal type or good. This time, I’m looking forward to the new water buffalo. Here’s a look at all the animals in Farming Simulator 25!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-animal-you-can-raise-in-farming-simulator-25">Every Animal You Can Raise in Farming Simulator 25</h2>



<p>As usual with the franchise, Farming Simulator 25 advances the core gameplay with additional crops and animals you can raise and harvest. In this year’s release, water buffalo and goats act as the newest additions, but we also have baby animals that you’ll spot wandering inside the pens around your farm. They’re cute and allow you to expand your livestock offerings without spending more money on adults, but don’t expect to make too much money off the children until they’re grown.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Animals in Farming Simulator 25</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Bees</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Chickens</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Cows</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Deer</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Dogs</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Goats</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Horses</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Pigs</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sheep</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Water Buffalos</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>I have not acquired any water buffalo on my current farm, but I have a few cows and chickens. I can’t wait to check out the new animals, though!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-the-most-profitable-animal-in-farming-simulator-25">What’s the Most Profitable Animal in Farming Simulator 25?</h2>



<p>If this year’s release is anything like the last entry, pigs will make the most money in Farming Simulator 25. However, you cannot discount water buffalo or goats yet. They’re brand-new, and as we delve deeper into the game, we’ll create a specialized farm focusing on both to discover precisely how much they earn. For now, prioritize pigs. You can earn thousands of dollars daily with a packed pen.</p>



<p>While bees are relaxed and fun to breed, they’re not much of a money-maker. However, it can’t hurt to generalize somewhat, as you can invest in various production chains that utilize components like honey to craft higher-grossing goods.</p>



<p>Which livestock do you intend to prioritize in Farming Simulator 25? Let us know in the comments below, or start discussing the game on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a>!</p>

<p>As with every new entry in the Farming Simulator franchise, this year’s launch, Farming Simulator 25, includes a rather large selection of new and returning crops that give virtual farmers a chance to sow their seed and make some money in a cutthroat industry. Of course, you won’t plant everything, at least not all at once, so knowing your options beforehand gives you time to plan your harvest for the foreseeable future. Here’s a look at all of the crops in Farming Simulator 25!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-crop-available-to-you-in-farming-simulator-25">Every Crop Available to You in Farming Simulator 25</h2>



<p>When you kick off your farming adventure in Farming Simulator 25, following along with the tutorial will teach you the basics of preparing fields, planting, and harvesting crops. You’ll start slow and simple with canola and wheat. But as you better grasp the gameplay mechanics, you’ll expand your harvest to include potatoes, sugarcane, beans, and so much more! It’s a lot to learn, especially for newcomers to the series.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Farming Simulator 25 Crops</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Wheat</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Barley</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Canola</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Oat</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sorghum</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Corn</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sunflowers</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Soybeans</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Potatoes</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sugar Beet</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sugarcane</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Cotton</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Grapes</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Olives</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Grass</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Red Beet</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Carrots</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Parsnips</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Green Beans</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Peas</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Spinach</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Long Grain Rice</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Rice</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>Alongside these crops, you can also plant, grow, and harvest Grass, Hay, and Straw. You’ll find uses for everything in the game, as nothing goes to waste here. Every crop and item in the game serves a purpose: improving crop yield, feeding livestock, selling wholesale, or being a component in one of the many production chains.</p>



<p>What’s your favorite crop in Farming Simulator? I think I’ll specialize in my first playthrough and focus on rice.

<p>Payload Studios is laying off even more staff, just months after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payload-studios-lays-off-25-percent-of-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letting go of 25%</a> of the company. The developer of TerraTech has confirmed to GamesIndustry.biz (GIBiz) that it is letting go a number of employees after being put in a “very difficult position”.</p>



<p>“It’s true that last week we announced another redundancy round,” CEO and co-founder Russell Clarke told GIBiz. “This has come out of the blue after a project that we were relying on did not materialise, and placed us in a very difficult position. </p>



<p>“The details, including the handling of the notice period and redundancy payments as well as the number of people who will ultimately lose their jobs, are still to be determined – but we had to notify staff last week, to give as much warning as possible to all those who might be affected.”</p>



<p>While Clarke didn’t confirm the number of people let go, GIBiz claims that eight people were let go this time around. Clarke said that his hope was to “give answers” to the staff sometime this week. It’s also being reported that those let go weren’t receiving any sort of redundancy pay.</p>



<p>Sources also told GIBiz that one of Payload’s co-founders was part of the layoffs, though the company wouldn’t confirm which one.</p>



<p>“We are still figuring out the details, but the team that goes forward will need to be very lean,” Clarke said about the future of Payload Studios.</p>



<p>In 2024, there have been <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roughly 13,500 jobs lost</a> in the games industry across more than 160 companies. The real total is likely higher, however, as some companies didn’t make public how many people had been laid off. </p>
