<p>The story behind the recent layoffs at 10:10 Games is more than just a case of simple restructuring. Insider Gaming has spoken to multiple sources who have provided new details about what led to the layoffs at the Funko Fusion developer, what they were told, and more.</p>



<p>According to those who spoke under the condition of anonymity, staff at the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/details-funko-fusion-developer-1010-games-recent-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found out about</a> the layoffs in mid-January and that there would be 19 jobs at risk. Those who were being let go were told by management that they would be “fully supported through this process”, including assistance with finding more work. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming was told that hasn’t happened yet.</p>



<p>As far as those let go, some were on Holiday—which the company had encouraged them to take. After being told while out of work, those let go were still expected to attend consultation meetings at the given time. That included those that happened to be abroad in different time zones.</p>

<p>“Management seemed very keen to wrap up the process quickly, and despite saying that they were fully open to suggestions and feedback, none of it has been taken on board,” one source said.</p>



<p>Once layoffs were finalized, meetings wrapped with those affected by the end of January. In those meetings, Insider Gaming learned that they were told there would be no real severance package. What they received was what one called “the bare legal minimum” that included notice periods and payment in lieu of any unused Holiday time. As mentioned above, Holiday time was encouraged to be used over the holiday season. </p>



<p>Many of those spoken to believed that the company knew they were going to be holding these layoffs and w anted to avoid paying it out after the fact.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-was-the-reason-given-to-10-10-games-staff">What Was The Reason Given To 10:10 Games Staff</h2>



<p>After the layoffs were announced, employees were—obviously—wondering what led to the decision. It’s understood that it all stems from 10:10 Games’ first release, Funko Fusion.</p>



<p>Sources say that Funko Fusion was a “complete commercial and critical failure”. Because of the poor performance of the game, the studio has failed to secure funding for more than one future project as of now. That led to lower-level staff being told that there “isn’t enough work to give the whole team”.</p>



<p>Layoffs were said to be based “entirely on the needs of the next project” which many who spoke to Insider Gaming believe hasn’t been  fully designed yet. It’s also believed that no senior-level or upper-management staff were impacted by the layoffs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming was told that studio heads Paul Flanagan and Arthur Parsons initially told staff that they wanted to take responsibility for the layoffs when it became public. However, the studio is reportedly having a different firm handle public contact, with no official statement on the moves.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has attempted to contact 10:10 Games for response to what has been said regarding the layoffs. As of publishing, a response has yet to be received.</p>

<p>Avowed, the fantasy RPG from Obsidian and Xbox, currently holds the number one spot on Steam’s Top Sellers List, four days before the game fully releases and comes to Game Pass. Amidst this and some solid review scores, Avowed looks like an early win for both Obsidian and Xbox.</p>



<h2 id="h-avowed-is-the-top-selling-game-on-steam-right-now">Avowed is the Top Selling Game on Steam Right Now</h2>



<p>The fantasy RPG title Avowed is at the top of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official live Top Sellers chart on Steam</a>, meaning it is currently bringing in more revenue than any other game on the platform. This list includes some of the most popular recent releases like Sid Meier’s Civilization 7 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-player-count-soars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, as well as highly grossing multiplayer juggernauts like Counter-Strike 2 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launching-perfect-couples-costumes-on-valentines-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>.</p>



<p>During the early access period, Avowed has peaked on Steam at over 9,000 players, however this figure only includes Steam players that have purchased the game’s premium edition. This figure doesn’t include console players, PC players playing through the Xbox app, players waiting for the standard edition to release, and players waiting to play through Game Pass. The player peak during this early access period will also likely rise during the weekend.</p>



<p>This strong start in sales for Avowed goes alongside a positive critical reception. On Metacritic, it’s hovering around an 80 on both PC and Xbox, and on Steam it has a “Very Positive” rating with 82% positive ratings. </p>



<p>Avowed’s early success is part of a strong start to new game sales in 2025. On the Steam Top Sellers list, four of the top 10 are new games that have released or will release in the first half of this year: Avowed, Civ 7, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and Elden Ring Nightreign.</p>
