<p>OpTic Gaming announced a major change to their OpTic Texas Call of Duty roster today, but it’s one fans have seen before. For the second time in just a matter of months, OpTic Texas has removed Amer “Pred” Zulbeari in favor of Cuyler “Huke” Garland.</p>



<h2 id="h-huke-in-pred-out-of-optic-texas-to-kick-off-another-call-of-duty-rostermania-period">Huke In, Pred Out of OpTic Texas to Kick Off Another Call of Duty Rostermania Period</h2>



<p>OpTic officially said thank you (and goodbye) to Pred today, thanking him for his “passion and energy.” Back in December, just months after OpTic Texas claimed the CDL championship, Pred moved to the inactive roster, needing a break to “handle personal issues” and fix his mental health. Days later though, he confirmed that he was a free agent, though still under contract with OpTic.</p>



<div><article><p><span>A World Champion with passion and energy for the game that is truly special ⚡

Always a part of our legacy. Thank you </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Pred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Pred</a></p></article></div>



<p>In his place, Huke returned to the OpTic lineup after being away for more than a year. Following his CDL Championship with Dallas Empire in 2020, Huke had bounced around different spots, picking up stints with LA Thieves, LA Guerillas, the Seattle/Vancouver Surge. OpTic struggled early this season with Huke in the lineup, but even after Pred returned to the starting squad this past February, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-map-streak-kenny-lowest-kd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the results got even worse</a>.</p>



<p>Before the Stage Two Major last weekend, OpTic Texas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-skyz-new-official-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought in Cesar “Skyz” Bueno</a>, after a struggling Kenneth “Kenny” Williams chose to step down. Now after a second major change, the OpTic Texas roster will look ahead to the Stage 3 Major Qualifiers at the start of April. However, don’t expect OpTic Texas to be the only teams to make roster moves before the next CDL stage begins.</p>



<p>Is this the right call for OpTic Texas? Let us know in the comments or on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Black Ops 6 fans can jump into Season 3 content 24 hours early, it’s been announced. A free trial is also being offered, but Warzone fans are likely to be disappointed with the news.</p>



<p>Call of Duty’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 content was delayed</a> a while back. Activision needed more time to perfect the nuances of the content. There’s also a suspicion that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> needed extra time and care.</p>



<p>But it seems the Black Ops 6 development team is looking for an early start. BLOPS 6 Season 3 launches a day earlier than planned on April 2—but it comes with a minor caveat.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-season-3-amp-verdansk-still-launches-on-april-3">Warzone Season 3 &amp; Verdansk Still Launches on April 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Still have to wait. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s no doubting the star attraction of Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3, and that’s the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-warzone-2-verdansk-pois/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a>. However, players eager to jump back into the classic battle royale map have to wait for the previously announced delayed date.</p>



<p>“Season 03 of #BlackOps6 will be dropping early on April 2nd with a 24 hour free trial,” posted the official <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty X page</a>. This is great news for Black Ops 6 fans and potential newcomers eager to try the FPS out.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, if you want Verdansk a day early, you’re out of luck. The message also went on to say: “During that time Call of Duty: Warzone will go offline in preparation for the launch of Verdansk on April 3. Anyone who opens the Call of Duty: Warzone game menu during that time will receive the Kilo 141 for free.”</p>

<p>We’ve heard about Mortal Kombat content heading to Fortnite already. However, a new leak has pulled back the bloody curtain to reveal that March 28 potentially brings emotes, pickaxes, and skins to finish us (or anyone).</p>



<p>There was a time when I used to be shocked by Fortnite’s collaborations. It went out the window quickly once the likes of Kratos and Halo started dropping into Tilted Towers. Now, anyone who’s anyone can make an appearance—check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sabrina-carpenter-might-be-the-next-playable-fortnite-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter</a> dialog if you don’t believe me. </p>



<p>But there’s something surreal about the brutal nature of Mortal Kombat entering a new realm. Alas, after initial talk of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-mortal-kombat-mythics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat content turning up for a fight in Fortnite</a>, it’s reportedly the case.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-amp-mortal-kombat-crossover-content-reportedly-releases-march-28">Fortnite &amp; Mortal Kombat Crossover Content Reportedly Releases March 28</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get over here, Fortnite. Credit to NetherRealm</figcaption></figure>



<p>Renowned leaker <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a> has dropped a finishing blow on the MK and Fortnite conversation. They posted to their official X channel about the nature of the content coming to the battle royale shooter.</p>



<p>They provided a bullet-point list outlining some of the key inclusions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Scorpion (MK3) Skin: 1.500 vbucks</li>



<li>Kitana (MK3) Skin: 1500 vbucks</li>



<li>Raiden (MK3) Skin: 1500 vbucks</li>



<li>Scorpion’s Flame Skull backbling: 800 bucks</li>



<li>Raiden’s Amulet backbling: 400 vbucks#</li>



<li>Raiden’s Staff pickaxe: 800 bucks </li>



<li>Scorpion’s Katana Duo pickaxe: included with the backbling</li>



<li>Kitana’s Steel Fan pickaxe: 800 bucks</li>



<li>Kitana’s Fan Bear: included with the pickaxe</li>



<li>Kitana’s Fan Fado emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>FLAWLESS VICTORY emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>Toasty! emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>Test your strength emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>Guiding Staff Mark emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>Raiden’s Victory emote: 300 bucks</li>
</ul>



<p>They finish by saying to expect the items on <strong>March 28</strong>. You can check out the full message here.</p>

<p>This may be the beginning of a fun and fatal partnership. Take the leaks with the usual punch of salt, but there’s every chance you can start preparing your best kombos to drop onto unsuspecting Fortnite players.</p>



<p>The Mortal Kombat collab isn’t the only rumored to be in the works: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-collaborating-with-dragon-ball-daima-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Ball Daima</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-getting-a-kendrick-lamar-emote-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick Lamar</a> might be boarding the bus soon enough.</p>
