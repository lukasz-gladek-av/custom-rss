<p>A previous report from Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson that an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed/" id="24">Assassin’s Creed</a> game codenamed “League” was canceled has now been confirmed.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.origami.ng/ubisoft-vantage-cancel-league-assassins-creed-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Origami</a>, Assassin’s Creed League was originally planned as multiplayer DLC for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows/" id="1478">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</a>. The game was designed around four assassins joining forces, set in feudal Japan to align with Shadows. League was reportedly intended to close out the season pass with a collection of scripted, four-player cooperative missions.</p>







<h2 id="h-more-on-the-future-of-the-assassin-s-creed-league-project">More on the Future of the Assassin’s Creed League Project</h2>



<p>It’s claimed that Ubisoft Annecy reevaluated the plan to make League an Assassin’s Creed Shadows expansion over the past year. Ultimately, it was deemed too time-consuming to meet quality standards. </p>



<p>They considered options like incorporating the multiplayer setup into another Assassin’s Creed project or scaling the project down into a smaller, standalone co-op game using parts of Shadows’ open world. Annecy chose the latter, planning to launch invitation-only alpha tests by May 2026.</p>



<p>The report notes that sources claim Ubisoft Vantage plans to continue the project’s legacy through a small team of around ten developers. The group is first focused on transferring the project’s technical advancements to the Anvil engine before pitching cooperative modes that could be used in future Assassin’s Creed titles.</p>







<h2 id="h-previous-reports-of-the-league-project">Previous Reports of the League Project</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> in October 2024 that a multiplayer co-op mode for Shadows is in development and planned for a post-launch release. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-datamine-reveals-a-multiplayer-mode/">A datamine in 2025</a> showed instances of a multiplayer mode being mentioned in the game’s files.</p>



<p>This news comes as Ubisoft continues to undergo a massive restructuring, including the cancellation or pausing of multiple projects. League is now the latest scrapped project.

<p>As a Soulslike, Nioh 3 assumes a reputation of being a hard game. We can say with complete certainty that it lives up to this mantle and more. This guide has the absolute top tips and tricks you have to use and absorb if you are to survive and complete Nioh 3.</p>



<p>Playing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-upcoming-soulslike-games-2026/" id="172993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Souls</a> games is as daunting as ever. While the genre has largely moved away from the sneaky traps and enemy placement of yesteryear—and don’t forget the backtracking—bosses are tougher than ever, and the emphasis on meta tricks and knowledge is as imperative as ever in Nioh 3.</p>







<h2 id="h-nioh-3-tips-amp-tricks-you-need-to-stay-alive">Nioh 3 Tips &amp; Tricks You Need To Stay Alive</h2>



<h3 id="h-become-adept-with-both-playstyles">Become Adept With Both PlayStyles</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A master of all. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Nioh 3 switches up the formula by having both Samurai and Ninja be changeable-on-the-fly options. A swift click of the trigger, and you go from being a strong Samurai to a master of speed and stealth as a Ninja. Don’t make the mistake of sticking to one: Use both as each is VERY useful for certain bosses and combat situations.</p>



<p>A boss fight with another Samurai will favor the style of the same name, whereas being a Ninja and darting about an arena could be better suited to a fast-moving Yokai. Keep chopping and changing your gear, and ensure both styles are used in equal measure.</p>







<h3 id="h-burst-break-mastery">Burst Break Mastery</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Burst their bubble. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>This will be difficult if you struggle with timing, but hear this tip out: You can <strong>dominate bosses with Burst Breaks</strong>. Some bosses are more liberal with their Burst Break usage, and many of those attacks are incredibly telegraphed. Landing a Burst Break does incredible HP and Ki damage and momentarily staggers the opponent, giving you time to get a few quick licks in.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>If you’re really struggling to deal damage, there’s even a world where you mainly rely on Burst Breaks. Heed our advice: Don’t be afraid of Burst Breaks; the counter window is very generous.</p>



<h3 id="h-don-t-rely-on-consumable-items">Don’t Rely On Consumable Items</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Git gud. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>As a lover of Soulslike, I make it a mission not to use any consumable items in these games. Why? Because resources are finite. You could quite easily become accustomed to popping a few stat-boosting items and chucking a few status-inflicting Conumables at a boss as you repeat it over and over, but what happens when the well runs dry? (Interestingly, more on wells below).</p>



<p>It’s much better to focus on core combat gameplay mechanics because you can improve your own skill level, and you’ll never face a situation where you have to waste time grinding for items or coming unstuck because you relied too heavily on something other than the fundamentals of attacking, evading, and deflecting—we believe in you.</p>



<h3 id="h-equip-equipment-sets">Equip Equipment Sets</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A very nice bonus. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>Certain pieces of Armor will have specific green writing in the item description, which is the game’s way of telling you it’s part of a set. There are countless sets in Nioh 3, and because of the game’s tendency to give you loot, you’ll more than likely have multiple items in the same set.</p>



<p>If you keep equipping more and more gear with the same set name, <strong>you gain new and more powerful bonuses</strong>. This includes giving you more health, increasing Attack damage, and much more. Try to prioritize completing sets instead of slapping on slightly superior individual gear.</p>



<h3 id="h-explore-amp-unlock-more">Explore &amp; Unlock More</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Have a wander. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has already gone ahead and done you a big favor by offering the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-warring-states-map-all-collectibles-in-nioh-3-every-shrine-kodama-more/" id="174129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete Warring States map</a>, showing you where every collectible is in the first region. These aren’t just run-of-the-mill collectibles. Increasing your Exploration Level upgrades your Attack, finding Kodamas and Six Jizo statues gives you Merit points, which can earn you more Elixirs, and Hot Springs are a good source of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yokai-teardrops-nioh-3/" id="174464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yokai Teardrops</a>.</p>



<p>Focusing on the main story mission is the last thing you should focus on; moreover, you’ll be underleveled and easy chow for the next big bad boss.</p>



<h3 id="h-ki-is-key">Ki Is Key</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The Ki to victory. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>This is primarily a tip for newbies, but Nioh’s Ki system must be respected. Other Souls titles employ a basic Stamina meter that recovers, whereas the Nioh series follows in Bloodborne’s footsteps by having an active-time mechanic that encourages player aggression.</p>



<p>In Bloodborne, if you lose health, attacking quickly stops you from losing health; in Nioh, timing your Ki Pulse regains consumed Stamina, with a perfect Ki Pulse giving you everything back. For your first few hours, focus on your timing so that it gets to the point where you don’t need to look at the Ki meter anymore. The more Ki you have, the more attacks you can do, and the slower it takes for an enemy to stagger you.</p>



<h3 id="h-soul-core-placement">Soul Core Placement</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Choose the right ones. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>Pay close attention to your Souls Cores and what they do. The basics are easy enough: Place a Soul Core in the Yang position to summon a Yokai to fight for you, put it in the Yin position to generate a Talisman or another ability. Don’t just focus on what a core does in terms of Special Effects (although they can be dreamy) or default Attack and Defence stats.</p>

</ul>



<p>A Summoning Seal with fewer conjure amounts is a surefire sign that it’s a powerful summon—see how Mezuki above is only allowed to be called upon twice in one life? These can provide huge buffs during the course of battle, so take Soul Core management seriously.</p>



<h3 id="h-use-the-best-gear-amp-methods">Use The Best Gear &amp; Methods</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Shameless, thank you. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>A bit of self-promotion here, but Insider Gaming has put together a few handy guides breaking down things you definitely need to utilize and know in Nioh 3:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-weapons-nioh-3/" id="174316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Weapons For Samurai &amp; Ninja</a></li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ninjutsu-nioh-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Ninjutsu You Need To Use</a></li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-more-elixirs-in-nioh-3-best-elixir-farming-methods-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How To Get More Elixirs &amp; Best Elixir Farming Methods</a></li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-open-locked-door-tenryu-river-nioh-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How To Open Locked Door In Tenryu River</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Having the best weapons and Ninjutsu is self-explanatory; knowing the ins and outs of Elixirs is paramount to consumable conservation, and you should definitely open that door!</p>



<h3 id="h-vantage-points-for-long-weapons">Vantage Points For Long Weapons</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I spy. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>Mobs are more inevitable than Thanos. You can run past them like Forrest Gump galloping around the world, but sometimes it’s better to eliminate them. You also need a steady stream of Amrita coming in. All creatures, no matter how great or small, are oblivious to your position at first, and it’s beneficial to try to find a high spot to scout the area and use your Bow or guns.</p>



<p>This can lessen the load on your blades and resources, making life much easier. As all good Zombie movies have taught us, aim for the head—you do more damage.</p>



<h3 id="h-well-well-well">Well, Well, Well</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Well…Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>A final little bonus tip for you. If you see a well, they always have a rock tied to them. Hit the rock, and more often than not, you’ll get a special surprise! Other times…brace yourself for a WELL-drawn out skirmish.</p>



<p>Do you agree with Insider Gaming’s assessment of how to be better at Nioh 3? Have you concocted your own brilliant array of tips and tricks to taunt Yokai?
