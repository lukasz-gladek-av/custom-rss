<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has been a long time in the making. It has been almost seven years since the release of the first game, pushed to market following a Kickstarter campaign that raised $1.3 million in just one month. On February 4, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be released, and I’ve been lucky enough to piece together a preview of the game.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of the first title, which was steeped in historical accuracy, featured gruelling mechanics, and had an authentic story that left you feeling immersed and challenged in equal amounts. All that and more awaits you in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>Here’s my full preview – it’s an exploration of a cinematic masterpiece in progress.</p>



<p>If you’d prefer, you can watch the full preview in video format:</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-world">Enter the World</h2>



<p>I can’t stress how immersive I’m already finding Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 to be. With a surround-sound headset, I’m traipsing through summertime forests and fields, hearing the leaves and brush crunch under my feet while birds twitter above me in the canopy. The light’s rays pierce the branches, splashing a burst against a nearby stag, who catches my scent and scarpers through the trees.</p>



<p>Perhaps I’ll hunt later.</p>



<p>In the next moment, I’m on a beaten path flanked by a twinkling stream, which would be idyllic if I wasn’t being held up by cutthroats. They demand my Groschen; I simply plead with them to leave me alone, for I have nothing.</p>



<p>They don’t care, and in a flash, I’m on my back.</p>



<p>After a reload, I’m in a nearby village, watching a fight break out between two shopkeepers, for whatever reason. The townspeople gather to watch the spectacle as I turn tail and walk down the path, avoiding making eye contact because I’m not familiar with the residents and they are inherently mistrusting of me because of a recent tavern brawl.</p>



<p>That’s how granular Warhorse Studios has made Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>From the reputation system to how the AI treats items you’ve dropped, and from manually smithing a sword step-by-step to needing to dry herbs and smoke meat to preserve everything, the finest details and all the most monumental moments alike have been considered by the studio in this awe-inspiring game.</p>



<p>This is just the beginning.</p>



<h2 id="h-henry-returns">Henry Returns</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Henry of Skalitz (Tom McKay) is one of my favourite game characters of all time. His ascendance in the first game was nothing short of memorable, with his rags-to-riches story capturing perfectly the true grit of a survivor hellbent on turning around his ill fortune.</p>



<p>Henry returns in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, flanked by Sir Hans Capon (Luke Dale), his trusty companion – a brash, cocky counterpart with a sense of swagger as large as the fortune that sits in his family’s coffers.</p>



<p><em>Audentes fortuna iuvat</em>, and all that.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 sees our troubled duo land in hot water within a few minutes of the game’s opening sequences, left for dead after a skirmish and a near-naked chase through the night. The game’s deeply cinematic introduction left my mouth agape – everything from the soundtrack to the way the camera pans over medieval vistas blew my hair back right off the bat.</p>



<p>Immediately, McKay and Dale deliver stellar performances, perfectly representing the chemistry they’ve built up both on- and off-screen over the years. There’s humour, there’s intensity, and for the first three or four hours, there’s… Well, the typical tutorial missions you’d expect from a game like this – but it’s all <strong>great</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’ve never even heard of Kingdom Come Deliverance, you’ll enter the second game unsure of what to expect, but after a few hours settling into the ambitious open-world RPG, you’ll be chomping at the bit to explore, grow as a character, and pursue the winding, branching story.</p>



<h2 id="h-evolution-at-its-finest">Evolution at its Finest</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The first Kingdom Come Deliverance game was a marvel – but it was rough around the edges at times. It felt a little sluggish, there were a fair few bugs to deal with, and occasionally, it felt a bit <strong>too </strong>challenging. It’s not a game that holds your hand, but sometimes the difficulty level felt a bit too punishing for the average gamer.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 retains that obvious challenge in the earliest sequences of the game, presenting players with a dire set of circumstances that take them from being a lauded nobleman to little more than a peasant begging for scraps. Where you once had a fine set of armour and a razor-sharp sword, you now have rags and bloodied knuckles.</p>



<p>That’s the welcome you get in KCD2 – but it’s phenomenal.</p>



<p>For those new to the franchise, you’re starting at the beginning, building Henry of Skalitz from the ground up and shaping him into what you want, and Warhorse Studios has done such a perfect job of explaining <strong>why </strong>that’s happening. This is an RPG at heart, and from the skill paths to the way you build your character based on your desired fighting style, everything is manipulated and experienced by you, the player.</p>



<p>For my Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 preview, I worked my way through the first ten hours or so of the game, but that was enough time to see that Warhorse has taken everything from the first game that I loved and improved upon it immeasurably – an evolution indeed.</p>



<p>Visually, the game is <strong>stunning</strong>. The audio palette is sumptuous and realistic, the movement mechanics are much smoother and more satisfying than the first game, and combat has been toned down a bit and optimised. The game’s AI is believable, interactive, and sensible, and the world around you feels as though it exists.</p>



<p>Of course, it helps that it’s rooted in history and authenticity – Warhorse made sure to employ the sharpest experts to make sure everything from swinging a sword to the behaviour of the local farmers is correct to the game’s period.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, I’m having no issues. I’m playing KCD2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-pc-specs-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a high-end gaming PC</a> with a controller, and running it at Ultra 1440p is giving me no concerns about the game’s stability. It’s buttery smooth and (almost entirely) bug-free.</p>



<h2 id="h-forge-your-story">Forge Your Story</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I spoke to Tom McKay</a>, the actor behind Henry of Skalitz, he let me know about the depth of the choice and consequence system in this game. As I explored the opening sequences, piecing together the steps for my Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 preview, I became aware of just how impactful even a passing comment in a conversation could be.</p>



<p>The world is truly what you make of it, and if you want your Henry of Skalitz to be a conniving, manipulating criminal, then so be it. If you’d rather be a stalwart and honest member of the wider community in the open world of KCD2, then you’re free to do that as well.</p>



<p>As you explore the game and mould your character, you’ll come to experience intense fights, incredibly cinematic cutscenes – all of which are fully acted – and at times, a slower pacing that makes you feel as though you’ve been teleported back in time by a few hundred years.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 starts as a very slow burner. You might not even hit the title flash for a good while, depending on your play style. It’s designed to give all players a solid introduction, a spread of the backstory, and a tutorial for the game’s many mechanics. It’s nice – it feels natural and entertaining, and the best way to learn is by doing, so I was more than happy to crack on with it.</p>



<h2 id="h-not-long-to-wait">Not Long to Wait</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be released worldwide</a> on February 4, 2025. That’s just a few weeks away – and until then, I’ll be neck-deep in the game, exploring every nook and cranny in preparation for my full review, which you’ll find here on Insider Gaming on February 3.</p>



<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this brief Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 preview – stay tuned for more coverage as the game’s release date draws closer, and as always, stop by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to chat about the game.</p>

<p>It has been announced that there will be a network test for Elden Ring Nightreign from February 14 to February 17.</p>



<p>Announced on X (formerly Twitter), the network test will be available on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X, and applicants can register to gain access by January 20. To apply for registration to the Elden Ring Nightreign test, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-join-the-elden-ring-nightreign-network-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a>.</p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is a brand new co-op action-adventure game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced during The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p>



<p>However, despite being a co-op game, the game will not be playable as a duo, as the developers announced that the game has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed to be played either solo or trio</a>. </p>



<p>The developers have already said that the network test is a “preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Various technical verifications of online systems will be examined by conducting large-scale network load tests,” the test description reads.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear how much of the actual game content will be available to players, but anyone with a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series S|X can sign up.</p>



<p>First released in 2022, Elden Ring has sold 28.6 million units by September 2024, making it one of the best-selling games of all time, and the fastest-selling game published by Bandai Namco. Shadow of the Erdtree, a DLC for Elden Ring, sold five million copies in its first three days of release.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 2 come at a pivotal moment. CoD remains absolute and steadfast in its consistency, but its popularity is waning. Season 2 is a chance to rekindle the FPS fire, and we’re here to run through the latest info.</p>



<p>When former Call of Duty World Champion legend Seth “Scump” Abner describes CoD as “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/scump-on-call-of-duty-state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kind of depressing</a>,” it’s deeply concerning. Many are switching over for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals Season One Eternal Night Falls Update</a>. Player counts are dropping big time and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> isn’t as hot as it was, despite fun variations in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-squid-game-event-release-date-details-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squid Game event</a>. Warzone isn’t doing so hot either, and Season 2 is paramount to CoD’s coming weeks.</p>



<p>Warzone and Black Ops 6 Season 2 needs to be special and must hit harder than an Archangel Launcher.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-amp-warzone-season-2-release-date">Black Ops &amp; Warzone Season 2 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s see if CoD can restore some faith. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 2’s release date is January 28 and it was confirmed by Activision through patch notes.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">January 9 patch notes blog</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 discussed stability fixes. It goes into greater detail, and ends up saying, “<strong>Look for both of those fixes when Season 02 launches on Jan. 28.</strong>“</p>



<p>It’s quite uncommon for a date to be revealed this way, but we’re not complaining. We already imagined this to be the date due to the Battle Pass end date, but it’s now official. You only don’t have long left to complete your Season 1 Battle Pass and secure limited-time unlocks.</p>



<h2 id="h-possible-warzone-amp-black-ops-6-season-2-content">Possible Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6 Season 2 Content</h2>



<p>There have been no leaks or suggestions as to what content is coming in Season 2. But it’s safe to assume Black Ops 6, Zombies, and Warzone are getting the usual slew of content: <strong>New Maps, Guns, Perks, limited-time modes, Operator Bundles, and a new Battle Pass</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s funny, sometimes we know of at least something fresh by now, but we don’t—and no one does. Season 2 is being kept under wraps, and fingers crossed it’s because it’s a big one. </p>



<p>Black Ops 6 players want a Ranked game mode without hackers, the Warzone community wants <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> back now, and Zombies is unlikely to get major content after the introduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-sword-upgrades-in-citadelle-des-morts-bo6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle del Morts</a>—an LTM could be fun given the novelty of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-win-dead-light-green-light-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Light Green Light</a>.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we’re going to update this guide once we learn any news or rumors about Season 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-bo6-amp-warzone-season-2-battle-pass">BO6 &amp; Warzone Season 2 Battle Pass</h2>



<p>Again, it’s not officially revealed, <strong>but a Season 2 Battle Pass is inevitable for Black Ops 6 and Warzone</strong>.</p>



<p>An even bigger question is if Activision is going to continue with additional Battle Passes. The Squid Game event didn’t just bring new game modes and special skins, but also a <strong>controversial Event Pass</strong>. It had a free version, along with a Premium Tier. This didn’t go down well with the player base, so we’ll see if this is addressed once Season 2 is announced.</p>



<hr>



<p>Call of Duty is a huge talking point at present. What do you like and dislike about it? Is Black Ops 6 dying? Does Warzone need a content injection? Let us know your thoughts below.</p>
