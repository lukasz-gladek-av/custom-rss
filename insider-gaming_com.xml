<p>A third season of Peacock’s Twisted Metal, based on the PlayStation racing series, has been announced. However, the renewal does come with the news of a change in showrunners.</p>







<p>Debuting in 2023, Twisted Metal loosely adapts the games from the early PlayStation era. Featuring fan-favorite characters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sweet-tooth-is-a-violent-man-in-twisted-metal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sweet Tooth</a>, the show was a surprise success for Peacock. It helped that the show sported massive talent like Captain America’s Anthony Mackie and Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s Stephanie Beatriz. A second season was quickly greenlit and released earlier this year to decent reviews. Now, Peacock has revealed that the action show is coming back for another season, but not without some creative changes.</p>

<p>Variety first covered the news that Twisted Metal is being <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/twisted-metal-renewed-season-3-david-reed-showrunner-1236584674/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">renewed for a third season</a>. Apparently, the second season was a hit for Peacock, being the second returning original scripted season with 993 million minutes watched. However, it isn’t without changes, as show creator and showrunner Michael Jonathan Smith is exiting. The Cobra Kai creator’s reasons for leaving has not been discussed. In his stead, writer and director David Reed will join current showrunners Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. No other details, like casting or release, is available.</p>



<p>David’s resume is quite a good one, from a glance. His most notable project is as a writer for Prime Video’s The Boys, which is releasing its final season in 2026. Other titles he has worked on include Star Trek: Strange New Worlds and Supernatural, among others. While Michael Jonathan Smith’s departure is a sad one, Reed does seem like a great substitute. </p>
