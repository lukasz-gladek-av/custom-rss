<p>We’re at the midway point of the week and raring to go with another NYT Connections puzzle. Below, I’ve provided the top NYT Connections hints and solutions you’ll need to smash today’s challenge. How’s your week going? Let me know in the comments if you’ve been playing any other puzzling games and what you might like to see more hints for!</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections answers you’re looking for. Today’s puzzle is a little bizarre as it features <strong>exclusively </strong>four-letter words. You’ll see what I mean below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-12">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 12)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #885:</p>



<ul>
<li>YOLO</li>



<li>POLO</li>



<li>LOCO</li>



<li>DODO</li>



<li>COMO</li>



<li>FOMO</li>



<li>JUDO</li>



<li>BOGO</li>



<li>BOZO</li>



<li>ROJO</li>



<li>YO-YO</li>



<li>SUMO</li>



<li>POCO</li>



<li>DOPE</li>



<li>GOLF</li>



<li>GOAT</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em><em>These all involve physical competition, but not your everyday gym workout.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Terms for someone who’s not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em><em>Internet-born abbreviations that pack a punch.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em><em>You might hear these in Madrid or Mexico City.</em></em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 12.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-12-885">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 12 (#885)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– GOLF, JUDO, POLO, SUMO</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BOZO, DODO, DOPE, YO-YO</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BOGO, FOMO, GOAT, YOLO</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – COMO, LOCO, POCO, ROJO</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls got a new trailer during today’s State of Play Japan. In it, the second closed beta was announced, alongside who’ll be included.</p>







<p>Revealed in June, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-tokon-ps5-closed-beta-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fighter from ARC System Works</a>, creators of Guilty Gear, teams up with the superheroes of Marvel. Many have already gotten their hands on it with the closed beta and at EVO. Given ARC System Works’ track record, it’s safe to say it’ll be one to watch. Now, thanks to today’s State of Play, we have a bit more information on when the next chance to play will be.</p>



<h2 id="h-second-closed-beta-for-marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-coming-december-5th-7th-2025">Second Closed Beta for Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls Coming December 5th-7th, 2025</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>The trailer, seen above, we get a look at some new gameplay of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. We see new stages, including the X-Mansion with some familiar faces. Most importantly, we see a new closed beta announced for PlayStation 5. The beta will occur from December 5th through December 7th and run all 72-hours. New characters not in the first beta include Spider-Man and Ghost Rider.</p>



<p>Via <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-closed-beta-2-arrives-dec-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the PlayStation Blog</a>, the beta will be open to all who participated in the first one. Furthermore, those who expressed interest but didn’t get in will now be considered for this one. As for the schedule, on&nbsp;December 5 and 6, CPU battles and online matches will be available, with&nbsp;December 7 being only online battles.</p>



<p>The roster, for Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls includes Iron Man, Captain America, Ms. Marvel, Spider-Man, Star-Lord, Storm, Ghost Rider, and Doctor Doom. More characters are expected to join before the game’s 2026 release. There are a ton of heroes to choose from, so the possibilities are somewhat infinite. Still, it’ll be exciting to see how ARC System Works approaches these characters and how they may differ from other Marvel fighting titles.</p>
