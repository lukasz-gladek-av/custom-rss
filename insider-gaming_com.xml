<p>Victor von Doom is just as menacing as his name suggests, and the villain—sometimes anti-hero—is a natural fit for Marvel Rivals. We already know the imperious presence of the doctor is confirmed, so let’s check out the latest on his arrival and see if he needs an appointment.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> has a blockbuster, star-studded cast of characters befitting of a Marvel shooter. Meaning, that it makes sense to have (arguably) one of the most influential and memorable <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-characters-are-in-marvel-rivals-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters</a> in the biggest attempt to date to bring the epic universe to games.</p>



<p>It’s no secret Doctor Doom is coming to Marvel Rivals, that much is certain. However, a lot of confusion is directed toward his potential debut—let’s take a look.</p>

<p>Neither NetEase nor Marvel has given an official launch date for Doctor Doom in Marvel Rivals—and there aren’t even any leaks to give us a glimmer of hope.</p>



<p>The lack of a Doctor Doom announcement is bizarre given the character’s eponymous trailer back on July 26: “Marvel Rivals | Cinematic Trailer | No One Rivals Doom.” While the majority of the trailer features an array of the Rivals stars fighting each other, the main focus is on Doctor Doom.</p>



<p>Curiously, he doesn’t feature on the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes/index.html?heroId=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals hero page</a>—despite his trailer—and if he doesn’t appear at launch, I’d expect him to be the focal point of at least one of the first two seasons.</p>



<p>If anything spells bad news, it’s two Doctor Dooms, and yet we’re here unable to verify the launch date of one—keep checking back as we wait for official confirmation from either developer or publisher on the character’s Marvel Rivals launch.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-who-is-doctor-doom-in-marvel-rivals">Who is Doctor Doom in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p>Doctor Doom’s origin story is as sinister and foreboding as any: His mother was taken by Mephisto, and his father succumbed to death as an indirect effect of someone else’s actions. Cue the warpath of the vicious Victor von Doom. His brilliant use of magic and a mind for inventing and creation makes Doctor Doom one of the most-feared villains in Marvel—and history, to be honest.</p>



<p>He’s a genius, and Fantastic Four lovers will be intimately acquainted with Victor as they regularly clash. Hardened fans will debate for weeks on end who the greatest supervillain in the Marvel universe is; however, you only need to check different ranking lists to see Doom’s name appear at the top—in many cases <em>the </em>top spot.</p>



<hr>



<p>Do you think Doctor Doom is the greatest Marvel villain ever? Or does someone else breed evil that tiny bit better? While you deliberate on this, be sure to read up on the hero shooter’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-maps-game-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps and modes</a>, as well as the live-service title’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-marvel-rivals-money-laundering-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">money laundering controversy</a>.</p>

<p>Tencent have announced with developer Polaris Quest that it will be releasing a new game called ‘Light of Motiram’ for PC which looks awfully like Horizon Zero Dawn.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://lightofmotiram.com/EN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> came yesterday (first spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/mechanimal-open-world-survival-crafting-game-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>), revealing that the game will launch for PC on Steam and the Epic Games Store, but the publisher did not give an official release date.</p>



<p>The game has already been ripped apart on social media for being a fairly blatant Horizon Zero Dawn ripoff, but we’ve attached some images below to make up your own minds.</p>

<p>In Marvel Rivals, you wage war across a rich depth of Marvel licenses from Thor to Black Panther. Many of the universe’s respective characters and native lands are represented in the hero shooter, so let’s run you through every confirmed map and game mode so far.</p>



<p>I’ve played many online multiplayer shooters, and it’s incredible how opinions can vary depending on the title’s maps and game modes. These are core fundamentals of a shooter’s identity, meaning if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>‘ DNA is flawed in this regard, it could fail before it even gets started.</p>



<p>However, based on the Marvel Rivals alpha and beta tests, I’d suggest this is unlikely. So without further ado, here’s every map and game mode locked and loaded in for Marvel’s star-studded hero release.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-marvel-rivals-map">Every Marvel Rivals Map</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A rich tapestry of content. Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>We currently know of nine maps in Marvel Rivals, and these battle arenas are distributed amongst the same few locations. Check out every single map confirmed so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven</li>



<li>Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface</li>



<li><a href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Tokyo_2099:_Shin-Shibuya"></a>Tokyo 2099: Shin-Shibuya</li>



<li><a href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Tokyo_2099:_Spider-Islands"></a>Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands</li>



<li>Tokyo 2099: Warped Ninomaru</li>



<li>Wakanda: Birnin T’Challa</li>



<li>Wakanda: Hall of Djalia</li>



<li><a href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Yggsgard:_Royal_Palace"></a>Yggsgard: Royal Palace</li>



<li><a href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Yggsgard:_Yggdrasill_Path"></a>Yggsgard: Yggdrasill Path</li>
</ul>



<p>More maps might accompany the official launch of the multiplayer title, so stay tuned for even more content. Also, with Marvel Rivals taking up the live-service trend, a fruitful conveyor belt of maps is only the beginning. </p>



<p>With so many Marvel licenses to use, I’d love to see the Avengers Tower or the Quantum Realm set the scene for an epic battle!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-marvel-rivals-map-rumors">All Marvel Rivals Map Rumors</h2>



<p>In addition to confirmed locales, many more Marvel Rivals maps are purportedly on the way—courtesy of a leak.</p>



<p>According to journalist <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ross Miller on X</a>, another f<strong>ive maps are already in development (or finished)</strong> and likely coming to Marvel Rivals in a future content update. They <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller/status/1788079410530185237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">outed</a>, “Hydra Erebus Base, The Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda, Klyntar, Empire of Eternal Night, and Krakoa” as major locations.</p>



<p>Each of the five areas is expected to have maps within too. Take this all with a grain of salt, but it makes for interesting reading.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-marvel-rivals-game-mode">Every Marvel Rivals Game Mode</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals is gearing up for launch with four game modes: <strong>Conquest</strong>, <strong>Convergence</strong>, <strong>Convoy</strong>, and <strong>Domination</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-conquest">Conquest</h3>



<p>Conquest is a variation of Call of Duty’s Kill Confirmed in which players need to bank points for a kill by collecting the fallen enemy’s coin. The key difference here is the value of a coin increases the longer time goes on.</p>



<h3 id="h-convergence">Convergence</h3>



<p>We’re using Overwatch as our template here as you need to capture a control point first to trigger a payload, which the attacking team needs to guide to the end of the linear route. Conversely, the defending team has to prevent the payload from reaching each checkpoint by pushing it back and repelling opposition forces.</p>



<h3 id="h-convoy">Convoy</h3>



<p>Convoy is an honorable imitation of Overwatch’s classic Payload and Convoy modes. There are no capture points here, it’s a straight-up escort or defense mission (depending on your given side) of a moving objective along a fixed path.</p>



<h3 id="h-domination">Domination</h3>



<p>For Marvel Rivals’ Domination game mode, it’s a basic race to capture a control point and hold it until one team reaches the threshold. If one team achieves 100% completion, but at least one enemy player is present, it goes to overtime to determine if the game continues.</p>
