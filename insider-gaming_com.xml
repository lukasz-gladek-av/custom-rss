            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It appears that the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 hasn’t been one to write home about for Microsoft and Activision. According to a new report from The Game Business, Black Ops 7 sales numbers are down compared to both Battlefield 6 and last year’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>In data <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">provided to the outlet</a> by GSD, Black Ops 7 sales—both physical and digital—are down 63% compared to Battlefield 6. Obviously, it’s important to note that Battlefield 6 isn’t available on any subscription service, meaning that people need to buy the game if they want to play. So, while the sales numbers for Battlefield 6 are higher, it’s still probably that the overall player count for Call of Duty is actually higher.</p>







<h2 id="h-sales-are-down-compared-to-last-year">Sales Are Down Compared To Last Year</h2>



<p>Where things get a little dicey is when you look at the comparison to last year’s release, Black Ops 6. According to the report, physical and digital sales are down over 50% compared to last year. Again, many can, and will, point the game being available on Xbox Game Pass for Ultimate and PC subscribers. But so was Black Ops 6. </p>



<p>Despite all the numbers being down, Black Ops 7 was still the best-selling game in terms of units and revenue in Europe for the week ending November 16 (its launch week). Battlefield 6, it’s main competition right now, came in fourth in both units sold and overall revenue.</p>







<p>At the end of the day, it’s not like Call of Duty is a dwindling franchise as it’s still generating revenue for its developers and publishers. Still, it’s interesting to see how far sales have fallen and if it’s simply a case of more people playing on Xbox Game Pass, or is there a real drop off in actual interest in the 22-year-old franchise.</p>

<p>Twitch is now the latest platform to be added to Australia’s upcoming social media ban. Just weeks after it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/australia-to-ban-kick-and-reddit-for-children-under-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that Kick</a> would be added, news has come out from Australian media about its main rival being put on the list as well.</p>



<p>First reported by the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-21/twitch-included-in-under-16s-social-media-ban/106036398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)</a>, Twitch’s addition comes less than three weeks before the ban is set to go into effect. For those unfamiliar, the Australian government is enacting legislation that will ban anyone under the age of 16 from having accounts on a number of social media platforms. </p>







<p>Those platforms include TikTok, Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram, Threads, Facebook, YouTube, Kick, and, now, Twitch.</p>



<p><strong>“eSafety has informed Twitch it is considered an age-restricted social media platform required to take reasonable steps to prevent under 16s from having accounts, in accordance with Australia’s Social Media Minimum Age legislation,”</strong> a <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/newsroom/media-releases/twitch-assessed-as-age-restricted-social-media-platform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement on Australia’s eSafety website reads</a>.<strong> “Following Twitch’s own self-assessment, eSafety assessed Twitch as meeting the criteria for ‘age-restricted social media platform’, because it has the sole or significant purpose of online social interaction with features designed to encourage user interaction, including through livestreaming content.”</strong></p>



<p>Starting December 10, Twitch will block the signups from those under 16 and will start deactivating the accounts of current users who aren’t old enough.</p>



<p>According to the office of Australian Communications Minister Anika Wells, there aren’t any more evaluations planned before December 10. That means that the platforms listed above will be the ones that must comply with the new order. That said, this ban is “dynamic”, and that more can be added, or removed, if it need be.</p>







<p>“Our historic law simply aims to provide Australian children with a reprieve from the persuasive pull of platforms,” a spokesperson told ABC. “We are not chasing perfection, we are chasing a meaningful difference in the lives of young Australians.”</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on the growing social media ban for those under 16 in Australia? Should the government really get involved like this, or should the platforms a kid uses be regulated by their parents and guardians?

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation Has Made Over $1 Billion On Steam, Firm Claims]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony decision to release PlayStation games on Steam seems to be paying off. According to one analytics firm, the company has made over $1.2 billion since it began putting first-party games on the platform.</p>



<p>In its latest report, Alinea Analytics goes into detail on the success of PlayStation Studios’ titles. They mention that the number comes after Valve’s cut of sales is taken into account.</p>







<p>The firm says that, <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-selling-playstation-games">according to their estim</a><a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-selling-playstation-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a</a><a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-selling-playstation-games">tes</a>, over $1.5 billion in revenue has been generated in total. Of that total, Sony received $1.2 billion while Valve has come away with at least $350 million. For Valve’s portion of the cuts, they take 30% of sales initially. Once a game reaches $10 million in sales, that drops to 25%. After $50 million it falls a bit further to 20%.</p>



<p>Still, even with the profits that are going to Valve, Sony has to be pleased with what PlayStation games are generating on the platform. </p>



<h2 id="h-five-games-lead-the-way-for-playstation-on-steam">Five Games Lead The Way For PlayStation On Steam</h2>



<p>Going into their estimates,—again, it’s important to note that many of these numbers haven’t been fully confirmed by Sony—Alinea reports that Helldivers 2 is the most successful first-party game on Steam. Since its release in February 2024, the game has sold 12.7 million copies. In a distant second is Horizon Zero Dawn, which sold 4.5 million copies. That’s then followed by God of War at 4.2 million, Days Gone at 3.4 million, and Spider-Man Remastered with 2.7 million copies sold.</p>



<p>Despite the success of these games, Alinea cautions that the “novelty” of PlayStation games on Steam is wearing off a bit.</p>



<p><strong>“The audience that was once excited to experience these games for the first time has largely been served,”</strong> Alinea’s head of market analysis Rhys Elliot said. <strong>“Later releases naturally face smaller potential audiences, and our estimates clearly show this.”</strong></p>







<p>Looking at their data, Alinea notes that sales were stronger when PlayStation first started releasing its titles on Steam. One example they used is God of War. When it released, the game sold 2.5 million copies in 427 days. That ended up being 2.5x more than the sequel, God of War Ragnarök,&nbsp;sold in the same timeframe. </p>



<p>Another game used was Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2. Over the first 294 days on the platform, Spider-Man sold twice as many copies as its sequel.</p>



<p>Whether this is a worrying trend or just a case of players not wanting to play the latest games right now remains to be seen. There have been rumors of Sony changing its strategy when it comes to whether or not it keeps releasing PlayStation games on Steam. With the reported generated revenue thus far, however, it feels like Sony could be leaving a lot of money on the table if they were to pull back. </p>
