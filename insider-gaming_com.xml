<p>Battlestate Games has teased a potential crossover coming to Escape from Tarkov with a new promo code. This promo code and imagery to accompany it suggest that a ‘duck hunt’ themed event might be surfacing soon. This follows suggestions that Escape from Duckov and Escape from Tarkov will be hosting a crossover collaboration.</p>



<p>When you enter the Escape from Tarkov promo code, you’re greeted by a suite of items, including double-barreled shotguns, armor, vests, and ammunition, all of which you can use to <strong>hunt ducks</strong>.</p>











<p>When you load up the Escape from Tarkov launcher, be sure to enter the new bonus code, <strong>WILDHUNT</strong>. This will unlock the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>2 x MP-43-1C double-barreled shotguns</li>



<li>2 x Korund-VM body armor</li>



<li>2 x 6Sh112 S-S vests</li>



<li>2 x Ushanka hats</li>



<li>40 x AP-20 shotgun slugs</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many believe this promo code is teasing an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-tarkov-collaboration-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape from Duckov collaboration event</a>, which first hit the airwaves a couple of weeks ago. The team behind Escape from Duckov posted cryptic images suggesting that Tarkov’s big bosses, Killa and Tagilla, have made their way into the duck-themed extraction universe.</p>



<p>The image that was posted by Battlestate Games to share the new promo code features targets hammered by birdshot, and on those targets are quite clearly <strong>duck </strong>silhouettes.</p>



<p>The player character in the foreground is simply wearing the items offered in the new promo code.</p>



<p>Recently, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov suggested that collaborations are incoming and asked the community for some guidance on what kind of topics should be included in that. There’s a whole world out there, but players mostly wanted realistic, grounded collaborations, and not ‘Fortnite-like’ crossovers with gaudy skins and in-game takeovers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sledgehammer Games Developing an Action RPG with Deep Lore, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sledgehammer-games-developing-action-rpg-lore/</link>
            <guid>1415068</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sledgehammer Games is best known for creating or contributing to the development of the Call of Duty franchise. The studio started in 2011 with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and most recently assisted the likes of Treyarch and Raven Software on Black Ops 7, released towards the end of 2025.</p>



<p>But thanks to a recent developer profile on LinkedIn, it seems that the studio is (or at least <em>was</em>) working on an ‘unannounced action RPG’ with deep lore and a large-scale world.</p>



<p>It would be like nothing Sledgehammer has ever created.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-sledgehammer-making-a-new-rpg">Is Sledgehammer Making a New RPG?</h2>



<p>Sledgehammer Games has been <strong>mostly </strong>a support studio for the last few years, only leading the way on a couple of Call of Duty games: Modern Warfare III (2023) and Vanguard (2021). Elsewhere, the team has assisted in the creation of several other Call of Duty titles.</p>



<p>It stands to reason that the studio has scope to create something new, but nobody had any money on the company’s next game being an action RPG.</p>



<p>For reference, the top action RPG games could be anything from Diablo to the likes of Fallout, depending on how you quantify or categorize the term ‘action RPG’.</p>



<p>In the most recent news for Sledgehammer Games, it was determined that the studio was working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sledgehammer-games-call-of-duty-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch ports</a> for Call of Duty titles, but that tidbit is already months in the past.</p>



<p>This revelation about Sledgehammer’s action RPG title comes from the profile of a former developer, Ben Wanat. He’s now the Creative Director and co-founder of Lurker Entertainment, but from 2019 to August 2025, he worked at Sledgehammer Games as a Senior Creative Director.</p>



<p>In the blurb for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-wanat-17842671/details/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his role at Sledgehammer Games</a>, he wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Creative director for Unannounced action RPG</p>



<ul>
<li>Franchise planning, pitching, hiring, planning</li>



<li>Directing prototypes, player mechanics for mechanics-rich design</li>



<li>World layout, location layout</li>



<li>Concept and asset creation for cultures, environments, characters</li>



<li>Lore books for world, cultures, languages</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>(<em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qlfrdb/sledgehammer_games_is_working_on_an_unannounced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> for the spot</em>)</p>



<p>Otherwise, Wanat only contributed assistance to the development of Vanguard and seems to have had <strong>no hand </strong>in Modern Warfare III, which means he was likely free to contribute <strong>mostly </strong>towards the unannounced action RPG game.</p>



<p>Given the description of his role, it’s safe to assume that the game has/had deep lore, a branching world, innovative mechanics, and all-new, fictional cultures, races, and languages.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Fans Disappointed at Five-Month Wait for New Map]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-fans-disappointed-new-map-wait/</link>
            <guid>1415038</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has unveiled the ARC Raiders roadmap for 2026, lifting the lid on a long-awaited pipeline of content for the all-new extraction adventure title. It arrives after the festive window saw a little lull for the game, with players complaining about content stagnation and a lack of things to do outside of the winter-themed event.</p>



<p>The new roadmap has rewarded patient players with four months of content, but some argue that it’s taking too long to release key elements, like new maps. The last (and first) new map was Stella Montis, released midway through November, but the <strong>next new map </strong>won’t arrive until <strong>April</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-arc-raiders-suffering-from-a-lack-of-updates">Is ARC Raiders Suffering From a Lack of Updates?</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders has proven to be a smash hit, pulling in around 12 million sales since dropping on October 31, and it has reshaped the face of the extraction genre. That hasn’t stopped players from complaining ad infinitum about several issues, especially those that plagued the community over the festive break.</p>



<p>Out-of-map exploits, cheaters, a lack of new content, and lacklustre rewards from the first Expedition Project all compounded over the last few weeks to make many players feel tired with what was being offered by Embark Studios.</p>



<p>Additionally, it took the team almost a month to release the first roadmap of 2026, which includes content spanning January to April.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>







<p>It starts with new matchmaking options, fresh player projects to expand the game’s lore and quest loop, and some minor ARC threats. In February, a new Raider Deck and Expedition Project come around, and some reworks will be applied to the existing map pool.</p>



<p>However, a new map and large-scale ARC enemy aren’t appearing in ARC Raiders until<strong> April</strong>, which has left some fans of the sensational extraction adventure title a bit disappointed.</p>



<p>If the new map, which we expect will be a waterborne map arriving with Riven Tides, emerges midway through April, it will have been a gap of <strong>five months </strong>between new maps.</p>



<p>In the extraction shooter space, that’s hardly unfamiliar territory. You just need to look at Escape from Tarkov, which only adds new maps once every year or two, to get an idea of how it works. For instance, the ‘Ground Zero’ map was added to Tarkov in December 2023, and before that, Streets of Tarkov surfaced in December 2022.</p>



<p>That’s just one example.</p>



<p>Extraction shooters typically have larger, more detailed maps than your run-of-the-mill first-person shooters. It’s not like Call of Duty, which traditionally receives several new multiplayer maps once every two or three months. It’s a much bigger deal, and everything from the balancing of the map, to loot routes, to spawns, to extract locations all need to be studied and optimized at length.</p>



<p>While it might seem an issue that ARC Raiders players have to wait so long for a new map, it should be stressed that the current pool is more than large enough to facilitate an engaging session.</p>







<p>Do you think it’s a problem that we’re waiting until April for a new ARC Raiders map? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE announced on the January 23 episode of WWE Friday Night SmackDown that there would be a special Attitude Era edition of WWE 2K26. The game’s cover features a multitude of superstars from the era that defined the late 90s and early 2000s in the promotion. Stars on the cover include Steve Austin, The Rock, DX, Undertaker, and more.</p>



<p>As this is a special edition release for the game, they have not announced who will be on the standard cover. Pre-orders are set to go live in one week on January 30.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-more-details-on-what-s-new-in-wwe-2k26">More Details on What’s New in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> that CM Punk will serve as the centerpiece of this year’s 2K Showcase. Players can relive CM Punk’s iconic career moments and play through dream matches that might have occurred if he hadn’t departed WWE in 2014.</p>



<p>Additionally, Insider Gaming reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new match types are coming to WWE 2K26</a>. Of the four game modes, only one is debuting, while three others return. All of them are gimmick matches that are emblematic of the WWE Attitude Era.</p>



<p>The Inferno Match, where the objective is for one opponent to throw the other into flames surrounding the wrestling ring. Originally introduced in 2008’s WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, the mode disappeared after its inclusion in WWE 2K14 over a decade ago. </p>



<p>I Quit Matches are also slated to return to WWE Games, last seen in the aforementioned 2K14. That match type is an anything goes contest, where one opponent must make the other say the words “I Quit” into a microphone. That match type first appeared in WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role in 2000. It has been removed several times over the years.</p>



<p>3 Stages of Hell is another returning match type. First appearing in 2001’s WWF SmackDown!: Just Bring It, the unique take on a best two out of three contest, where each fall has a different stipulation, has not been a selectable match type since WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2006 in 2005.</p>



<p>The only new match type rumored to be coming to the game is the Dumpster Match. In that match type, one competitor must put their opponent inside a dumpster and slam the lid.</p>







<p>There’s currently no release date set for the game. It is expected to be playable on all current-gen consoles and PC via Steam. Insider Gaming will keep you up-to-date with the latest WWE 2K26 news.</p>
