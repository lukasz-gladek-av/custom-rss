            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming sources have revealed that Insomniac Games’ Wolverine is ready to be shown off for the first time officially since the 2021 PlayStation Showcase.</p>



<div><p>According to sources, who wished to remain anonymous as they couldn’t talk about company plans, PlayStation is currently planning its next State of Play event towards the end of September. </p><p>Other sources revealed that Insomniac Games’ Wolverine is “almost certainly” going to be at the event, as the production of its next trailer has now been completed. If the game doesn’t appear at State of Play, then the trailer will undoubtedly be released in the next few months, with The Game Awards being the next likely candidate.</p></div>



<p>Insomniac Games’ Wolverine faced <span>some issues in development following a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniac-games-alleged-ransomware-attack/" target="_blank">ransomware attack</a>&nbsp;in December 2023, during </span>which employee information and a substantial amount of game footage&nbsp;leaked online. The hack resulted in some changes to the game’s plans, but the extent of these changes is currently unknown.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, neither PlayStation nor Insomniac Games has revealed when Wolverine is set to be released, but fingers crossed, an answer awaits us in the coming weeks. The game is currently slated to release exclusively on the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>As for what else the next State of Play event could feature remains to be seen, but it’s likely to feature Bungie’s upcoming ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-bungie-befre-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a>‘, a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroidvania God of War</a> (Insider Gaming has it on good authority a mainline title is also in the works), Phantom Blade 0, and possibly even Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. If the State of Play is at the end of September as intended, then we’ll likely see a deeper dive into Ghost of Yotei, too, which releases on October 2, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dreamhaven is now the latest studio to lay off employees from staff, letting go of many staff members.</p>



<p>Today, the developer/publisher, who created Wildgate and Sunderfolk, announced layoffs made to the studio. As of writing, no specific number is out, but it’s likely a good chunk. Dreamhaven, led by ex-Blizzard cofounder Michael Morhaime, is a newer studio. The team only has a few titles under it, with the latest being the multiplayer shooter Wildgate. With that said, the layoffs are rather surprising and very unfortunate to those affected.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369069584328421376/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a LinkedIn post</a> by CEO Michael Morhaime, he announced the layoffs and some reassurance. He states in the post,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We made the hard decision to reduce the size of our company, with the primary impact on our Publishing group,” says Michael in the post. “These choices are never easy — they affect talented colleagues who have played a key role in building Dreamhaven’s foundation and supporting what has been an eventful year for us.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As mentioned before, the exact number of laid-off staff has not been disclosed. Regardless, it seems like support will be available, as severance packages and connections to future jobs have been given. As for its roster of games, the studio plans to continue to be supported, like Wildgate and Sunderfolk.</p>



<p>Already, this year has been full of layoffs and closures. Just last week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-holds-layoffs/">Crystal Dynamics</a> let go of staff following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-reportedly-could-have-been-saved-after-cancellation/">cancellation of Perfect Dark</a>. Hopefully, with new studios on the rise, those who lost their jobs can land back on their feet soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[007 First Light Deluxe Edition Details—Pre-Order Rewards Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-deluxe-edition-details-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-first-light-deluxe-edition-details%E2%80%94pre-order-rewards-explained.1288047/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>007 First Light has been revealed in full by IO Interactive, including the game’s release date and the editions that will be available when it drops. It’s coming next March, bringing a refreshing origin story to 007 fans worldwide. Following the release of a lengthy gameplay walkthrough, the 007 First Light Deluxe Edition was uncovered, benefits and all.</p>



<p>If you pre-order the 007 First Light Deluxe Edition, here’s everything you’ll get for your money…</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-007-first-light-deluxe-edition">What’s in the 007 First Light Deluxe Edition?</h2>



<p>Those who want a little more bling for their buck with 007 First Light will want to secure the Deluxe Edition, available to pre-order on PS5, Xbox Series, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>It’s an all-digital special edition, which means the bonuses and benefits are cosmetic-based.</p>



<p>Here’s what you get:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That’s four exclusive outfits, a new weapon skin for Bond’s trademark handgun, and a ‘Gleaming Skin Pack’ that equips 007’s earbuds, lighter, pen, and mobile phone with a gold skin.</p>



<p>I’m particularly interested in the exclusive outfits. I want to stalk my targets while trying to maintain my cover dressed as a skeleton in a top hat. I hope there’s some kind of lore to explain why that’s a thing. Perhaps I’ve missed a trick, but I’m hardly a James Bond fan!</p>



<h3 id="h-when-is-007-first-light-coming-out">When is 007 First Light Coming Out?</h3>



<p>During the gameplay reveal, IO Interactive also dropped the 007 First Light release date. The game is set to be released worldwide on March 27, 2026. That means there’s still quite a while to wait until it launches.</p>



<p>Are you going to pre-order the 007 First Light Deluxe Edition upgrade? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what your plans are.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>IO Interactive just revealed an in-depth walkthrough of 007 First Light, dropping more than half an hour of preview footage. It was a combination of a raw mission session followed by a gameplay breakdown, accompanied by commentary. The entire length and breadth of the game’s core mechanics were unveiled by the team.</p>



<p>During the walkthrough, my eagle eyes spotted something in the background. In one sequence, there’s a row of classic arcade games across the other side of a room, and one is none other than Freedom Fighters, the 2003 third-person shooter from IO Interactive and one of my favorite PlayStation 2 games.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-freedom-fighters-be-playable-though">Will Freedom Fighters Be Playable Though?</h2>



<p>If Freedom Fighters were to be playable as a game within a game, I think I’d lose my mind. I adored the shooter when it dropped more than 20 years ago, and it went on to influence games like Homefront.</p>



<p>Here’s a screencap from the trailer:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The 007 First Light preview was one that I’d seen previously at Gamescom, but this was the first time it had been made public. It also offered up the release date for 007 First Light, which is set to drop on March 27, 2026.</p>



<p>I’ve penned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-preview-hitman-as-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a full preview breakdown</a> of the walkthrough I received at Gamescom, but little did I know, IO Interactive would show the <strong>exact same preview </strong>to the world today! I didn’t see the Freedom Fighter cameo earlier, though.</p>



<p>007 First Light will drop next year, and fans of Hitman will be pleased with what’s on offer. It will also give 007 fans a look at a refreshing origin story for the legendary character.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-preview-hitman-as-james-bond/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-first-light-preview-i-couldn%E2%80%99t-stop-seeing-hitman-with-a-james-bond-skin.1287999/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I had the pleasure of attending a 007 First Light preview at Gamescom, where I got a glimpse of live gameplay of the highly anticipated, upcoming spy action-thriller from IO Interactive. The team from IO walked us through a brief mission to locate a target at a gala while undercover, but soon fast-forwarded to some intense car chase scenes.</p>



<p>This was one of the most ‘protected’ experiences I had at Gamescom, hidden away behind the scenes in an area mocked up as a theater flanked by a classic Aston Martin. However, for all the pomp and circumstance of the reveal, I couldn’t help but feel I was watching gameplay pulled from the next Hitman game.</p>



<p>Here’s my full 007 First Light preview.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-beginning-of-bond">The Beginning of Bond</h2>



<p>My 007 First Light preview opened with the IO Interactive squad setting the scene for the game. They explained that this is a brash, young, and somewhat inexperienced James Bond, fresh out of the military and working into what will become a legendary career as one of the most recognizable spy characters to ever emerge.</p>



<p>It was easy enough to see that concept surfacing in the first few minutes of the gameplay walkthrough at Gamescom. This James Bond was making quips, stepping out of his lane relatively early on, and perhaps fumbling where a more experienced 007 might not.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, as the sequence unfolded, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was watching a Hitman game on the big screen. It was also an early build, so a few bugs were present, emotionless NPCs were everywhere, and interactions felt a little flat.</p>



<p>It might be obvious at first blush, but both Hitman: World of Assassination, the most recent game in the series, and 007 First Light share an engine – Glacier. The visual palette is quite similar, but it goes beyond that, and a lot of the movement, UI, and underlying themes feel as though they’ve been ripped from Hitman.</p>



<p>As the IO Interactive team stalked the luxurious gala venue in Slovakia, trying not to arouse suspicion and searching for their target (in this case, 009), I felt as though I’d done the same thing a hundred times in the last 25 years in Hitman games. What’s different is that 007 is a cheeky British chap with a bit more agility than the gruff Agent 47.</p>



<p>Bond fans will absolutely appreciate the origin story that sees them shaping 007 and becoming acquainted with the likes of M, Moneypenny, and Q, but anyone coming into Bond from a Hitman background might feel a little short-changed. The timeline is also a little skewed. This is ‘young’ James Bond, but from the weapons to the vehicles, the game feels decidedly modern.</p>



<p>I <strong>should stress </strong>that these impressions are based on a short preview, so it’s perhaps unfair to tar First Light with such a tough brush this early on, but if I’m in the business of judging a book (game) but its cover (exclusive preview)…</p>



<p>But as the preview unfolded, I found myself nitpicking something awful. There’s not enough room here to expand on that.</p>



<h2 id="h-meat-on-the-bones">Meat on the Bones</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Car chases are high-octane but very scripted (Credit: IO Interactive)</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s tough to gauge how sizable 007 First Light will be, but I can see it having replayability value on account of the multiple approaches possible for each mission and situation. There are some extra modes attached to the game, like challenge runs, and the title seems to accommodate both lethal and non-lethal styles.</p>



<p>I witnessed Bond getting his ‘license to kill’ from MI6 first-hand, opening the door to a guns-blazing sequence that showcased the faster pacing of the game present in these scenes and car chases, for instance.</p>



<p>I was also privy to the game’s espionage mechanics, with Bond using distraction tactics, neat gadgets, and tricks of the trade like bluffing and persuasion to make his way to his target unimpeded. These are elements that <strong>you’d expect </strong>to see in a Bond game, of course.</p>



<p>I hate to play a broken record, but they’re also elements that are prevalent in Hitman. If you modded the game and replaced the all-new and original model of 007 with Agent 47, you’d probably not be able to tell the difference.</p>



<p>I want to highlight that I’m not <strong>disappointed </strong>with what I saw from 007 First Light; I’m just not yet convinced that it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-reveal-how-hitman-has-influenced-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standing apart from Hitman</a> enough for IO Interactive to push it as far as it can, especially as there’s a desire to make it a trilogy. I’ve always enjoyed the Hitman games, and I’d almost certainly enjoy 007 First Light, regardless of how familiar it feels.</p>



<p>For some, that familiarity is nothing but a good thing. It’s a comfort. I’m sure that with a fuller preview or a lengthy walkthrough, I’d have a much better sense of how First Light differentiates itself from Hitman beyond a few gadgets and heavily scripted car chases.</p>



<p>007 First Light is set to be released in 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. Let me know what you think about it on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
