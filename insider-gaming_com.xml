<p>Fortnite loves a good collab. miHoYo and Honkai: Star Rail are joining forces with the Fortnite goliath to create epic content for all players to experience through skins and more, and a release date is available.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/honkai-star-rail/" id="3565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honkai: Star Rail</a> is another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/hoyoverse/" id="95199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HoYoverse</a> success, with the free-to-play title continuing to dominate the scene over two years after its explosion into the universe. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/epic-games/" id="87655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games</a> smells success from a mile away, which is why a Honkai: Star Rail and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> collab makes too much sense NOT to do.</p>

<p><strong>The Fortnite and Honkai: Star Rail collab goes live on February 26.</strong></p>



<p>This isn’t a collab weeks away or months down the pipeline; the official announcement was revealed on February 6. In the same statement, ‘February 26’ was outed, and arrives one week after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-2-delayed-by-over-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now-delayed Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 2</a>.</p>

</ul>



<p>It’s not an extensive crossover, but fans of both franchises will be pleased with the upcoming content.</p>



<p>You can look forward to “A brand-new UEFN island and kick off a creator-involved collaboration tournament,” to celebrate the occasion.</p>

<p>Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 2 was supposed to arrive on March 4, 2026, but is now arriving on March 19. </p>



<p>Chapter 7 Season 1 of Fortnite introduces a bunch of new content, including a brand new island, new weapons, collaborations with Hollywood, including Back to the Future and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-to-feature-quentin-tarantinos-dream-kill-bill-chapter-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kill Bill</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Park</a> crossover, and so much more. It seems players will now have to spend some more time with this Season, until Epic Games works on CH7S2. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-7-season-2-now-arrives-on-march-19">Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 2 Now Arrives on March 19 </h2>



<p>A new post on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2019788648376393947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) by the official Fortnite Status account confirms that Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 2 will now release on March 19, 15 days later than intended. It also includes the caption “opens the loot vault &amp; starts cooking” with a ‘Let Him Build’ version of the Let Him Cook meme. It seems that Fortnite is hinting that they have something special in the works with the upcoming Season, and that’s the reason for the holdup. </p>



<p>Players have a little over a month until the next season begins, and there is a lot to look forward to. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-february-2026-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February roadmap</a> reveals details on events, maps, skins, collabs, and more coming throughout the month. Additionally, the game’s director has teased a “fun update” coming in February, which is designed to “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-director-teases-fun-update-to-spice-up-current-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spice things up</a>” in the current season. </p>



<p>In other news, Paul Heyman wants players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paul-heyman-wwe-2k26-play-instead-fortnite-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to play WWE 2K26</a> instead of Call of Duty and Fortnite. Additionally, Fortnite has teased a brand new collaboration <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-teases-brand-new-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Honkai Star Rail</a>.
