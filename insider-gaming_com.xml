<p>Prime Video’s God of War series has its Kratos.</p>



<p>The company announced on Wednesday that Ryan Hurst has been cast to play the lead protagonist Kratos in the upcoming series. The show is currently in pre-production with casting continuing.</p>







<p>Hurst is known for his roles as Opie Winston in Sons of Anarchy and Gerry Bertier in Remember the Titans. In the video game world, Hurst’s only role was as Thor in God of War Ragnarok. He was nominated for a BAFTA in 2022 for Performer in a Supporting Role for his depiction of the God of Thunder.</p>



<p>Speaking of Thor, according <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-series-thor-baldur-cast-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to recent reports</a>, Olafur Darri Olafsson is in talks to play the role in the series. The series will focus on the Norse saga from the 2018 God of War and the aforementioned Ragnarok. </p>



<p><strong>“God of War&nbsp;follows father and son Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye,” </strong>the show’s synopsis reads. <strong>“Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human.”&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>There’s been no word on when the series will debut. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The recent run of layoffs at Ubisoft are continuing as the company confirmed that it has let go a number of staff at its Abu Dhabi studio.</p>



<p>First reported by Game Developer, 29 people have been let go by Ubisoft. In a statement, Ubisoft confirmed the layoffs took place last year, and says it was based on a decision made in November. </p>







<p><strong>“In November, Ubisoft made the difficult decision to restructure its Abu Dhabi mobile studio, discontinuing some projects in order to focus on&nbsp;Growtopia,”</strong> they <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-ubisoft-laying-off-staff-at-abu-dhabi-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told Game Developer</a>.<strong> “As a result, this change impacted 29 team members.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“We remain deeply grateful for their contributions and are providing support to them throughout the transition.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the layoffs at the Abu Dhabi studio, Ubisoft has recently closed its Halifax location while also letting go dozens of other employees in Sweden and elsewhere. Regarding the Halifax closure, the union representing 61 of the staff impacted has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/union-files-legal-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-studio-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a legal complaint</a> against the company and is requesting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cwa-union-met-ubisoft-company-brought-nothing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transparency on claims</a> that the decision is out of financial necessity.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for clarity on its current plans and if more layoffs should be expected. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[CWA Union Met With Ubisoft, Says Company Brought “Nothing”]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The situation surrounding the recent closure of Ubisoft Halifax continues to get messier. Just one day after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/union-files-legal-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-studio-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filing a legal complaint</a> with the Nova Scotia Labor Board, CWA Canada, the union representing 61 of the 71 employees let go by Ubisoft, revealed that they met with the company on Wednesday.</p>



<p>However, the meeting, they say, resulted in no progress.</p>







<h2 id="h-cwa-says-ubisoft-came-without-documents">CWA Says Ubisoft Came Without Documents</h2>



<p>In a statement provided to Insider Gaming, CWA President Carmel Smyth said that the meeting on Wednesday morning was “disappointing”</p>



<p><strong>“Ubisoft came to the table with nothing,”</strong> she said. <strong>“No documentation proving financial distress, and no plan to find work at other Ubisoft operations or&nbsp;increase severance.”</strong></p>



<p>She added that they brought up the concern of those being out on parental leave being told that they wouldn’t qualify for the proposed two-month severance pay. But, instead of any progress towards a solution, Ubisoft reportedly told the union they will send their ideas on Friday.</p>







<p><strong>“It was frustrating,”</strong> Smyth said. <strong>“Their lack of preparation along with the fact that they gave no advance notice of the closure, makes us question their intentions and their commitment to treating people fairly.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“We continue demanding real information, and to get the answers and the compensation you deserve after 10 years with this company.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the statements on the meeting, the union sent a release claiming that Ubisoft received nearly $1 billion (C$980 million) in government tax credit subsidies from 2020 through 2024.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment on where things stand and its view on the meeting. As of writing, multiple requests have gone unanswered. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bully Online Gets Shutdown A Month After Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bully-online-shutdown-month-after-launch/</link>
            <guid>1406167</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you were interested in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bully-online-mod-is-now-live-in-ealy-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently released</a> Bully Online mod, hopefully you were able to check it out because it’s been shutdown. </p>



<p>In a Discord post, it was announced that the Bully Online project was ending development and being taken offline “forever”. That means the server is offline, the source code has been taken down, and all account data will be deleted, among other steps. </p>







<p>As far as why it’s being taken offline, that wasn’t revealed. However, it was promised that Swegta, the Youtuber leading the project, will cover everything “in more detail” in a video about it.</p>



<p>“For now though, know this was not something we wanted,” <a href="https://x.com/TheNathanNS/status/2011478101419544964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the announcement</a> reads.</p>



<p>Bully Online was a mod that was officially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bully-online-announced-huge-catch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced back in October</a> and released in mid-December. It featured free roam, custom vehicles, role playing, and over 60 mini games for players to enjoy with others around the world. The mod was also released as an open-source project, allowing anyone with the skills and ability to add to it overtime. </p>



<p>Unfortunately for fans, however, that’s all come to an immediate stop and the <a href="https://swegta.com/online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website to view</a> the mod is now offline.</p>







<p>As mentioned, it’s not clear, as of now, what the reasons behind the shutdown are. That said, it could be assumed that it has something to do with the developers of the original game, Rockstar.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will add to this story once an official update on why the project was ended is made available. Until then, leave your thoughts down in the comments on Bully Online being shutdown, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
