<p>Team Falcons and The MongolZ are the first teams to fall from the StarLadder Budapest Major playoffs after both being swept by more capable opponents. Their fixtures ended with a 0-2 scoreline, with Spirit knocking out Falcons and a dominant Vitality squad dispatching The MongolZ.</p>



<p>The fan-favorite sides had sparked hopes of an underdog run through the Budapest playoffs, but it simply wasn’t to be. These two spirited campaigns come to an end, and we move on to day two of the playoffs.</p>



<p>If you want to place a wager on what’s left of the playoffs, Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025.

<h2 id="h-first-eliminations-confirmed">First Eliminations Confirmed</h2>



<p>The grand final round of the StarLadder Budapest Major is fast approaching, and one team is lining up to walk away with a massive $500,000 prize. Before that arrives, another five fixtures, including the BO5 grand final, has to take place.</p>



<p>Team Falcons fell short after facing the daunting challenge of Team Spirit, who entered the playoffs in formidable form. Spirit was dominant out of the gate, sweeping the series 2-0 without too much fuss. </p>



<p>It was a similar story for The MongolZ, and despite dishing out earlier upsets against some capable sides, Vitality was just too quickly able to outmaneuver the Mongolian side. It was unsustainable, and another 2-0 sweep brought another chapter of the Major to a close.</p>



<p>The remaining matches are set to be blockbuster fixtures:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team Spirit vs. Team Vitality</li>



<li>MOUZ vs. FaZe Clan</li>



<li>Natus Vincere vs. FURIA</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s anyone’s game right now.</p>

<p>A leak for a game called Tomb Raider Catalyst has leaked online ahead of The Game Awards, where an announcement is expected.</p>



<p>The leak came courtesy of a Reddit post on the Tomb Raider subreddit, where images of both a remake, titled ‘Tomb Raider Legacy of Atlantis,’ and a new mainline game called ‘Tomb Raider Catalyst’ were posted from what appears to be Amazon Games listings. You can see both images below:</p>







<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-2-new-tomb-raider-games">2 New Tomb Raider Games</h2>



<div><p>The first Tomb Raider game, Legacy of Atlantis, will be a remake of the 1996 game coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The description of the game reads,</p><p>“Experience a stunning reimagining of Lara Croft’s 1996 genre-defining game with jaw-dropping visuals, modern gameplay, and new surprises that honor the spirit of the original.”</p></div>



<div><p>The second game, titled Tomb Raider Catalyst, will be coming sometime in 202,7 and it is described,</p><p>“Set in the wake of a mythical cataclysm that unleashed ancient secrets and awakened mysterious guardian forces, Tomb Raider: Catalyst follows Lara Croft on a new adventure across Northern India.</p></div>







<p>First announced in 2022, Tomb Raider has hardly seen the light of day since, with developer Crystal Dynamics going through a turbulent time with approximately 60 people being laid off this year alone.</p>



<p>What do you think of us getting two new Tomb Raider games by the end of 2027?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Rockstar Games firing controversy has been one of the biggest gaming stories of 2025. New developments have slowly trickled out about the firing of 34 Rockstar employees, but now the company itself has officially addressed the real reason that led to the action.</p>



<p>On November 24, Insider Gaming reported on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leaked-discord-messages-reveal-why-rockstar-fired-34-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked Discord messages revealing why Rockstar fired 34 employees</a>. Now, Rockstar Games has officially given its side of the story, and the reasons are very interesting.</p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-games-claims-employees-discussed-features-from-unannounced-games">Rockstar Games Claims Employees Discussed Features From Unannounced Games</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Does this change things? Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>







<p>Rockstar Games has given <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> a statement, voicing its own take on the employee firings scandal, which led to protests:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Rockstar Games took action against a small group of individuals, across the UK and internationally, who distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations. Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The only official title in development (that everyone knows about) at Rockstar Games right now is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-reveal-trailer-is-already-two-years-old/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. This will inevitably raise speculation about other games being worked on behind the scenes. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-4-remaster-former-rockstar-dev-niko-bellic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 4 remaster</a> has been discussed for the longest time, and you’d have to think <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-3-is-likely-says-lead-role-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption 3</a> is inevitable.</p>



<p>This statement comes less than 24 hours after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer declared that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-will-be-investigated-uk-prime-minister-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar will be investigated</a> due to a breach of union rights.</p>



<p>The Rockstar Games firing controversy looks to be far from over. Rockstar was hit with a legal claim shortly after the firings, and UK government action will only push the controversy further under the microscope. As always, Insider Gaming will continue to report on new evidence and developments in the ongoing case.</p>
