<p>Bethesda Game Studios has invested significant resources into Fallout Shelter, the popular mobile game that has since expanded to multiple platforms, boasting over 250 million downloads as of 2025. The staggering update has introduced a wealth of new content into the game, particularly on Steam, with new quests, characters, themes, and more being added in one comprehensive update.</p>



<p>The supersized update also introduces the first of many Fallout Shelter Seasons, new limited-time events that populate the game with new experiences, exclusive rewards, and a spin-wheel mechanic.</p>

<p>Fallout Shelter is a phenomenal mobile-first title for Fallout fans everywhere. It dropped before the launch of Fallout 4 in 2015 and has remained a staple of the series ever since. In Fallout Shelter, players are charged with building and managing their own vault, embarking on missions into the wasteland, levelling up vault dwellers, and repopulating a fractured planet.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588430/view/514102575975368959">blog post on Steam</a>, the team at Bethesda Game Studios revealed that the <strong>largest update yet </strong>has arrived in Fallout Shelter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Rejoice, Overseers – Fallout Shelter’s biggest update yet is here! Years of content previously only available on mobile is now available on Steam, including new questlines, characters, weapons, themes, and more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This atomic update includes the first Fallout Shelter Season, dubbed ‘Viva New Vegas’ in tribute to the second season of the Fallout television series. It also adds a new questline that mirrors the show perfectly, named Power Struggle. It features all the main characters of the show and boasts <strong>eight </strong>linear quests.</p>



<p>Fans of the show can even unlock CX404, the adorable pup adopted by The Ghoul, as a vault pet.</p>

<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 has concluded with a series between two titans: Team Vitality, the tournament favorite, and FaZe Clan, an unexpected entrant to the grand final. In the end, Vitality proved unstoppable, defeating FaZe Clan with a memorable 3-1 finish and securing back-to-back Major trophies.</p>



<p>The Major might be over, but Counter-Strike 2 isn’t. Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025.

<p>The grand final began with FaZe Clan picking Nuke, where they managed to edge out Team Vitality with a strong scoreline, presenting fans with promise in the earliest map of the final. However, Vitality quickly regained control, crushing FaZe 13-3 in the follow-up. From there, the French-led roster never looked back.</p>



<p>It was a decisive victory for Team Vitality, which has gone down in the history books after putting up one of the best single seasons in the world of esports this year. The team claimed the half-a-million-dollar prize and lifted <strong>another trophy </strong>in 2025.</p>



<p>This makes Vitality the first team since 2019 to secure consecutive Major titles, which is a perfect way to end the season. For FaZe, the loss is a bittersweet one. It was a rocky year for the team, and many had their doubts going into the tournament, let alone the grand final.</p>



<p>Fans of the organization were begging for a redemption shot at the final Major of 2025, but it just wasn’t to be.</p>



<p>Now, we start looking to the 2026 esports calendar and whatever comes next.</p>
