<p>The viral horror sensation Poppy Playtime is back with Chapter 5 and, in honor of Halloween, a new teaser is out. Furthermore, we now know some more on what to expect from the next chapter in the series.</p>



<p>Mascot Horror has been at the forefront of the indie scene for quite some time. Starting with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-megan-fox-matpat-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Five Nights at Freddy’s</a>, the genre has developed into an almost foolproof shot to success. Games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-shown-at-summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Choo-Choo Charlie</a>, Indigo Park, and Garten of BanBan have rose in popularity from following FNAF’s footsteps. One such series, Mob Entertainment’s Poppy Playtime, has been one of the bigger successes. With recognizable characters like Huggy Wuggy, Doey, and CatNap, fans worldwide have been anticipating the next chapter of the franchise. Fortunately, just in time for Halloween, we got a new teaser and some plot to go with it.</p>



<h2 id="h-meet-the-puppetmaster-in-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-s-newest-trailer">Meet the Puppetmaster in Poppy Playtime: Chapter 5’s Newest Trailer</h2>

<iframe title="Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 - Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGSn5cY0o3k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Mob Entertainment has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGSn5cY0o3k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released a new trailer</a> for <strong>Poppy Playtime: Chapter 5</strong>. While the video isn’t long, lasting less than a minute, it’s certain to make fans go nuts with theories and the like. There’s a lot to go off of, too, as specific locations like a science lab are shown along with mysterious goop and a burning Poppy billboard. Unfortunately, <strong>no pricing or release date was announced</strong>, though the game is <strong>now available for wishlisting</strong> on <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWlYYXJZYlJyb0NpWEF3X1dGUG5IeHRKckJqZ3xBQ3Jtc0tsTDBLdTh3TVpvdEJ3X20xRE1QWGdiVU9sR2hlQW5jS2dic29pNTNXdDhLNmtIaFRzSHVvMGMxSFRweFNDOU5NNF9Nd1hDYlhocjlVT3RMTTJzeDBXN3FPckRYcTEyeEZ3QnpMa2dlUGZFRWJ4YWdwcw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggywug.co%2F4oK8fPx&amp;v=NGSn5cY0o3k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> </strong>and the <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbUQ4eWZjbUNuWFVjbUxDY1o0b0pCeENRU3BuQXxBQ3Jtc0tsNkxVNzdqa1pFbllxV3ByR1hKZmFvVVdKSWFkSjl5RXF1NjUzd1JFZGtnLWhMMUV4UlhCaEZ4QjJIZ3YwaUtUenR4bFhiOGlhcWNQX2pxQXRkMEdBdGFDWXdyNGd5ZEN4Y3JjTEgwWGNrWl9WMHhVMA&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggywug.co%2F4qswKSW&amp;v=NGSn5cY0o3k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a></strong>.</p>



<p>However, we do know some information regarding the game’s plot. The game takes place after the events of Chapter 4. Mob Entertainment states on the official Steam page,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In Poppy Playtime: Chapter 5, players must prepare to face off against the deadly puppetmaster behind the horrifying events of Playtime Co. Solve devious puzzles and overcome dangerous obstacles as the true rotten heart at the center of Playtime Co. draws nearer. Traverse this new realm of shadows in a fight for survival (and the truth) with Playtime’s security system Huggy Wuggy in hot pursuit and separated from your only allies. Will you finally end this nightmare, or fall victim to the puppet master’s twisted madness?”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If Chapter 5 is as big as previous entries, we may see Poppy Playtime get back into the spotlight once again. Even if you haven’t played any games in the series, it’s sure to deliver some scares galore. Given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnitemares-2025-features-largest-ever-collabs-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite added Poppy Playtime</a> to its Fortnitemares this year, it’s a pretty good time to get into the series and an even better time to be a fan.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/advantage-wireless-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/advantage-wireless-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-review%E2%80%94pro-perfection-without-paying-full-price.1340587/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On paper, the&nbsp;PowerA Advantage Wireless Controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 seem like a more affordable way to enjoy the premium nuances of an official Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. PowerA has always excelled at delivering classy imitators, all while adding its own signature flair through creative designs and licensed crossovers.</p>



<p>When I was asked to check out PowerA’s Advantage Wireless Controller lineup of Switch 2 Pro controllers, it was a no-brainer. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-production-pipeline-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a>‘s official accessories have always been notoriously expensive—it costs <strong>$89.99 for another set of Joy-Con 2 controllers</strong>, for example! If you’re worried about investing a lot of money into a third-party accessory or peripheral device, I’m here to tell you that your doubts are in vain. Read on for my full Advantage Wireless Controller Switch 2 Controller review.</p>



<h2 id="h-pro-kemon-gotta-catch-em-all">Pro-kemon, Gotta Catch ‘Em All!</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It looks utterly gorgeous. Credit to PowerA</figcaption></figure>



<p>From the box to the packaging to the controller itself, this feels like a premium product. The <a href="https://www.powera.com.au/collections/all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerA</a> Advantage Wireless Controller is ‘Pro’ in every sense of the word. I reviewed the Pokémon: Mega Evolutions edition, but the range also features a more classic-looking ‘<strong>Black</strong>‘ design, in line with the actual Switch 2 Pro controller, and the more vibrant ‘<strong>Mario &amp; Friends</strong>‘ is a must-have for Mario fans. </p>



<p>As a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-first-year-revenue-estimates-hit-1-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> connoisseur myself, I had to have Mega Evolutions. It’s simply incredible to look at. The front-facing design is compartmentalized into Lucario, Pikachu, and Mewtwo segments. They team up and intertwine to create a canvas of cohesive colors, and they’re presented on, in essence, a smooth-shaven controller surface—<strong>It’s the ASMR equivalent of sleek architecture</strong>. </p>



<p>The main Y, X, A, and B buttons have a nice purple finish to align with Mewtwo’s colors, and the top of the device—where a centrally-placed USB-C slot awaits—has a lovely yellow finish wrapped around the curved edges. The analog sticks are where your thumbs will be the majority of the time. A stark opposite to the Pro controller is having grippy barbs around each rubber stick. They add an extra layer of grip, and give you a feel of control that its more expensive contemporary could learn a thing or two from.</p>



<p>Lightweight is the best way to describe the controller, and it sits beautifully in my hands. The buttons are clicky and responsive, and my only real reservation about the design is that the <strong>controller’s main functionality buttons are all in a line along the bottom of the controller</strong>. I don’t think PowerA has done this with previous Switch controller designs. Throughout my playtime with the device, I often found myself trying to press the ‘+’ button, thinking it was in the middle of the controller, only to be met with empty space. Again, it’s the <em>only </em>minor inconvenience I’ve encountered with the design and presentation, and you get used to it after a while.</p>



<h2 id="h-pro-performance-across-the-board">Pro Performance Across The Board</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Spoilt for choice? Credit to PowerA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The PowerA Advantage Wireless Switch 2 Controller will cost you <strong>$69.99</strong>, compared to the more eye-watering <strong>$84.99</strong> of the official Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. After countless hours with the Pokémon: Mega Evolutions controller, I don’t see any reason to pay the extra $15. Plus, you don’t get the novelty and variety of these bespoke designs.</p>



<p>In fact, the only major performance discrepancy of note is the <strong>battery life</strong>: You get roughly 40 hours for the official controller versus 30 hours with the PowerA model. It’s up to you if you think the extra money is worth a few more hours, but I charge my controller regularly, and I have immediate access to a USB-C cable next to the couch as a contingency for worst-case scenarios. </p>



<p><strong>PowerA has also thrown in a 10ft / 3m USB-C charging cable as a bonus.</strong></p>



<p>I tested the controller across a collection of my Switch games: Mario Kart World, Pokémon Scarlet, and Super Mario Party Jamboree. <strong>I experienced zero issues</strong>; the controller connected to my Switch 2 very quickly, and it behaves just like a Pro controller should. It also doesn’t skimp on the additional buttons, enabling you to reconfigure the controls. If you feel the X button is too far away for the game you’re playing and it’s compromising your playstyle, simply remap it to either of the GR/GL buttons.</p>



<p>The GR and GL buttons are present on the controller’s rear area of the handles, tucked inside. They sync up with your middle fingers and give you the liberty to tweak your setup. It also has real-time sensors and motion controls as standard—along with a C Button for Switch 2 GameChat.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict">Verdict</h2>



<p>Unless another pro controller comes along that narrowly edges out the Pokémon: Mega Evolutions design, this is easily my new, full-time Nintendo Switch 2 controller moving forward. The analog sticks are unbelievably satisfying to use and tailor-made to cushion your thumbs. The overall design is smooth, simple, light, and feels satisfying to use. The controller’s performance is absolutely what it needs to be, and unless you want to pay a few more dollars for additional battery life, you can’t go wrong with any of the PowerA Advantage Wireless Controllers For Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>I hope you enjoyed my Advantage Wireless Controller For Nintendo Switch 2 review. Let me know if you end up buying one of the controllers.

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix Looking At Buying Warner Bros. Discovery]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Netflix is looking into buying Warner Bros. Discovery, which could include the full library of Warner Bros. Games and intellectual properties (IPs).</p>



<p>The news <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-discovery-sale-potential-game-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes just over a week</a> after Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was opening up sales bids after it had received “unsolicited interest from multiple parties for the entire company.”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/netflix-exploring-warner-bros-bid-1236603687/">Deadline</a>, Netflix has hired investment bank Moelis &amp; Co to explore a bid for the company. It’s the same firm that helped with Skydance’s merger with Paramount. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-could-happen-to-warner-bros-games-under-netflix">What Could Happen To Warner Bros. Games Under Netflix?</h2>



<p>What’s unclear, though possible to happen, is if a Netflix acquisition would see all of Warner Bros. Games be assumed into Netflix Games. Currently, Warner Bros. Games holds major gaming franchises such as Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC Comics, Game of Thrones, and more. </p>



<p>Warner Bros. Games also owns multiple studios, including Avalanche Software, NetherRealm Studios, Rocksteady Studios, TT Games, and WB Games studios in Montreal, Boston, New York, and San Francisco. All of which would likely be included in any sale. </p>



<p>Netflix declined to comment to Deadline on the report. Insider Gaming has also reached out to Warner Bros. Discovery for comment on whether any sale would include the games division. Thus far, no response has been received.  </p>



<p>Netflix has attempted to make a dent in the games industry in recent years, but it has never fully gotten off the ground. That said, the company is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-is-doubling-down-on-its-gaming-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continuing to invest in gaming</a> on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dont-nod-netflix-major-ip-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various fronts</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think the future would hold if Netflix were to acquire Warner Bros. Games? Leave your thoughts down in the comments, and join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blue-ridge-hunting-is-six-one-publishing-first-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blue-ridge-hunting-is-six-one-publishing%E2%80%99s-first-game.1340488/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Six One Publishing, a new publishing wing from the team behind the Six One Indie Showcase, has announced the first game under its label. Introducing Blue Ridge Hunting, a co-op horror game set in the Appalachian Mountains from Jade Meadows.</p>



<p>Players will either go on the hunt solo or with up to two friends to follow the journey of Levi Chambers, <strong>“a disgruntled West Virginia native haunted by sightings of the infamous Mothman his entire life.”</strong> </p>



<p>The game, according to the press release, will explore themes of trauma, grief, and family through the lens of Appalachian folklore.</p>



<p><strong>“The Appalachian Mountains are steeped in some of America’s most chilling folklore, home to legendary cryptids and unexplained phenomena,”</strong> the game’s description reads. <strong>“Step into the boots of the Appalachian Investigation Group, a team dedicated to tracking these elusive creatures. Using a range of tools and equipment, gather evidence, follow the clues, and embark on high-stakes hunts based on real sightings and local legends.”</strong></p>



<p>Features of the game include (courtesy of Six One Publishing):</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Found Footage:&nbsp;</strong>A gritty retro/PSX art style inspired by early 3D horror and analog media.</li>



<li><strong>Always Listening:&nbsp;</strong>Creatures react to proximity voice chat and radio chatter. Communication is crucial, but dangerous.</li>



<li><strong>Into the Woods, Solo or Together:</strong>&nbsp;Explore the Appalachian wilds alone or with up to 5 players in online co-op freeplay mode.</li>



<li><strong>Bump In The Night:&nbsp;</strong>A narrative-driven story (1–3 players) following the Appalachian Investigation Group’s hunt for the truth.</li>



<li><strong>Experience The Legends:&nbsp;</strong>Face unique, intelligent creatures based on real Appalachian legends and folklore.</li>



<li><strong>Dark-Bluegrass Symphony:</strong>&nbsp;An original score that blends haunting melodies with Appalachian roots, amplifying the tension and tone.</li>
</ul>



<p>The game will launch first in early access and include a full story when 1.0 releases. There’s no release date just yet for Blue Ridge Hunting, but a demo is available now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2434930/Blue_Ridge_Hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Steam</a>, along with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jadecompany/blue-ridge-hunting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Kickstarter</a> to help with the game’s development. </p>
