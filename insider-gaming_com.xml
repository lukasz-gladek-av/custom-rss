<p>When was the last time you dove into Diablo Immortal? Following its bout of controversy upon release, namely, the egregious monetization practices that saw many spending hundreds to thousands of dollars on gems and power-ups for their miniature characters on-screen, I dropped the game. However, Blizzard has continuously updated and improved the experience since its launch. They recently dropped a few new updates, addressing player feedback. Here are the Diablo Immortal patch notes for the past week!</p>

<h2 id="h-is-diablo-immortal-worth-playing-now">Is Diablo Immortal Worth Playing Now?</h2>



<p>If you tried to play Diablo Immortal previously, specifically a year or so ago, then you’re probably a little jaded on the mobile ARPG. But if you’ve yet to try it, now’s an excellent time. At the end of last year, specifically in December, Blizzard pumped out a few updates that genuinely improved the game. There’s word the studio intends to reduce the overall cost of gems, too. That’s a huge boon to current and returning players.</p>



<p>If you don’t have a powerful computer or gaming console for Diablo IV and Path of Exile 2, then Diablo Immortal will suffice for the time being.</p>
