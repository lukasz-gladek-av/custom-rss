<p>After years of waiting, Hytale is finally available in early access. While there are vast differences between the Hypixel Studios title and comparisons are widespread, there are plenty of things Hytale does better.</p>



<p>Hytale is still very young in its lifespan, but there are already areas where the game has the edge over Minecraft, and Insider Gaming has detailed them here.</p>







<h2 id="h-8-things-hytale-does-better-than-minecraft">8 Things Hytale Does Better Than Minecraft</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Content galore. Image via Hypixel</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-crafting-from-storage">Crafting From Storage</h3>



<p>Is there anything worse in Minecraft than realising you have miscounted or forgotten a material, requiring you to trundle awkwardly back to your storage to collect what’s missing, and having to start the process all over again. In Hytale, that’s not an issue at all, as crafting will automatically pull in materials from nearby storage.</p>



<p>This is particularly useful if you’re yet to properly sort out all your storage boxes and have things randomly strewn all over the place, saving you a lot of time trying to find the particular item you’re missing.</p>



<h3 id="h-inventory-management">Inventory Management</h3>



<p>Second to the point above, inventory management in Hytale is a lot less stressful than Minecraft, and it’s extremely quick to dump and sort everything you’ve collected on a recent trip. Whether you grinded for food, ores, or random materials, you can shift everything into a box and organise it by type in just a few button clicks.</p>



<p>Similarly, it’s easy to stack resources that are already placed in a box, which means that you don’t have to spend a hefty chunk of time manually sorting things constantly.</p>



<h3 id="h-wildlife">Wildlife</h3>



<p>Minecraft regularly adds new wildlife mobs in annual updates, which has seen the array of creatures discoverable in the world increase significantly, but Hytale is certainly on the front foot with a wide array of animals already, and more in the pipeline.</p>



<p>From boars to fish, frogs to crows, owls to bears, moose to snakes, Hytale is packed full of animals to encounter already, with dinosaurs set to be introduced imminently, while previous development screenshots have shown off bison, antelope, and sabertooth cats. It really is a jungle out there.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Modders paradise. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-modding">Modding</h3>



<p>Minecraft’s modding scene is incredible for PC players, but Hytale has the capacity to be even better. In just a few days of early access, players have downloaded mods over one million times on Curseforge, and Hypixel Studios has made tools for modding the game widely available.</p>



<p>From quality-of-life adjustments to entirely new concepts, modding in Hytale has the capacity to be a game changer, providing a never-ending supply of experiences for all players in a similar way to Fortnite and Roblox.</p>



<h3 id="h-no-crafting-grid">No Crafting Grid</h3>



<p>Though Hytale has widespread comparisons to Minecraft, one of the biggest differences is crafting. While Minecraft requires you to arrange items for crafting in a particular design across a 3×3 grid, Hytale’s crafting requirements are more like Valheim, and it just requires you to have the necessary items.</p>



<p>It’s admittedly not too much of a problem in Minecraft, as you can get the game to put the crafting layout in automatically if you have the items, but Hytale’s approach is much easier to get to grips with.</p>



<h3 id="h-server-support">Server Support</h3>



<p>Like Minecraft, Hytale is heavily geared towards multiplayer, and, while custom servers are widely available in Minecraft, the process can be overwhelming, particularly for new players, and setting everything up can be quite a headache.</p>



<p>Hytale, which started life as a Hypixel Minecraft server, has tools available from the off that make joining a server, or connecting to one that you have purchased, extremely easy, and it’s quick and simple to jump into a new world.</p>



<h3 id="h-mantling">Mantling</h3>



<p>Minecraft’s blocky approach to the world can be difficult to navigate at times, with limited jump height and not much manoveurability, and while Hytale has a similar block-like approach, traversing the terrain is made a lot better with the addition of one simple feature: Mantling.</p>



<p>In Hytale, you can pull yourself up on a ledge that is within reach, which can be a lifesaver when trying to escape hostile mobs and PvP situations.</p>



<h3 id="h-plenty-more-to-come">Plenty More to Come</h3>



<p>At the time of writing, Hytale is only a few days out from being introduced to players in early access, and the content in the game so far is merely a drop in the ocean. With lots more to come in development and the promise of regular updates, there’s no telling what lies ahead for the future of the game.</p>



<p>That’s extremely encouraging in a world where Minecraft has arguably not adapted quickly enough to modern gaming, with updates taking a lot longer to come into fruition, particularly major tweaks to the game. It remains to be seen whether Hytale will continue on this path of updates post early access, but there’s a lot of excitement for what’s on the agenda.</p>

<p>Massive Entertainment has shared a message on social media confirming that Julian Gerighty, executive producer on The Division franchise, is stepping down and transitioning to a new role at Battlefield Studios. This takes Gerighty from Ubisoft to Electronic Arts, moving from one shooter series to another.</p>



<p>Gerighty has been at Ubisoft and Massive for more than 27 years and recently appeared in interviews talking about the future of The Division, making bold promises about The Division 3.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-division-s-executive-producer-is-moving-on">The Division’s Executive Producer is Moving On</h2>



<p>In a recent post on social media, Massive Entertainment shared the message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Today, we want to share that Julian Gerighty, Executive Producer on the Tom Clancy’s The Division franchise is heading off to a new adventure at Battlefield Studios. While we’ll miss him, his mark will live on at Massive and we’ll continue to bring hte world he’s been part of creating to our players for years to come.</p>



<p>Julian, your legacy is part of this studio and remember: once an Agent, always an Agent.</p>



<p>For our players, don’t worry. Our teams who built this world with Julian are still here, carrying it forward with an ambitious, unchanged commitment for the future with The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence, and The Division 3</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Days ago, Gerighty spoke on The Division 3, stressing it’s shaping up to be ‘a monster’ and suggesting it will have the same impact on the industry as the first Division game, released back in 2016.</p>



<p>Gerighty also posted on social media regarding his departure:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Agents! </p>



<p>Quick update from the Base Of Operations: It’s time for me to hang up my go bag (keeping the watch) as I go on another grand adventure. </p>



<p>The Division future burns bright, and I can’t wait for you to discover what the teams have been working on. </p>



<p>Long live The Division and Godspeed!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gerighty has worked at Ubisoft and Massive for more than 27 years, a role that has taken him from branding to to IP development, and from creative direction on games like The Crew to lead spots on games like The Division and Star Wars: Outlaws. He assumed his first role at Ubisoft in 1999 and pivoted to Massive Entertainment, which Ubisoft acquired in 2008, in 2014.</p>



<p>Battlefield Studios is the coming together of several studios under the Electronic Arts banner. The amalgamation of the teams was uncovered in the run-up to the October release of Battlefield 6, one of the most ambitious games ever created by the group of studios.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a post on social media, Battlestate Games has asked for <strong>your help </strong>picking upcoming collaborations and crossovers with other projects. This isn’t a request that’s exclusive to <strong>games</strong>, as the team asked for opinions on ‘games <strong>or</strong> projects’ that could be a ‘great fit’ for Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>It was recently suggested that an Escape from Duckov collaboration might be incoming, which honestly writes itself. But there’s a whole world of brands out there that would make perfect sense for an Escape from Tarkov collaboration.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-brands-do-you-want-in-escape-from-tarkov">What Brands Do You Want in Escape from Tarkov?</h2>



<p>Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, posted a message <a href="https://x.com/nikgeneburn/status/2012116918694752296" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a> asking fans for help:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>recently the team and I have been discussing potential collaborations with other projects, and I’d love to hear your thoughts. What game or project do you think would be a great fit for EFT for a collab with?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Escape from Tarkov, the pioneering extraction shooter that has been evolving for a decade, has typically steered clear of the typical collaboration topics that live-service games so regularly explore. It’s not a game known for skin packs, crossover bundles, or LTMs, which is something fans have been appreciative of over the years.</p>



<p>However, that looks set to change now that Escape from Tarkov is a ‘1.0’ title and is exploring more ways to monetize and expand.</p>



<p>Days ago, it was suggested by Team Soda and Bilibili that an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-tarkov-collaboration-coming/">Escape from Duckov x Escape from Tarkov crossover</a> is on the horizon. This would make brilliant sense, as both games are extraction shooters that mirror each other closely, but what other brands could surface or enter the space?</p>



<p>Fans were quick to make suggestions on social media under Buyanov’s post.</p>



<p>One suggested more alignment with similar games, like ARC Raiders and Gray Zone Warfare. Another suggested STALKER makes sense, but there might be something political preventing Russian and Ukrainian developers from joining forces.</p>



<p>In one comment, a user poked fun at Escape from Tarkov’s more prolific problems, writing: ‘Collab with Riot Games and add Vanguard anti-cheat.’</p>



<p>It’s unlikely we’ll see Escape from Tarkov become the next Fortnite when it comes to collaborations, but it’s cool to imagine the potential.</p>

<p>Resident Evil 5’s voice actor is teasing a new announcement coming this March, during the franchise’s 30th Anniversary. </p>



<p>Capcom’s next big title, Resident Evil Requiem, arrives next month on February 27, 2026. The developers just provided us with another trailer, showcasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-showcase-reveals-new-leon-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon Kennedy’s gameplay</a> in the process. However, after this title, what’s next for the franchise might be revealed during the 30th Anniversary event in March. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-5-s-sheva-alomar-teasing-something-for-march-2026">Resident Evil 5’s Sheva Alomar Teasing Something for March 2026</h2>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qdt1yu/eva_la_dare_va_from_sheva_alomar_re5_is_teasing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, the voice actor for Karen Dyer from Resident Evil 5, Sheva Alomar, has posted a cryptic video on their official <a href="https://x.com/KarenShevaEva/status/2011868483194392926" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The video’s caption states that “got a few fun things lined up for March. Stay Tuned!. Additionally, the video itself has another caption that reads “When you know something, but can’t share it with the world…yet.” </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Fans from the community have already started making all kinds of speculation from this post, with many hoping that this could be a tease for a possible Resident Evil 5 Remake. At the same time, there are also speculations that Alomar will star in another Resident Evil movie, with Resident Evil: Death Island’s writer, Makoto Fukami, mentioning in a 2023 <a href="https://www.fangoria.com/resident-evil-death-island-writer-would-love-to-take-the-carnage-to-antarctica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fangoria</a> interview that he would “love to bring back characters like Barry Burton or Sheva Alomar.” </p>



<p>Additionally, there was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-5-remake-not-in-development-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a claim</a> from last year that stated Resident Evil 5 Remake was not in development. Whatever this announcement is, players will have to wait until Resident Evil’s 30th Anniversary to know for sure, and all players are hoping that more games are announced this year. </p>







<p>In other news, PlayStation was recently seen promoting a strange Resident Evil rip-off, ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-promote-resident-evil-rip-off-ebola-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ebola Village</a>‘. Additionally, Requiem’s director has stated that the upcoming title is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-almost-like-having-two-games-says-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost like having two games</a>“.
