<p>Steam’s user review system can sometimes be overloaded with user bombing and other unfair measures and tactics. However, the writing has been on the wall for Football Manager 26 since its early access beta, and Steam’s all-time worst games list has sadly welcomed it with open arms.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-26-open-beta-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Manager 26 Open Beta</a> was supposed to signal the welcome return of FM. Anticipation quickly turned to agony after it was found that the game was a bug-ridden mess with an unintuitive UI. Problems quickly piled on problems, and the comeback turned into a nightmare. The full release arrived, and as expected, players weren’t happy with the final product.</p>







<figure><figcaption>It wasn’t worth the wait. Credit to Sports Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Developer Sports Interactive said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-26-was-helped-by-last-years-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Manager 26 Was Helped By Last Year’s Cancellation</a>. FM 25 was infamously delayed and canceled, putting a huge gap in the calendars of Football Manager fans.</p>



<p>Football Manager 26 launched to better-than-expected critical reviews. The FM community wasn’t as kind, and the game’s Steam store page was quickly filled with bad reviews, giving the game a ‘<strong>Mostly Negative</strong>‘ review reception.</p>



<p>This isn’t the end of the world, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-launches-to-mostly-negative-reviews-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 REDSEC launched to Mostly Negative reviews</a>. Yet, it’s still being enjoyed by countless users. For Football Manager 26, it went from bad to worse to <em>abysmal </em>very quickly.</p>



<p><a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/football-manager-26-is-one-of-the-worst-games-ever-rated-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FootballGamingZone</a> (through Steam250) found that <strong>Football Manager has moved to number seven on the all-time worst games list</strong> already. It’s better than Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight and FlatOut 3: Chaos &amp; Destruction at least, but it’s a sight for sore FM fans’ eyes.</p>



<p>Strangely, there was no major day-one patch for FM 26 either. Even though it’s <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/football-manager-26-riddled-with-performance-issues-on-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">riddled with performance issues on console</a>, it seems like fixes will be a slow rollout. This will surely risk the ire and patience of those who’ve committed to the game early doors.</p>



<p>This is no doubt a huge disappointment for you who’ve had to wait two years for Football Manager 26. Have you bought FM 26 in any way? More importantly, have you played it? Let us know what you think of it, what needs fixing, and if Sports Interactive has any hope of salvaging this mess through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-frustrating-challenges-fixed-or-reduced/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-most-frustrating-challenges-have-been-fixed-or-greatly-reduced.1345447/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve played Battlefield 6 online and willingly attempted to complete challenges, you’ve probably come across a fair few with difficult requirements—borderline impossible ones. EA and Battlefield Studios have rectified this with over 90 tweaks.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has countless Initiation objectives and other challenges spread across the game. This relates to Classes, specific weapons, game modes, and much more. If you’ve spent a ton of time on one or more challenges to no avail, you might finally be in luck.</p>



<h2 id="h-say-goodbye-to-annoying-battlefield-6-challenge-requirements">Say Goodbye To Annoying Battlefield 6 Challenge Requirements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We can see the light. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>A Battlefield Comms message confirms that “A total of 90+ adjustments to Challenges and Assignments” have been made—and they are active in-game right now.</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of the affected challenges:</p>



<ul>
<li>“<strong>Assault 2: </strong>Have Squadmates deploy on your Spawn Beacon. Reduced from 50 deploys to 5.</li>



<li><strong>Support 2:</strong> Revive teammates as Support. Reduced from 200 revives to 60.</li>



<li><strong>Conquest 3: </strong>Objective kills in a round of Conquest. Reduced from 30 objective kills in a round to 10.</li>



<li><strong>Explosives Expert 2:</strong> Get Multi Kills <em>(2+ Kills Onwards)</em> with explosives. Reduced from 20 Multi Kills to 5.”</li>
</ul>



<p>This list is exhaustive, to be quite honest. Engineers will be greatly pleased to hear that the infamous Engineer Specialist 3 challenge has been reduced. Repairing 6,000 Vehicle Health in one match has been slashed to just 1,000!</p>



<p>Also, many in the community are reporting that once matches are being completed, and challenges where you’ve now met the requirements (because of the reductions) are being unlocked automatically. Now’s the perfect time to start playing BF 6, and we have the best way to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-loaded-pc/">buy Battlefield 6 for cheap</a>.</p>



<p>Expect to see a lot of challenges suddenly start being completed and popping up.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Should it have taken this long to make such adjustments? Or is it better late than never, as previous BF games might have done?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-multiplayer-co-op/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Where Winds Meet is right around the corner, offering hours of entertainment, and we’ve got all the details on multiplayer and co-op in the title.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet has already achieved huge success in China, where it initially launched in December 2024, and is poised to make a global debut on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, launching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on PC and as a console exclusive on PlayStation 5</a>.</p>



<p>Multiplayer is a huge component of modern gaming, though it isn’t always present, and we’ve got all the details on the multiplayer situation in Where Winds Meet.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-where-winds-meet-have-online-multiplayer">Does Where Winds Meet Have Online Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of options. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Where Winds Meet offers various multiplayer modes, including PvP and campaign dungeons.</strong></p>



<p>The matchmaking social hub can host up to 30 players simultaneously, while campaign dungeons range in degrees of difficulty and support either five or 10 players.</p>



<p>There are also various multiplayer-only challenges spread across the map, though these are entirely optional and can be avoided.</p>



<p>In fact, all multiplayer in Where Winds Meet is entirely optional, and if you’d prefer a solely single-player adventure, there will still be over 100 hours of content to enjoy as a solo player.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-where-winds-meet-have-co-op">Does Where Winds Meet Have Co-Op?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Where Winds Meet supports online co-op for up to four players, while campaign dungeons raise that figure to either five or 10 players working together, depending on the difficulty of the dungeon.</strong></p>



<p>Co-op mode allows players to explore the world together, searching for historic traces, defeating bosses, solving puzzles, and participating in events.</p>



<p>All players in the session will receive rewards for first-time completion of side story or campaign tasks, while players within a certain range will receive rewards for solving puzzles.</p>



<p>There are some restrictions, however, as only certain quest items owned by the host are visible and usable, but all items will be restored to normal when you return to your own world.</p>



<p>Like all multiplayer in Where Winds Meet, co-op is optional and isn’t required, with the game offering plenty to solo players who don’t want to join up with others to tackle the world—though it can help to open a co-op lobby if you’re struggling with a specific boss.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dante’s Inferno 2 was expected to be the successor to EA’s new hack-and-slash franchise at the time. For whatever reason, it never happened, and it’s been on the shelf for the last 15 years. While some bits and pieces have come out over the years, we’ve now gotten a proper look at the canceled ‘Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio’&nbsp;title.</p>



<p>Dante’s Inferno was touted as the next big hack-and-slash game to rival the likes of God of War and Devil May Cry—it also looked and played a lot like the former. We used it in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-best-games-to-play-like-ninja-gaiden-4-top-hack-and-slash-games-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best games to play like Ninja Gaiden 4 list</a>, and despite the God of War comparisons, Dante’s Inferno reviewed decently, sold respectably, before a potential Dante’s Inferno 2 disappeared off the face of the Earth…until now.</p>



<h2 id="h-dante-s-inferno-2-would-have-been-the-second-game-in-a-trilogy">Dante’s Inferno 2 Would Have Been The Second Game In A Trilogy</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dante of War. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Dante’s Inferno saw Dante—a Templar Knight—battle through horrible monsters and bosses through the Nine Circles of Hell. Its combat, nifty camera angles, puzzles, and bosses were reminiscent of God of War.</p>



<p>A full report from IGN has dug deep into history and uncovered many lost tidbits about Dante’s Inferno 2. It includes screenshots, concept drawings, and how the game’s story would unfold—as well as a third game!</p>



<p>‘<strong>Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio</strong>‘ was the official title for the second game. IGN says it had: “A 240-page script penned by Assassin’s Creed 2 co-writer Joshua Rubin that outlines every stage, boss battle, and plot point planned for Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio.”</p>



<p>The sequel would also have shifted away from the God of War influences and looked to forge its own identity.</p>



<p>IGN’s report outlines and details every single level throughout the game, with the Seven Sins being a huge aspect, and how Dante would climb Mount Purgatory. Furthermore: “Visceral planned for Dante’s Inferno 2 to include <strong>co-op and multiplayer modes</strong>.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>What a ride it could’ve been. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another document uncovered finds that the sequel’s conclusion would set up the events of “Dante’s Inferno 3: Paradiso.” You can check out more details and screenshots in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-dantes-purgatorio-the-cancelled-sequel-to-eas-dantes-inferno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>‘s full findings.</p>

<p>Where Winds Meet is one of the biggest and most anticipated releases on the horizon in 2025, and we’ve got all the details on when you can preload the game to jump into the action.</p>



<p>After achieving vast success in China, Where Winds Meet <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases globally on November 14</a> on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC and PlayStation 5</a> as a console exclusive title, with millions of players already pre-registering for the game.</p>



<p>If you can’t contain your excitement and want to preload Where Winds Meet in advance so you can dive straight into the game on launch, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-can-you-preload-where-winds-meet">When Can You Preload Where Winds Meet?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nearly there. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Preloads for Where Winds Meet will be available from November 12 at 2 PM PT, NetEase has confirmed to Insider Gaming.</strong></p>



<p>This gives you plenty of time to download Where Winds Meet in advance for launch, and preloading is recommended due to the large file size and the fact that servers will likely be stretched by an influx of players the moment the game goes live.</p>



<p>The table below shows when preloads for Where Winds Meet will be available in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Where Winds Meet Preload Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">2 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">9 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Standard Time (AST)</td><td data-align="center">7 AM – Nov. 13</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-where-winds-meet-file-size-explained">Where Winds Meet File Size Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Exact file sizes for Where Winds Meet depend on your platform, with PC users having several options to download, while PlayStation 5 has a single version.</strong></p>



<p>Users on PC have three different versions to choose from, with the Lite version clocking in at 68 GB, the Standard version requiring around 100 GB of space, and the Ultimate version requiring 120 GB—though the Ultimate version of the game may not be available immediately.</p>



<p>For PlayStation 5 players, the download size is around 108 GB total, and there are no other options for the download. </p>



<p>Bear in mind that these sizes are subject to change and could increase with day-one patches.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-where-winds-meet">How to Preload Where Winds Meet</h2>



<p><strong>If you want to preload Where Winds Meet, you can do so by visiting your platform store once the preload has been made available.</strong></p>



<p>On Steam, simply search for ‘Where Winds Meet’ in the store and find the preload option, which is available without needing to spend any additional cash due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-price-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">title’s free-to-play status</a>.</p>



<p>The approach on PlayStation 5 is similar, requiring you to search for ‘Where Winds Meet’ in the PS Store, though make sure you click the right version, as there is a paid-for pre-order edition that provides additional rewards.

<p>The Letters feature is accessible from the main menu within the game as an option to select on the right-hand side of the same screen where you can change your gear and skills, view quests, and change appearance.</p>



<p>It’s worth keeping an eye on your Letters in-game, too, as there will be a bunch of rewards to claim throughout your progression in the game.</p>
