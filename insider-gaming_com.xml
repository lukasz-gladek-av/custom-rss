            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/lat-scrap-and-ghosty-interview-cdl-super-team/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The LA Thieves just destroyed the Miami Heretics on (sort of) home turf, pushing them down into the elimination bracket following a complete sweep. The 3 – 0 scoreline was probably easy enough to predict, but it came a little closer than some would have expected, with the Heretics putting up a considerable fight.</p>



<p>In the aftermath of the win, which pushed LA Thieves further towards the grand final, I caught up with Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe and Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst to learn how they were handling the expectations of being the CDL’s ‘Super Team’ this season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shouldering-it">Shouldering It</h2>



<p>For the opener, I asked Scrap and Ghosty whether they felt extra pressure trying to live up to these lofty expectations and whether they believed they <strong>had</strong>. In the run-up to the CDL kicking off, the LA Thieves’ squad was billed as being a Super Team, with Nadeshot making it very public (even if in jest) just how much securing the talented roster had cost the organisation.</p>



<p>Here’s what they had to say:</p>



<p><em><strong>Ghosty: </strong>I feel like there’s always a sense of pressure as a competitor to be the best version you can be. There’s definitely more external pressure from other teams, fans, whatever – but it still doesn’t amount to the personal pressure you put on yourself as a competitor.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Scrap: </strong>For myself, from how much shit I talk, there’s just pressure from the whole community on me, no matter what team I play for. People can call us a Super Team, yeah, I’ll call myself a Super Team because <strong>my team is godlike</strong>. You know, we have pressure on us, but we go into every match taking no-one lightly.</em></p>



<p>Following that, Scrap walked me through his growth in the CDL since entering the League as a rookie during the MWII season. He was painted as (and loved being) the villain, going on a notorious arc that set his profile ablaze.</p>



<p><em><strong>Scrap: </strong>I don’t think I’ll ever change. Honestly, I’m just being myself up on that stage, to be honest. If it comes out, it comes out. I feel like over the past couple of years in the League I’ve grown into more of a leadership role of a sort, not like the kid that just flies around. Now that I’m on a younger team that has a lot of young players and I’m just trying to work as best around them.</em></p>



<p>Like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-shotzzy-wants-more-eu-majors-thanks-to-madrid-crowd/">OpTic Texas’ Shotzzy</a>, the pair agreed that the crowd in Madrid is one of the most energetic they’ve ever seen, and they are ‘down for some more’ EU tournaments.</p>

<p>Fallout New Vegas and Horizon Zero Dawn lead writer John Gonzalez has announced he will be retuning to Obsidian after 14 years. </p>



<p>The announcement came via his LinkedIn profile, where he was quick to shoot down impending rumours of Fallout New Vegas 2, by simply saying, “No, it’s not Fallout: New Vegas 2.”</p>



<p>As for what Gonzalez is working on remains to be seen and could ride on the success of the studios next two upcoming games, Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2. If tremendously successful, he could be working on a future sequel.</p>



<p>However, Obsidian Entertainment has also released some stellar games in the past few years, including Pentiment, Pillars of Eternity, and Grounded, so he could also be working on a sequel to those, or a new IP entirely. But for now, all we know if that he’s not working on New Vegas 2… Apparently.</p>



<p>What do you think Gonzalez is working on? Would you like to see a Fallout: New Vegas 2? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p>Ubisoft has revealed that Far Cry: New Dawn, the 2019 post-apocalyptic title, is getting a 60 FPS update on both Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 platforms. Fans of the franchise were quick to point out how ‘random’ the update is, with some stressing that other Ubisoft titles are in sore need of similar attention from the developer.</p>



<p>It was recently confirmed that on February 4, Far Cry: New Dawn will land on the Game Pass subscription service, which could go some way to explaining the performance upgrade.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-smoother-is-better">Smoother is Better</h2>



<p>It has taken six years, but Ubisoft is finally getting around to upgrading one of the most underrated Far Cry games ever made.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of the franchise, and New Dawn was a welcome addition to the series. Given that I love anything rooted in a post-apocalyptic environment, it made sense that New Dawn spoke to me quite nicely. </p>



<p>It’s set in the aftermath of Far Cry 5, which sees the player plunged into a bunker as nuclear war erupts across the world. What emerges after the bombs have fallen is something incredible – a world taken over by nature, roving bandit gangs, and settlements of survivors trying to get by.</p>



<p>It’s far outside the standard expectations of the Far Cry series, and it’s a twist on the post-apocalyptic vibe like no other. This isn’t a drab, woeful world like the ones portrayed in Fallout or Metro, for instance. It’s bursting with colour, representing an oversaturated take on the end of the world.</p>



<p>The 60 FPS upgrade on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 is a welcome thing, and it might be enough to pull me back in for another loop around the game when it lands on Game Pass next week.</p>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://x.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1885437595527557264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft announced</a> that ‘this wasn’t how (they) planned’ to reveal the upgrade. They had to cut off ‘FPS Boost’ on Xbox consoles to roll out the change, and assuming that players would notice that, they were forced to make the announcement early.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-dead-ninja-marvel-rivals/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98overwatch-is-dead-and-gone%E2%80%99-ninja-thinks-marvel-rivals-has-killed-the-competition.1097709/</guid>

<p>As Marvel Rivals has gone from strength to strength, the game’s main competitor – Overwatch – has floundered. Since being released by NetEase in December, Marvel Rivals has taken the gaming world by storm, racking up tens of millions of players and sitting proudly atop social and streaming charts worldwide.</p>



<p>Overwatch 2 is struggling by comparison. From concerns about the game’s player count to the lack of meaningful updates, the hero shooter that once stood atop the genre is imploding.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-overwatch-2-launch-was-abysmal">‘The Overwatch 2 Launch Was Abysmal’</h2>



<p>During a recent stream, Ninja broke down the state of play for Marvel Rivals and Overwatch. He stressed that Overwatch 2 has been in a pit since it was released in October 2022, which is accurate. It was seen by many as being ‘Overwatch 1.5’, and even a pivot to a free-to-play operating model didn’t do much to revive the game’s prospects.</p>



<p>He referenced the Overwatch 2 launch being ‘abysmal’ and then went in against the game, stressing that Marvel Rivals is taking over right now.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Overwatch is dead and gone.</p>



<p>It’s so unfortunate. Here’s the thing — first off, they already have a new map coming, which is incredible. Second, they have so much lore and so many heroes and villains and anti-heroes that they have enough for updates for the next ten years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hero shooter space is booming right now. Marvel Rivals is in a league of its own, but fans of the genre are still enjoying and anticipating the imminent arrival of Valve’s Deadlock, which has received global praise from some of the biggest streamers in the business.</p>



<p>VALORANT, a hero shooter with a serious esports ecosystem, is also enjoying rampant growth and popularity.</p>
