<p>Disney Plus users have spotted a dedicated section for Marvel Rivals on the streaming platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1888862600244699555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Culture Crave</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-own-disney-plus-section/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>), the new category on Disney Plus has been titled “Featuring Characters from Marvel Rivals”. It includes three movies: Captain America: Civil War, Thor: Ragnarok, and Doctor Strange: The Multiverse of Madness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These three Disney movies feature a massive chunk of the Marvel Rivals roster but not all the heroes and villains. Civil War features characters like Captain America, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Black Panther, and Black Widow. Ragnarok features Thor, Loki, Hulk, and Hela. Lastly, the Multiverse of Madness has other characters from the roster, including Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch, and Mr. Fantastic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Marvel Rivals promotion on <span>the</span> streaming platform might help the game gain more traction; however, it has been doing pretty well since its release. The hero-shooter quickly became popular with its big roster, familiar faces, and exciting gameplay. It managed to soar on the Steam charts and has retained its position as one of the platform’s <a href="https://steamdb.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">top 10 most-played games</a>, according to SteamDB.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players might soon see categories like “Movies and TV shows based on Marvel Rivals game” on Disney Plus. We already know that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-comic-book-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comic book</a> is in the works, and there’s a chance we could get other adaptations, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Ninja thinks Marvel Rivals <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-dead-ninja-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has killed Overwatch</a>. Also, the developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-fake-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly hide fake heroes</a> in the files to catch leakers.

<p>Valve has a new dedicated page that explains what types of advertisements are supported and not supported on Steam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Steam has always had these advertising rules. However, recently, a <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new page</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gaming on Linux</a> has appeared to explain these rules and clarify that the platform doesn’t contain paid advertising or models. The page also explains what constitutes “advertising” in a game, what types of ads developers can implement, and what advertisements shouldn’t be in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-types-of-ads-are-allowed-on-steam">What types of ads are allowed on Steam?</h2>



<p>Steam allows ads with product placement, which includes “real brands, products, personalities, etc., as part of gameplay.” This advertising is accepted when it does not disrupt anything and matches the context of the game—for example, sponsor logos in sports games like football, Formula 1, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cross-promotions are also allowed, such as promoting bundles, sale events, and more. Players can also include other Steam products or products/brands outside of Steam; however, it’s not allowed “to charge other developers to participate in a bundle or to sell access to a sale page or other page on Steam.” Lastly, developers can also run paid advertising campaigns to increase traffic to their Steam product pages.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-types-of-ads-are-not-allowed-on-steam">What types of ads are not allowed on Steam?</h2>



<p>Coming to the ads that will lead to your game being banned on Steam. Devs are not allowed to “utilize paid advertising as a business model in their game,” meaning you can’t entice players into watching ads to play or gate gameplay behind it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the game’s business model depends on advertising, the developers must remove those elements before releasing it on Steam. They can also create a single-purchase “paid app” or use microtransactions and DLCs by making the game free to play.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the wrong use of advertising, such as creating value for the player, will not be allowed. This means developers can’t put rewards or unique content behind ads on Steam games. Lastly, developers cannot “charge other developers for access to Steam features. These include sale pages, bundles, store pages, franchise pages, etc.”</p>



<p>In other news, Steam now warns players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-warning-buying-abandoned-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before they purchase an “abandoned” game</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wreckfest 2 is arriving</a> on the platform on March 20. What are your thoughts on Valve’s advertising rules for Steam games?
