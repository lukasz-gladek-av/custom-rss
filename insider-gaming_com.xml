<p>A significant development has transpired in Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against Palworld, as one of their patents is being reexamined by the US Patent Office. </p>



<p>For those wondering, in September 2025, Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-acquires-another-patent-for-character-summons-as-palworld-lawsuit-continues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired a patent</a> amid its lawsuit against Palworld. The patent in question, US Patent No. 12,403,397, relates to summoning characters and allowing them to engage in combat against one another. Now, the USPTO director has personally ordered the office to reexamine the patent. </p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-patent-against-palworld-is-being-reexamined-due-to-two-prior-art-references">Nintendo’s Patent Against Palworld is Being Reexamined Due to Two Prior Art References</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesFray</a>, USPTO Director John A. Squires has&nbsp;personally&nbsp;ordered,&nbsp;at his own initiative, that the organisation reexamines Nintendo’s patent against Palworld due to two older US patent applications. US Patent No. 12,403,397’s claims 1, 13, 25, and 26 are the ones under review, and if they fall, then the other ones will fall as well, like “a house of cards.” The reexamination is being conducted due to the failure to cite prior art references in support of the issuance of this patent </p>



<p>The two prior art references have been specified as well. Nintendo’s ‘397 patent is related to character summons in combat, and it seems Konami and Nintendo itself have patents that can be considered prior art. Konami’s patent application was filed in 2001 and published in 2002. The other is Nintendo’s own patent application, which was filed in 2019 and published in 2020. Both of these prior art references “teach a player being allowed to perform a battle in a manual mode and in a simpler, automatic mode.”</p>



<p>For those wondering, reexamination doesn’t mean the patent will be revoked. Nintendo will have two months to come up with a response, and during that time, third parties can also present challenges through other prior art references. Moreover, if Nintendo tries to sue over patent ‘397 in a United States District Court, the “court would stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the reexamination.”</p>



<p>The director initiated the order for Ex Parte Reexamination to address the element that the original examiner believed made Nintendo’s patent distinct from the prior art. Moreover, there might not be any more developments in Nintendo’s lawsuit against Palworld in this calendar year. But, 2026 should see some decisions come into play by Presiding Judge Motoyuki Nakashima. </p>



<p>Regarding the lawsuit, one of Nintendo’s anti-Palworld patents was recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendos-anti-palworld-patent-application-gets-rejected-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rejected in Japan</a>. Additionally, the Switch 2 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-10-million-sales-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed 10 million units sold</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout-Like MMO ‘PIONER’ Launches Open Beta on Steam]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-open-beta-fallout-live-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-like-mmo-%E2%80%98pioner%E2%80%99-launches-open-beta-on-steam.1343116/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PIONER is an ambitious, post-apocalyptic MMO FPS that fuses PvE and PvP mechanics, crafting, and customization to bring players a memorable experience that’s just a <strong>bit </strong>reminiscent of other games. It has been compared to a combination of Escape from Tarkov and Fallout in the past, and it’s easy to see why.</p>



<p>In PIONER, players contend with a grim, desolate world teeming with threats, all while exploring an immersive story that promises to offer stacks of opportunities to dig into the game’s ecosystem. The developer, GFA Games, has just announced that PIONER’s open beta is available now, exclusively on Steam.</p>



<h2 id="h-pioner-s-open-beta-is-live-now">PIONER’s Open Beta is Live Now</h2>



<p>If you want to sample all the dark, destructive things that PIONER has to offer, you’ll want to jump in now and explore the open beta, available on Steam until November 11.</p>



<p>In a press release, the team at GFA Games said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Players can now explore the dangerous and mysterious Tartarus Island and experience the game for free ahead of its full release, planned for late 2025. This is the next step in the ongoing development of this highly anticipated title, following a series of successful closed beta tests to which selected players have been invited over the past few weeks.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GFA Games is a Serbian studio made up of developers who formerly worked on games like STALKER and Atomic Heart.</p>



<p>PIONER’s open beta will offer around 30 hours of content, including the first five acts of the story campaign, which will give players the lay of the land when it comes to factions, points of interest, and more. There’s a hefty PvE raid available, as well as a PvP deathmatch portion for the players who want an added challenge.</p>



<p>Players can explore three huge missions, taking on a world boss and getting a taste of the full scope of PIONER.</p>



<p>PIONER is set to be released later this year, but doesn’t have a confirmed date at present. It’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">coming to Steam</a> first, but GFA Games has promised that console versions are coming later.</p>
