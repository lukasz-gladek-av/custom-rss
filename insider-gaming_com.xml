            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-march-2026-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-confirms-bungie%E2%80%99s-marathon-will-launch-by-march-2026.1349656/</guid>

<p>Sony has once again reconfirmed that Bungie’s extraction-based shooter, Marathon, will launch by March 2026.</p>



<p>The confirmation came during the company’s quarterly earnings call, where Sony’s CFO, Lin Tao, said that Bungie’s Marathon was still in active development and that the company was “fully dedicated” to launching the game in the current fiscal year. Sony’s fiscal year ends March 2026, suggesting that Marathon will likely launch sometime in February to March, if we were to guess.</p>







<p>Marathon has had an uphill battle since it was first announced earlier this year, with the game struggling to captivate players and the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facing a slew of plagiarism allegations</a>, of which Bungie later admitted. The issues facing the gam<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-delayed-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> led to a delay of an undisclosed length</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-but-is-marathon-good-now">But is Marathon Good Now?</h2>



<p>However, as recently as the game’s latest playtests at the end of October, which were apparently under NDA, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-leaks-closed-test-reveal-positivity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie has apparently been able to turn things around</a> with its game. </p>



<p>According to those who played the latest version of the game, it’s apparently in a much better state now, with players looking forward to its release in the coming months.</p>



<p>The game was said to be a ‘significant improvement’ since the playtests in the summer, yet the game still had some minor issueswhich were said to be easily fixed.</p>



<p>Whether Marathon will be a success on launch remains to be seen, but with GTA 6 now slipping into November 2026 and the start of the year seemingly being relatively quiet now, it could launch to some interest. </p>







<p>ARC Raiders is clearly the game’s most immediate competition, but if Marathon launches in March 2026, ARC Raiders’ playerbase and hype will likely have whittled down considerably. </p>



<p>Are you looking forward to giving Bungie’s Marathon another go when it releases? Let me know what you’re thinking on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite is set to make a controversial addition in a future update, it’s claimed, with gambling mechanics set to be directly added to the title.</p>



<p>Huge updates are on the cards for Fortnite with Chapter 7 due to kick off later this month, and the annual switch in chapters usually results in the biggest gameplay changes of the year.</p>



<p>While we’ve already seen leaks suggesting huge collabs with the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob Squarepants</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a> are on the cards, the apparent addition of gambling will ruffle some feathers.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-will-add-gambling-mechanics">Fortnite Will Add Gambling Mechanics</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big deal. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1988203466146410851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reliable leaker ShiinaBR</a>, gambling mechanics are “coming soon” in Fortnite and will be available to games created using the Unreal Editor in Fortnite.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear whether official Fortnite experiences will support gambling, or whether content link loot boxes will be added to the Item Shop, but it appears that it will be available in community-created experiences.</p>



<p>According to leaks, random items will be purchasable with V-Bucks, but creators will be required to disclose gambling odds—something commonplace in gaming to align with international laws. Additionally, due to laws in some nations, experiences with gambling involved will be blocked in some nations.</p>



<p>While gambling aspects are already available in some user-created experiences within Fortnite, including pet eggs with a rare chance to hatch specific creatures in games like Pet Heroes Adventure, the major difference is that these are paid for with in-game soft currency that is not purchasable.</p>



<p>With this update, V-Bucks will be directly available to spend on items that provide random rewards, though it’s unclear at this stage what exactly that will entail, and it will likely depend on the experience being played.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bethesda’s Latest Update is Awful News for Fallout Fans]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-fans-awful-news-bethesda-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda%E2%80%99s-latest-update-is-awful-news-for-fallout-fans.1349554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard revealed that The Elder Scrolls 6 is still ‘a long way off’, despite being revealed almost a decade ago. It’s dire news for fans of The Elder Scrolls, who haven’t received a new ‘numbered release’ since 2011’s Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</p>



<p>However, in a twist that might displease post-apocalyptic fans, the knock-on impact of this news is that Fallout 5 will be <strong>even further away </strong>than anticipated. The studio’s production line will see The Elder Scrolls 6 on the market before Fallout 5 even enters meaningful development, which is a big issue for fans of the decades-old series.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-5-could-be-ten-years-away">Fallout 5 Could Be Ten Years Away</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with GQ around the tenth anniversary of Fallout 4, celebrated by the release of the Anniversary Edition, Todd Howard touched on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-is-still-a-long-way-off/">increasingly long development window</a> of The Elder Scrolls 6. He suggested that the open-world RPG is a long way off and that fans should be ‘patient’.</p>



<p>This presents a tricky issue for Fallout fans.</p>



<p>While Fallout 76 is here and still receiving massive updates, a numbered Fallout release (by that I mean Fallout 5) is likely several years away from being released, if it ever surfaces at all.</p>



<p>We know that the team is working on ‘more Fallout’, but that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-more-than-a-decade/">doesn’t necessarily mean Fallout 5</a>. It most likely means <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remastered-begging-bethesda-fallout-3-remastered-game/">Fallout 3 Remastered</a> or a New Vegas project.</p>



<p>It has been known for several years that Bethesda Game Studios’ running order would take them from Starfield to The Elder Scrolls 6 to Fallout 5. Given that we don’t have a <strong>release year </strong>for The Elder Scrolls 6, it could be a while before it hits the market. That means that for as long as it takes to get out the door, Fallout 5 will take even longer to appear.</p>



<p>Presently, we know <strong>nothing </strong>about Fallout 5. There’s not a shred of information to share aside from knowing that Bethesda Game Studios has a core concept for the game.</p>



<p>Bad news, apocalypse fans – you’ve got a while longer to wait.</p>



<p>Are you eagerly awaiting the arrival of Fallout 5? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/embark-reveals-arc-raiders-player-count-steam-majority/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embark-reveals-arc-raiders-player-count-and-64-of-them-are-on-steam.1349548/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders continues to impress, and the player count is not only holding firm as the game’s lifecycle pushes on – <strong>it’s growing</strong>. The game has gone from strength to strength, and with a roadmap of content sitting on the horizon alongside that positive community sentiment, the game shows no signs of slowing down.</p>



<p>Recently, Embark Studios revealed that the game hit a concurrent user count of 700,000 players over the weekend across all platforms. From the data we’ve collected, we know that a whopping 64% majority of those players were present on Steam.</p>







<p>The extraction shooter genre (however <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-marathon-director-extraction-shooter-dumb/">dumb the name may be</a>) has always been front and centre on PC. From Escape from Tarkov to Marauders, and from Gray Zone Warfare to Arena Breakout: Infinite, the PC platform loves an extraction title.</p>



<p>The latest addition to the lineup is ARC Raiders, released on October 30 and introducing an all-new concept to the genre, a ‘post-apocalyptic’ setting backed by an AI-powered robotic threat.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, but the latest figures revealed by Embark Studios paint a particular picture.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey Raiders!<br>It's been a little over one week since we opened up the tunnels for you to head Topside, and this past weekend we reached over 700,000 concurrent Raiders on the surface! 🥳<br>We're so happy to have you all here!<br>The many different ways you play and participate in ARC… <a href="https://t.co/Do6bAhWf4o">pic.twitter.com/Do6bAhWf4o</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1987930324156678210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>More than 64% of players are on <strong>Steam</strong>, showing that adoption is perhaps lacking somewhat on PlayStation and Xbox. With a market share of just 36%, console players are showing a lack of investment in the exhilarating extraction shooter.</p>



<p>It’s a fair statement, as the ‘extraction shooter concept’ is new to console-exclusive gamers. Until now, almost <strong>nothing </strong>with this operating model has appeared on console, save for failed titles like Call of Duty’s DMZ.</p>



<p>If you’re reading this and wondering if you should try ARC Raiders on console but are sceptical about the genre, let me point out that this is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-highest-rated-multiplayer-shooter/">highest-rated multiplayer shooter</a> in almost a decade.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders continues to sit high on the charts. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you intend to invest in the game.</p>

<p>In the last ten years, the concept of the extraction shooter has skyrocketed in popularity. It has become a staple of the industry, and many developers have had a stab at it. We’ve seen extraction shooters set in post-apocalyptic wastelands, war-torn suburbs, and even the depths of space.</p>



<p>The genre hasn’t impressed everyone, though. It’s a challenging, unwelcoming concept that puts some players off investing entirely, and others feel it has been overdone in recent years. One former director of Bungie who worked on Marathon for years recently explained how the genre’s name is ‘so dumb’ and ‘terrible’.</p>







<p>In a recent podcast appearance, Chris Sides, who was the Director of Product Management at Bungie between 2020 and 2024, working specifically on Marathon, <strong>an extraction shooter</strong>, admitted that he hates the genre’s name.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The genre name is so bad. I hate the genre name of extraction shooter. When I was working on Marathon, I was working with marketing, dying to be like, ‘Can we please create a different genre name,’ because extraction shooter is so dumb. It’s the only genre where its name is a mechanic.</p>

<p>Sides was quick to bring up other games that have similar mechanics that are not dubbed extraction shooters, such as Helldivers 2. He stresses it’s about the formula of an extraction shooter and how you can’t shoehorn games that are drastically different into the same categorization model.</p>



<p>For instance, he says it’s unfair to compare ARC Raiders and Escape from Tarkov, and he’s kind of right. They’re chalk and cheese when it comes to what they do and how they play, and the only thing that unites them is the <strong>extraction </strong>mechanic.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s just… it’s a problem. I cannot stand the name of it. So I think that when you say the extraction genre, it should hit your spot. I think it’s really the fact that the genre doesn’t even know what it is. You, as a player, how do you know what you’re going to get? And I think that’s one of the real issues with the genre itself.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full episode of the Shooter Monthly podcast that features Sides:</p>

<p>Further on in the podcast episode, Sides admitted that Bungie was studying ARC Raiders as it evolved under the Embark Studios banner, and he said that it has ‘gotten so much better’ since they were using it as an inspiration of sorts for Marathon.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders can be considered a social extraction shooter, leaning on mechanics like proximity chat, persistent squads, emote wheels, and contextual pings to keep players working together. That’s similar to how Marathon operates, and the team at Bungie even dubbed it a ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-wants-marathon-to-be-a-social-extraction-experience/">social extraction shooter</a>‘ several months ago.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s something inherently wrong with the name ‘extraction shooter’? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
