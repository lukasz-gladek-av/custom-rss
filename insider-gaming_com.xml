<p>ARC Raiders is an online-only game, and that naturally comes with some issues when the network falters. If you’re trying to get into ARC Raiders but are being met with a server queue, or if you’re being forced out of the game by a network error, you might want to know what’s happening and what the ARC Raiders server status looks like.</p>



<p>That’s natural – after all, you’ve paid to get the game, and it’s only fair for you to want your money’s worth! In this guide, I’ll help you understand whether ARC Raiders is down <strong>now</strong>, and if it’s not undergoing a severe outage, what you can do to figure out your ARC Raiders error or concern.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-arc-raiders-server-status">How to Check ARC Raiders Server Status</h2>



<p>Embark Studios has developed and published ARC Raiders in-house, but the team hasn’t provided a way to check the game’s server status. There are no <strong>official methods </strong>to check if ARC Raiders is having network issues.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean you’re out of luck. Here are a few ways you can check the server status of ARC Raiders:</p>



<h3 id="h-use-a-network-checker-service">Use a Network Checker Service</h3>



<p>If you use a service like <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DownDetector</a> or <a href="https://status.technobezz.com/arc-raiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameBezz</a>, you can see if other users are pinging an error in ARC Raiders. If there’s a widespread issue preventing connections to the game, other gamers will go online to the sites and paint a perfect picture of where they’re having their problems.</p>







<p>If you’re on social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter (X), Instagram, or even in an ARC Raiders-related Discord server, you can run a search for the game’s server status or for any like-minded players sharing information about outages. It’s a little loose, but it works, as people often take to social media immediately when an ARC Raiders server issue starts.</p>



<h3 id="h-use-player-count-trackers">Use Player Count Trackers</h3>



<p>This is a <strong>very unreliable </strong>method to check the ARC Raiders server status, but you can use a real-time player count tracker service like <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. If the player count in the last few minutes has plummeted, it’s a clear sign that something might be wrong and that thousands of people are being kicked from the game or are failing to connect.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-fix-arc-raiders-network-error-is-arc-raiders-down">How to Fix ARC Raiders Network Error—Is ARC Raiders Down?</h2>



<p>If you’re stuck in an ARC Raiders queue or suffering under the weight of an error code, you don’t have to panic.</p>



<p>There are some general network fixes you can apply to try ‘working around’ the core problem impacting the ARC Raiders servers.</p>



<ul>
<li>Restart your router or modem to refresh your internet connection</li>



<li>Power cycle or restart your console or PC, and reopen the game</li>



<li>Verify your game’s integrity or reinstall it entirely (it’s only a small game; it won’t take long)</li>



<li>Disable any VPN or proxy services you have live</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re wondering how long the ARC Raiders queue is, well, you’re also out of luck. Embark Studios has implemented a server queue feature in ARC Raiders, but hasn’t given any indication as to how long the queue is when you’re in it.</p>



<p>If you’re suffering from any ARC Raiders server errors on any platform, let us know about it on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Five games, including Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, are leaving Xbox Game Pass in November 2025. </p>



<p>All of the games, which you can see below, will be removed on November 16. That means not only will they not be available for subscribers, but the ability to save money on a purchase will be gone, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-games-leaving-xbox-game-pass-in-november">Games Leaving Xbox Game Pass In November</h2>



<p>As mentioned, five games are set to leave the Xbox Game Pass catalog later this month. In addition to Stalker 2, other games leaving the service include Football Manager 24, Football Manager 24 Console, Blacksmith Master (Game Preview), Frostpunk, and Spirittea.</p>



<p>Football Manager 24 is leaving as the latest installment, Football Manager 26, releases on November 4. The original Frostpunk also makes sense, as Frostpunk 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/frostpunt-2-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined the catalog</a> on September 18.  Lastly, Stalker 2’s departure comes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-new-game-releases-for-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just days before its launch</a> on PlayStation 5 on November 20. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As mentioned, the games are set to leave on November 16. Game Pass Subscribers can save up to 20% on the games, should they want to buy them. </p>
