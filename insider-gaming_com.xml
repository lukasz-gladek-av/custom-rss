<p>I’d be the first to admit that my time with VR and AR is fairly limited, but at this years GDC in San Francisco, it was impossible not to be drawn in by the awesome tech and games that developers are working on in the space. In fact, one of my biggest takeaways from GDC is that I’ve walked away eager to try out virtual reality again after briefly giving it a go a few years back.</p>



<p>One game that stuck out as particularly impressive to me was Stay: Forever Home, a soon-to-be-released XR game that pushes the boundaries of VR and AR technology to create a fully immersive pet simulator. Its developers, Windup Minds, are a small fully-remote team consisting of veteran developers behind the likes of Meta’s Bogo and First Steps.</p>



<p>Stay: Forever Home evolves around your pet named Ember, a magical canine that lives by your side and is fully responsive to your actions to how you also interact with the world. Ember is powered by unscripted AI-powered behaviour that creates a familiar feeling that everyone with a real-life dog knows. From mischievous antics to being needy because she wants to be petted, it creates a genuine feeling of immersion that no pet simulator on the market has been able to pull off. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The developers say that the game designs to “love you back” and during my 25-30 minute demo, I got to see exactly what they meant first-hand. Despite being initially weirded out by feeling somewhat unnatural wearing a VR headset and watched by the developers (again, I’m not super into VR), it didn’t take long to realise that the developers were onto something special.</p>



<p>To start, I was introduced to Ember who appeared in a floating portal in her own world and at first she was a little nervous and skittish of who I was – just like how a real-world pet would be. To gain her trust, I was instructed to feed her a few berries, where she progressively became more trusting of me and soon, she trusted me enough to jump from her world into mine. From here, the game was designed for me to get familiar with the controls and what you can do with Ember, from petting and brushing her down to making her fetch a ball. It was all very reminiscent of being at home with my own dogs, where I could sit down and pet her for as long as I wanted at my own leisure and mess with her floppy ears as I would do with my Labrador (sorry Max). </p>

</p></figure>







<p>Moving on from the mixed-reality environment, I was then prompted to take Ember into a fully-fledged VR world via a magical door. This is where you can take Ember for those all important ‘walkies’ that every dog needs. But this is where you’ll also be able to complete challenges, do trades for treats and other items, and more. The developers tell me that these challenges and activities will be updated regularly, but for those with a more relaxed approach, you can just go for a stroll and see what antics she gets up to if preferred. Again, referring back to that unscripted AI behaviour, you’re never quite sure what she’ll do. For example, in my play time, I was harvesting some berries and Ember decided to run off, only to return to be covered in mud – something I presumably would have had to deal with later if I had longer time playing.</p>



<p>The developers told me that this is just the beginning for the VR-world and that they do have plans to update the world in the future, but that it was still early days to announce anything. Hopefully, such updates to reflect the seasons is something that’s being considered to add another layer of immersion to the world, and I think seeing Ember react to the likes of crunchy leaves in Autumn or reacting to snow on the floor for the first would be particularly fun to watch.</p>



<p>In the demo, I was also introduced to the first voice command of “come” or “come here”, where after shouting, Ember would obey the command and return to you. Other voices commands like “sit” where also said to be coming to the game on launch, adding another layer of immersion to a game that stands out from the rest of the pet simulators on the market.</p>



<p>Overall, Stay: Forever Home breaks new ground on pet simulation, not only because of the use of the technology, but because of the caring nature of its developers that has created an experience that I don’t think can be replicated.</p>



<p>Stay: Forever Home launches on the Meta Quest 3S, Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest Pro, and Meta Quest 2 on April 3, 2025 where you can <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/stay-forever-home/8870151916378062/?srsltid=AfmBOoog3Z7zc5XUfg64IgVnaPPX2lIr8fr2VmzYYUUMPQdgl7iszzS8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">add it to your wishlist here</a>.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has revealed that Assassin’s Creed Shadows has surpassed Odyssey and Origins’ launch numbers, hitting a 2 million player milestone.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-2-million-players">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Has Surpassed 2 Million Players</h2>



<p>The official Assassin’s Creed account on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1903431554459644198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) has just confirmed that Shadows has crossed the launch numbers of AC Origins and Odyssey, with 2 million players joining their latest adventure in Feudal Japan. The game managed to cross the 1 million players mark <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-crosses-1-million-players-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">within the first day</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ubisoft’s decision to launch Shadows Day One on Steam seems to be going well, too, as the game has already beaten AC Origin’s all-time peak numbers and is now closing in on AC Odyssey. Shadows has hit an all-time peak of 59,941 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">today</a> (at the time of writing), and the number can go higher as it’s the weekend. This number beats Valhalla and Origns all-time peaks of 15,679 and 41,551 and is just a bit shy of beating Odyssey’s 62,069. However, it’s worth noting that none of the other AC games were Day One releases on Steam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was subject to several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delays</a> before it was released on March 20. However, the added time has helped the developers provide the players with a more immersive and polished experience. It’ll be exciting to see how many more players the game attracts over time and whether it becomes the most-played Assassin’s Creed game yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Shadows may have set a record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-endgame-credits-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for its endgame credits</a>. Also, the Japanese government is worried about ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/japan-government-worried-attacks-assassins-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imitation attacks</a>’ based on the game.

<p>Delta Force developers have revealed they are developing a new ‘solo mode’ for the game’s campaign, allowing players who prefer to play alone to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/delta-force-devs-adding-solo-mode-easier-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, Delta Force’s game design director Ricky Liao mentioned a ‘solo mode’ they will introduce soon for Black Hawk Down. The solo mode will be “a more approachable experience for players who prefer playing alone”. At the same time, the developers will maintain “the core tactical elements of the game” to provide a similar experience in the new game mode.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-delta-force-black-hawk-down-solo-mode">Delta Force Black Hawk Down Solo Mode</h2>



<p>The developers will provide different difficulty options for Delta Force Black Hawk Down’s upcoming solo mode, so players don’t need to face off against enemies created for co-op difficulty. However, the campaign will remain challenging no matter what, as the game “isn’t meant to be a fast-paced shooter”. The developers want “players to think critically, strategize, and collaborate effectively with teammates, creating a level of tension and realism that mirrors real military operations.“</p>



<p>Apart from the ‘solo mode,’ the developers also discussed adding balancing changes to make the game seem “more fair.” However, they confirmed that the game will not become easier as “the challenge is intentional.” The developers want players to approach this game tactically “and as a team.” For those wondering, Delta Force’s Black Hawk Down launched to ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-mostly-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mostly negative</a>’ reviews on Steam, as many felt it was too difficult.</p>



<p>In other news, Delta Force has issued <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-issues-thousands-of-10-year-bans-to-clamp-down-on-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,000s of 10-year bans</a> to clamp down on cheaters.
