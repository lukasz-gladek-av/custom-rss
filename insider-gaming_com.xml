<p>In 2025, PlayStation Plus members can enjoy an impressive lineup of titles. Explore the vibrant streets of Night City in Cyberpunk 2077, embark on an epic journey through the breathtaking realms of God of War: Ragnarök, or face the chilling horror of Alan Wake 2. There’s something thrilling for every type of player to discover this year.</p>



<p>PlayStation Plus adds tons of titles to the subscription service each year, providing access to more and more games for every higher tier. Out of this massive library, some titles are certified hits, whereas some are just space fillers. Check out Insider Gaming’s top 10 picks for PlayStation Plus 2025 games below. </p>



<h2 id="h-top-10-playstation-plus-games-of-2025">Top 10 PlayStation Plus Games of 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>First up is the game that came out in January, a sequel to one of PlayStation’s most popular franchises, God of War. If you have played the first game, then you should definitely give Ragnarök a try as it improves on the base game immensely, adding new gameplay elements, fresh realms to explore, and a proper conclusion to the story.</p>



<h3 id="h-high-on-life">High On Life</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>High on Life is a first-person comedy adventure developed by Squanch Games and released in 2022. It is known for its humorous narrative, filled with quirky characters and featuring talking guns as the highlights. You are tasked with saving Humanity, who is threatened by an alien cartel that wants to use them as drugs. The title is also receiving a sequel soon, so it might be the perfect time to catch up on the first game.</p>



<h3 id="h-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are into 2D platforming metroidvania games, then Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown might be an excellent pick for you. It features an original story in which players explore a Persian-inspired world filled with larger-than-life landmarks. You also get to use time abilities and platforming skills, which can be used to perform combos against time-corrupted enemies and other mythological creatures. </p>



<h3 id="h-hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you haven’t had the chance to try Hogwarts Legacy and are a big fan of the Harry Potter franchise, then there is no better game in this list for you. Though the game’s events take place 300 years before the books and movies, it is a familiar magical world that players get to explore as a new character. It features an original story, familiar location, spell casting, crafting potions, and everything else that you love about this universe, all revolving around an original story. </p>



<h3 id="h-blue-prince">Blue Prince</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Blue Prince is a new indie title released in 2025 that has won the hearts of many around the globe. The critically acclaimed title takes players to Mt. Holly, a mysterious manor with shifting rooms. The player has inherited this manor and is searching for Room 46. To get to this room, players will have to go through all the doors, which lead to new and exciting chambers with their own secrets and challenges. </p>



<h3 id="h-cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is my pick of all the games. I can tell you that I spent over 70 hours just scouring through the open world, not even finishing half of the story, with my total gameplay coming in at 140 hours. I am not a fan of first-person games; however, this title has been the best entry into the genre. The world of this game is so incredibly dense, and the characters are so well defined that you will spend most of your game exploring Night City, which, to be honest, is the real main character of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-lies-of-p">Lies of P</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are looking into testing a challenging soulslike title, then Lies of P might be more your speed. In this game, you get to play as Geppetto’s puppet, who has been tasked to slay unearthly monsters while unearthing the secrets of Krat, a city set in the Belle Epoque era. The 2023 title is Neowiz’s take on&nbsp;the beloved fairy tale of Pinocchio, with a dark, grim spin. </p>



<h3 id="h-marvel-s-spider-man">Marvel’s Spider-Man</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Again, if you are a PlayStation player, then this game cannot be missed. Marvel’s Spider-Man is one of the biggest PlayStation games and also one of the best superhero games out there. It is a remastered version that features higher resolution and a higher frame rate, while offering players an original story in which they play as Peter Parker, fighting crime and iconic villains as they swing through New York.</p>



<h3 id="h-alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Alan Wake 2 is the critically acclaimed sequel to the 2010 title; however, players don’t need to play the first game to experience this mind-bending survival horror. It features Alan Wake, a writer trapped in a nightmare, and Saga Anderson, who is in the world of the living. Players get to play as two characters and even explore two locations, the majestic landscapes of Cauldron Lake and the nightmarish cityscape of the Dark Place. The game puts you in close-combat situations with various supernatural enemies, and the ultimate weapon for survival against them is the light. </p>



<h3 id="h-red-dead-redemption-nbsp">Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Red Dead Redemption is the first game in the series, even though the events of the game take place after RDR2. Players get to play as John Marston as he tracks down the last remaining members of the Van Der Linde Gang in his quest for revenge. The new version of the game offers higher resolution and a higher frame rate, making it better suited for current-gen consoles.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Insider Gaming’s Best Action-Adventure Game of the Year 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gaming-best-action-adventure-game-of-the-year-2025/</link>
            <guid>1392472</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Action-Adventure category gets more intense and serious year on year. With the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S capable of delivering high-end games that no one thought possible two decades ago, we’re seeing the best of the best in the genre. This year’s Insider Gaming Action-Adventure nominees are incredible, and one stands above the rest in 2025.</p>



<p>Combining exhilarating action you’d normally associate with a Hollywood blockbuster epic with the storytelling and nuances of an adventure movie, book, or game is a difficult duality to master. Masterfully succeeding at two genres means you’ve created the ultimate hybrid, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> has picked out four key contenders for this award.</p>







<p>The breakdown begins with the winner.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-action-adventure-game-of-2025-winner-hollow-knight-silksong">Best Action-Adventure Game Of 2025 Winner—Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p>At Gamescom 2025, Insider Gaming got a chance to play Silksong before most, and claimed: “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The game you’ve been waiting for is worth the wait</a>.” Come release day, this statement aged very well. Silksong is an all-time Metroidvania great, and its intricate level design pairs up beautifully with the usual tropes of dropfeeding abilities and blocking your way with tough bosses.</p>







<p>Unusually, Silksong offers more freedom than the typical Metroidvania. There are multiple optional areas and bosses; you don’t have to go on the same path each time, and there are so many side quests and gambits to consider. Sometimes this is to get away from the game’s excessive difficulty, mind, as Silksong is certainly not an experience the casual gamer will enjoy. It requires a gut full of fortitude and patience to beat, but the alluring graphics and beautifully designed enemies and environments make it worth it.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong took longer than anyone would’ve liked to arrive, but it’s earned its place.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-action-adventure-game-of-2025-nominations">Best Action-Adventure Game of 2025 Nominations</h2>



<h3 id="h-ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sucker Punch Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ghost of Tsushima wasn’t perfect, but it sure was pretty and plentiful. Ghost of Yotei is an improvement in most areas, but still stumbles into the same pitfalls as its predecessor, and the story perhaps doesn’t quite live up to the first game. Still, this is a PlayStation 5 exclusive worth the money, and further flexes Sucker Punch’s creative muscles.</p>



<p>The studio has admitted it might move onto <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-could-make-new-sly-cooper-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sly, inFamous</a>, or something new entirely moving forward. If this happens, Ghost of Yotei is a good note to end on (or briefly put on hiatus) and was a strong contender for the Best Action-Adventure prize.</p>



<h3 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another in the ‘sequel to the original that basically does it better’ department. Hideo Kojima’s schedule is busy with OD and Physint, but Death Stranding 2 was always going to be the focus. With returning cast members and another glittering array of video game royalty joining the action, there’s no expense spared for Death Stranding 2.</p>



<p>As with any Kojima title, there’s an unbelievable sense of grandeur and pomp in DS2. The game sometimes crumbles under its own lofty premise and vision, but take nothing away from what Kojima Productions has achieved here. It’s a technical marvel and one worth the price of admission for <em>that </em>spinning lights section!</p>



<h3 id="h-split-fiction">Split Fiction</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hazelight Studios has quickly gained a reputation as a studio that can’t do any wrong. The new-ish studio already has A Way Out and It Takes Two under its belt. When you win Game of the Year in only your second try, every subsequent release comes with the unenviable burden of expectation. If there was one way to describe Split Fiction, it’s more of It Takes Two: Two-player-only gameplay, two different characters going through a host of mini-games and new and innovative mechanics, and a heartwarming story to pull them together through the adventure.</p>



<p>Split Fiction is near-enough on par with It Takes Two, but there might be an argument that it’s a trick we’ve already seen before—lessening its spectacle and impact. Hazelight’s newest work is still a GOTY contender—one <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gamings-the-game-awards-2025-winner-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming think was cruelly overlooked by The Game Awards 2025</a>—and needs to be played.</p>



<p>Was Hollow Knight: Silksong the clear and oustanding candidate in this category? Or has IG made a misfire on this list somehwere? There’s an ideal place to let us know: The free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-blade-dev-is-super-proud-of-special-game-its-creating/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel’s Blade development team has been hard at work, and they have called the title ‘a special game.’</p>



<p>The next big title that players are looking forward to from Arkane Lyon is Marvel’s Blade, and players have really been hoping to learn more details about the title. All we learned earlier this year was that the production phase of Marvel’s Blade commenced at the end of 2024 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-blade-survives-recent-xbox-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was not impacted by the layoffs</a>. Now, a developer has provided another minor update. </p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-s-blade-dev-provides-small-update">Marvel’s Blade Dev Provides Small Update</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/upcoming-xbox-games-blade-development-progress-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, an Arkane and Bethesda-focused content creator recently asked the developers for an update on Marvel’s Blade as a Christmas Gift. To everyone’s surprise, the studio/co-creative director, Dinga Bakaba, arrived with a minor update on Marvel’s Blade via a reply on <a href="https://x.com/DBakaba/status/2003458441139118463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), confirming that development is indeed progressing well. </p>



<p>Bakaba stated that the team is working hard to develop the title and that “everyone is super proud and outdoing themselves.” The developer also asked players to be patient, as this “will be a special game,” and hopes it will meet the “high standard” they have set for themselves and the players. </p>



<p>For those unaware of the title, Marvel’s Blade will be a single-player, third-person game set in the heart of Paris. Players will be able to embody the role of the legendary Daywalker, Eric Brooks, as they explore an original story set in a quarantined zone in Paris, where a supernatural emergency is unfolding. </p>



<p>In other news, Bethesda wants players to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-wants-play-fallout-5-600-hours-rookie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play Fallout 5 for ‘600 hours’</a>. Also, the developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-fallout-a-decade-to-feel-comfortable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">needed a decade to ‘feel comfortable’</a> with creating ‘new stuff’ in Fallout.

            <guid>1392451</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Larian says that it isn’t necessary to play the older Divinity games before starting the upcoming game. </p>



<p>The Baldur’s Gate 3 developers have been in the news a couple of times lately, most recently for their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-larian-employees-fire-back-at-bosss-ai-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comments on AI</a> and the reveal of the new Divinity title at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-3-announcement-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>. Since then, we have heard some new details about the upcoming title, and now the developers have revealed that we don’t need to prep by playing previous games in the series. </p>



<h2 id="h-players-should-play-the-older-divinity-games-only-for-the-lore">Players Should Play the Older Divinity Games Only for the Lore</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/theyre-a-bit-outdated-larian-boss-swen-vincke-doesnt-believe-you-should-play-the-older-divinity-games-before-the-new-one-unless-you-want-the-lore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Larain founder Swen Vincke elaborated on playing the older Divinity: Original Sin games. Vincke first spoke about how the upcoming title will reference events from the original games, including Ego Draconis, the same story, or The Dragon Knight Saga, and more. However, these events are now “just part of the history of what happened in this world, and it helped shape the world to the point where it is now.”</p>



<p>Vincke adds that players who tried Baldur’s Gate 3 for the cinematic experience shouldn’t try older Divinity games unless they “want to know the lore”. If the player likes “tactical combat, or co-op multiplayer, or really having lots of freedom,” then they should definitely try out Original Sin 2, as that title served as a blueprint for Baldur’s Gate 3. Vincke concluded, stating that players who want to know everything, “there are games that came before, but they’re a bit outdated by now, they are quite old.”</p>



<p>In other news, Divinity will follow the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-plans-to-follow-the-same-early-access-format-as-other-larian-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same early access format</a> as previous Larian games. Additionally, the upcoming title will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-divinity-will-feature-turn-based-and-co-op-gameplay-developers-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turn-based and co-op gameplay</a>. Will you be playing the older Divinity or jump directly into the new one?

            <title><![CDATA[GTA 6 Is The Insider Gaming Community’s Most Anticipated Game Of 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-insider-gaming-community-most-anticipated-game-2026/</link>
            <guid>1392271</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>While the games that are released bring the joy of being able to experience something new, there’s something about the build up to a game that can be just as, if not more, exciting as the release itself. In 2026, the gaming calendar is loading with titles like Marvel’s Wolverine, Resident Evil Requiem, and Phantom Blade Zero that could be in contention for Game of the Year. However, no game has the community talking and is more anticipated than Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6).</p>



<p>A poll hosted exclusively on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a> saw GTA 6 get 29.8% of the votes. That may be far less than the 87% it received last year, but that can be blamed, if you will, on the other games in development.</p>







<p>But why did GTA 6 win for the second year in a row? It’s kind of obvious, really. </p>



<p>It’s the first game in 13 years for the nearly 30-year-old franchise. It also sees the series return to Vice City and the state of Leonida as a whole in what looks, based on the information released so far, to be the largest region in the history of GTA. </p>



<p>Two trailers have been released so far, both doing well over 100 million views, showing just how excited players are to get this game. It’s expected to be the highest-grossing game in the series and could very well beat the sales numbers for GTA 5, which made $815 million in just 24 hours. </p>











<p>As mentioned, GTA 6 received 29.8% of the votes this year. Where things got interesting, though, is in the rankings that followed.</p>



<p>Second place saw a tie between a game confirmed for next year and one still a year or two away. Both Marvel’s Wolverine, which releases next fall, and The Witcher 4 received 18.2% of the vote. That was followed by another tie for fourth between Resident Evil Requiem and the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake at 9.9%.</p>



<p>Other games receiving votes included 007 First Light, Phantom Blade Zero, Pokémon Pokopia, Saros, and Fable.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Stardew Valley is officially available, with a shadowdrop landing today, December 25th. It’s priced at just $14.99, but existing owners can take advantage of a <strong>free upgrade pack</strong>.</p>



<p>It boasts several innovations to boost the game up to spec on Nintendo’s latest flagship console, including ‘intuitive mouse controls’ and online multiplayer that supports up to eight players.</p>







<h2 id="h-stardew-valley-on-switch-but-2">Stardew Valley on Switch, But 2</h2>



<p>ConcernedApe has delivered everyone a neat Christmas gift and launched Stardew Valley’s Switch 2 edition without any warning. It’s available to download <strong>now </strong>through the Nintendo eShop, but if you already own Stardew Valley on the Switch, you can download a <strong>free upgrade pack</strong>.</p>



<p>This new version of the game introduces mouse controls, four-player split-screen co-operative multiplayer, and, as mentioned, eight-player online support. If you lean on GameShare, four friends can play together even if only <strong>one of them </strong>has the game.</p>



<p>While we knew about the version upgrade for Stardew Valley thanks to an announcement made months ago, a release date was never confirmed. It was given a <strong>window </strong>of Fall 2025, which it missed. Here’s the trailer that was published to announce the upgrade several months back:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Back in July, Stardew Valley shattered a record held by Portal 2 for <strong>14 years on Steam</strong>. It became the highest-rated game on the entire platform, out of tens of thousands of games. That’s nothing if not indicative of how universally beloved Stardew Valley is.</p>

<p>Here’s to raising a glass to RPG games that continue to bring deep, detailed worlds for everyone to lose hours in. 2025 delivered its fair share of world-class role-playing games, and Insider Gaming is celebrating these outstanding feats with the RPG Game of the Year 2025 award, and the winner might surprise you.</p>



<p>What another year it’s been for the RPG market—you’re simply spoiled at this point. It’s been so overwhelming that even remasters have been some of the most popular launches, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remastered-9-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and Final&nbsp;Fantasy&nbsp;Tactics&nbsp;–&nbsp;The&nbsp;Ivalice&nbsp;Chronicles. Plenty of fresh meat has been thrown onto the market, and picking a winner for dinner was tricky.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-role-playing-game-of-2025-winner-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Best Role-Playing Game Of 2025 Winner—Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>From a pure role-playing game standpoint, with a primary emphasis on quests, world-building, exploration, and deeper, meaningful RPG fundamentals and mechanics, it would be wrong not to award RPG of the year to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios is not here to placate casual users: This is a serious RPG requiring immersion, concentration, and attention to your actions, as one false step or bad choice can be the end of a quest or even your game! There’s so little bloat in KC2, and you have limitless paths to choose from in how you tailor your version of Henry to meet your needs.</p>



<p>The realistic gameplay won’t be for everyone, but who cares when the experience is this rich and full? This is years of hard work and dedication, making a unique RPG. Progression is a multi-layered cake of voluminous ingredients, and well over four million of you have been subjected to its unabashed brilliance. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is the RPG game of the year, and an all-time great role-playing game. </p>



<p>If you disagree, you might be branded.</p>

<h3 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a superior, cleaner, and better-perfected game compared to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, but it’s just <em>not </em>a better RPG. While Sandfall’s adventure doesn’t hold your hand, it simply doesn’t have the diverse range of freedom KC2 offers, not even close, to be honest.</p>



<p>That said, there’s no disputing how good Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is. It will forever go down as the game that took home a record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-broke-all-time-the-game-awards-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nine The Game Awards 2025</a> honors. Its battle-to-battle scenarios and set-pieces are determined by your team and your build: How you invest skill points, your ability to attack an enemy’s weakness, and so forth. It’s a rightful GOTY contender, and will be talked about for decades, but it can’t be recognized as 2025’s best RPG from a genre standpoint.</p>



<h3 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s hard to argue against Monster Hunter Wilds being the most open and inviting release in the franchise yet. You might have the odd Monster Hunter purist disagree with some of the changes in Wilds, but the fact is that Capcom has done it again. Wilds and World have helped the series transcend the joy and satisfaction of slaying monsters for a select audience and opened the franchise up to the mainstream.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds switches to a living, breathing open-world design, you have a dedicated mount, there are tweaks to the combat and modes of attack, and if you invest now, expect a constant stream of updates between now and the end of the game’s lifecycle—look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-4-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Update 4</a>, as an example.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Obsidian’s calendar has been exceptionally full in 2025, and it’s had another RPG to release and support—Avowed. However, the focal point of the company’s year was always likely to be The Outer Worlds 2. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tim-cain-returns-to-obsidian-for-new-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Cain</a> helping, the developer has released the perfect follow-up to 2019’s The Outer Worlds.</p>



<p>Almost everything has been overhauled and improved in some capacity or another. There’s also a plethora of fun weapons—Wham-Bam!, take that—and even quests feel like you (the player) have been unshackled. You can approach missions and play them in different ways, and between its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-trolls-players-who-buy-the-games-premium-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hilarious trolling Flaws</a> and progression trees, it’s a must-play RPG!</p>



<p>It’s your chance to go to the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> to tell everyone your favorite RPG game of 2025. You can also admonish us for not giving it to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33!</p>
