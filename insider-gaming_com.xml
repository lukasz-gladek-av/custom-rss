            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-explains-why-marathon-is-an-extraction-shooter/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a bold move to stand up an extraction shooter game in this day and age. Many have come before and have fallen short of expectations, and the ones that have stuck around have effortlessly dominated the scene – I’m looking at <em>you</em>, Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Regardless, Bungie is breaking into the genre with Marathon, an upcoming extraction shooter set in a sci-fi universe. In a recent interview, Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky sat down with Joe Ziegler, the game’s director, to learn <strong>exactly why </strong>the team wants to try making a success of an extraction shooter when so many have failed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-super-exciting-and-super-unique">‘Super Exciting and Super Unique’</h2>



<p>The extraction shooter model ebbs and flows, but it’s fast becoming a staple of the wider industry, with many developers having thrown their hat in the ring. The next biggest studio working on an extraction shooter is Bungie, breaking into the vertical with Marathon, a reboot of a game from the 1990s.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>When Jake Lucky caught up with Joe Ziegler after a session testing Marathon, he asked <strong>why </strong>the team had aimed to produce an extraction shooter when the market has a tentative reception at best for new games in that space.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Extraction shooters to us symbolise this rare circumstance in gaming where you have a lot of different choices inside of a game experience, and all of them become meaningful in a weird way. As you’re playing it, you get these really dramatic stories that occur about survival. Every decision you make kind of becomes a point of regret or a point of excitement.</p>



<p>This idea that behind the corner there’s this brand new light that could exist there or this dark hole that you will get destroyed in. That adventurous aspect of trying to survive a dangerous environment is just super exciting and super unique, and I think that’s really why the extraction shooter was such a perfect game for us to make. </p>



<p>It’s because, the studio likes to do these crazy FPS experiences that really have uplifting and very emotionally engaging moments – we wanted to take that to the next level with something like Marathon.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team explained that, with Marathon, they want to create a social extraction experience that’s more enjoyable, accessible, and entertaining. It’s not trying to become the next Escape from Tarkov and it’s certainly not as punishing as the 10-year-old Battlestate Games extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Marathon is all about revelling in an adventure with friends, that’s why the core gameplay loop is accessible only in a team format – for now. Bungie wants players to have an exciting experience that never culminates in a depressing loss after an hour in a single raid, which can be typical for Escape from Tarkov players.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to this new extraction shooter, or do you think the genre is done? Let me know in the comments or over on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Marathon is Bungie’s latest stab at a new genre, with the team attempting to break into the extraction shooter market. It’s a game set within a distant universe, with players controlling cybernetic soldiers fighting to survive across a variety of maps and environments.</p>



<p>The team revealed today that an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-access-marathon-alpha-closed-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alpha is lined up for the game</a>, set to take place in the next couple of weeks. That’s all well and good, but when it finally hits the market, will Marathon be free to play, or will it have a premium price tag?</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-marathon-price-guide">Marathon Price Guide</h2>



<p>Marathon is a sci-fi extraction shooter with more unique elements under the hood than the average player might realise. It’s an attempt from Bungie to disrupt the genre and challenge games like Escape from Tarkov, which have long held the top spot in the market.</p>



<p>It’s been widely speculated that Marathon will be a free-to-play title, however, in an announcement following the games reveal, that’s simply not the case.</p>



<div><p>Taking to the official X account, the Marathon account said, “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-is-not-free-to-play-will-be-a-premium-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon will be a premium title</a>. Marathon will not be a ‘full-priced’ title.”</p><p>“We’ll announce details this Summer,” they continued.</p></div>



<p>It means that you will be expected to part with some cash in September, but as to how much is currently unclear. The going rumors suggest that the game will have a $40 price tag, but so far, no one has stepped forward with a concrete report. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-marathon-on">What Platforms is Marathon On?</h2>



<p>Marathon will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. The recently revealed alpha will be available across all platforms, and the full release will have crossplay and cross-save functionality.</p>



<p>How much will you pay for Marathon when it launches? Do you think Bungie have missed out on not making Marathon free to play? Let me know what you think in the comments, or check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-is-not-free-to-play-will-be-a-premium-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-reveals-marathon-gameplay-during-extended-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the full gameplay reveal for Bungie’s extraction shooter Marathon</a>, it’s been reported that the game will be a “premium” release that players pay for, but the exact pricing has not been made official yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-won-t-be-full-price-but-players-will-still-have-to-pay">Marathon Won’t Be Full Price, But Players Will Still Have to Pay</h2>



<p>In a lengthy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon impressions piece</a> on GameSpot, Tamoor Hussain writer wrote that Marathon will launch September 23rd as a “premium product, meaning players will be asked to pay full price.” Hussain also confirmed that the game will feature a seasonal content model with its own battle pass, three maps at launch (a fourth coming later), and a persistent story.</p>



<p>Before players panic about having to pay $70 though, it’s already been reported that Marathon’s price point won’t be close to that figure. Forbes gaming writer Paul Tassi, who’s long covered Bungie and Destiny, <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1911124290545549611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated on X</a> that they’ve received confirmation that Marathon is not $70, and will be “not even close” to that number. The official Marathon account has since confirmed that the game will be a premium title, but not full-priced, and stated that more details would be announced in the summer.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Marathon will be a premium title. Marathon will not be a ‘full-priced’ title. 

We’ll announce details this Summer.</span></p></article></div>



<p>As Tassi wrote in an earlier post, releasing closer to $30 or $40 “of course still comes with its own risks.” Several players reacting to the reveal that Marathon won’t be free-to-play immediately are already making comparisons to Concord. Concord, a multi-player shooter released in 2024 as the debut game for Firewalk Studios, launched at a $40 price point for its standard edition. Sadly for Firewalk, the game received luke-warm receptions from critics, and failed to establish any sort of reliable player base. Within two weeks of launch, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game was shut down</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-shut-down-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Firewalk Studios was closed two months later</a>, in what’s considered one of the biggest launch disasters in gaming history.</p>



<p>While Bungie has the distinct advantage of a far more impressive track record to boast, Marathon will still face the same challenge: attaching a premium price point for a game that will compete in a saturated market of free-to-play titles.</p>

<p>Bungie has revealed how Runners will work in Marathon, who they are, are what their class type does.</p>



<p>It’s been confirmed that their will be six individual ‘Runners’ on launch, with Bungie confirming four of them during the Marathon Gameplay showcase.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-runners-work">How Runners Work</h2>



<p>Marathon is a team-based extraction shooter, where the player will need to choose one of six (at launch) Runners to use. In the lore of the game, a Runner is a cybernetic mercenary who’s given up their human form for a biosynthetic shell. </p>



<p>The gist? Each of the Runners have their own unique abilities and attributes catering to different playstyles. The goal of the game is to scavenge the map for the best loot and extract.</p>



<p>Before you join a game, you’ll pick a Runner and build your loadout with the overall objective to get in, scavenge, and extract alive.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-are-the-runners-in-marathon">Who Are The Runners in Marathon?</h2>



<p>So far, Bungie has confirmed that there will be six different Runners coming to the game on launch, but they have only revealed four.</p>



<ul>
<li>Locus – Locus is the games “soldier” class who is suited towards players with a more aggressive playstyle.</li>



<li>Blackbird – Blackbird is the games reconnaissance Runner, who can find where players are and strategically plan your next move.</li>



<li>Glitch – Glitch is all about disrupting the enemy by pushing forward, compromising them (details to be determined) and getting out.</li>



<li>Void – Void is the games Stealth class, with active camo and the ability to throw down smokes.</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>It’s currently unclear on what the other two Runners in Marathon will be, but logic suggests that one will at least be some kind of healer, while the other could be some kind of Tank/Brute character.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-marathon-release-date-gameplay-details-and-alpha/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon is Bungie’s ambitious and energetic extraction shooter, poised to disrupt a relatively tired genre that has been dominated by a single game for far too long. The team at Bungie has worked tirelessly over several years to produce a remarkably unique title that might not look like a typical extraction shooter, but it definitely plays like one.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything we know about Marathon, including the game’s release date, gameplay loop, extraction shooter model, and when the closed alpha will take place.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-marathon">What is Marathon?</h2>



<p><strong>Marathon is a first-person shooter built around an extraction model</strong>. That means that players kit up, enter a map, and fight to survive against other players and AI enemies. They’ll complete tasks, loot items, and try to stay alive, as death means failure and the loss of everything they’ve acquired.</p>



<p>Extraction shooters are typically intense and very challenging, but Marathon will have a much more ‘arcade-style’ aesthetic and operating model. It’ll utilise fast-paced movement mechanics and powerful abilities to make it stand apart from the milsim extraction shooters we’re used to seeing.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-marathon-coming-out">When is Marathon Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Marathon’s release date was revealed <strong>as being September 23, 2025</strong>. The price of Marathon hasn’t been confirmed just yet, but we know it’s not going to be free. It might cost something in the region of $40.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-marathon-alpha">When is the Marathon Alpha?</h2>



<p>The Bungie team revealed that the <strong>closed alpha for Marathon starts on April 23, 2025</strong>. It’ll start as an invite-only event, with passes being allocated to specific users. From there, priority codes will be issued, and those who access the alpha will be able to invite two friends.</p>



<p>If you want to access the alpha, it begins with jumping into the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/marathonthegame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marathon Discord server</a> and completing a survey.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marathon-coming-to-console">Is Marathon Coming to Console?</h2>



<p>Most extraction shooters are only released on PC platforms, but <strong>we already know that Marathon is coming to Xbox and PlayStation</strong>. This was known ahead of the grand reveal that took place on April 12.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-marathon-gameplay-look-like">What Does Marathon Gameplay Look Like?</h2>



<p>Marathon’s gameplay loop is typical for an extraction shooter. Players start their game up and load out as they see fit, equipping weapons, upgrades, shields, grenades, attachments, and more. They’ll pick a ‘Runner’, a cybernetic individual with unique perks and skills, and then they’ll pick a map.</p>



<p>From there, it’s a fight to survive, with players exploring the map they’ve chosen, trying to complete tasks and successfully win their fights to eventually get the chance to <strong>leave the map</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s a deep dive into Marathon’s gameplay:</p>

<p>The team at Bungie has sat down in front of a live crowd to carry out one of the most exciting reveals in recent years – <strong>Marathon gameplay</strong>. This game is a reboot of a title that dropped in the 1990s, but it’s coming back to the market in an entirely different format: an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Bungie has put a lot of stock into Marathon; that much is certain. The extended showcase that revealed Marathon gameplay was a big-budget affair in a full-fledged studio packed with Bungie employees and guests.</p>



<p>And it makes sense because Marathon looks fantastic.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-escape-will-make-me-god">Escape Will Make Me God</h2>



<p>The gameplay trailer for Marathon was stunning, showcasing how the core gameplay mechanics will work. This is a much more manageable extraction shooter that uses arcade elements. There are on-screen prompts, a helpful UI and HUD, and contextual pings sitting front and centre.</p>



<p>‘Death is not the end’ is the running theme in this game, and Bungie has designed Marathon to be a flawless team-based shooter.</p>



<p>It’s all about adapting to ever-evolving games that never go the same way twice. </p>



<p>You can see what I’m talking about in the extended gameplay trailer below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon | Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvJIQoWIQP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>There’s so much to soak up in the extended gameplay trailer. We get a look at some of the maps and Runners, which are the cybernetic characters that players will control in Marathon. We’re seeing invisibility upgrades, energy shields, scanners, and many other augments. There are traversal and movement mechanics that keep things fluid, but it all depends on your Runner.</p>



<p>The team stressed that the gameplay loop will feature ‘costs’. No one Runner is without a weakness. For example, if one character can overdrive and move faster, they’ll overheat, and it will impact them in another way.</p>
