<p>Awards for individual genres are amazing, and recognition for one game conquering a whole field of gameplay. However, this is the big one. There have been so many elite contenders for the 2025 Game of the Year accolades, and Insider Gaming has selected the one deemed the best.</p>



<p>12 months of video game releases have led to this big moment. Top-level developers have worked hard, and publishers have put their faith in games in the hope of being acknowledged as the best. 2025 has emptied wallets and consumed hours with amazing Roguelikes, RPGs, Action-Adventure games, and more.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> has crowned a winner.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-game-of-2025-winner-hollow-knight-silksong">Best Game Of 2025 Winner—Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a testament to numerous games that a few releases could be in this spot. If you can overlook the dastardly difficulty of Hollow Knight: Silksong and ignore the elitist conversation of a AAA game needing to be GOTY, then Silksong is a worthy winner, and the Insider Gaming team has spoken!</p>



<p>This year has seen Silksong go from being barely a figure in the shadows to receiving a launch date soon after it reemerged at Gamescom 2025 in August. It’s rare for an indie game to have the levels of hype it did, but that’s exactly what happened. It single-handedly took the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-xbox-eshop-offline-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam, Xbox, and eShop stores offline once downloads went live</a>, due to demand, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-beat-hollow-knight-all-time-peak-player-count-in-15-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decimated the original’s all-time peak player count in minutes</a>.</p>



<p>It’s one of the highest-rated games of 2025, and it’s a breathtaking adventure from start to finish. You’ll struggle to find indie games this beautiful and carefully manicured—there are no ugly edges to be found. The gameplay and depth of quests and things to do have been greatly expanded, and every locale feels unique. Combat is a steep learning curve, but there’s nothing wrong with that, and owners will receive the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow-dlc-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sea of Sorrow DLC</a> for free.</p>



<p>Silksong suddenly ended up being one of the year’s most anticipated games, and in Insider Gaming’s opinion, the best, without question.</p>



<h2 id="h-insider-gaming-game-of-the-year-2025-runner-up-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Insider Gaming Game of the Year 2025 Runner-Up—Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Another accolade. Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>So many turn-based RPGs successfully execute one or more aspects of a game: Gameplay, Story, Performances, Music, and Art. Very few dare to tackle them all head-on and nail it! Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 wasn’t as hyped as Silksong was, but it emerged as one of the most must-play RPGs of the modern era.</p>



<p>Yes, Sandfall Interactive’s first game was created by world-class developers with years of AAA experience. It didn’t mean Clair Obscur would work by any means. The odd design choice here and there could maybe have used some more work, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI controversy</a> does leave the slightest of sour tastes in the mouth.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is an easy runner-up. With other games like Hades 2, Blue Prince, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 all delivering their own serving of excellence, respect needs to be put on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s name.</p>



<p>This is one of the best games in years.</p>



<p>It’s likely many of you would swap our winner and runner-up around—or omit Hollow Knight: Silksong altogether!

<p>Pokémon mania continues to spread around the world, and 2026 is set to be a huge year for the franchise, which celebrates 30 years since the release of the first games in Japan.</p>



<p>In the three decades since, Pokémon has introduced over 1,000 creatures to catch and collect in video games, alongside thousands of anime episodes, full-length films, an extremely successful TCG, and countless spin-off titles.</p>



<p>With next year being such a landmark occasion for the Pokémon franchise, Insider Gaming has taken a look at what to expect from the company in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-pokemon-in-2026">What to Expect From Pokémon in 2026</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New World Order. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-pokopia-launches-a-new-series-of-games">Pokopia Launches a New Series of Games</h3>



<p>Due to launch on March 5, Pokopia is set to be the first Pokémon title to release in 2026, and the first Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive for the franchise—although there is a way to play on the original Switch.</p>



<p>The concept of a Pokémon version of an Animal Crossing-like game seems like a perfect match and if the title is as successful as it looks likely to be, it will likely spark the start of a new series of games.</p>



<p>Pokopia may feature Pokémon from a variety of generations, but it appears to be set in Kanto, with a post-apocalyptic theme leaked, which leaves the door open to adventures across even more regions in the future.</p>



<h3 id="h-30th-anniversary-tcg-set">30th Anniversary TCG Set</h3>



<p>A 30th anniversary TCG set for Pokémon is a surefire guarantee, with trademarks already registered in Japan. It doesn’t take a genius to predict them, as previous anniversaries saw the Celebrations set release in 2021, and Generations in 2016.</p>



<p>Exactly what Pokémon has up their sleeve remains to be seen, though they could opt to reprint classic cards once again. There are countless possibilities, however, and plenty of debate around what would be the best move for Pokémon<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Either way, it’s a guaranteed money-spinner for the Pokémon franchise, particularly given the craziness in the market currently, which, sadly, doesn’t look likely to stop for a while.</p>



<h3 id="h-gen-10-releases-on-nintendo-switch-2">Gen 10 Releases on Nintendo Switch 2</h3>



<p>2026 will mark four years since the release of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, making it the longest gap between generation releases since Black and White were released in 2010, and the next generation of Pokémon<strong> </strong>is almost certain to arrive next year.</p>



<p>Pokémon Day 2026 would be the perfect time for the first reveal, and it seems likely to be when the first teaser will be shown, with a full release coming at the back-end of 2026 in a similar spot to where Legends: Z-A released this year.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for original Switch players, Gen 10 is likely to be the first main title released as a Switch 2 exclusive, setting a precedent for future releases to follow.</p>

<h3 id="h-pokemon-black-amp-white-remakes">Pokémon Black &amp; White Remakes</h3>



<p>Black and White are the next games in line for a remake, and were widely expected to be released this year, but Pokémon went quiet and, following on from the rather disappointing Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl in 2021, it could be that the entire approach has shifted.</p>



<p>Remakes of Gen 5 are inevitable at some point, however, and they’d be the perfect signing-off game for the Switch era, releasing on both the original console and Switch 2. </p>



<p>Black and White remakes in 2026 are far from a guarantee, however, as the aforementioned Gen 4 remake titles seem to have left a lasting impact, and not in a good way. That’s all for the best, though, as it’s better for time to be taken to hit the remakes in the way that Heart Gold and Soul Silver did, for example.</p>



<h3 id="h-more-pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansions">More Pokémon TCG Pocket Expansions</h3>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has achieved vast success in its first year since its initial release, and it’s only going to get bigger from here, which makes more expansions in the game in 2026 one of the easiest predictions to make.</p>



<p>TCG Pocket has moved into the Mega Evolution scene with the start of the ‘B’ sets, a trend likely to remain for the foreseeable future, but it’s already exciting to consider what could be on the horizon, considering the game has almost 30 years of TCG history to reflect back on for inspiration.</p>



<p>A 30th anniversary set in TCG Pocket seems to be a solid bet for sure, and there are plenty of options when Gen 10 comes around, too. </p>



<h3 id="h-another-pokemon-mobile-title">Another Pokémon Mobile Title</h3>



<p>A flurry of Pokémon titles have been released on mobile devices in recent years, including big hits like Pokémon Go, TCG Pocket, Cafe Remix, and more, so it isn’t hard to see another Pokémon title launch onto mobile in 2026.</p>



<p>It’s already been confirmed that Pokémon Champions will be released on mobile, but an entirely new game is possible. There are endless possibilities, with the ability to tie into existing games or offer something different entirely.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-lego-sets-make-a-wave">Pokémon LEGO Sets Make a Wave</h3>



<p>After an eternity of waiting, Pokémon and LEGO have finally partnered together, and the first sets from the huge collab will be released in 2026, but expect there to be a fight to secure them.</p>



<p>LEGO and Pokémon are both extremely popular hobbies, with both fanbases often having a fight to get the products they want, so don’t be surprised if you struggle to find any LEGO Pokémon products in your local store.</p>



<p>The good news is, LEGO is a lot better at making sure products are available long-term and in greater quantity than Pokémon’s TCG side, so it shouldn’t lead to a scalper frenzy.</p>
