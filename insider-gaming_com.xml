<p>Square Enix celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Kingdom Hearts series in 2022. Kingdom Hearts 4 was unveiled during the special presentation, showing us how glorious a next-gen KH could look, but the project has gone quiet since.</p>



<p>I have played Kingdom Hearts 1 to death, and it’s one of my favourite games ever. Sequels have grabbed my attention, but a warmth resides in me when I think of KH1. Recent Kingdom Hearts titles have so many narrative strands weaving about all over the place that it’s hard to keep up sometimes, but there’s no mistaking the brilliance of the franchise. </p>



<p>Director Nomura Tetsuya has said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-4-is-heading-towards-the-conclusion-of-the-series-says-game-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts 4 is heading toward the end of the series</a>. But many players want to know what they’re getting with Kingdom Hearts 4 before they contemplate the future.</p>



<h2 id="h-no-news-on-kingdom-hearts-4-release-date">No News on Kingdom Hearts 4 Release Date</h2>

<p>The April 10, 2022, Kingdom Hearts 20th Anniversary Celebration featured trailers for new KH games. The final announcement was for <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-iv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, and featured a set-piece battle between Sora and a skyscraper-sized Heartless boss.</p>



<p>It ends with a comical cameo featuring Donald and Goofy. Those closing moments were the last we’d see for three years. We reported in 2024 that a leaker had outed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-4-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 release date for Kingdom Hearts 4</a>. We’re a third of the way through 2025, and still have heard nothing—making this report feel thinner by the day.</p>



<p>The only thing Square Enix has said about KH recently is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-series-is-coming-to-steam-in-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts is finally coming to Steam</a>. It’s at the point now where I’d forgotten KH4 exists until I saw social media today. In today’s ever-evolving and fast-paced game industry, it’s hard to believe it’s been three years since Kingdom Hearts 4 was announced.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-dont-come-with-a-download-code-its-all-on-the-same-cartridge/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Upgraded Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games have been confusing because of their contents, but Nintendo has clarified that they don’t include download codes, and everything is on the game cartridge.</p>



<p>The physical and digital media conversation is louder than ever. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-nintendo-switch-2-games-cost-physical-digital-game-prices-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2’s increased game costs</a> have made physical media the costliest it’s ever been. But when players are paying for physical media and receiving digital media instead, it sends mixed signals.</p>



<p>There’s been unrest and understandable headscratching over the Switch 2’s games and what you get. There’s been talk of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/not-all-nintendo-switch-2-games-include-game-on-cartridge-despite-prices-of-up-to-90/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$90 physical Nintendo Switch 2 games</a> giving you a code instead of a game cartridge. One thing we know for sure is that if you buy a Switch 2 Edition release, you don’t get a code.</p>



<h2 id="h-switch-2-edition-games-have-everything-on-the-game-cartridge">Switch 2 Edition Games Have Everything on The Game Cartridge</h2>



<figure><figcaption>All-in-one convenience. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vooks</a>, Nintendo addressed Switch 2 game cartridge concerns: “That physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will <strong>include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card</strong> (i.e. they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code).”</p>



<p>So, if you’re buying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild</a> Switch 2 Edition, you get the game’s box and a cartridge inside with the full upgraded version of the RPG—<strong>no code required or included</strong>.</p>



<p>However, Nintendo did clarify that this applies to first-party exclusives: “Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card.” We’ve seen this before with Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Black Flag and Rogue bundle featuring a physical case and a download-only code inside it.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-selling-switch-2-consoles-us-at-a-loss/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-could-be-selling-switch-2-consoles-%E2%80%98at-a-loss%E2%80%99-in-the-us-but-they-can-take-it.1160133/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-selling-switch-2-consoles-us-at-a-loss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed by a securities analyst that Nintendo could be shaping up to sell every Switch 2 console ‘at a loss’ based on the estimated costs of the bill of materials. This is because of the recent tariffs imposed by the United States government, and it’s assuming that they stay at 10%.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-uneven-ground">Uneven Ground</h2>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-10/nintendo-s-pivotal-switch-2-launch-boosted-by-trump-tariff-pause?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Bloomberg</a>, the scope of the financial situation surrounding Nintendo and Trump’s tariffs came into question.</p>



<p>Hideki Yasuda of Toyo Securities in Japan explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We believe the Switch 2’s bill of materials is around $400, meaning Nintendo would still be selling consoles at a loss in the US with the 10% tariff — but the loss would be something Nintendo would be able to absorb.</p>



<p>Sony is in a tougher situation as most of its PlayStation production is in China, and it may be forced to hike PS5 prices in the US in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2’s price point is much higher than that of the first console, released in 2017, but Nintendo recently went on record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-why-switch-2-so-expensive/">explaining why that is</a>. It’s all to do with the quality of the offering and the upgrades over the first console – and inflation also weighs into the debate.</p>



<p>In the Bloomberg report, Bernstein’s Robin Zhu explained how Nintendo could raise prices if the tariffs escalate:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If the tariffs stay at 10%, Nintendo probably keeps pricing at $450 and just takes the hit on margin.</p>



<p>At 46% Vietnam tariffs, I expected them to raise by $50 to $100.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>These tariffs are wreaking havoc on the pre-order situation in the United States and Canada. Pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been put on hold as manufacturers and retailers across the region contend with what might happen next.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-almost-1-billion-dollars-raised/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Star Citizen, from Cloud Imperium, is one of the most bizarre projects you’ll ever lay your eyes on. In 2012, Cloud Imperium kickstarted a crowdfunded project to bring Star Citizen to life, and within a couple of months, millions of dollars had been raised to support the development of this space-faring epic.</p>



<p>Today, the game still hasn’t been ‘released,’ and it still sits in alpha. Recently, the team at Cloud Imperium passed the <strong>$800 million mark </strong>on the crowdfunding (and sales) scale, moving ever closer to the almighty and ludicrous $1 billion mark.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-burning-money">Burning Money</h2>



<p>In October 2024, our Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secured a monumental exclusive report</a> from within Cloud Imperium, diving deep into the company’s culture and the decade-long development cycle of Star Citizen.</p>



<p>It came off the back of a new working mandate that forced employees to grind their asses off to hit deadlines for a time. The report delved into financial updates that suggested the hundreds of millions of dollars the company had raised had been poured into developing the title and that the financial outlook for the firm was ‘bleak’ at best.</p>



<p>Then came the layoffs.</p>



<p>We heard from those inside CIG that the creative processes internal to the company weren’t working and that even the minutest of details were taking <strong>days </strong>to be decided on because of poor creative control and micromanagement.</p>



<p>In January, CIG’s founder, Chris Roberts, stated that the team is ‘closer than ever’ to hitting that 1.0 release mark, but there are still no timelines or indicators to suggest when that will happen. Until then, players will keep pouring in their pledges, donations, subscriptions, and purchases, some of which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-legatus-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can sell for as much as $48,000</a>.</p>



<p>It’s possible to track the trajectory of <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/funding-goals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Star Citizen’s financials</a> through the official site, where it’s revealed that, at the time of writing, $802,335,704 has been raised or earned by the project.</p>



<p>Have you ever invested any cash in Star Citizen, and are you jonesing for the 1.0 release to hit? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-arena-battle-pass-here-rewards/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov%E2%80%99s-first-battle-pass-is-here-and-it-has-more-than-100-rewards-to-claim.1160115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-arena-battle-pass-here-rewards/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has unveiled the first battle pass in the Tarkov universe – Season 0. It’s available exclusively in Escape from Tarkov: Arena, the multiplayer, session-based spin-off that was released in December 2023. It’s a solid staging ground to gauge the responses of players before something similar could be introduced for the core extraction shooter, though.</p>



<p>The Season 0 Battle Pass has more than 100 unique rewards, ranging from custom tactical clothing to masks and from GP coins to supply crates for Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-the-tarkov-arena-battle-pass-free">Is the Tarkov Arena Battle Pass Free?</h2>



<p>That’s the question on the minds of Tarkov players worldwide, and <strong>yes</strong>, the Season 0 Battle Pass is completely free to access and grind.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has revealed that the 100+ tier battle pass will be progressable entirely through Escape from Tarkov: Arena, but there will be rewards that apply to both that game and the foundational extraction shooter title.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape from Tarkov: Arena - 0.3.0 BattlePass Season 0" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQAYSNYVAvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>As soon as you start your path with the Season 0 Battle Pass, you’ll unlock exclusive tactical outfits available in <strong>both </strong>Escape from Tarkov: Arena <strong>and </strong>Escape from Tarkov, and even PvE players can take advantage of the new loot.</p>



<p>BSG <a href="https://arena.tarkov.com/news/patch-0300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has advised</a> that not <strong>everything </strong>will be available in PvE, as the synchronisation mechanics between EFT: Arena and PvE mode aren’t yet complete – Ref doesn’t exist in that vertical, for instance.</p>



<p>Players will have two months to grind through the Season 0 Battle Pass, but it has been suggested that the timeline might be extended, depending on feedback.</p>



<p>Also, everything you unlock in the battle pass, including ‘Battle Pass Currency’, will be persistent through Tarkov and Tarkov Arena’s regular wipes.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to grinding the Season 0 Battle Pass? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-players-not-owning-digital-games-double/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-players-not-owning-digital-games-in-the-crew-lawsuit.1160100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-players-not-owning-digital-games-double/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In November 2024, Ubisoft’s lawyers started contending with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-class-action-lawsuit-shutting-down-the-crew/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a class-action lawsuit</a> raised following the shutting down of The Crew, an MMO-based, live-service racing game, taking it offline for one and all. </p>



<p>The lawsuit alleged that Ubisoft had ‘duped’ players into believing they were buying a game with permanent ownership. Ubisoft retorted that they were only ever buying a ‘license to play’ the game. In the latest update in the case, Ubisoft’s legal team has doubled down on that concept, and the plaintiffs have fired back with amendments.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-not-unfettered-ownership">It’s Not ‘Unfettered Ownership’</h2>



<p>In a document dug up by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/555469/ubisoft-holds-firm-in-the-crew-lawsuit-you-dont-own-your-video-games?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR6qVUri3YEl-Rm1i2hUkopLGiFMB0vcfSJN_2XvFyiSWDUJc6EDhA_0kDCXkw_aem_vnLG_QctHg-dUb7i1mTNHA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> (and <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/848030901/The-Crew-lawsuit-Ubisoft-response-via-Polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">helpfully transcribed</a>), it was revealed that Ubisoft’s tenacious legal team filed to have the case thrown out of the California court. The team claimed – or rather, reiterated – that <em>‘customers received the benefit of their bargain and were explicitly notified, at the time of purchase, that they were purchasing a license.’</em></p>



<p>Per the original claim from the plaintiffs:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Ubisoft Inc. allegedly misled&nbsp;purchasers of its video&nbsp;game <em>The Crew</em> into believing they were purchasing unfettered ownershiprights in the game, rather than a&nbsp;limited license to access the game.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The recent amendments to the class-action suit saw the claimants leaning on the law surrounding gift certification sales in California. The hope is that they can stress that they were ‘robbed’ of digital currency, as in California, gift cards aren’t allowed to expire – but any in-game credits players had when The Crew was shut down did just that: they disappeared.</p>



<p>In January 2024, Ubisoft’s Director of Subscriptions, Philippe Tremblay, went on record speaking about the transformation of gaming from a physical to a digital world. He suggested that players should <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-not-owning-games-comfortable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘get comfortable’ with not owning their games</a> and instead acquiring limited licenses to play them.</p>



<p>Gamers have never forgotten these comments, and even today, folks on social media platforms worldwide will jibe Ubisoft fans with comments about them ‘renting their games.’</p>



<p>With the latest amendments having been made to the class-action lawsuit, Ubisoft has been given a new window in which to respond. We’ll have the latest on this case by April 29, which is the deadline.</p>



<p>Do you think Ubisoft is right, or are you on the side of the plaintiffs in complaining that digital ownership should also be <strong>permanent </strong>ownership? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
