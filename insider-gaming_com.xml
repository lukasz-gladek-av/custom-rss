<p>Everyone who has played ARC Raiders knows that Scrappy the Rooster exists. He’s a quirky little bird that struts around your Raider Den, collecting all kinds of resources while you’re off topside fighting the ARC – and other Raiders. But nobody really knows how he got there and what his purpose in life is, besides gathering scrap items.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has just set the story straight on where Scrappy came from and why he exists in ARC Raiders.</p>







<h2 id="h-scrappy-has-an-origin-story">Scrappy Has an Origin Story</h2>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/the-story-of-scrappy-the-rooster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders website</a>, Johan, a 3D artist working on the game, revealed the origin story behind Scrappy, everyone’s favorite and lovable rooster character:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was living with my parents at the time – they happened to keep chickens. Mid-zoom meeting, the birds somehow snuck into the house and strutted around behind me, instantly stealing the show and derailing the meeting entirely. Among those birds was Hȧkan, the rooster that would go on to become Scrappy.</p>



<p><strong>Hȧkan was unlike the other roosters.</strong>&nbsp;Friendly, cuddly, and blind in one eye, he had a habit of stepping in his food and tripping over himself. I adored him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One day, I decided to photoscan Håkan and sneak him into the game as a silly little easter egg. In early builds, you could sometimes spot a rough version of Hȧkan sprinting around the cantina.</p>



<p><strong>But then, Hȧkan</strong>&nbsp;<strong>got his chance to shine.&nbsp;</strong>The team needed an in-game asset that would be used as a “resource producer,” something that would provide you with materials after each raid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cycled through many ideas: robots, cats… robot-cats! But the art team didn’t have time to build them and the meeting stalled, until someone raised their hand and said, in a moment of brilliance, “don’t we have a rooster?”</p>



<p><strong>That spark of inspiration turned into a phenomenon.&nbsp;</strong>Scrappy went from hidden easter egg, to “temporary mesh we’ll definitely replace later”, to a beloved and irreplaceable part of the ARC Raiders universe. So next time you see Scrappy, tell him I say hello!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a quaint story, but it perfectly explains why Scrappy exists in a world so devoid of animal life. Most of the humour has been sucked clean out of the world on account of it being a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but knowing that Scrappy is waiting for you when you return to Speranza is always a nice touch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gentlemates CDL Roster Revealed Ahead of 2026 Season]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re just weeks out from the start of the Call of Duty League 2026 season, and teams are starting to be unveiled. The organizations across the board are lifting the lid on jerseys, rosters, and operating models, as the Call of Duty esports world prepares for what could be one of the most ambitious seasons in CDL history.</p>



<p>Next season, the Call of Duty League comes back to the United Kingdom for the first time in <strong>many years</strong>, teams have been shaken up more than <strong>ever</strong>, and the Call of Duty League Championship is headed back to <strong>Las Vegas</strong>.</p>



<p>Gentlemates is the latest team to uncover its four-man roster heading into the new season.</p>



<h2 id="h-your-gentlemates-have-been-confirmed">Your Gentlemates Have Been Confirmed</h2>



<p>Gentlemates, which assumed control of the Los Angeles Guerrillas spot last season, has confirmed the four-man starting lineup ahead of the commencement of the 2026 CDL season:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dylan ‘Envoy’ Hannon</li>



<li>Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe</li>



<li>Daunte ‘Sib’ Gray</li>



<li>Travis ‘Neptune’ McCloud</li>
</ul>



<p>It was a mixed season last year for these players, but perhaps none more so than Neptune, a superstar player who broke back into the CDL under the Vancouver Surge banner, going on to land in second place at multiple Major tournaments <strong>and </strong>at COD Champs. It was <strong>almost </strong>Neptune’s greatest season ever.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Ghosty and Envoy migrate from LA Thieves, their spots overtaken by a restructuring that has finally pulled aBeZy out from under the FaZe banner.</p>



<p>LAT won Major 3 and Major 4 and went on to top the chart by the end of the season, but a hugely lacklustre performance in Kitchener at COD Champs saw the team drop out in seventh place after being defeated by Boston Breach <strong>and </strong>Vancouver Surge. There’s likely very little love lost between Envoy, Ghosty, and Neptune.</p>



<p>Sib comes over from Cloud9 NY, a rehash of the old New York Subliners roster that was also taken over last season. It was a horrible year for C9NY, with the team failing to secure a spot of traction the whole season through, falling extremely short and not even making it to Champs.</p>



<p>Ironically, C9NY <strong>still </strong>finished above LAG M8 in the season standings.</p>



<p>It’s going to be a busy year in the Call of Duty League. Let me know what roster you’re most interested in on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
