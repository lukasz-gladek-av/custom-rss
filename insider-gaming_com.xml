<p>Activision has been hellbent on jamming as many crossovers into the Call of Duty universe as possible these days. We’ve seen some bizarre topics surface, leading to inane in-game events and laughable skins that have players craving something a little more grounded.</p>



<p>In a recent claim from a prolific Call of Duty insider, it was suggested that Activision is acutely aware of the feedback from the wider community suggesting that Call of Duty is becoming a laughing stock because of these weird skins and irrelevant crossovers.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-self-awareness-is-key">Self-Awareness is Key</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1909627607567458504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostofHope</a> gave feedback about the performance of Warzone and how Verdansk has boosted the game’s player count on all platforms.</p>



<p>He then turned to talk about the future of Warzone, suggesting that Activision’s teams are proposing taking a more restrained approach to skins and bundles in the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They are talking about showing more restraint with Warzone for skins/bundles/microtransactions. Crossovers are ‘printing money’ but they hear the criticism that the game is starting to look stupid.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gone are the days when people ran around Call of Duty dressed exclusively in milsim outfits. The rise of the free-to-play battle royale platform meant that microtransactions had to be ramped up, thus leaving us with countless crossovers and collaborations with musicians, television shows, movies, and other games.</p>



<p>They might be ‘printing money’, but perhaps die-hard Call of Duty fans are growing tired of the number of neon-lit, over-the-top, impossible outfits in the game.</p>



<p>Have you ever bought a ludicrous Call of Duty skin? Let me know what you purchased in the comments, or hit up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The BAFTA Games Awards 2025 has wrapped, and all the trophies have been handed out. Sitting at the top of the table is Astro Bot, one of 2024’s most popular titles. It claimed no fewer than <strong>five </strong>BAFTA Awards, securing the winning spot in some of the most competitive categories, including the prestigious ‘Best Game’ slot.</p>



<p>It was joined by games like Helldivers 2 and Still Wakes the Deep, both of which landed multiple awards during the show.</p>

<h2 id="h-astro-bot-on-top">Astro Bot on Top</h2>



<p>Astro Bot has claimed the BAFTA Awards for some iconic categories:</p>



<ul>
<li>Best Game</li>



<li>Game Design</li>



<li>Family</li>



<li>Audio Achievement</li>



<li>Animation</li>
</ul>



<p>The results at the <a href="https://www.bafta.org/awards/games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BAFTA Games Awards</a> in London follow months of similar circumstances for Team Asobi’s wonderful platformer.</p>



<p>Still Wakes the Deep also had a nice spree at the BAFTAs, securing the following wins:</p>



<ul>
<li>New IP</li>



<li>Performer in a Leading Role</li>



<li>Performer in a Supporting Role</li>
</ul>



<p>Still Wakes the Deep was one of my top games of 2024, boasting some intense horror sequences that unfolded during a tense fight for survival aboard a besieged Scottish oil rig. </p>



<p>Helldivers 2 was able to grab the BAFTA Awards for Music and Multiplayer, while Hellblade II landed Technical Achievement. There’s a special nod reserved for Tales of Kenzera: ZAU, which received the BAFTA Award for Game Beyond Entertainment, which given the game’s backstory, is deserved through and through.</p>



<p>To my surprise, Vampire Survivors won Evolving Game, an award that I thought would for sure go to Hello Games and No Man’s Sky. Balatro managed to secure the award for Debut Game, and Thank Goodness You’re Here, the star-studded and bizarre comedy title, won the award for British Game.]</p>



<p>Stay tuned to Insider Gaming, as I was at the BAFTA Games Awards and secured some exclusive interviews with some of the biggest names in gaming.</p>
