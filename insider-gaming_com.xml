<p>Four iconic NES and Game Boy games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online’s Classics catalog for November 2025. Two of them, in particular, are some deep-cut, difficult titles.</p>







<p>As a benefit of Nintendo Switch Online, the Classics catalog offers many nostalgic games from Nintendo’s past. There are plenty of titles to choose from, like Donkey Kong and Metroid 2: Return of Samus. While the Expansion Pack adds Nintendo 64 titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/luigis-mansion-nintendo-switch-online-halloween-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luigi’s Mansion</a>, there’s still plenty of new additions to the base catalog. Now, there are some iconic games making their way to the Classics lineup that are sure to unlock some fun (and frustrating) memories. </p>

<p>In the video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wZZI8a4uDI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, we see four nostalgic games coming to the Nintendo Switch Online Classics Catalog for November 2025. Those games are Battletoads, Ninja Gaiden 2: The Dark Sword of Chaos, Bionic Commando, and Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters. The titles will be available starting tomorrow, November 26th, for all Nintendo Switch Online players.</p>



<p>If you were an avid Nintendo fan in the 1990s, you know how difficult Ninja Gaiden 2 and Battletoads are. The iconic Turbo Tunnel level in Battletoads has left many with good and bad memories, depending on perspective. For Capcom lovers, Bionic Commando is a welcome sight, as the last time we saw the series was 2009’s controversial reboot. Then, Kid Icarus, who has yet to get another entry since 2012’s Uprising, can now complement the original, which Of Myth and Monsters is a sequel to.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-series-actor-toby-wallace-euphoria/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix%E2%80%99s-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-series-casts-euphoria-actor-as-lead.1364776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The upcoming Netflix live-action adaptation of Assassin’s Creed has cast a co-lead for the show. Furthermore, it’s an actor whose resume includes projects like Euphoria and The Bikeriders.</p>







<p>The Assassin’s Creed series of games has been going strong since 2007. Spanning eras of history with action-packed gameplay and gripping story, it’s had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-hits-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a decent streak recently</a>. A film adaptation starring X-Men: First Class’ Michael Fassbender came out in 2016 to negative press. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ordered-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed earlier this year</a>, Netflix is working with Ubisoft to develop a live-action Assassin’s Creed series. Multiple ones are in the works, as revealed in the blog from July, but it seems traction has been gained on at least one of them.</p>



<h2 id="h-toby-wallace-to-co-lead-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-series">Toby Wallace to Co-Lead Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/assassins-creed-toby-wallace-cast-netflix-series-1236628211/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive report from Deadline</a>, actor Toby Wallace is set to co-lead Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series. While no date or story was announced, it’s stated that he will be a series regular.  Even more so, the report says that filming will occur in Italy, which may serve as the main setting. </p>



<p>Toby Wallace is a fairly new actor, only having a few big roles under his belt, like The Bikeriders and Eden. However, the actor is set to star as a series regular in the new season of HBO’s Euphoria. An interesting tidbit is that Wallace will co-lead, so another actor, not yet known, will star alongside him. Given the game’s usage of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-assassins-creed-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">present and past</a>, perhaps another actor will play the ancestor or present-day descendant. In the film, Michael Fassbender played both parts, so maybe the co-lead is a Templar head or another role. Either way, it’ll be interesting to see how the cast, and show, shape up.</p>







<p>What do you think of Toby Wallace’s casting in Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series? Do you think the show will work out? Who do you want to see cast in the series? Any actor in particular?

            <title><![CDATA[Exodus to Reveal New Trailer at The Game Awards]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/exodus-trailer-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exodus-to-reveal-new-trailer-at-the-game-awards.1364689/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new trailer for Archetype Entertainment’s Exodus is set to premiere at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>. The sci-fi shooter title, done by former Mass Effect team members, is expected to release in 2026.</p>







<p>Revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Exodus is a first for Hasbro, the toy company. The game follows a group of Travelers who can travel through time within the Omega Centauri star cluster. It already bolsters some incredible visuals and star power in Oscar-winning actor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exodus-starring-matthew-mcconaughey-gets-new-cinematic-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew McConaughey</a>. While only bits and pieces of content have come out, it seems it’s time for more to come, and sooner rather than later.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>In a tweet from <a href="https://x.com/EXODUSGame/status/1993365313962889525" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Exodus account</a>, a new trailer is coming out during The Game Awards 2026. A blog post&nbsp;about the reveal on the game’s website describes the trailer as a story-based one. The last trailer for Exodus <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exodus-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was almost a year ago</a> and showed off some impressive combat and gameplay. Given how anticipated it’s become, especially with a new Mass Effect seemingly lightyears away, a new trailer is certainly one to look forward to.</p>



<p>As mentioned before, the title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exodus-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first revealed there</a> in 2023, so it’s no surprise to see it a part of this year’s.&nbsp;It does seem like, given the amount of content available, it could announce a release date or window. With an already stacked 2026 with Grand Theft Auto 6 and Marvel’s Wolverine, Exodus does have the potential to stand out. Hopefully, we’ll know more on December 11th during The Game Awards 2025.</p>
