<p>According to a new report, the God of War live-action series has secured its Sif, and it’s none other than Teresa Palmer. </p>



<p>Things have been shaping quite well for Amazon’s God of War live-action series, with new castings being announced over the past day. Yesterday, we were informed that the man taking on the iconic role of the God of War will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sons-of-anarchy-star-cast-kratos-god-of-war-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sons of Anarchy’s Ryan Hurst</a>, who will pick up the Leviathan Axe and the Blades of Chaos as Kratos. </p>







<h2 id="h-teresa-palmer-to-play-sif-in-god-of-war-s-live-action-series">Teresa Palmer to Play Sif in God of War’s Live-Action Series</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/teresa-palmer-cast-prime-video-god-of-war-1236684477/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> reveals that Teresa Palmer will play Sif/Phoebe, Thor’s wife. Amazon has declined to comment on whether this news is true. Fans will remember Palmer from movies like Sorcerer’s Apprentice, Lights Out, The Fall Guy, and more. </p>



<p>The report on this casting has also made fans wonder about the series’ timeline. Players who have played both games will remember that Sif and Thor do not make an appearance until God of War: Ragnarok. So, will the live-action series follow the game’s events or set its own flow? </p>



<p>Additionally, a report from last month discusses who will play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-series-thor-baldur-cast-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur and Thor</a> in the upcoming series. It seems Max Parker from Boots will be taking on the role of Baldur. At the same time, Olafur Darri Olafsson from Severance will be playing the God of Thunder, Thor. </p>



<p>There are still many essential characters left to cast, including Atreus, Odin, Freya, Mimir, Sindri, Brok, and more. Which characters do you think will best fit these roles? </p>



<p>In other news, the voice actor of God of War’s Kratos has expressed his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-wars-kratos-actor-wants-to-go-to-egypt-for-the-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">desire to go to Egypt</a> for the next game. Additionally, check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshots</a> from a cancelled God of War multiplayer title. </p>

<p>WWE 2K26 is just about two months away, and players will have some new matches to enjoy when they load up the game.</p>



<p>In addition to learning that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CM Punk will be the featured superstar</a> in the game’s Showcase mode, sources have told Insider Gaming what to expect from match types this year.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-are-the-new-wwe-2k26-match-types">What Are The New WWE 2K26 Match Types?</h2>



<p>In total, there are four new match types coming to this year’s game. One of which, Insider Gaming understands, has been in the works for quite some time.</p>



<p>The first new type is the I Quit match. The match hasn’t been seen since WWE 2K14, but is making a return after 13 years (the game launched in October 2013).</p>



<p>Another match returning after 13 years is the Inferno Match. In it, players can win by setting their opponent on fire. As you perform heavier moves, the flames will get larger. The last returning match is the 3 Stages of Hell. A match type that hasn’t been seen since the days of Smackdown vs. Raw, this match has players select three different stipulations for a 2-out-of-3 falls match.</p>







<p>As far as the new match coming, the Dumpster Match is making its debut in the WWE 2K series. While it’s unsure, at this point, exactly how it’ll work, it’s possible that it’ll be akin to the casket match. Exact details on the match are expected to come in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>One last bit regarding a match type that debuted last year, Intergender Matches are returning to the game. It’s also been said that they will even be a part of MyFACTION.</p>
