<p>Layoffs in the video game world seemingly wait for no one. According to recent posts on social media, Warner Bros. Games held layoffs in December at its San Francisco location.</p>



<p>The layoffs, which were first reported on by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-warner-bros-games-eliminates-roles-at-san-francisco-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, point to a number of LinkedIn posts from, now former, employees at the company. Two such employees impacted by the cuts were the San Francisco studio’s Art Director and Director of Design.</p>







<p><strong>“It’s been a helluva ride but all good things must come to an end,”</strong> former Art Director Roland Herran wrote. <strong>“Just wrapped up my time at WB Games San Francisco last month- unfortunately hit by, you guessed it, layoffs. Super appreciative and proud of everything we accomplished at the studio in the last 11 years.”</strong></p>



<p>Tony Perkins, former director of design, said, <strong>“Loved my time here with the San Francisco team and the project we worked on is awesome and something I am super proud of. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“Unfortunately, the stars didn’t align, and a great game didn’t find the success it needed!”</strong></p>



<p>There’s no word as to what specific game Perkins is referencing in his statement.</p>







<p>Warner Bros. Games San Francisco has been around since 2013. As a studio, it primarily focused on free-to-play and mobile games over the years.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Warner Bros. Games for more context surrounding the layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article. </p>



<p>Currently, Warner Bros. Games is part of a potential sale of that side of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business over to Netflix</a>. Rival company Paramount has continued to make efforts in a “hostile takeover” bid, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-expected-to-reject-paramounts-latest-offer-sticking-with-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been rejected</a> multiple times. </p>

<p>Intel integrated graphics seem to be getting a significant upgrade with the next generation. One known leaker has gone online to give insight into just how big of a boost they’ll be getting.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, known hardware leaker <a href="https://x.com/OneRaichu/status/2008504896476348601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OneRaichu</a> spoke about the in-development Intel Nova Lake CPUs and what it entails from the integrated graphics perspective.</p>







<p>They say that the new architecture, Xe3P, which is expected to launch with the new CPU lineup in 2027, will see a performance uptick of “20-25%” with “even more [performance] uplift for the Xe3P-12C.”</p>



<p>Currently, Intel is preparing to launch its Panther Lake Core Ultra 300 series processors. Those will feature the Xe3 architecture that is also expected to be the main architecture behind the Intel Celestial graphics card line up. Those aren’t expected to be seen, however, until late 2026. </p>







<p>As with all rumors and leaks, until it’s made official or confirmed by Insider Gaming, take the information with a grain of salt. Even from leakers that have been reliable in the past.</p>



<p>What do you think about the rumored performance jump for Intel’s integrated graphics? Does it really matter to you?
