<p>When it comes to finding the right camera for streaming on Twitch, YouTube and other platforms, people often find themselves with more options than less. The truth is, there are quite a few options out there to choose from. What would be considered the best camera for streaming, though?</p>



<h2 id="h-streaming-cameras-which-one-is-the-best">Streaming Cameras: Which one is the best?</h2>



<p>When searching for a camera to go live with, you must first figure out a budget. Unfortunately, there are not any cameras that will give you HD-studio quality imagery for under $150. However, if you do not mind the quality being a little lower than normal, then there are plenty of options for you.</p>



<p>But if you want to get a high-end camera that really makes you pop while streaming, then this article will provide the correct resources for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-streaming-camera">The Best Streaming Camera</h2>



<ul>
<li>Sony Alpha a6400 Mirrorless Camera</li>
</ul>



<p>The Sony Alpha a6400 Mirrorless Camera is by far the best camera for streaming. With an infinite battery inside the body, the Sony Alpa a6400 will run for as long as you want it to.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The camera can shoot up to 4k and has 24.2 megapixels. However, all of the look is not in the camera, but also in the lens. </p>



<p>The Sony Alpha a6400 Mirrorless Camera is currently $749.99 USD on <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-alpha-a6400-mirrorless-camera-body-only-black/6324856.p?skuId=6324856&amp;extStoreId=211&amp;utm_source=feed&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=18182031001&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAlsy5BhDeARIsABRc6Zvat_zqkIfLUjsyKkENIqv8J1cxmDr1U7JgSYPQ_v0cA4sBfog9bpoaAhlMEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Best Buy.</a></p>







<h2 id="h-best-camera-lens-for-streaming">Best Camera Lens for Streaming</h2>



<p>Camera lenses do not come cheap, but if you are willing to spend a buck or two, the Sony E 15mm F1.4 G APS-C lens is by far one of the best lenses to use when live streaming.</p>



<p>With an F1.4, this lens will give you the best depth of field compared to any other lens. Its auto-focus is pristine and will stay focused on you for the entirety of your stream.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>To top it off, the lens is also a 15mm lens, meaning it will be able to capture a large amount of your streaming room, showcasing your setup.</p>



<p>The Sony E 15mm F1.4 G APS-C lens is currently $649.99 USD at <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-e-15mm-f1-4-g-aps-c-large-aperture-wide-angle-g-lens-black/6509497.p?skuId=6509497">Best Buy.</a></p>

<h2 id="h-best-budget-friendly-streaming-camera">Best Budget-Friendly Streaming Camera</h2>



<p>Want a good camera, but are on a bit tighter budget? Luckily, Logitech has quite a few options for you.</p>



<p>The Logitech StreamCam has dominated the streaming world as one of the best Webcams for live streaming. With 1080p resolution at 60fps, this camera is perfect for those wanting to make their stream look great but do not want to spend upwards of $1,000 to do so.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Logitech StreamCam is currently only $129.99 USD on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Streamcam-Streaming-Webcam-YouTube/dp/B07TYWPM67/ref=asc_df_B07TYWPM67?mcid=4659779bd56a3e6e8e430dad7edb682f&amp;hvocijid=11117331681224633862-B07TYWPM67-&amp;hvexpln=73&amp;tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=692875362841&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=11117331681224633862&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9028715&amp;hvtargid=pla-2281435180498&amp;th=1">Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>It has been confirmed that Black Ops 6 will appear at the Esports World Cup in 2025. This is the first game to be locked in for the multi-million-dollar event, which is set to run between July and August 2025. This year’s Esports World Cup was the first iteration of the event, and it was a roaring success, by all account ts.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-locked-in">Locked In</h2>



<p>This year’s Esports World Cup saw everything represented, from League of Legends to Counter-Strike 2, and from Rainbow Six Siege to Rocket League. While Call of Duty (multiplayer, not battle royale) was a late addition to the monumental tournament, Activision has more than made up for that delay this year by making Black Ops 6 <strong>the first confirmed game </strong>for the Esports World Cup 2025.</p>



<p>In August, Atlanta FaZe stormed the stage and secured the $600,000 prize pool, beating an unlikely 100 Thieves team in an intense grand final in Riyadh. The tournament didn’t pull in as strong a viewership as the Call of Duty League, but it made for a nice change of pace in the off-season, and it allowed for a much more diverse roster of teams to compete</p>



<p>It’ll likely be the same format this year, with Challengers-grade teams mixing up with CDL squads in a Pro-Am setting. </p>



<p>As the months move by, we’ll see many more games surface in the line-up for the 2025 Esports World Cup. If the inaugural event was a showstopper, the event’s organisers will be pulling out all the stops to make sure that the second year is even bigger.</p>

<p>HBO has confirmed a release window for season 2 of The Last Of Us. According to the network itself, the current target is Spring 2025 for second season of the popular show.</p>



<p>In addition to the confirmation of a release window, a new short teaser was released for the show. You can watch that at the end of the story.</p>



<p>The Last of Us Season 2 will follow the events of the second game in the franchise. That said, there will be some additions to the show in the form of backstory. In September, series creator and head of Naughty Dog Neil Druckmann said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-two-backstory-important/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the show will dive further</a> into areas that they couldn’t do for the game.</p>



<p>“And there’s stuff in this season that I’m really excited about — stuff that we hinted at — one scene in particular comes to mind that I think fans of the game will eat up, because it really kind of tells you a lot of backstory of this important character that there wasn’t really a way for us to even do that in the game,” he said. </p>



<p>It was also has been said that the story of the second game will likely be told over multiple seasons meaning that the show should at least get a third season.</p>



<p>“We don’t think that we’re going to be able to tell the story even within two [more] seasons because we’re taking our time and [going] down interesting pathways which we did a little bit in season one too,” Showrunner Crag Mazin told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-showrunner-season-two-casting-abby-1235560553/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. </p>



<p>“We feel like it’s almost assuredly going to be the case that – as long as people keep watching and we can keep making more television – season three will be significantly larger. And indeed, the story may require season four.”</p>

<p>During the Q3 2024 <a href="https://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/news/?news=300823" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings report</a> (via Inven), Shift Up revealed that a PC release for Stellar Blade is being considered for 2025. The developers stated, “Considering recent trends such as Steam’s expanding market share in the AAA game sector and the global success of Black Myth Wukong, we expect the performance on PC to exceed consoles.”</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is an action-adventure title developed by South Korean developer Shift Up. It was released in April 2024 and has been exclusive to the PS5 since then. However, after the latest developments, players can finally play Stellar Blade on PC in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stellar Blade follows the journey of 7th Airborne Squad member EVE, who arrives on a desolate, abandoned Earth to save Humankind from the Naytiba. However, while battling these evil forces, Eve also puts together the mysteries of human civilisation, which makes her realise that her mission isn’t as simple as it seems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game features intense and fast-paced third-person combat, where players use basic attacks, Beta skills, ranged attacks, and Burst skills to take down the Naytiba. You also get to explore a unique, post-apocalyptic world that consists of crumbling buildings, vast wastelands, deserts, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arc Raiders, the upcoming extraction shooter from Embark Studios, has just revealed its gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new Arc Raiders gameplay trailer features early tech test gameplay recorded in October 2024. The footage shown in this trailer is still a work in progress and “does not represent the final quality” of the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Arc Raiders gameplay reveal shows us what it feels like to be a part of the game’s universe, which is set in a distant future on Earth. In the gameplay trailer, we follow the mission of three raiders who are trying to complete a quest in the Buried City. Players begin in Speranza Piazza, a haven in the rust belt that protects civilisations from the Arc machines on the surface.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, this haven always needs resources, and Raiders venture out to bring these vital materials from the surface. The journey is treacherous, as the Raiders have to deal with the deadly Arc Machines that occupy the surface and be vigilant of rival Raiders who might be looking to steal their loot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Arc Raiders gameplay trailer reveals that players can access multiple surface regions through a network of tunnels from the Piazza. This mission takes players to Calabretta, Buried City. Here, players glimpse the post-apocalyptic universe created for the title while the Raiders explore the deeper city to retrieve a seed vault from a research facility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this mission, the Raiders loot different types of resources while plotting a course for medical supplies at the pharmacy. While exploring, they see a red flare in the wild, which signifies a Raider being knocked down. However, there’s no way of knowing what happened without scoping out the location.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The players in the Arc Raiders gameplay trailer then proceed to the research facility, where they are greeted with bullets from the drone-like Arc machines. During this segment, we see the shooter mechanics as the Raiders shoot down several machines and fight other rival Raiders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The end of the Arc Raiders trailer explains that sometimes an aggressive approach might be the only way; however, there will be many other times when stealth might be the way to go. The Rust Belt is a land of opportunities and secrets to uncover, and players get to shape the Raiders they want to be in this world.&nbsp;</p>
