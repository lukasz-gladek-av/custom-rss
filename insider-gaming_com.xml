<p>Embark Studios has confirmed that recent server issues in ARC Raiders are due to DDoS attacks. </p>



<p>Since the new Headwinds update, players have been reporting several bugs and glitches, most notably one that causes a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-significantly-impacts-looting-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive drop in looting speed</a>. Additionally, several players observed stability issues, including being unable to move in the game. It seems the cause of the server issues has been found. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-hit-with-ddos-attacks-hotfix-arriving-later-today">ARC Raiders Hit with DDoS Attacks, Hotfix Arriving Later Today </h2>



<p>As revealed on the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/arcraiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> (via <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/arc-raiders-server-issues-caused-by-mass-embark-ddos-attack-as-devs-warn-players-not-to-login-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FRVR</a>), Embark Studios recently acknowledged the server issues in ARC Raiders and stated that they were actively investigating the issue. Now, it seems they have found the cause of this problem, as a new statement on the game’s official Discord says both ARC Raiders and THE FINAL are experiencing extensive, coordinated DDoS attacks. The strike team is working to solve the problem, but at this moment, they are still facing attacks. </p>



<p>The developers have confirmed that a Hotfix will be released later today to address the bugs and glitches introduced by the Headwinds update, and the strike team is making “good progress” towards fixing the problem. Interested readers can check out the full statement below: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hey Raiders, both ARC Raiders and THE FINALS have been under extensive, co-ordinated DDoS attacks. The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress – but at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing. </p>



<p>Additionally, the team is also working on a hotfix which will solve some of the issues and unintended changes introduced in yesterday’s update, we hope to have that available later today. </p>



<p>We’ll update you all on progress as we have more information to share! </p>



<p>Stay vigilant, Raiders – and we’ll see you Topside when we’re through this.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders players have observed looting speed drops and server stability issues after the latest Headwinds update. </p>



<p>Embark Studios put out the Headwinds update for ARC Raiders yesterday, introducing new features and systems like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-update-1-13-0-patch-notes-solo-vs-squads-bird-city-open-parties-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solo vs squads, Bird City, Open Parties, and more</a>, along with new content. However, some bugs and glitches accompanied the new features and system, with several players experiencing issues. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-headwinds-update-impacts-looting-and-server-stability">ARC Raiders Headwinds Update Impacts Looting and Server Stability </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/embark-confirms-arc-raiders-new-update-broke-looting-speed-and-made-it-a-lot-slower-the-team-is-aware-of-this-as-its-not-intended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, the recent Headwinds update for ARC Raiders has significantly affected looting speed. Players have reported a 30% decrease in looting efficiency when using a skill designed to speed up the process. </p>



<p>This issue has been brought to the attention of the game’s official Discord, where community managers have responded. Community admin Ossen mentioned that Embark is “actively investigating” the problem, while community manager Boirdie confirmed that the “team is aware of this, as it’s not intended.”</p>



<p>Additionally, the Headwinds update appears to be causing the servers to become unstable, with players reporting multiple glitches and being unable to move once they load in. Embark has stated that this issue is under investigation as well, according to a post by CharlieIntel on <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/2016474456655323351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). </p>

<p>Big releases continue to come thick and fast in 2026, and fans of the strategy genre should have their eyes cast towards the release date of MENACE.</p>



<p>The title from Hooded Horse will be available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> only on release, and the game has been compared to the likes of XCOM, which is sure to ignite further excitement in the passionate strategy playerbase. </p>



<p>With over 50k followers on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, MENACE looks set to make a big impact on its arrival, and Insider Gaming has all the details on the release date and the exact time you will be able to jump in and play.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-menace-release">When Does MENACE Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Strategy. Image via Hooded Horse</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>MENACE has an official release date of February 5, 2026, though this may change based on the region where you are located.</strong></p>



<p>While the majority of players will be able to jump in on that date, others will have to wait until the early hours of the morning on the following day before the doors open to them.</p>



<p>This is because MENACE has a global release structure, becoming available simultaneously to players across the world, and not a staggered release.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-menace-release">What Time Does MENACE Release?</h2>



<p><strong>MENACE will be released at 6 AM PT on February 5, with the release taking place later in the morning for those elsewhere in the United States.</strong></p>



<p>For those in Europe, MENACE releases in the afternoon, while those in Australia and nearby regions will have to stay up late to jump in immediately. Details of the release time come via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2432860/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for players on console, there’s no news on a MENACE release on other platforms yet, so PC will be the only way to play at launch.</p>



<p>The table below highlights the release time of MENACE in major regions across the world, so you can count down exactly how long remains until the game is accessible.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">8 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">9 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">2 PM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Feb. 6</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
