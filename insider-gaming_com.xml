<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is bringing a brand-new main set, courtesy of Mega Rising. After some brief respite with Deluxe Pack ex, this is a fully fledged set, and it arrives at the end of October 2025.</p>



<p>We enjoyed the much-needed break Deluxe Pack ex gave us. It was a big expansion of recycled and effectively reprinted cards. This is fine, and it means we’ve been able to build up our Pack Hourglasses, and now they are ready to be splashed out frantically on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-debut-mega-evolution-later-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega</a> Rising.</p>

<p>Let’s face it, thanks to leaks, we already knew a decent amount <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about Pokémon TCG Pocket Mega Rising</a>. Still, it’s always cool actually seeing it announced, and you Pocket users might need to start rethinking your best decks.</p>



<p>The likes of Mega Gyarados ex, Mega Blaziken ex, and Mega Altaria ex, are going to cause havoc.</p>



<p>These special cards are loaded with HP, hard-hitting moves, but come with one massive caveat—a defeated Mega Pokémon is worth 3 points, and gives your opponent the immediate win.</p>



<p>Again, this is going to change up the strategy needed quite a bit. <a href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>‘s Mega Rising drops on October 30, and as it’s set B1, we’re expecting a LOT of cards to collect!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Wants Xbox to Hit a 30% Profit Margin, Well Above Industry Standard]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-wants-xbox-to-hit-a-30-profit-margin-well-above-industry-standard.1332508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report has outlined that Microsoft wants Xbox to hit higher profit margins, with the goal for the gaming division to hit a profit margin of 30%, a number which is well above the industry standard. The target has resulted in Xbox canceling several different projects, raising both its console and subscription service prices, and cutting thousands of jobs over the last 24 months.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>‘s Jason Schreier and Dina Bass, Microsoft’s Chief Financial Officer, Amy Hood, has reportedly set a target to achieve 30% “accountability margins” across the company, including Xbox.</p>



<p>As revealed in the report, the target of 30% is significantly higher than the industry standard for the video game industry, with past averages ranging between 17-22%, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>



<p>In 2023, Microsoft reported a mere 12% profit margin for its gaming division, with S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence estimates revealing that the industry, on average, has not gone past 22% for at least since 2018.</p>



<p>In July 2025, this new target by Microsoft saw the highly anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-was-perfect-dark-canceled-xbox-game-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark by The Initiative canceled</a> – a project that was reportedly in development for around seven years. Its cancellation saw the shutdown of The Initiative studio. Rare’s Everwild, another project that was in development for around seven years, was also canceled around the same time.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-was-everwild-canceled-xbox-game-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internal memo obtained by Insider Gaming</a> from Xbox CEO Phil Spencer, the cancellations were due to the “focus on strategic growth areas.”</p>



<p>In the last two years, Microsoft has seen several high-figure layoffs, with Xbox also being impacted.</p>



<p>What do you think of Xbox’s new internal target of 30% profit margins? Do you think it can be achieved, or will we continue to see Xbox canceling projects, raising prices, and laying off its employees?
