<p>It has been confirmed by Esports Charts that the League of Legends World Championship, which wrapped in London, England tonight, has secured a new esports world record. During the final game of the last series in the tournament, a whopping 6.94 <strong>million </strong>users tuned in worldwide, smashing the records set by last year’s LoL Worlds.</p>



<p>If the power of League of Legends esports wasn’t already evident, this record has cemented it.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-constant-growth">Constant Growth</h2>



<p>League of Legends is, by numbers, the biggest esports title in the world. This monumental event that was capped off with a grand final in London was an eye-opener to the power of esports, even amidst the ‘esports winter’ that’s refusing to fully thaw.</p>



<p>In a report <a href="https://escharts.com/news/2024-league-legends-worlds-record" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Esports Charts</a>, it was confirmed that this final series peaked at 6.94 million viewers, which is a new world record that won’t be beaten any time soon. In the last few weeks, more than 190 million hours of game time were watched, and the average viewership throughout the month-long tournament exceeded 1.7 million.</p>



<p>There are no games out there that do it quite like League of Legends.</p>



<p>The tournament was streamed across various platforms, but it dominated on YouTube. More than half the peak viewer count was logged on the platform, with Twitch sitting in second place, which isn’t all that typical for esports. This is likely because at the start of the year, Twitch revealed it was ‘pulling out’ of South Korea.</p>



<p>This year’s League of Legends World Championship was a wonderful event from start to finish. It heralded the fifth trophy for T1 Esports – and the fifth for Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok, often considered the GOAT of the esports world.</p>

<p>The dust has settled in London and your League of Legends World Championship 2024 winner has been crowned. In a close grand final fixture at the O2 Arena that saw the monumental series go down to game five, Bilibili and T1 clashed like the titans that they are, stunning millions of viewers worldwide – but only one team could win it all.</p>



<p>T1 walks away with a $445,000 grand prize and a FIFTH world championship trophy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-heavy-is-the-crown">Heavy is the Crown</h2>



<p>This League of Legends World Championship grand final will go down in the history books. The opening ceremony alone pulled in more than 4.2 million concurrent viewers, according to Esports Charts. That has effectively set an all-new record and beat the previous number reached in 2022 – 3.3 million. </p>



<p>The ceremony saw performances from Ashnikko, Mars Atlas of Forts, Tiffany Aris, and of course, Linkin Park. On social media, League of Legends fans were quick to call this the best opening ceremony in LoL Worlds history.</p>



<p>From start to finish, the final series blew the roof off the O2 Arena. As the final round unfolded, it proved to be a flip-flop of a game, with Bilibili securing the first match before T1 was able to fire back and net a win – but Bilibili netted another point and pulled ahead, sitting on match point as the fourth map approached.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Faker’s flank paid off massively here</figcaption></figure>







<p>This is where things got <strong>intense</strong>. As the match pushed on, Faker had a fire lit under him, going on more than one killing spree against BLG and making high IQ plays time and again. T1 had a massive lead on towers and in gold, and it proved to be too much for BLG, with T1 winning the game before a screaming crowd and a kill record of 14 – 9 over BLG.</p>



<p>And then it came down to the last game.</p>



<p>By the 24th minute of the map, things were relatively balanced. The scoreline sat at 3 – 2 kills and 2 – 3 towers, and both teams were almost equal on gold accrued. It was neck-and-neck with both teams busying themselves with finding openings across the Rift.</p>



<p>In the 29th minute, everything went insane in the middle of the Rift with Faker storming into the middle of a teamfight and netting a triple kill to complete an ace for T1, following which T1 went on to slam the Baron to net a huge chunk of gold.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The tide was turned</figcaption></figure>







<p>The ‘Unkillable Demon King’ that is Faker went on to pull off a second spree to take the scoreline from 6 – 12 in kills, and from there, it was all she wrote. The squad pushed into BLG’s base and scrapped everything, taking the win after an immense kill streak and securing the trophy for the <strong>fifth time</strong>.</p>

<p>In London, the League of Legends World Championship is unfolding in an epic fashion. It’s Bilibili Gaming versus T1 Esports, and there are hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line. In the fourth game of the grand final, Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok made history by netting his <strong>five hundredth kill </strong>all-time in the tournament.</p>



<p>He’s been attending the League of Legends World Championship for a decade, and he’s the first person in history to hit this milestone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-records-on-records">Records on Records</h2>



<p>This is turning out to be a stunning tournament for T1’s Faker. This hyper-recognisable and incredibly talented esports pro player won his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/faker-100-matches-league-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100th LoL Worlds match</a> on October 12, and now he’s hit the milestone for 500 all-time kills in the tournament.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, T1 had pulled back from a 2 – 1 deficit to draw even with Bilibili Gaming, the team looking to score its first win ever on the grandest stage in esports. During the fourth round of the series, Faker eliminated BLG Xun to secure the 500-kill record, and shortly after, T1 won the map and prepared to move into game five.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The fateful moment, seconds after dropping BLG Xun</figcaption></figure>







<p>Time and again, Faker proves why he’s arguably the most impactful esports competitor in history. His record of four world championship wins speaks for itself, and the man is <strong>intent </strong>on winning another one today in London, England. He’s a rockstar competitor and nobody does it quite like him.</p>
