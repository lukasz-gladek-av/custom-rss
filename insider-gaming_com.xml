<p>A new leak for Sonic Racing CrossWorlds reveals that the Pac-Man DLC is expected to arrive in January 2026. </p>



<p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds has been out for some time now, bringing good competition to the kart racing space. Recently, we also learned that the game will be facing Mario Kart World next month, with the title receiving a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-releases-for-switch-2-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 release date</a>. Now, the next DLC’s release window for the title has been leaked. </p>

<p>The release window for Sonic Racing CrossWorlds’ Pac-Man DLC was revealed by a user on <a href="https://x.com/8T8999/status/1992775917945700779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). Their recent post includes an in-game screenshot with “Crossover Course, Release expected in January” written on it. The course is locked and Pac-Man-themed, with Pac-Man himself driving a kart alongside Sonic. When asked how they came across this find, the user revealed that they updated the game before the Pac-Man festival, and the devs let them in “an hour early”. </p>

<p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is really living up to its name, crossing over with as many franchises as possible. The game has already collaborated with the likes of Persona, Like a Dragon, Minecraft, and more. The latest collaboration is with SpongeBob SquarePants, which, along with new racers, machines, courses, and more, also brought the SpongeBob SquarePants festival, which introduced additional rewards players can acquire.  </p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem features a brand-new protagonist, Grace Ashcroft, and the devs recently spoke about how she differs from other protagonists. </p>



<p>Capcom seems to be cooking up a storm with Resident Evil Requiem, and the anticipation is only going higher as the release date draws closer. Recently, the developers revealed during an interview that the upcoming title will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-characters-from-previous-games-producer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters from previous games</a>. Now, the producer has opened up about how Requiem’s Grace is different from other main characters. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-s-grace-is-an-ordinary-person-but-is-a-bit-more-used-to-guns">Resident Evil Requiem’s Grace is An Ordinary Person, But is a ‘Bit More Used to Guns’ </h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://checkpointgaming.net/features/2025/11/we-speak-with-producer-masato-kumazawa-about-resident-evil-requiem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CheckpointGaming</a>, Resident Evil Requiem’s producer Masato Kumazawa was asked to talk about Grace. Kumazawa explained that the whole point is “scaring the players,” and, from his perspective, “she is the most scared or easily prone to being scared protagonist in the series.” The producer added that he wants other players to “be scared with her and enjoy the atmosphere with her,” noting that “she’s an ordinary person.” </p>



<p>However, Requiem’s Grace is an FBI Analyst, which makes her well-versed with guns. At the same time, when comparing characters like Chris and Leon, “they’re not like, ‘Oh, we get a gun, and we start shooting everything,’ or we get to close combat and have no problem.” When talking about ordinary, Kumazawa believes that Ethan is “the most ordinary in terms of just saying normal”; Grace is just a bit more used to guns than he is. </p>



<p>Kumazawa added that Grace is not an expert like Leon or Chris. They aim to make players feel they have limited resources and to have them figure out “what they can do with the limited amount of things that they have.” The game is closer to “classic type of horror survival,” but it’s not all classic as there are “new elements and new weapons in order to make it more fun.”</p>







<p>In other news, a new claim states Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-definitely-has-one-dlc-in-the-works-right-now-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">definitely has at least one DLC in development</a>. Additionally, the upcoming title is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-expected-to-sell-better-than-re-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to sell better than RE Village</a>.
