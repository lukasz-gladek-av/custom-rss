<p>The sale of Warner Bros. to Netflix is going to get messier before it gets settled. On Monday, it was announced that Paramount had submitted what is being classified as a “hostile” proposal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety. </p>



<p>Their offer would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be for $30 per share</a>, compared to Netflix’s $27.75 per share for just the Warner Bros. side of the company.</p>







<p><strong>“WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,”</strong> Paramount CEO David Ellison said.<strong> “Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion.”</strong></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://ir.wbd.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2025/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Confirms-Receipt-of-Paramount-Skydance-Unsolicited-Tender-Offer/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message to investors</a> on Monday afternoon, Warner Bros. Discovery confirmed that it had received the public proposal from Paramount. The company called the offer <strong>“unsolicited”</strong>, but will <strong>“carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance’s offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery’s agreement with Netflix”</strong>.</p>



<p>Warner Bros. Discovery made it clear, however, that the Board of Directors will not be “modifying its recommendation” of the Netflix acquisition with respect to the prior agreement. The company plans to inform stockholders of the Board’s recommendation regarding Paramount’s offer with 10 business days. </p>



<p>If counting today, that would mean an update should come by no later than Friday, December 19. With offers being considered and a fight underway, the future of Warner Bros. Games—both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its studios and projects</a>—continues to hang in the balance.</p>



<p>What do you think ultimately happens with the Warner Bros. sale, and will it go to Netflix or Paramount? Leave your thoughts down in the comments or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>







<h3 id="h-full-warner-bros-discovery-statement-on-the-offer">Full Warner Bros. Discovery Statement On The Offer</h3>

<p>The Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors (the “Board”), consistent with its fiduciary duties and in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, will carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance’s offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery’s agreement with Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix”).</p>



<p>The Board is not modifying its recommendation with respect to the agreement with Netflix. Warner Bros. Discovery intends to advise its stockholders of the Board’s recommendation regarding Paramount Skydance’s tender offer within 10 business days.</p>



<p>Warner Bros. Discovery stockholders are advised not to take any action at this time with respect to Paramount Skydance’s proposal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The future of the Tomb Raider series is being unveiled at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Game Awards</a>. While no specifics were given, it seems fans will finally know what’s next for Lara Croft during the event.</p>



<p>Released in 1996, the Tomb Raider series has become an icon in the gaming world. The intuitive gameplay, sweeping stories, and, of course, the protagonist Lara Croft, have entertained fans for almost 30 years. The last main entry in the series, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, released in 2018, with re-releases following suit. Developer Crystal Dynamics and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-publishing-next-tomb-raider-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new partner Amazon</a> have been working on a new entry for some time. Now, December 11th is the date players will finally know where Lara Croft is off to next.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-future-of-tomb-raider-to-be-shown-at-the-game-awards-2025">The ‘Future of Tomb Raider’ to be Shown at The Game Awards 2025</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a tweet from The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley, it was announced that Tomb Raider would make an appearance at the show. Specifically, the ‘future of gaming’s most iconic franchises’ will be shown on December 11th <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the show</a>. Apparently, the news was teased in Fortnite, where fans can vote for their favorite nominees for the show.</p>



<p>It has been quite some time since fans reunited with Lara Croft, as 2018 marked the last new entry. However, teasers of Lara’s new look came out in celebration a few years back, though it’s unknown if it’s changed since. It’s also unclear whether it’s a continuation of the new reboot trilogy or of the originals. Given Lara’s look in the silouette, it does look reminiscent of her days in the original titles, though likely with a modern twist. Either way, a new Tomb Raider is finally on its way, and fans won’t have to wait long to find out how.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation Wrapped 2025 is the chance to see your full gaming stats for the year. Sony PlayStation users can see a bunch of PS4, PS5, and PS VR 2 stats racked up over the course of 12 months, and it’s all brought to you in one neat wrapped PlayStation Wrapped present.</p>



<p>Forget about wrapping presents; it’s time to unpack a year’s worth of media consumption. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-spotify-wrapped-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify Wrapped</a> has become hugely popular at the end of every year, and even YouTube has gotten in on the act. But for gamers, PlayStation Wrapped is where it’s at. </p>



<p>It’s a full self-assessment of how little time you’ve spent touching grass. PlayStation Wrapped 2025 is coming, so here’s the latest on your next big social media boast (or confession).</p>

<figure><figcaption>Stats, stats, and more stats. Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Based on recent years, Insider Gaming expects PlayStation Wrapped 2025 to go live on Tuesday, December 9.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation Wrapped 2021 came out on January 20 and really was a reflection of the full year of gaming prior. However, Sony and PlayStation started to follow the trend by releasing it toward the end of the year, and this started when PlayStation Wrapped 2022 launched on <strong>Tuesday, December 13</strong>, 2022.</p>



<p>Next up was 2023’s edition of Wrapped, beginning on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, <strong>December 12</strong>, and 2024’s iteration arrived on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, <strong>December 10</strong>.</p>



<p>There’s a clear theme here, as you can see—it arrives on the second Tuesday of the month. </p>



<p>While there’s no guarantee Sony will do the same again for PlayStation owners in 2025, don’t be shocked to see PlayStation Wrapped become available on Tuesday, December 9.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-playstation-wrapped-2025">What is PlayStation Wrapped 2025?</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation Wrapped gives you an in-depth stat pack detailing your PlayStation playtime, such as most-played games, how many hours you spent on your console, and more.</strong></p>



<p>Wrapped tells you almost everything about your PlayStation year: Games played, Trophies accumulated, multiplayer hours, hours in general, etc.</p>



<p>It’s a comprehensive encyclopedia of your 2025 PlayStation gaming year. Get ready to be wowed and woken up by surprising stats, and be shocked at how many hours you’ve spent dropping into Fortnite and realizing how much Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has sapped your time.</p>



<p>Once it’s out, please share your PlayStation Wrapped 2025 stats with the official, free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, as it will be fun to see the contrast and compare.</p>

<p>A former Doom animator has launched his first indie game. High Fructose is a first-person survivor-like roguelite where a ninja fox fights demon fruit while completing various recipes for power-ups.</p>



<p>The game comes from the mind of Christopher Cantero&nbsp;and his studio Chazak Games.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="High Fructose Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T17VClSvKmA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Cantero has worked as an animator on past titles like Smite, Doom: Eternal, and, for a short time, Doom: The Dark Ages. The game, he says, was mostly solo developed and came after being laid off from Unity in 2024. With his severance money, he decided to make his first indie game.</p>



<p>Features of the game include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Flow-state combat with wall-runs, air-dashes, double-jumps, and slow-mo</li>



<li>Mutating demonic fruit enemies</li>



<li>One manual weapon; everything else auto-fires</li>



<li>Procedural battlefields every run</li>



<li>Recipe powers: heals, shields, summons, explosions</li>



<li>Between-wave upgrades and persistent seed progression</li>
</ul>



<p>The game is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2888260/High_Fructose_Demo/">PC via Steam</a>. There are plans to release on Xbox in the future, but there’s no set timeline for that release. In addition to the trailer above, you can check out screenshots in the gallery below. </p>
