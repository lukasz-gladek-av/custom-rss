<p>2024 didn’t live up to the heights of 2023, but it certainly produced bangers. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is most definitely in the “banger” category. While I can understand the titles superseding it in 2024, in some ways, Rebirth ended up being a “failure.”</p>



<p>I’ll preface by saying Final Fantasy 7 was one of my childhood games. I played it several times, adored the combat, and grew very attached to the characters. The remake trilogy is at the forefront of my wishes, so there’s an inherent bias between myself and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. </p>



<p>However, this doesn’t mean I can’t be objective here, and I recognize why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-new-dlc-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a> won Game of the Year (It was my pick too!) For all the effort and time that went into FF7 Rebirth though, the post-launch rewards didn’t justify the final product.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-the-perfect-rpg">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is The Perfect RPG</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I’m as peeved as you, Cloud. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>A 92 rating on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a>, a 99% Critics Recommend score on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/15136/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OpenCritic</a>, and seven nominations at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a> should feel like a big W for Could Strife and his crew. Yet, I’m sitting here, and it feels like no one is talking about an all-time JRPG great.</p>



<p>Rebirth has coherent storytelling with epic twists and turns, a deep and intuitive combat system, a gorgeous palette of extensive biomes, and Red XIII walking upright in a side-splittingly comical fashion spectacularly paying homage to the original.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth may have collapsed under the weight of expectation. I would argue this installment is the most important of the three and covers one of the most talked-about segments in video game history. I’d say Rebirth handled it brilliantly and hits all the right notes: The Gold Saucer, Barret’s story in Mt. Corel, and the introduction of fate into the core narrative.</p>



<p>When it comes to Game of the Year and Best RPG of the Year, Rebirth feels like it’s been forgotten about in favor of another. </p>



<h2 id="h-rebirth-or-refantazio">Rebirth or ReFantazio?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-metaphor-refantazio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> is published by Atlus—developers of the legendary Persona franchise—and their trademark influences are all over Metaphor. Atlus’ newest project received similar reviews and praise to Rebirth but is deemed a superior game in almost every way. Furthermore, it swiped three Game Awards—including “<strong>Best RPG” ahead of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</strong>.</p>



<p>I’ve invested over 100 hours in FF7 Rebirth and seen most of its content, and honestly believe Astro Bot is the only contender that pipped it as the year’s best content—each to their own of course. Shadow of the Erdtree is DLC, I won’t hear anything else; whereas Metaphor: ReFantazio is an exceptional JRPG, and its stylistic choices are down to personal choice, but many agree with its idiosyncrasies.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth’s lack of praise and love can’t be down to the perception of JRPGs, as Metaphor falls under this category too. No Metaphor: ReFantazio means more awards and praise for Rebirth. But it doesn’t change the fact Square Enix also perceives its own game as a disappointment in some ways. The company believes Rebirth did not meet sales expectations, and I’m hoping this doesn’t impact the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-final-fantasy-7-remake-already-under-way-uematsu-possibly-returning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third and final Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>.</p>



<p>Was Rebirth released at the wrong time of year? Did the feel of a fresh IP in Metaphor: ReFantazio supersede a franchise where people know what they’re getting? I’ll be left twiddling my thumbs and asking these questions until part three hits the shelves. Big congratulations to Metaphor of course, but I’d keep a watchful eye out for a long silver-haired assailant with a long sword.</p>



<hr>



<p>Did Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth deserve more recognition in 2024? Or was it simply bested by a better RPG and needed to do more to sell more copies? I’m keen to hear what you have to say.</p>

<p>We like having banger after banger after banger. Unfortunately, things don’t always work out this way, which is why we’ve had the difficult decision to pick our top six most disappointing games of 2024—stay tuned for supreme heartbreak.</p>



<p>It’s easy to talk about the best games of 2024, but many like to leave it there. No, we need to talk about these things and remind you it’s not all roses. 2024 has had stinkers too, and I’d rather forget about the outright worst games, and fixate on the releases people were excited about, but it left them down in the dumps.</p>



<p>Like a bed-ridden Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, here’s our carefully selected assortment of most disappointing games in 2024 that didn’t deliver.</p>



<h2 id="h-most-disappointing-games-of-2024">Most Disappointing Games of 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-concord">Concord</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What else is left to say? Credit to Firewalk Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>I feel Concord’s significance will still echo a decade or two from now. When I first played the Concord beta, I genuinely thought to myself, “This is pretty solid, but nothing special.” I reiterated these comments to my peers, and I didn’t think Concord would last long, but I didn’t think I would be as right as I was. </p>



<p>Concord’s core gunplay mechanics are solid, but it didn’t do anything special that Overwatch, Valorant, or the now-released Marvel Rivals doesn’t already do. Its content was lacking—as most free-to-play, live-service titles seem to be on release—and the minimal interest in the beta was telling. People didn’t ask for Concord, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nobody-wishlist-concord-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nobody wishlisted it</a>, and their reluctance to invest time and money is why I now refer to Concord in the past tense—it’s dead.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation shut Concord down</a> within two weeks of its launch. Its reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-cost-over-400-million-to-develop-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$400 million budget</a> makes the shooter a catastrophic failure and one of the worst ever, and developers are likely to learn a lot from Concord’s mistakes for years to come.</p>



<h3 id="h-skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Trust me, this is a rare moment of exhilaration. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>I put around 20 hours into Skull and Bones, and the moments of genuine enjoyment were fleeting at best. Skull and Bones was first announced in 2017 to much hype and excitement, with players ready for a full-blown, pillaging, and pirating adventure akin to Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. Instead, Ubisoft ended up making a much more boring version of its own game.</p>



<p>You can’t fight other crews as the action is relegated to cutscenes, harvesting resources can be done from your ship via a simplistic mini-game, and everything about Skull and Bones is uninspired: The story, the gameplay, the lackluster visuals, and the progression. The ill-conceived fast travel system forces you to regularly travel enormous distances on your ship—where very little happens.</p>



<p>Skull and Bones had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-players-total/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less than one million players at launch</a> and shows no signs of improving. It started a familiar trend of disappointing AAA games—or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-aaaaa-games-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAAA in Skull and Bones’ case</a>—with many games underperforming—such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-about-xdefiant-closure-and-the-future-of-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Beauty with no brains. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Oh, look, another Ubisoft game. The festering stink of a Ubisoft open-world lingers all over Star Wars: Outlaws. It looks pretty on the outside, but inside, a hollow, familiar journey awaits. It makes The Force Awakens’ derivative clone of A New Hope look faultless—I do love The Force Awakens, by the way, but still.</p>



<p>Outlaws promises a new story in which we get to be bandits. It’s a novel idea and a welcome one, but throughout Outlaws’ development, trailers, and gameplay reveals, it was hard to shake the feeling we were getting a reskinned Far Cry and Assassin’s Creed entry. Again, by nature, it’s a “good” game, but not one likely to live long in the memory.</p>



<p>Worse still, its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=outlaws" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lukewarm launch caused Ubisoft’s stock to plummet</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-underperformed-ubisoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales underperformed</a> big time. Ultimately, it pales in comparison to EA’s Star Wars Jedi series and shows you need more than an IP to become a true Jedi.</p>



<h3 id="h-lego-horizon-adventures">LEGO Horizon Adventures</h3>



<figure><figcaption>This hurts my Thunderjaw. Credit to Guerrilla Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The LEGO video game franchise has sold millions of copies rehashing a successful formula. Take a popular film series or game, LEGO-ify it, turn it into a collect-a-thon with amusing cutscenes and basic gameplay, and it sells like hotcakes. LEGO’s Horizon Tallneck model is excellent, and little did we know this would prompt a crossover (like Concord) no one was asking for.</p>



<p>On paper, LEGO Horizon Adventures should be a success. I don’t think Horizon gets the praise or adulation it deserves, Aloy is a great hero to follow, and its world is captivating. But when it got the LEGO-ify treatment, people didn’t gravitate toward it. Its OpenCritic rating stands at a decent 71/100—with its “Critics Recommend” score plummeting to a lowly 53%.</p>



<p>This might be a lesson to not stick “LEGO” in front of a franchise and expect gold studs to spew out.</p>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection">Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Lazy. Credit to Aspyr</figcaption></figure>



<p>I lost so many hours to Galactic Conquest and Hero Assault in Battlefront II, and when I heard it was getting newer and, hopefully, more polished ports, I was excited to revisit it in 2024—especially after 2017’s dismal reboot disaster. I was all ready to splash out the cash on the Classic Collection, only to study the vehement backlash to its release.</p>



<p>Currently, the Classic Collection has a “Mostly Negative” verdict under its 7,000 “All Reviews” on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446550/STAR_WARS_Battlefront_Classic_Collection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The Battlefront games launched with the smallest licks of paint to polish, broken servers, missing modes featured in the original, and sus AI. Curiously, despite the full-price tags, you can actually buy “STAR WARS Battlefront (Classic, 2004)” and “STAR WARS Battlefront II (Classic, 2005)” on Steam for far less than the disastrous collection.</p>



<p>The Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection has gone under the radar somewhat, but it can’t escape the grasp of our most disappointing games of 2024 list.</p>



<h3 id="h-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The Justice League didn’t need to die for this. Credit to Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Admit it, you were getting worried I wasn’t going to include this. How I could not feature Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League—the live-service atrocity <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-pulls-suicide-squad-just-one-hour-into-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulled from Early Access barely one hour into its launch</a>. Suicide Squad was supposed to be the video game adaptation somewhat based on the movies, only, we have the fascinating plot about killing each member of the Justice League due to Brainiac’s evil influences controlling them and making them evil.</p>



<p>Instead, Kill the Justice League is full of copy-and-paste missions, painfully slow XP grinds, repetitive content, and heinous narrative decisions undermining and destroying Rocksteady’s beautifully molded Arkham universe. I also can’t forgive Suicide Squad for being the last-ever credited role of the legendary Kevin Conroy as Batman—truly lamentable in its own right.</p>



<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League bombed, and is another entry on this list <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-reportedly-says-suicide-squad-fell-short-of-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling short of expectations</a>. Furthermore, it lost Warner Bros. over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-cost-warner-bros-200-million-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$200 million</a>—resulting in many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocksteady layoffs</a>—and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-updates-will-end-with-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 spells its end</a> within a year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlestate-has-released-stats-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-last-wipe.1069305/</guid>

<p>Battlestate Games has published a series of graphics on social media highlighting some of the key statistics from the last wipe, which ends today as the 0.16.0.0 patch is ushered in.</p>



<p>It reveals some of the most interesting tidbits of information about Escape from Tarkov on a global scale – and it gives us a neat representation of the number of people still playing the game late into the wipe. Recently, concerns about the game’s longevity have been raised, with numbers seemingly dropping worldwide. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games revealed some interesting factoids about the most recent wipe in Escape from Tarkov, which ends <strong>today</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>62% of players opted to represent the USEC faction this wipe</li>



<li>99,288 players maxed out their Metabolism skill, the most popular skill by far</li>



<li>876,328 players were killed by Partisan, the boss character introduced in this wipe</li>



<li>692,000 players accepted Mortar Strike, a special event quest that surfaced several weeks ago</li>



<li>188,514 players accepted ‘Dark Times’ a late-wipe task that rewarded 39,000 players with ‘Kappa’</li>
</ul>



<p>It was further confirmed that the most popular weapons in Escape from Tarkov haven’t changed in the last few months. The most popular assault rifle was the M4A1, which is a staple weapon in the scene. It was followed closely behind by the AKS-74U. </p>



<p>The Mosin was king of the ‘bolties’, while the SVDS was the top choice for those running marksman rifles. Bizarrely, the most popular armour was the PACA Soft Armor, but that’s only because <strong>everyone </strong>uses it at the start of a new wipe. </p>











<p>The next wipe, which is live today, introduces the 0.16.0.0 patch, which expands and enhances Customs, tweaks visual recoil, and adds a bunch of new weapons and other items to the game.</p>

<p>As revealed by reliable leaker RivalsLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871707483691245587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the Human Torch is one of the upcoming heroes Marvel Rivals developers seem to be working on. In-game images and abilities of the character have surfaced online, hinting that he might be arriving soon. The character is seen wearing his Fantastic 4 uniform, with his whole body engulfed in flames. Additionally, his hair, eyebrows, and eyes match the colour of the fire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same thread, RivalsLeaks has also <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871707598703272309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared</a> the in-game abilities page for the Human Torch in Marvel Rivals. The character’s primary attack is the Fire Cluster, the secondary attack is Blazing Blast, and his Team-Up ability with Storm is called Omega Fire. Other abilities include Supernova, Plasma Body, Pyro-Prison, and Flaming Meteor. Check out what each Human Torch ability does below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Fire Cluster (Left Click): Launches a splittable fireball at the enemy</li>



<li>Omega Fire (X): This team-up ability allows Storm to consume the Human Torch’s fire tornado and add it to her hurricane. Alternatively, the Human Torch can also consume Storm’s Hurricane to create a fiery hurricane that enlarges and intensifies all the fire tornadoes found while the ability is active.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Supernova (Q): The Human Torch will release a shockwave that damages enemies within a radius. During the activation of this skill, flame fields will turn into flame tornadoes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Plasma Body (L-Shift) This ability allows the Human Torch to enter a state of accelerated ascent.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Pyro-Prison (E): Through this ability, players can connect flame fields to create a fire wall that can burn enemies to deal damage.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Flaming Meteor (F): This ability will make the Human Torch dive to the ground and stun nearby enemies.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Blazing Blast (Right Click): Players can create a flame field in a targeted area by launching a fireball through this ability.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Okay, so you thought January would kick off 2025 with a slew of new video game releases, right? Well, it’s a generally quiet time for the industry, though we are receiving a few big titles, like Spider-Man 2 and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on PC. But it’s February that will really jump-start gaming in 2025. Here’s a look at the biggest video game releases in February 2025!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-hottest-game-releases-of-february-2025">The Hottest Game Releases of February 2025</h2>



<p>I really cannot understate how massive the month of February 2025 is for game releases. It’s overloaded with some truly epic titles, the kind of games you could spend hundreds or thousands of hours playing without looking at the release calendar again. But they come one after another this month, which will take a toll on our sanity and wallets.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </strong>(PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – February 4, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Civilization VII</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch) – February 11, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – February 14, 2025</li>



<li><strong>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Nintendo Switch) – February 14, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch) – February 14, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Avowed </strong>(PC/Xbox Series X|S) – February 18, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 1</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – February 18, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S) – February 21, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – February 28, 2025</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-looking-forward-to-march-2025">Looking Forward to March 2025</h2>



<p>After a month like February, here’s hoping March isn’t overly packed with new video game releases. We could use some time to rest and recuperate and, of course, to finish all of those massive titles like Kingdom Come and Monster Hunter Wilds. But, here’s what you can look forward to in March 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Two Point Museum</li>



<li>Split Fiction</li>



<li>Tales of the Shire</li>



<li>Atomfall</li>
</ul>

<p>Battlestate Games has confirmed that Escape from Tarkov’s next wipe will hit tomorrow, December 26. This patch – which also includes Escape from Tarkov Arena – ushers in the 0.16.0.0 patch, and the 0.2.5.0 patch for the latter title. It’s set to take the game offline for around eight hours, and when it comes back up, hundreds of thousands of players will flood the game.</p>



<p>How many of them will be cheaters or malicious operators?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-good-with-the-bad">Good with the Bad</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has had a tough time of late dealing with more than a few issues. The biggest concern is cheaters, and the epidemic reached such epic proportions that the game’s biggest streamers were turned off, with many players diverting their attention to the game’s ‘offline’ PvE offering.</p>



<p>This month, Tarkov’s viewer counts on Twitch hit their lowest point since the summer of 2019, when the game underwent a monumental boom on streaming and content platforms.</p>



<p>Regardless, Escape from Tarkov will undergo a sizeable upshift in the coming days as the next Tarkov wipe hits and countless players come back to the extraction shooter in droves. It’ll hit the top spots in the charts on streaming sites, and once again, players will start their stories in Tarkov, tackling those pesky early-game tasks.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Tomorrow, December 26, at 7:00 AM GMT / 2:00 AM EST we are planning to install patches 0.16.0.0 for </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EscapefromTarkov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#EscapefromTarkov</a><span> and 0.2.5.0 for </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TarkovArena" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#TarkovArena</a><span>. The installation will take approximately 8 hours. The installation of updates may be extended if required. The games will not be…</span></p></article></div>







<p>When Tarkov wipes tomorrow, it’ll bring about the 0.16.0.0 update, which introduces changes to Customs and adds in several new weapons, amongst other things. Battlestate is also tweaking the game’s weapon recoil mechanics, making some major visual adjustments.</p>



<p>It’s also expected that the Unity 2022 upgrade will be wrapped up in this patch.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the next Tarkov wipe? Make sure you keep an eye open for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-winter-twitch-drops-2024/">Twitch Drops campaign</a> starting later this month, and be sure to stop by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
