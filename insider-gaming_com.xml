<p>If you’re as excited as I am about Planet Coaster 2, then you’ll likely want to check out the achievements coming to the creative park building and management game. There aren’t too many, but enough to challenge you and keep you working toward a goal beyond the most beautiful park imaginable. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-planet-coaster-2-achievements-and-how-to-unlock-each">All Planet Coaster 2 Achievements and How to Unlock Each</h2>



<p>The clear majority of Planet Coaster 2 achievements revolve around progressing through the game’s story mode, completing various challenges, and exploring the game’s core mechanics. They don’t appear overly tricky to unlock, so I’m confident you can 100% the game this year.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-there-a-planet-coaster-2-platinum-trophy-on-ps5">Is There a Planet Coaster 2 Platinum Trophy on PS5?</h2>



<p>As Planet Coaster 2 launches simultaneously on PC and PlayStation 5, along with the Xbox Series X|S, it does indeed have a platinum trophy to unlock. It’s called “Heir to the Throne,” and of course, requires you to unlock all other trophies in the game to acquire.</p>



<p>It’s quite the challenge, but savvy fans with experience in previous “Planet” titles should have no issue meeting the unlock requirements for each of the above-mentioned Planet Coaster 2 achievements and trophies!</p>

<p>The Pokémon TCG Pocket mobile title has a few different packs to choose from at different stages of the game. If you’ve just started Pokémon Pocket, or you’re deeper in and seeking wisdom on which to rip open, we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<p>I find opening packs in Pokémon TCG Pocket as addictive as doing it in real life. The hope of pulling an Ultra Rare or Full Illustration card is too tempting, even though I know it’s going to be another duplicate Psyduck or Slowpoke. Still, the feeling is there, and if you don’t want to splash out your hard-earned money on physical packs, Pokémon TCG Pocket is the perfect fix for this itch.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s early days feature three distinct packs (and starter packs) and it’s understandable if you want advice on opening the best packs.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-starter-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Starter Pack in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So many amazing cards to pull. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>I recommend opening the Charizard Pack</strong> when you first start Pokémon TCG Pocket as the Exeguttor EX in it is an extremely strong card and can be a consistent menace in online PvP. Additionally, I also think the <strong>Charmander Full Art card is the best-looking card</strong> of the six from a purely aesthetic standpoint—but each to their own.</p>



<p>The Charizard, Mewtwo, and Pikachu packs you’re offered aren’t for decoration—each one comes with a special set of two cards guaranteed to drop.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick look at each pack and what they offer you.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pack Type</th><th data-align="center">Pack Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Charizard Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Exeguttor EX</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Charizard Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Charmander Full Art</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mewtwo Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Marowak EX</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mewtwo Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Bulbasaur Full Art</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pikachu Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Arcanine EX</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pikachu Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Squirtle Full Art</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-pack-to-open-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Pack to Open in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p><strong>The Mewtwo Packs</strong> are the best to open in Pokémon TCG Pocket as they are the gateway to some of the most powerful cards in Pokémon Pocket—including Mewtwo itself. </p>



<p>In Pokémon TCG Pocket’s early weeks, <strong>Mewtwo EX</strong> is considered one of the strongest—if not the strongest—cards in the whole game. The Mewtwo pack also has other dominant cards including <strong>Venusaur EX</strong> and <strong>Dragonite</strong>. You only need to take a cursory glance at the bubble that pops up over each of the packs to see certain cards are exclusive to those packs.</p>



<p>Charizard packs also feature quite a few special EX cards: <strong>Charizard</strong>, <strong>Moltres</strong>, and <strong>Starmie</strong>. Outside of these, don’t sleep on Vileplume’s Soothing Scent attack which does high damage and puts opponents to sleep, or Alakazam’s Psychic move. On the other hand, the Pikachu pack-specific cards are decent, but won’t get you meta-decks like Charizard and Mewtwo do.</p>



<p>I highly recommend switching up the packs you open as it’s essential to get every card in the set without having to spend Card Points and buying them individually. Not only this, but when the meta does change, you have more cards to choose from, and you can also build diverse decks needed for unique challenges in Pokémon Pocket.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has some great close-range options for smaller maps like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nuketown-24-7-playlist-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown</a> and Stakeout, but none are quite as powerful as Shotguns. The ASG-89 is the fastest-firing Shotgun in the game, but you’ll need the best attachments for it to experience its true power.</p>



<p>With that said, here’s the best loadout for the ASG-89 in Black Ops 6.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-asg-89-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-asg-89">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-asg-89">Best Secondary for ASG-89</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-asg-89-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock ASG-89</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-asg-89-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the ASG-89 any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-asg-89-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-asg-89-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best ASG-89 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Fast Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: CQB Grip</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Balanced Stock</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>Kicking off our best ASG-89 loadout in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a> is the <strong>Long Barrel</strong>, which improves the Shotgun’s damage range, which is pretty poor otherwise. Then, the <strong>Fast Mag I</strong> provides a quicker reload at the expense of some bullets, while the <strong>CQB Grip</strong> gives you some dive, slide, and sprint to fire speed to get your shots off faster while being mobile.</p>



<p>The <strong>Balanced Stock</strong> further boosts mobility, improving strafing, hipfire, movement, and aim walking movement speeds. Lastly, to ensure you’re finishing enemies as quickly as possible, the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> attachment is essential for increasing the Shotgun’s fire rate.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-asg-89">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for ASG-89</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>We’re focussing on mobility with the ASG-89 so that you can get up close and personal effortlessly and put enemies to bed. <strong>Gung-Ho</strong> improves movement speed while reloading and using Equipment, while <strong>Assassin</strong> lets you track enemies on a KIllstreak for more intel on the opposition’s position. </p>



<p><strong>Double Time </strong>boosts Tac-Sprint so you can reach top speed for longer, and thanks to the <strong>Perk Greed</strong> Wild Card, we’ve gone with <strong>Dexterity</strong> for our fourth Perk, which reduces weapon motion when jumping, sliding, and diving, as well as decreasing fall damage.</p>



<p>As for Equipment, we like a <strong>Semtex</strong> for the quick throw and detention time, while the <strong>Stim Shot</strong> keeps you topped up on health to stay in the fight. Finally, the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> is a top choice for a Shotgun loadout, as you’ll want to protect your flank while behind enemy lines.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-asg-89">Best Secondary for ASG-89</h2>



<p>The <strong>Grekhova</strong> is the best Secondary for the ASG-89 in Black Ops 6, as it’s fully automatic, so when you need to hit the target and finish a kill off, the fast fire rate gives you plenty of leeway to do so.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-asg-89-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock ASG-89 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>To unlock the ASG-89 you’ll need to hit <strong>Level 31</strong> in Black Ops 6. This can be done in Multiplayer or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-guided-zombies-come-out-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a>, and using our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best tips to level up fast</a>, you should make it there fairly quickly.</p>



<p>Be sure to take advantage of Double XP weekends and playlists like Nuketown 24/7, as those will help net you a load of XP.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-asg-89-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the ASG-89 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The ASG-89 is <strong>very good for small maps</strong>, but it isn’t so great outside of close quarters. So, we recommend either running it as a secondary with an Overkill class or only using it when you play a small map like the ones found on Face Off Moshpit.</p>
