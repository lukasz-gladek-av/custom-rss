<p>I’ve lost myself to the MMORPG genre since 2004, and no, it wasn’t at the launch of World of Warcraft. I started with EverQuest 2. But I quickly jumped ship after a few years, joining the fun in Blizzard’s monolithic MMO sometime around the launch of Cataclysm. However, the experience always missed one immersive feature that most other games in the genre offered. Well, it’s happening. World of Warcraft will receive player housing after two decades!</p>



<p>In a teaser on <a href="https://x.com/Warcraft/status/1856769095112200343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Blizzard unveiled player housing for World of Warcraft, which is coming in the next major expansion, Midnight. From the short teaser trailer, it appears we can decorate the walls and floors with various trinkets and furniture, and there’s a quick scene of a warrior consuming a mug of some type of drink before sitting down at the fire, with the whole trailer culminating in a look at two floor mats with Horde and Alliance logos, respectively.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/player-housing-is-coming-to-world-of-warcraft-after-20-years-though-youll-have-to-wait-until-the-next-expansion-its-a-tremendously-large-undertaking/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Blizzard’s Ion Hazzikostas said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want to give players a little sneak preview of some of what the team is cooking. This also gives us a chance, I think, to have more open conversations about it that aren’t possible when it’s a top secret feature.</p>



<p>[Player housing] an idea that’s been kicked around for a long time—but we knew that to do it, we needed to be able to do it right. It’s a tremendously large undertaking.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Furthermore, Hazzikostas said the team wants to hear from the community regarding what they want to see and what they expect from player housing. If you have suggestions, don’t be afraid to make them known. Blizzard is generally quite active on social media, and they have forums where you can submit suggestions for the player homes feature coming in the upcoming expansion!</p>



<p>After all these years, are you still enjoying World of Warcraft? Let us know over at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Depending on how long you’ve had an account on Steam, you probably have hundreds of titles waiting in your backlog. You scored them cheap, right? I couldn’t help myself, either. I have so many games in my library, many of which I’ve never played, but whenever a new zombie survival game is on sale, I can’t help myself. I grab it. And now, you can score Dread Dawn, by developer Kioop, on sale until November 26!</p>



<h2 id="h-dread-dawn-is-on-sale-through-november-26">Dread Dawn is On Sale Through November 26</h2>



<p>Dread Dawn is available for 20% off for this extended sale, bringing the total price down from $19.99 to $15.99. While $20 for an open-ended zombie survival game is already an excellent deal, the reduced price through the end of November should help anyone on the fence.</p>



<p>On launch, Dread Dawn received a mixed reception from fans. The studio launched the game as a full release, but it was evident that it required more time to cook. An Early Access launch may have mitigated many negative reviews, but it’s still an exciting zombie survival sandbox!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-dread-dawn">What is Dread Dawn?</h2>



<p>Dread Dawn is a top-down, open-world zombie survival game with sandbox and RPG elements. You play a student trapped on the campus alongside your classmates and other survivors as the evacuation goes wrong and you’re left behind. With zombies approaching on all sides, you must find ways to survive, growing food, wielding firearms and melee weapons, and constructing barricades and turrets to help you defend against the encroaching hordes. It’s part tower defense and part Project Zomboid, but with a little more jank and no controller support currently.</p>



<h2 id="h-other-zombie-survival-games-worth-your-time">Other Zombie Survival Games Worth Your Time</h2>



<p>Of course, the zombie survival genre is positively massive, thanks to years of content flowing through the game development pipeline. If Dread Dawn doesn’t catch your fancy, then check out:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Project Zomboid</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dying Light 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>7 Days to Die</strong></li>



<li><strong>Left 4 Dead 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Zompiercer</strong></li>



<li><strong>No More Room in Hell 2</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Ready for Black Friday? With Christmas just around the corner, many gamers are trying to grab the best deals possible. Like every year, Xbox has quite a few deals people can choose from. Here are the best Black Friday Deals for Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-xbox-series-x-s-black-friday-deals">Best Xbox Series X|S Black Friday Deals</h2>



<p>Excited to find the best Xbox Series X|S deals this Black Friday? Well, Xbox will be doing quite a few deals for Xbox Series X|S systems, controllers and games.</p>



<p>However, no actual Black Friday deals have been released by the company, many are already speculating that the system will have huge bundle deals at stores like Walmart, Target, Best Buy and more.</p>



<p>Every year, too, many of these popular retail stores have a bunch of different discounts on games. With popular titles like Call of Duty just releasing a new game, gamers should expect to see deals revolving around the games to release on Black Friday.</p>







<h2 id="h-current-xbox-series-x-s-deals">Current Xbox Series X|S Deals</h2>



<p>Luckily, Xbox has a ton of deals already in its store, meaning gamers can indulge in the Black Friday festivities early on. Below is a list of current Xbox deals gamers can grab in the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/promotions/sales/sales-and-specials">Microsoft store:</a></p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X ($50 off)</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The page also has quite a few games for sale, too. However, the majority of these games for sale are not big titles. The big titles, like Call of Duty and more, will not be released until Black Friday.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-black-friday-deals">How to Get Black Friday Deals</h2>



<p>Luckily, Black Friday deals are not as difficult to come by as they were in the past when you had to wait outside a store until midnight. Many retailers, like Walmart and Target, will release their deals earlier in the day on Thanksgiving, giving consumers the chance to grab whatever their heart desires early on.</p>



<p>Still, many deals, especially on Xbox games and systems, will go incredibly fast, so be prepared to have your money out.</p>
