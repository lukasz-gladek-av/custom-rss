<p>MADFINGER Games has just revealed an exclusive new trailer showcasing the long-awaited Night Ops update for Gray Zone Warfare. This monumental and major overhaul introduces a day-night cycle to the open-world tactical shooter, forever altering the course of combat and further proving that in Gray Zone Warfare, <strong>every move matters</strong>.</p>



<p>In the snapshot trailer, we get a glimpse at how the world of Lamang changes under a veil of darkness. From new equipment to combat the shadows to quests that can only be completed at night, Gray Zone Warfare players are preparing to eat well when the Night Ops update is released on November 27.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-continuous-improvement">Continuous Improvement</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare was released in April 2024 to a very positive reception, despite there being some teething issues.</p>



<p>MADFINGER has been a stalwart force in tackling these issues, working hard to deliver a game that continuously improves and innovates, with community-led feedback sitting at the heart of everything the team does.</p>



<p>The Night Ops update has been on the cards for a couple of months, and following the release of a new teaser trailer, it has been revealed when that update will hit the ecosystem.</p>



<p>If you’re a Gray Zone Warfare fan eager to jump into some night-based activity, you won’t need to wait long. The Night Ops update will be released in Gray Zone Warfare on  November 27, which is also when MADFINGER will publish a full, feature-length trailer showcasing the impending changes.</p>



<p>I played Gray Zone Warfare as soon as hit early access this year and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-preview/">was blown away</a> by the depth of the game and the ambition of MADFINGER. I was then welcomed by the team at Gamescom to learn about these changes and to talk at length <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Marek Rabas</a>, the CEO of MADFINGER, about the future of extraction shooters.</p>



<p>If you’ve been enjoying Gray Zone Warfare, believe me when I say you’re not ready for Night Ops – it’s going to bring about a paradigm shift that’ll forever change how you play the game, but it’s <strong>all good things</strong>.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Night Ops? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>A month after version 1.0 was released on PC and console, Undisputed has received its first post-launch update for all players. The update addresses a few key concerns from the community while developer Steel City Interactive continues to work on it’s planned December update. </p>



<p>Some of the key fixes in Update 1.1.3 include adjustments to Deontay Wilder’s stats for more fair online play, removeable of the critical stumble reaction, updated blocking, and more. You can check out the full patch notes from the update for yourself.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-undisputed-update-details">Undisputed Update Details</h2>



<ul>
<li>Changes to the block colliders to ensure that block functions as expected and the number of power punches that break through the block is greatly reduced.</li>



<li>Deontay Wilder’s stats have been reduced, and we’ve removed a trait. His power hooks should now be less impactful.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Increased max stamina cost of hooks and straights.</li>



<li>Increased the cost of power punches to both short-term and max stamina.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Introduced a threshold on the number of power punches that can be thrown within a single fight before the stamina cost per power punch is increased further.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Increased the stamina cost of pushing, which should reduce the amount of people spamming the push mechanic.</li>



<li>Temporarily removed the critical stumble reaction from the game as it was too punishing.</li>



<li>Reduced the effectiveness and chainability of hooks by further slowing them down when a fighter is gassed.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue that would prevent players from moving if they entered flat-footed movement while fighting on the inside.</li>



<li>On Xbox and PC Steam: Ranked quitters should now receive a loss on their record, and the remaining player should receive a win. The fix for PlayStation is taking longer than we’d like and will hopefully be part of the December update.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Our best Pokémon TCG Pocket Electric deck handpicks the best and strongest lightning-charged Mon out there. Electric-type Pokémon are some of the most visually impressive and striking, and I’ve put together the most complete Electric Deck to use against AI or real-life trainers.</p>



<p>The beauty of Pokémon is the veritable smorgasbord of cool-looking, devastating creatures. Pokémon has many different elemental types, tons of eye-catching moves, and strategies concerning weaknesses. This leads us nicely to Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Electric types and how they are utilized.</p>



<p>Electric Pokémon have strengths and weaknesses like everyone else, but the type has one of the strongest sets of cards in the collecting game. Thanks to special EX cards and easy starters, you can build a strong deck, and become the scourge of almost anyone in Pokémon Pocket.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-electric-deck-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Electric Deck in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Focus your efforts on Pikachu packs. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best Electric Deck in Pokémon TCG Pocket requires multiple <strong>Pikachu EX, Zapdos EX, Voltorb, Electrode, Pincurchin, Item, and Supporter Cards</strong>.</p>



<p>Our Electric Deck is honestly as good as anyone’s in the Pokémon Pocket scene. It’s hard to build, yes, and you need luck on your side when opening the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-open-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best packs</a>. However, if you can assemble this well-constructed Electric deck, your chances of success drastically go up, and it can render PvP into an exercise in futility for your opponent.</p>



<p>Here’s the full deck and how to get it.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Card Name</th><th data-align="center">Card Type</th><th data-align="center">How To Get</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pikachu EX</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Pikachu Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pikachu EX</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Pikachu Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Zapdos EX</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Pikachu Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Zapdos EX</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Pikachu Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Voltorb</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Pikachu Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Voltorb</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Pikachu Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Electrode</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Pikachu Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Electrode</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Pikachu Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pincurchin</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Any Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pincurchin</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Any Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Giovanni</td><td data-align="center">Supporter</td><td data-align="center">Mewtwo Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sabrina</td><td data-align="center">Supporter</td><td data-align="center">Charizard Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sabrina</td><td data-align="center">Supporter</td><td data-align="center">Charizard Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Professor’s Research</td><td data-align="center">Supporter</td><td data-align="center">Shop Purchase</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Professor’s Research</td><td data-align="center">Supporter</td><td data-align="center">Shop Purchase</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Poké Ball</td><td data-align="center">Trainer</td><td data-align="center">Shop Purchase</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Poké Ball</td><td data-align="center">Trainer</td><td data-align="center">Shop Purchase</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Potion</td><td data-align="center">Trainer</td><td data-align="center">Shop Purchase</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Potion</td><td data-align="center">Trainer</td><td data-align="center">Shop Purchase</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">X Speed</td><td data-align="center">Trainer</td><td data-align="center">Shop Purchase</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>To start, you need two Pikachu EX and Zapdos EX cards—these are the foundation of this Electric deck. You need to focus your efforts on <strong>opening Pikachu packs</strong> as this is how you can get both cards, and we all know the lottery of opening packs in Pokémon TCG Pocket—so fingers crossed for you.</p>



<p>This deck requires Pokémon from Pikachu packs, so concentrate on this booster, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-free-packs-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free packs</a>—get all the other cards too—and the deck is set.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-electric-type-alternatives-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Electric type alternatives in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>The trio of <strong>Tynamo, Eelektrik, and Eelektross</strong> is a great evolution set to throw into the mix if you’re missing some cards for the best Electric Deck, and you can gamble on the regular <strong>Holographic Zapdos</strong> if you’re feeling lucky.</p>



<p>Getting the four EX cards is tough, so alternatives are needed as a backup. I like to mix things up with Tynamo and its evolutions because if the cards fall in your favor, Eelektross is a low-key monster. <strong>140 HP</strong> and its <strong>Thunder Fang attack doing 80 damage and a coin flip to paralyze</strong> are big-time attributes.</p>



<p>I’m not as fond of the normal Zapdos as it does “<strong>30 damage to one of your Benched Pokémon</strong>,” but it can be played from the get-go, and its one attack does <strong>100 damage</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-electric-deck-so-powerful-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Why is Electric Deck so Powerful in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>This Electric Deck is so powerful in Pokémon TCG Pocket because the <strong>EX cards can be played straightaway if you draw them</strong>, their main attacks deal <strong>high amounts of damage</strong> and don’t require much energy, their <strong>HP is high</strong>, and the <strong>retreat cost for each card is only one</strong>.</p>



<p>At times, the other Pokémon in this Deck are there to look pretty. However, aside from the EX cards, Voltorb and Electrode are straightforward cards with low costs and solid damage output, and Pincurchin is an ace in the hole thanks to its “Thunder Shock” attack capable of paralyzing opponents.</p>



<p>The Trainer and Supporter cards are ubiquitous across best decks, so there’s not too much out of the ordinary there.</p>

<p>Rebellion has releaved the release date for its upcoming survival-action game Atomfall. The studio has announced that Atomfall will launch on March 27, 2025.</p>



<p>The game will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. It’ll also be available on day one on Game Pass.</p>



<p>“Set in the aftermath of a nuclear disaster,&nbsp;Atomfall&nbsp;tasks players with solving the mystery of what happened at the Windscale nuclear power station,” Rebellion’s Associate Head of Design Ben Fischer <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote about the game</a>. “To solve this, you will need to navigate military encampments, delve through abandoned bunkers below ground, and risk your life in Pagan ruins.”</p>

<p>When it launches, the game will come in two editions: Standard and Deluxe. The Standard Edition of the game will be available both physically and digitally, and those who pre-order it will get a Basic Supply Bundle as a bonus. This bundle will “allow you to uncover additional items and supplies as you explore the game world, including an exclusive melee weapon variant, additional loot caches and an item recipe.”</p>



<p>The Atomfall Deluxe Edition comes with an Enhanced Supply Bundle that includes “an exclusive pistol variant, metal detector skin and character upgrades”. Those who pre-order the Deluxe Edition will get three days early access to the game along with the post-launch Story Expansion.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-preview-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview of the game</a> over the summer, Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill said that Atomfall is a “very open” game where how you act around other characters in the world actually matters.</p>



<p>“In conversations, you can choose from what might be several choices, each of which can lead a different way,” Taylor-Hill wrote. “If you want to be stealthier, you’ll put enemies on edge, and if you go in guns blazing, you’ll quickly draw an entire force down upon you.”</p>



<p>The full game is expected to take anywhere from 20-30 hours to complete “depending on how you approach the game”.</p>
