<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 hasn’t been released yet, but people are already asking about the franchise’s future. Specifically, how will AI change the development of Grand Theft Auto 7 and beyond?</p>



<p>During an interview this week in New York City, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick was asked about AI and its place in game development. While he’s not fully against the idea of AI, Zelnick remains skeptical about just how much it can and will help game development and general production. That includes making sure that what his company builds remains with the company. </p>



<p><strong>“We have to protect our intellectual property, but more than that, we have to be mindful of others,” </strong>Strauss <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/can-ai-create-next-grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-ceo-says-no.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told CNBC</a>. <strong>“If you create intellectual property with AI, it’s not protectable.”</strong></p>



<p>When talking specifically about Grand Theft Auto, Zelnick said even if there were no constraints on how AI can be used, it wouldn’t be able to produce what the team at Rockstar has been able to do.</p>



<p><strong>“Let’s say there were no constraints [on AI],”</strong> he said. <strong>“Could we push a button tomorrow and create an equivalent to the Grand Theft Auto marketing plan? The answer is no. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“A, you can’t do that yet, and B, I am of the view that you wouldn’t end up with anything very good. You end up with something pretty derivative.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as why, Zelnick said that AI is “backward looking”. AI productions, he said, can “feel new” because of the predictive models, and though there are things the data it’s built on can solve for, there are still areas that it simply can’t.</p>



<p><strong>“Anything that involves backward-looking data compute, it’s really good for that and that applies to lots of things,” </strong>Zelnick said. <strong>“What we do at Take-Two, anything that isn’t attached to that, it’s going to be really, really bad at.”</strong></p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is currently scheduled to launch on May 26, 2026, for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox Live is currently down for many Xbox users on all fronts, like Xbox Game Pass and <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">even the support page</a>. The outage comes at an inconvenient time, as Obsidian’s The Outer Worlds 2 is in the middle of its launch today. As for what the cause is, it looks to be an Azure service outage, as Obsidian Support has <a href="https://x.com/OESupport/status/1983586140478435817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mentioned in a tweet</a>.</p>



<p>Outages for Xbox Live are rare, but when they happen, it causes a lot of problems for many players. Without access to the internet, you can’t play multiplayer, purchase items, or download anything. So, when it goes down, it’s a big deal. Unfortunately, it just so happened to shut down today with The Outer Worlds 2 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6s-new-battle-royale-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield: REDSEC</a> starting up. </p>



<p><em>This story is currently developing and will be updated when more information is available.</em></p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Due to an ongoing Azure service outage, all titles may be temporarily unavailable to purchase or install on Xbox Series X|S, the Xbox app on PC, and with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass. We're working with Microsoft to resolve the issue and will update players with info.</p>— Obsidian Support (@OESupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/OESupport/status/1983586140478435817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>As of now, the only statement Microsoft made about the Xbox Live outage was for <a href="https://x.com/AzureSupport/status/1983569891379835372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Azure Front Door services</a>. The <a href="https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">support site</a> shows that it is out worldwide and affects everything in the network. This includes Microsoft Office and, of course, Xbox Live. Furthermore, the outage has been addressed by Obsidian Support, who mention that all titles are unavailable to purchase and/or install on all platforms. This includes Xbox Series X|S, the Xbox app, and Xbox Game Pass. As mentioned before, it comes at a bad time for Obsidian, as they just released The Outer Worlds 2. While early access has been open since last week, the general public only got their hands on it today.</p>



<p>No update regarding when the issue will be fixed by has been given. When one does, we’ll update the article with the official statement.
