<p>Sniping looks incredible in Battlefield 6, but there has been a consistent complaint: Sniper Glint. A Battlefield 6 dev has addressed this via social media and promises big changes coming to the game mechanic.</p>



<p>Nearly everything about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-phantom-edition-contents-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has looked impressive. Battlefield Labs has been an eye-opening experience, with hundreds and thousands of matches taking place. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-peaks-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BF6 beta</a> opens up the player pool significantly, and we can see for ourselves what it looks and feels like.</p>



<p>But gameplay leaks and official footage have already shown how extreme Sniper Glint is.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-sniper-glint-will-be-toned-down">Battlefield 6 Sniper Glint Will be “Toned Down”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I’m blind. Image via Battlefield Studios </figcaption></figure>



<p>Being a sniper is all about stealth and secrecy. Ensuring your position isn’t compromised so the enemy can be neutralized without a fuss. A social media post from <a href="https://x.com/TheBFWire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Wire</a> shows how exposed snipers are when aiming down their scopes.</p>



<p>It’s so distinct that the page even asked: “Do you think that Battlefield 6 should have Sniper Glint?”</p>







<p>Well, it caught the attention of Florian Le Bihan AKA DRUNKKZ3—a former player turned Principal Game Designer for DICE. They replied: “Yes. It’ll get toned down in scale a bit but it’s here to stay.”</p>



<p>Sniper Glint isn’t going anywhere. This is a good thing, as no Sniper Glint would be unfair. With no killcams and expansive maps, while snipers could do what the role asks of them very well, it could be too OP.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Yes 🙂 It’ll get toned down in scale a bit but it’s here to stay</span></p></article></div>



<p>We don’t know the scale of the Sniper Glint nerfs. It’s likely DICE will tweak the glint until the developer and player base are happy with the changes. How problematic do you think Sniper Glint is in its current state? How much is too much? Let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto Age Assurance Security Settings Leak, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-age-assurance-security-settings-leaks-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-age-assurance-security-settings-leak-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1263150/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Reports of GTA Online adding new age verification measures were recently leaked. Now, a new claim has shown the GTA age assurance settings with preview screens that aren’t live in Grant Theft Auto just yet.</p>



<p>Age verification has gone from being a concept to a full-blown enforcement of the practice. The UK has seen a huge clampdown on certain content—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/uk-age-verification-laws-online-safety-act-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including gaming websites</a>—and it could be spreading to gaming. It was recently claimed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-will-soon-require-age-verification-to-play-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online was gearing up to add age verification</a> to the game.</p>



<p>A new development shows it’s more than likely happening.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-online-age-assurance-preview-leaks">GTA Online Age Assurance Preview Leaks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What does this mean for the future of GTA? Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Trusted source <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tez2</a> was the one to break the initial age assurance story. Now, the leaker has shared “A preview of age assurance in-game,” but said, “This is not active yet.”</p>



<p>The first screenshot shows a new screen for GTA Online saying: “Verify Age – Please verify your age to access online features.”</p>



<p>Whereas the second screenshot shows ‘Additional Settings,’ which include the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Verify Age</li>



<li>Online Access (On/Off)</li>



<li>Store Access (On/Off)</li>



<li>Snapmatic Upload (On/Off)</li>
</ul>



<p>This information should be taken with a pinch of salt as it is a leak. Until Rockstar Games officially announces the introduction of age assurance and verification methods, it’s not absolute. However, Tez2 is rarely wrong, and we’ve already seen the code in the game files.</p>



<p>Plans could always change, so stay tuned.</p>



<div><article><p><span>A preview of age assurance in-game. This is not active yet.
</span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTAOnline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GTAOnline</a></p></article></div>



<p>I think this is only the beginning of age verification across the UK and the rest of the world. Many apps, games, sites, and pieces of content won’t be safe from these new rules and regulations. Will age assurance stop you from enjoying the content you like? Or will you go ahead and do it anyway? We’re keen to hear your thoughts over at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Destruction has always been a big selling point in Battlefield. With EA, DICE, and Battlefield Studios as a whole working hard to develop and market Battlefield 6, we know there’s a huge helping of destruction in the game, but you should temper your expectations.</p>



<p>My life changed the day I properly got into Battlefield: Bad Company, being my introduction. I’d only ever known using doors to enter a room, not grabbing a grenade launcher and blowing a gaping crater into the side of a house. Whereas Battlefield 4’s Levelution is still some of the most visually impressive gaming I’ve ever seen.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-took-huge-inspiration-from-bad-company-2s-destruction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 takes inspiration from Bad Company 2’s destruction</a>, that’s a fact. It’s been confirmed BF6 won’t let you flatten maps, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-dice-wants-interesting-scene-changes-in-battlefield-6">DICE Wants “Interesting Scene Changes” in Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Automated wrecking balls. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GNN</a> (through <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1952869411125100656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Bulletin</a>) learned many new details about Battlefield 6 through a special multiplayer event.</p>



<p>The game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-time-to-kill-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time-to-kill system</a> was covered in great detail—an ever-controversial topic in the community. But additional details about the game’s destruction were discussed.</p>



<p>GNN managed to grab an interesting quote on BF6 destruction: “We’re not aiming for complete destruction of entire areas, like turning a battlefield into a parking lot with nothing left. Instead, we aim to create interesting, environmentally stimulating effects through destruction – primarily creating interesting scene changes.”</p>



<p>If you have a village of houses, for example, I think it’s fair to assume you won’t be able to destroy them all until they resemble nothing but rubble. Certain houses might have scripted destruction or limitations—one house will only let you blow holes through the floors and walls, maybe?</p>



<p>Either way, we’ve seen from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-reveal-will-contain-3-hours-of-multiplayer-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer reveal event</a> and other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leak-shows-battle-royale-map-poi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay leaks</a> that Battlefield 6 doesn’t skimp on the level of chaos and anarchy you can inject into every match.</p>



<p>Is it a good thing that you can’t fully destroy entire maps? Or should it have specific maps and modes where this is possible? Let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. Worst case, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-upgrade-players-build-own-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Portal</a> should have something along these lines.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/genshin-impact-shut-down-playstation-4/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The HoYoverse team has announced that support for Genshin Impact on PS4 is being <strong>shut down</strong> and that the game will receive no further updates after April 8th, 2026. It was stressed that this decision was made due to hardware limitations and ‘platform application size’, and that PlayStation 5 support will continue as normal.</p>



<p>From September 10th, 2025, you won’t be able to search for or download Genshin Impact on PlayStation 4.</p>



<p>This decision garnered immediate backlash from the Genshin Impact fanbase still playing on the platform, which launched way back in 2013.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impactful-decision">Impactful Decision</h2>



<p>In a post on the HoYoLab page, the decision to shut down Genshin Impact on PlayStation 4 was unveiled:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your continued support and love for Genshin Impact on PS4! Due to limitations related to hardware performance and platform application size, we will be discontinuing support and updates for Genshin Impact on PS4 in future versions.</p>



<p>Genshin Impact on PS5 will continue to operate normally and is not affected by the removal and update discontinuation on PS4. Traveler will still be able to enjoy the latest content updates on PS5 and other supported platforms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was then stressed that the removal of Genshin Impact will unravel across three phases on PS4:</p>



<ul>
<li>Game Removal (September 10th, 2025) – You will no longer be able to search for or download Genshin Impact on PS4</li>



<li>In-Game Purchases Delisting (February 25th, 2026) – Store purchases for Genshin Impact will be removed from the in-game shop and the PS Store</li>



<li>End of Update Support (April 8th, 2026) – No more updates will be rolled out across Genshin Impact’s PS4 version</li>
</ul>



<p>The article from the HoYoverse team <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained how users</a> can port their progress to other platforms.</p>



<p>In the comment section under the article, the backlash was fairly instant and aggressive, with users branding the decision ‘disgusting’, ‘the biggest middle finger’, and ‘gross and dumb’.</p>



<p>Let me know in the comments if this move will impact you as a Genshin Impact fan.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-and-saints-row-delisted-adult-games-debate/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-and-saints-row-%E2%80%98at-risk%E2%80%99-of-being-delisted-in-adult-games-debate-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1263084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent weeks, few topics in the gaming space have earned as much attention as the ‘adult games debate’. It was recently revealed that payment processors for certain gaming outlets are cracking down on adult and NSFW games, targeting some of the smuttier titles that sit on storefronts like Steam.</p>



<p>It has brought about the rise of some activist actions from the likes of GOG, a storefront that made a bundle of NSFW games free to claim for a short time to protest the ‘financial censorship’ being pushed by some payment providers and processors.</p>



<p>However, it has now been claimed that games such as Grand Theft Auto, Saints Row, and Duke Nukem could be targeted by payment processors, potentially resulting in them being delisted.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-potentially-at-risk">‘Potentially at Risk’</h2>



<p>In an article penned by GamingOnLinux, it was highlighted that a digital retro storefront had been ‘targeted’ by payment processors looking to clamp down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/itch-io-latest-site-strike-down-adult-games-payment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on adult games</a>. The storefront, ZOOM Platform, <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/news/preserving-and-protecting-artistic-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained in a statement</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As you are likely aware, there have been a number of adult title de-listings across the industry. One of our payment processors made us aware that a “fellow member of the industry” was concerned about our content.</p>



<p>We have no plans to remove any titles, and will do absolutely everything in our power to prevent such de-listings. We are fervent supporters of artistic freedom and always will be.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/zoom-platform-also-had-payment-processor-issues-say-they-have-no-plans-to-remove-any-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingOnLinux</a> reportedly received an email from the ZOOM Platform team, explaining that ‘they expect the de-listing situation to expand further.’ It was specifically said that games like ‘Grand Theft Auto, Duke Nukem, and Saints Row were described as <strong>potentially at risk.</strong>‘</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto has long been one of the most controversial franchises in gaming, but the ‘NSFW elements’ of the game only make up a small part of what’s on offer. It’s not one of these smut titles that are hidden in the libraries of some questionable gamers on Steam, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>That being said, the violence, behaviors, and destructive potential of franchises like Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row could be described as gratuitous and harmful to the wrong people, like minors.</p>



<p>Is the answer taking them off the shelves and preventing people from buying them? <strong>Absolutely not.</strong></p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that ZOOM Platform is a retro-focused site, and these claims could be angled towards more classic titles, especially where the likes of Duke Nukem are concerned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Whether you are on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC, here is everything you need to know about whether Madden 26 is available on your preferred platform or console.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-madden-26-release-exact-release-date-time/#:~:text=Madden%2026%20Release%20Date&amp;text=Madden%2026%20officially%20releases%20on,game%2C%20starting%20on%20August%207." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a> pushes the series forward in new and exciting ways. For <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-gets-gameplay-deep-dive-showcasing-on-field-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay</a>, EA brought over the wear and tear system from College Football 25, and also introduced the Coach DNA system, which mimics real-life playstyle tendancies. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-franchise-deep-dive-shows-new-coaching-updates-gameplan-changes-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Franchise</a>, some of the big new changes include coach archetypes, weekly playsheet updates, a new weekly highlights show, and more. As for&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-presentation-updates-include-updated-gameday-experience-new-mascots-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">presentation</a>, Madden 26 features former NFL legends in stadium pre-game rituals, has licensed more than 40 songs for stadium music, and includes official team mascots. With that all in mind, let’s take a look at which platforms the upcoming game is coming to. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Madden 26 on Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Madden 26 ends a 13 year drought for Nintendo fans. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Madden 26 is available on the Switch 2</strong>, making it the first game in the series available on a Nintendo console since Madden 13 on the Wii and Wii U in 2012. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/gridiron-notes-madden-26-pre-order-details" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA</a> confirmed that Madden 26 on Switch 2 will have all of the same features as other platforms, meaning this isn’t a “lite” version of the game, as we have seen from other stripped down versions of other sports games on the Switch. </p>



<p>That being said, there is a slight visual downgrade compared to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-madden-26-on-switch-2-and-it-didnt-suck/1100-6532037/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamespot</a> reported that the game feels smooth in handheld mode, however it is reported to perform at around 40 frames per-second on the Switch 2 and the menus load slowly. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-playstation-4-and-5">Can You Play Madden 26 on PlayStation 4 and 5?</h2>



<p><strong>Madden 26 is available on PlayStation 5, but is not on PlayStation 4</strong>. This is the first time that a Madden game won’t be on last-gen consoles. </p>



<p>It’s odd that Madden 26 won’t be available on PlayStation 4, because EA is still developing EA FC 26 for PS4. Regardless of the reason, it’s time for previous generation console owners to make the upgrade. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-xbox-one-and-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Madden 26 on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>Like PlayStation, <strong>Madden 26 will be on Xbox Series X|S but not Xbox One</strong>. </p>



<p>On the Xbox Series X, Madden 26 supports 4k Ultra HD, HDR 10, ray tracing, spatial sound, and performs at 60 frames per second or better. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-pc">Can You Play Madden 26 on PC?</h2>



<p>Yes, <strong>PC users can download Madden 26 on Steam or Epic Games</strong>. </p>



<p>EA recommends playing Madden 26 on PC with a controller, and Xbox and DualShock controllers are both supported. It’s unclear if the game will be able to run on a Steam Deck. </p>

<p>Before pre-ordering Madden 26, it’s worth reviewing every edition and understanding the differences between them. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-madden-26-release-exact-release-date-time/#:~:text=Madden%2026%20Release%20Date&amp;text=Madden%2026%20officially%20releases%20on,game%2C%20starting%20on%20August%207." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a> officially releases soon, meaning you don’t have much longer to take advantage of the pre-order bonuses. Madden is much different than other sports video game franchises because EA develops both Madden and the College Football franchise. </p>



<p>EA used that luxury to its advantage and offered a package that includes both games. Not only that, but you can take the player you created in College Football 26 and continue their journey in Madden 26, after spending four seasons in school. </p>



<h2 id="h-madden-26-pre-order-bonuses">Madden 26 Pre-Order Bonuses</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There are several different coach archetypes in Madden 26. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pre-ordering any edition of&nbsp;Madden 26 comes with a few bonuses, including Franchise Coach Ability Points, a MUT Cover Athlete Elite Player Item, and a Super Star Legendary XP Boost. </p>



<p>Coach Abilities are a new feature in Madden 26, and there are 22 offensive and 24 defensive abilities available at launch. For example, the&nbsp;Trimmed Edges&nbsp;ability gives your offensive tackles an increased chance to win against various pass rush moves, while Sure Hands increases the likelihood of receivers catching passes. Coach Ability Points are used to unlock new abilities. </p>



<p>As the name suggests, the Superstar Legendary XP boost significantly accelerates the amount of XP earned in Superstar mode for your created pro. If you bring over your created player from College Football 26 and combine it with this boost, you will have a massive head start. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-devs-say-game%E2%80%99s-time-to-kill-system-%E2%80%9Cwill-evolve%E2%80%9D.1263015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 is set to enter open beta in the coming days, and its developers have addressed on of the game’s primary multiplayer concerns: Time-To-Kill.</p>



<p>Time-To-Kill or TTK is exactly what you think it is. It’s the amount of time it takes for a player to kill an opponent. As part of a media event in Hong Kong, developers from DICE addressed how the team is handling the system in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p><strong>“We’ve done in-depth research on TTK,”</strong> DICE’s Jac Carlsson said <a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via GNN</a> courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1952869411125100656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Bulletin</a>. <strong>“In fact, in Battlefield 6 we’ll be dealing with complex gunfights and environments. TKK is typically fastest in close combat (where it’s very fast), and the scenes we’ve shown in the trailers are mostly close combat.” </strong></p>



<h6 id="h-more-battlefield-6-battlefield-6-servers-will-use-bots-if-not-enough-players">More Battlefield 6: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-bots-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Servers Will Use Bots If Not Enough Players</a></h6>



<p>Carlsson continued: <strong>“We’ve actually done a lot of testing on the game itself, as well as a lot of historical experience, and based on this experience, we’ve found the most enjoyable and comfortable combat situations for players. Based on our own experience, the TTK in the dynamic battlefields of Battlefield 6 needs to be fast enough to keep up with the changes on the battlefield. </strong></p>



<p>Carlsson said that they used “a lot of data analysis” in order to get the TTK results that currently exist. However, the studio will listen to feedback from the players during the betas and after the game launches in order to “evolve” and “adjust” the game.</p>



<p>What do you hope to see from the TTK system in Battlefield 6? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
