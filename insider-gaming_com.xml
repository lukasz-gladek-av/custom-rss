<p>Ahead of VALORANT’s fifth year anniversary, the live-service tactical FPS from Riot Games is pivoting its model away from its regular episode release calendar. Instead, VALORANT will utilize year-long seasons, each consisting of six two-month long acts.</p>



<p>VALORANT studio lead Anna Donlon recently <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1876644967466090569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered this change</a> ahead of what is set to be the first season under this new model: Season 2025, or V25 for short. During this season, players are hoping to finally get some of the features they’ve been waiting years for.</p>



<hr>



<p>The switch from episodes to calendar year seasons was spurred by a need to re-adjust the VALORANT content release schedule, says Donlon. With Riot also running a yearly schedule for the VALORANT Champions Tour, the game’s growing esports ecosystem, switching to a “perfectly curated season of VALORANT” affords the team more space and flexibility to plan out both game and esports projects.</p>



<p>Many of the in-game projects that players have been waiting for might (at last) be coming sooner than later. Donlon explained that “most of the [dev team] expansion work” is behind them, meaning the developers can work on some highly anticipated features. This includes the replay system, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-sunset-map-changes-in-valorant-patch-9-08/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reworked map rotations</a>, ranked rollbacks (rating refunds), improved matchmaking, and less toxicity.</p>



<p>This first update of 2025 is setting the stage for a slew of updates to come:</p>



<ul>
<li>A dev update on upcoming gameplay changes and fixes is coming “in the next few days.”</li>



<li>An update on VALORANT mobile is coming some time in “the future.”</li>



<li>Head of VALORANT Esports, Leo Faria, will have more to share on VCT “in the next couple of days.”</li>
</ul>



<p>While Faria is expected to share more on the matter, Donlon did note that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pro-valorant-teams-made-44m-from-digital-goods-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan engagement</a> has prompted Riot to “continue investing heavily into VALORANT esports.”</p>

<p>A new company is set to take over the games and franchises that once belonged to former Take-Two Interactive-owned studio Private Division. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, former staff of Annapurna Interactive have formed a new company that will take over the franchises of Private Division.</p>



<p>The name of the new company is currently unknown.</p>



<p>The report states that private equity firm Haveli Investments out of Austin, Texas was the “unnamed buyer” of Private Division late last year. It continues to say that after the deal was closed, Haveli made a deal with the ex-Annapurna staff to place them in charge of the acquired franchises. Those games include Tales of the Shire, Kerbal Space Program, and the in development game from Pokemon developer Game Freak.</p>







<p>As part of this new deal, employees who were a part of Private Division when the deal was made will be laid off. It’s unclear how many of the approximately 20 employees will be let go.</p>



<p>“The current leadership of Private Division has told employees to explore their options due to the uncertainty surrounding their jobs,” the report reads.</p>



<p>What do you think of the changes happening at Private Division with this new company led by former Annapurna staff? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls will begin on January 10, 2025, and the devs, Netease, have just revealed what content we can expect from the upcoming season, including new heroes, maps, game modes, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-marvel-rivals-season-1">What to Expect from Marvel Rivals Season 1</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls will see the arrival of four new playable characters, the Fantastic Four. Three new maps will also be introduced: Empire of Eternal Night: Sanctum Sanctorum, Empire of Eternal Night: Midtown, and Empire of Eternal Night: Central Park. Season 1 will include double the playable content of a regular season and will bring the total number of heroes in the roster to 37 by the end of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The duration of Season 1 has been set at three months, and it will be divided into two halves of six to seven weeks each. The first half will see the arrival of two of the four playable characters, Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman. Additionally, Empire of Eternal Night: Midtown will be added as a new convoy map during Marvel Rivals Season 1 Part 1, and a new game mode called Doom Match will be playable in the Sanctum Sanctorum.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-battle-pass-nbsp">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Battle Pass&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The developers will provide <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNiYrOSLYD4&amp;t=146s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">double the content </a>of Season 0 for the Marvel Rivals Season 1 battle pass. The theme will be Eternal Night Falls, and players can claim 10 new skins through the pass. Season 1 Luxury Battle Pass will be priced at 990 Lattice, and players can claim 600 Lattice and 600 Units by completing it.&nbsp;The battle pass will not expire once obtained.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-balancing-changes">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Balancing Changes</h2>



<p>The developers are “toning down the prowess of formidable ranged duelists like Hela and Hawkeye”, meaning players will see these characters getting nerfed soon. The developers will provide buffs to mobile-type Vanguards like Captain America and Venom and characters that “shine in specialised compositions” such as Wolverine and Storm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Characters like Cloak and Dagger will also receive buffs to make them more “formidable in diverse team setups during Marvel Rivals Season 1. Lastly, Jeff the Land Shark’s ultimate range is also being fine-tuned to “better align with early warning signals.”</p>



<h2 id="h-pick-rates-and-win-rates">Pick Rates and Win Rates</h2>



<p>At the end of Season 0, Marvel Rivals developers will provide the pick and win rates for all characters across all available platforms. Players should know that the stats for PC and Console will be merged for quick matches as it features cross-platform battles. However, separate statistics will be available for the competitive mode. Players should expect these pick and win rates to be released every half-season.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-rank-adjustments">Rank Adjustments</h2>



<p>Lastly, the start of Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls will reset competitive ranks, with each player receiving a drop of 7 divisions, depending on their end rank in Season 0. Additionally, Season 1 will see the arrival of a new major rank, Celestial, which falls between the Grandmaster and Eternity ranks. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-additional-settings">Additional Settings</h2>



<p>Listening to player feedback, the developer will provide additional tools at the start of Marvel Rivals Season 1. A new option that allows you to boost frame rates will be introduced. Also, devs will introduce support for mouse acceleration settings for more customisation. A streamer mode will be introduced in the first half of Season 1 for upcoming and established content creators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details about Marvel Rivals Season 1 Part 2 will be revealed later, where we will learn more about The Thing and Human Torch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s tough trying to follow previous efforts, but the biggest and best games in 2025 offer hope. From stellar AAA behemoths to long-time-coming remakes and remasters, there’s a lot to be excited about. However, we start from the beginning with January 2025’s biggest releases.</p>



<p>2024 continually got better, leaving us to salivate at another jaw-dropping year at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a>. Last year is in the rearview mirror, and it’s time to shine the light ahead at what’s to come. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/grand-theft-auto-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> is lurking somewhere, ready to sweep up every award and penny from our pockets, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is camouflaged and coming for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-remakes-and-remasters-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best remake</a> crown, and there’s an FPS that could spell <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-will-be-on-xbox-and-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM</a> for all of us.</p>



<p>I’m already trembling with fear at how expensive this year could be. Let’s start with January 2025, and its biggest games to set the stage for the rest.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-games-coming-in-2025">Best Games Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>Release dates can change—even at the last second—but I feel confident in declaring these to be January’s biggest games. I’ve also provided their release dates for you to mark on your new 2025 calendar.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-january-16">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD — January 16</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The kings of the Kongs. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>January 2025 is a very remaster and port-friendly month. Nevertheless, I never tire of Donkey Kong’s underrated and punishing difficulty. Nintendo is giving Donkey Kong Country Returns HD at least one more port, this time for the Nintendo Switch. With the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-have-seemingly-surfaced-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 rumors</a> growing—and my belief <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/we-desperately-need-the-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we need a Nintendo Switch 2</a>—this might be the last chance to collect, swing, smash, and bash in Country Returns before it finally makes way for a new entry.</p>



<h3 id="h-dynasty-warriors-origins-january-17">Dynasty Warriors: Origins — January 17</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I’d hate to clear up this mess. Credit to KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD</figcaption></figure>



<p>I couldn’t tell you the first thing about Dynasty Warriors: Origins—or the series. Every time I see one though, I think, “This looks fun.” Origins’ trailers and gameplay reveals boast even more obscene on-screen soldier counts and epic battles. Dynasty Warriors producer and director Tomohiko Sho told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dynasty-warriors-10000-soldiers-tokyo-game-show-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, “The team set themselves the goal of having <strong>10,000 soldiers on screen at a given time</strong>.” Even if it doesn’t quite hit this number, it looks widely impressive nonetheless.</p>



<h3 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-23">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth — January 23</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Every Cloud has a silver lining. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-release-date-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC release date</a> is one to watch. Rebirth may have already been out for nearly a year, but that’s no excuse to miss this masterpiece. It may have underperformed in sales, but I believe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-deserves-more-love/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebirth deserved better</a>—in terms of sales and awards—and PC players are getting a superior version of the JRPG. The port features DLSS, Enhanced Textures &amp; Modeling, Improved Lighting, and VRR. Queen’s Blood has never looked so vibrant.</p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-january-30">Sniper Elite: Resistance — January 30</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Wait for the killcam. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a> is a rare, new AAA game in January 2025. Rebellion is back at it again with its sniper-gore-fused third-person shooter. I say gore because I’ve seen enough horrifying killcams from the franchise down the years to make me wince at the thought of them. More mission variety and creativity are promised as you seek to neutralize Germany’s secret Wunderwaffe&nbsp;weapon—and Sniper Elite: Resistance is a day one Game Pass launch.</p>



<h3 id="h-marvel-s-spider-man-2-january-30">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 — January 30</h3>



<figure><figcaption>That’s a big tongue. Credit to Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>One final port rounds off our biggest games of January 2025 list—Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. Spidey and Miles (and Venom) are surfing the web to the realm of computers with this polished port. Like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-marvels-spider-man-2-release-date-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Spider-Man 2 PC release</a> boasts improvements and upgrades on the original—<strong>Enhanced ray-tracing options</strong> being the news here.</p>
