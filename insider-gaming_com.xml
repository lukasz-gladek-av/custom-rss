<p>The Call of Duty League has published the full spread of competitive settings ahead of the 2025 season. On social media, the unveiling caused some issues with fans worldwide, especially concerning the mapset that has been lined up for the CDL 2025 season. It’s not amazing, and many fans are clinging to the hope that a resurgence of old maps will make their way into the pool.</p>

<h2 id="h-cdl-2025-season-settings-unveiled">CDL 2025 Season Settings Unveiled</h2>



<p>The map list for the 2025 season of the Call of Duty League isn’t amazing, and many are wondering why Control is still a thing.</p>



<p>Here’s the spread:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hardpoint: </strong>Protocol, Red Card, Rewind, Skyline, Vault</li>



<li><strong>Search and Destroy: </strong>Protocol, Red Card, Rewind, Skyline, Vault</li>



<li><strong>Control: </strong>Protocol, Vault</li>
</ul>



<p>Having just two maps for Control is a bit of a nightmare, and it’s yet another year that fans are clamouring and asking for a different mode to fill the competitive slot. For the longest time, people have asked for something like CTF or Blitz to make a return to the Call of Duty esports scene, to no avail.</p>



<p>The settings put forward by the Call of Duty League <a href="https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/competitive-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a recent guide</a> are mostly typical and nothing has changed from last season, but it’s in the restricted items that things start getting interesting. During the pre-season window, we’ve seen plenty of GAs get lobbied around, but the official rules from Activision are something else.</p>



<p>As usual, the need to keep things as balanced as possible is front and centre, and with that in mind, almost every perk and streak is eliminated. Only the RC-XD and Hellstorm missiles remain in the scorestreak selection.</p>
