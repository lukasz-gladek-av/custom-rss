<p>A fully automatic Assault Rifle with a lot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">firepower</a>, the best <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> Model L loadout can do some serious damage across <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medium and large maps</a>.</p>



<p>For those interested in taking advantage of the gun, here are the best Model L attachments, Perks, and Equipment to use.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-model-l-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best Model L attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic: </strong>Merlin Mini</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Extended Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-comms-weapons-attachments-intel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6 Model L</a> excels in medium-ranged engagements, with a slow fire rate that’s easy to control and consistent damage. The iron sights aren’t the best, so the <strong>Merlin Mini </strong>is a nice choice for Optic. Then, to keep you off the enemy’s radar, the <strong>Suppressor</strong> Muzzle is a vital option. </p>



<p>Boosting the damage range and bullet velocity is the <strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong>, making the weapon even more effective at range. Then, the <strong>Extended Mag I</strong> gives you more than enough bullets in a mag to finish off multiple enemies. Lastly, the <strong>Commando Grip</strong> improves handling with a decrease in aim down sight and sprint-to-fire speeds.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-model-l">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for Model L</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Flak Jacket</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4:</strong>&nbsp;Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Frag Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<p>Perks are a vital aspect of any loadout in BO6, and so we’ve chosen <strong>Assassin</strong>, <strong>Double Time</strong>, and <strong>Gung-Ho</strong> to get the Enforcer Combat Speciality. Then, <strong>Perk Greed</strong> allows you to select another Perk, and I find <strong>Flak Jacket </strong>to be a huge lifesaver, especially when enemies are lobbing grenades at the objective.</p>



<p>As for Equipment, <strong>Frag Grenades</strong> are a classic tool for catching enemies in enclosed spaces, while the <strong>Stim Shot</strong> keeps you topped up with health. Finally, we’ve gone with the <strong>Trophy System</strong> to support the team in capturing objectives.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-model-l">Best Secondary for Model L</h2>



<p>The best Secondary weapon for the Model L is the <strong>Grekhova</strong>, a fully automatic pistol that can support your battles in close-range situations. As the Model L is a long-range AR, this Secondary keeps you covered in those close-combat situations where you need something that has a faster fire rate and more mobility.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-model-l-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock Model L in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You will unlock the Model L in Black Ops 6 by reaching Level 40. This will take some time, but by playing objective-based modes and gaining as much XP as possible, you should get there in a relatively fast fashion.</p>



<p>Check out our guide on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to rank up fast</a> if you’re eager for tips on unlocking the gun quickly.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-model-l-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the Model L any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The Model L is great on medium and large-sized maps, but it isn’t he best at close ranges due to its slow fire rate. So, with that said, it’s an excellent AR but you’ll need to play to its strengths to get the most out of it.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-model-l-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the Model L in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AK-74</a> is an optimal alternative to the Model L, offering a similar fire rate and damage profile. If you want something with a faster fire rate, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ames-85-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMES 85</a> is one to look at.</p>

<p>Those looking to for a reason as to why Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown sold below expectations thus leading to a sequel being rejected need to look to the top of Ubisoft. </p>



<p>That’s what Michael Douse, the director of publishing at Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios, had to say about the situation. </p>



<p>In a social media post (h/t <a href="https://80.lv/articles/baldur-s-gate-3-publishing-director-blames-ubisoft-for-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-s-poor-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">80 Level</a>), Douse pointed the fingers at Ubisoft management, saying that the decision to not release the game on Steam day one hurt any chance of the game’s success.</p>



<p>“The last notable game on their platform was arguably Far Cry 6 in 2021,” <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1849147473354211400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Douse said</a>. “The Crew, Mirage and Avatar came in 2023 and didn’t perform, so you can assume subscriptions were at a lull when PoP released by 2024. Which means people wouldn’t be launching their store all too much.</p>



<p>“If it had released on Steam not only would it have been a market success, but there would likely be a sequel because the team are so strong.”</p>



<p>He then went on to call out the game’s critical success across the board.</p>



<p>“It’s such a broken strategy,” he said. “The hardest thing is to make a 85+ game — it is much, much easier to release one. It just shouldn’t be done as it was.</p>

<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown has sold around one million copies since its launch, far below what the internal expectations were for the game. Insider Gaming learned that Ubisoft was was expecting the game to sell on par, or better, than some of biggest Metroidvania’s in the market. When that didn’t happen right away, a decision was made to move on from the project.</p>



<p>Now, the team that developed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is no more after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft disbanded them to move on</a> to different games.</p>
