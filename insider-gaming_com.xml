            <guid>1405018</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov fans have been left bewildered by the latest string of social media posts from Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games. He recently unveiled a social profile created in 2024 linked to a website for a fictional entity named ‘CORE Corp’, and heading to that website uncovers a wealth of information.</p>



<p>At first blush, it appears to be an entirely new game, rooted in a sci-fi, interplanetary universe where Earth has been left partially destroyed by some unseen cataclysm and rendered <strong>radioactive</strong>. There are daily challenges to resolve, modules to unlock, AI characters to talk to, and stacks of mysteries to unravel.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-cor3-gg">What is COR3.GG?</h2>



<p><a href="https://os.cor3.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">COR3.gg</a> is the webpage that Escape from Tarkov lead, Nikita Buyanov, linked his followers to earlier today. It’s mocked up to look like a retro-futuristic computer interface, like something you’d find in Fallout or ARC Raiders.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Once you’ve completed the very basic login puzzle (by entering your email and getting an OTP), you’ll be given a unique identifier that you’ll need to hold on to. This will get you into the system if you happen to log out inadvertently.</p>



<p>The ‘CORIE’ operating system you’re exposed to will now present you with a string of options. You can check messages, interact with a virtual (but locked-down) browser, see that the weather is apocalyptic, and listen to a gravelly radio. There’s a notepad, an updater module, and a series of daily challenges that involve probing strings of files and attempting to figure out what the errors in them are.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>CORIE appears to be set in 2251, or thereabouts. There are ‘logs’ from the player character that serve as a little backstory to CORIE, or COR3, whatever it’s called:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Today is my first day as a private investigator for “History Unfolded”.</p>



<p>The contract has been signed and all the terms agreed for. But I am still shocked about how smooth that went. Those people … the “handler” – they didn’t even ask that many questions. It seemed like they knew me for quite some time. And that Aurana chick … stunning but dangerous. She gives me chills.</p>



<p>How did I even get here … have been asking that myself for several days now. Guess wanting something new and mysterious can sometimes lead to such adventures.</p>



<p>The main goal of that “contract” is to uncover some old mysteries it seems. But I wonder if those are truly a secret for the people who hired me, because they seem to be very well informed. Like having deep knowledge on most events.</p>



<p>Maybe they are looking for an alternative opinion, or maybe they found something interesting in my personality and skill set … Honestly, I am not sure I would even like to know.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>An on-site ’employment contract’ reveals that you’ve been hired by Aurana Strogova, and that you’re tasked with ‘uncovering the files related to experiments that took place on -redacted- from 2170 to present time.’</p>



<p>The entire thing is quite bizarre.</p>



<p>The top screen for CORIE looks to be set in some kind of underground bunker. You can interact with the environment, studying various items that are described from a first-person perspective. There’s a junk box full of scrap, a ventilation system, and various pieces of armor, including a mining helmet.</p>



<p>One of the item descriptions reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Darkhound ‘Oppressor’ Modular Plate Carrier</p>



<p>A universal plate carrier from a legendary company known throughout the solar system. I’ve taken it everywhere, wherever it’s weapon-based environment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It smacks of ARC Raiders crossed with Fallout, as I mentioned before, but it’s interplanetary. There’s talk of space elevators, cargo ships adrift in the great beyond around nearby planets like Venus, and talk of immense death-ray-sounding weapons built to intimidate and deter <strong>space pirates</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s a full-fledged space council, a navy equipped with battle cruisers, and the back stories of several characters are explored at length.</p>



<p>In one section, a faction called Alternative Future can be uncovered, but it’s said that to find out more information, you’ll need to ‘visit any one of (their) outposts.’</p>



<p>This is all very confusing, and fans of Escape from Tarkov and Battlestate Games have been left bewildered. While more information is dug up, it’s worth heading over to COR3.gg and seeing what you can uncover.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals Deadpool can play 3 roles: Duelist, Vanguard, and Strategist, and you can choose which role you want to play. </p>



<p>Season 6 of Marvel Rivals, Night at the Museum, is all set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-6-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kick off</a> on January 16, 2026, and it will finally bring the most anticipated character to the game, Deadpool. The developers have now released their Dev Vision Vol. 13, which goes over the new characters along with all the new content and changes coming to Marvel Rivals Season 6. </p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-deadpool-features-3-roles-in-one">Marvel Rivals Deadpool Features 3 Roles in One </h2>



<p>The latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmU6RtypJ3w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dev Vision Vol. 13</a> started very differently from the previous Marvel Rivals dev diary. In the most Deadpool fashion, the Merc with the Mouth stepped into Guangguang’s role and walked us through his character details himself. Deadpool first addressed the complaints about the game not having enough Vanguard and Strategists, revealing that he is the solution, as Deadpool can play as a Duelist, Vanguard, and Strategist in Marvel Rivals. </p>



<p>Deadpool features Dual Pistols and Dual Katanas, allowing him to battle the enemies at range and up close and take up the Duelist role. As a Vanguard, the character has a unicorn plushie that can give out shields. Lastly, the Dual Pistols and Dual Katanas can not only damage enemies but also heal allies when shooting at them as a Strategist. </p>



<p>Additionally, Deadpool in Marvel Rivals can level up while the battle goes on until he becomes a “true server admin”, no matter which role you pick. The character’s ultimate ability charges faster depending on “how fancy” the player fights, which leads to a challenge to other players. Depending on how the players answer Deadpool’s questions, the character will receive a huge buff according to the role he is playing.  </p>

<p>Developer 34BigThings has released a new gameplay trailer for the upcoming Carmageddon: Rogue Shift.</p>



<p>Announced back in early <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/carmageddon-is-back-with-carmageddon-rogue-shift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 2025</a>, Carmageddon: Rogue Shit releases on February 6 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p>







<p><strong>“Carmageddon smashes back with brutal roguelite vehicular‑combat mayhem,”</strong> the game’s description reads. <strong>“Adapt, upgrade, and unleash destruction on post‑apocalyptic zombie hordes. The legacy lives on, reinvented and unforgiving.”</strong></p>



<p>The game sees players go through a roguelite campaign with branching event maps, dynamic challenges and permanent progression between runs. There will be 15 upgradeable vehicles that range from tanks to hot rods with 13 weapon classes and over 80 perks to equip to your vehicle.</p>







<p>With it being a roguelite game, 34BigThings say that every run through the campaign will offer a “unique journey through a randomly generated graph.” There will also be branching patches, a variety of objections, and dynamic time of day and weather to make sure each run is different.</p>



<p>You can check out the gameplay trailer for yourself, below, and leave your thoughts down in the comments and over at the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
