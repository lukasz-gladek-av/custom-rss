<p>EA Sports College Football 26 was the best-selling game in the United States (US) for July 2026. That marks the second-straight year that EA Sports College Football took the top spot the month it was released.</p>



<p>According to the latest data from Circana, College Football 26 takes the top spot over from Elden Ring: Nightreign, which led the way in May and June. For July, Nightreign finds itself at 16th.</p>



<p>Following College Football 26 comes, well, College Football 26 again. At least, in a way. The EA Sports MVP Bundle, which includes both College Football 26 and Madden 26, came in second in sales. That was followed up by Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive Donkey Kong Bananza, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>As far as new games finding themselves in the Top 20, there were 5 games joining the fray. Four of the new releases all were in the Top 5, while the other new release, Grounded 2, came in eighth.</p>



<p>With five new releases in the Top 20, as well as a return of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, that means six games fell out of the list. Leaving the Top 20 were Stellar Blade, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Star Wars: Battlefront 2, Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, Mario Kart World, and Elden Ring.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-best-warbonds-to-buy/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2 has received a fresh wave of reinforcements in the fight to spread democracy following the Xbox release, and there’s a host of Warbonds available to purchase.</p>



<p>Warbonds are regularly released in Helldivers 2, with the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dust Devils Premium Warbond</a> on the horizon, which can make it difficult to decide which to pick up. Fortunately for you, we’re here to help.</p>



<p>Whether you’re looking to spend your Premium Warbond Token or are mulling over splashing some extra cash on more unlocks, we’ve got a breakdown of the best Warbonds available in Helldivers 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-best-warbonds-listed">Helldivers 2 Best Warbonds, Listed</h2>



<h3 id="h-democratic-detonation">Democratic Detonation</h3>



<figure><figcaption>For democracy! Image via Arrowhead Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>For those just starting out in Helldivers 2 and looking to give their arsenal a boost, there isn’t much better than the Democratic Detonation. With three pages of rewards, you’ll receive useful weapons, armor, and an armor passive, along with the usual cosmetics.</p>



<p>The G-123 Thermite grenade is great for taking out Terminid enemies, while both the Grenade Pistol and Exploding Crossbow can also be used to take out swarms of enemies. Just beware you don’t also take out the rest of your squad.</p>



<p>Add in some nice cosmetics and a return of 100 Super Credits, and it’s the ideal starting point.</p>



<h3 id="h-cutting-edge">Cutting Edge</h3>



<p>Initially one of the weakest Warbonds in the game, the benefit of the Cutting Edge Warbond has increased significantly following the introduction of the Illuminate to the game.</p>



<p>The Arc Resistance Passive is the perfect counter to the Illuminate, offering a huge amount of damage reduction. If you’re struggling to overcome that specific enemy time, take a look at this option.</p>



<p>Also in the Warbond are Stun Grenades, the Sickle Assault Rifle, and the Blitzer Shotgun, with both weapons having infinite ammo.</p>







<p>The biggest addition from the Urban Legends Warbond is the Anti-Tank Emplacement, the perfect tool to take out Strider Convoys and large groups of enemies.</p>



<p>With the Siege-Ready passive, you will benefit from quicker reload speeds and the ability to carry 20% additional ammunition, which is a boost for any combat situation.</p>



<p>There’s also a Stun Lance, a Flame Sentry, and a Directional Shield which, although not as stong as other options, can still come in useful.</p>



<h3 id="h-halo-odst-legendary-warbond">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dropping in hot. Image via Arrowhead</figcaption></figure>



<p>Not only is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</a> stocked full of unlocks that will release a wave of nostalgia, it also marks the historic moment of Helldivers 2’s Xbox release—the first Sony title to make the jump to the rival platform.</p>



<p>With four new weapons, two armors, a new armor passive, and a bunch of other cosmetic items, the Halo ODST Legendary Warbond is a solid pick-up for those looking to expand their collection with exclusive items. </p>



<p>The downside, however, is that you can’t use a Premium Warbond Token to unlock this, so you will have to splash out some extra cash. </p>



<h3 id="h-servants-of-freedom">Servants of Freedom</h3>



<p>Those looking for the ultimate weapon should look no further than the Portable Hellbomb, the perfect tool to issue damage to a large area or to clear out an objective.</p>



<p>The Ultimatum sidearm can also clear out huge groups of enemies, with huge explosive damage that is on par with an Orbital Precision Strike.</p>



<p>If that’s not enough, the Double-Edged Sickler has a larger heat sink than the original and increased damage penetration the longer you fire, though the downside is you could catch alight too.</p>



<h3 id="h-truth-enforcers">Truth Enforcers</h3>



<p>Any players who prefer their combat to be up close and personal should head straight to the Truth Enforcers Warbond, which features some of the strongest close-range weapons in the game.</p>



<p>The SMG-32 Reprimand Heavy and the SG-20 Halt Shotgun are the two guns in question, the latter being able to switch between armor-piercing ammo and stun rounds, giving you more versatility in the field.</p>



<p>Capping things off is the PLAS-15 Loyalist Plasma Pistol, a decent sidearm option if you’re looking for something new, and it’s particularly useful against heavy enemies.</p>



<h3 id="h-steeled-veterans">Steeled Veterans</h3>



<p>Ask any Helldivers 2 player for their favorite weapons, and the SG-225IE Breaker Incendiary Shotgun will more than likely be mentioned.</p>



<p>Dishing out huge damage and setting enemies on fire, the Breaker Incendiary Shotgun is the perfect tool for dealing with large swarms of enemies, and there’s also the P-4 Senator Pistol to consider, too.  </p>



<p>Also included in the Warbond is the AR-23C Liberator Concussive that, although highly situational, can be a powerful asset to stun large enemies.</p>
