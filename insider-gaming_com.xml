<p>Please, please, please keep an eye on Fortnite in the immediate future, as pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter appears to be heading to game soon. The breakout musical artist will seemingly be the next face in the massive roster of characters and real-life people to become playable Fortnite characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-have-you-ever-tried-this-one">Have You Ever Tried This One?</h2>



<p>The Fortnite leakers are the first to report Sabrina‚Äôs seemingly imminent arrival. Multiple leakers have claimed that Sabrina Carpenter is likely the next to arrive, and the @FNBRintel account <a href="https://x.com/FNBRintel/status/1903101976147095629" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> last week that an inside source confirmed that the ‚Äúnext Fortnite Festival artist is female.‚Äù</p>



<p>Another Fortnite leaker, @ShiinaBR, posted today that some Sabrina-themed cosmetics have appeared in the game files already. This includes a glittery microphone with a heart-shaped base and a red, sequined heart-shaped sticker that she regularly uses.</p>



<div><article><p><span>SABRINA CARPENTER IS THE NEXT FESTIVAL ARTIST üî•

Fortnite accidentally added some of her cosmetics to the files earlier than intended! </span></p></article></div>



<p>Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg, and The Weeknd have all been featured as the primary Icon in each season of Fortnite Festival. The rhythm game developed by Harmonix, developers of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, launched in Fortnite in December 2023. Each season features its own seasonal pass complete with songs, poses, and instruments related to the season‚Äôs Icon. Each Icon typically releases with playable outfits that can be used in various other games modes, like Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Whether or not Sabrina‚Äôs more risqu√© poses from her performances of ‚ÄúJuno‚Äù make it into the game remains to be seen. But a number of her most iconic songs should be playable in Fortnite Festival. Almost certainly, ‚ÄúEspresso‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlease Please Please‚Äù will be featured, with one or both likely to be outfitted into an emote. The current Fortnite Festival season, featuring pop idol Hatsune Miku as the Icon, is scheduled to end on April 8th.</p>

<p>All eyes in the video game industry are watching to see when Grand Theft Auto 6 will release. The potential impact on the industry is expected to be very large, but several publishers planning to release games around the same time are ready to delay just to get out of its way.</p>



<h2 id="h-we-don-t-want-to-be-anywhere-near-that">‚ÄúWe Don‚Äôt Want to Be Anywhere Near That‚Äù</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Christopher Dring</a> of the recently launched outlet The Game Business, ‚Äúthree major video game publishers‚Äù are ready to delay their games to avoid GTA 6. Dring says that the boss ‚Äúof one of the world‚Äôs biggest game publishers‚Äù told him: ‚ÄúRockstar games always suck a lot of money and, more importantly, time out of the market. We don‚Äôt want to be anywhere near that. We are working up multiple different plans for our titles.‚Äù</p>



<p>This past weekend at the Game Developer‚Äôs Conference in San Francisco, Insider Gaming‚Äôs Tom Henderson was told by a few developers that they‚Äôre ‚Äúwaiting to see what GTA 6 does.‚Äù Back in December, Bloomberg‚Äôs Jason Schreier reported that competing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-power-launch-date-competing-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishers are ‚Äúwaiting as long as possible to commit to their release date.‚Äù</a></p>



<p>The launch of GTA 6, tentatively scheduled for October 2025, reportedly isn‚Äôt just scaring off major new releases. According to Dring, two developers of ‚Äútop 10 live-service games‚Äù are not planning any significant updates during the GTA 6 launch window. One studio boss reportedly said that they would ‚Äúnudge‚Äù their releases ahead or backwards three weeks just to avoid GTA 6. The studio heads that spoke to Dring spoke of other potential issues, like a crowded schedule of other games trying to avoid GTA 6, but those problems seem preferable than trying to compete with a potentially industry-altering release. However, as one industry consultant noted at GDC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/if-gta-6-delayed-tank-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waiting on GTA 6 only for it to delay could ‚Äútank‚Äù those developers</a>.</p>



<p>Are game developers perhaps being too cautious of the GTA 6 release, or are they wise to get out of the way? Let us know down in the comments below!
