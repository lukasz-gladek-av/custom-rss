            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re halfway through December (almost), and the festive window is rapidly drawing nearer. Before it gets here, you’ve got a couple of weeks of NYT Connections puzzles to solve. Fortunately, I’m on hand to give you the answers you need! Below, you’ll find the latest NYT Connections hints to crack today’s puzzle as quickly as possible.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-15">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 15)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #918:</p>



<ul>
<li>FINAL</li>



<li>BUMPER</li>



<li>QUALIFIER</li>



<li>GIANT</li>



<li>QUARTER</li>



<li>MONSTER</li>



<li>SEMI</li>



<li>TITANIC</li>



<li>DIVE</li>



<li>CELSIUS</li>



<li>DUMP</li>



<li>COLD</li>



<li>HOLE</li>



<li>ONE HUNDRED</li>



<li>JOINT</li>



<li>SEE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of the stages you pass through before a champion is crowned</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Words you’d use to describe something so big it feels exaggerated</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Places you might warn a friend not to hang out in</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Different contexts where the single letter “C” takes on a specific meaning</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 15:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>

            <title><![CDATA[When is the ARC Raiders Cold Snap Update Coming Out?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-release-time/</link>
            <guid>1383184</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is set to receive a major update this week, with Embark Studios pushing Cold Snap to all platforms. It’s one of the biggest updates to launch since the game was released on October 30, and it’s set to introduce new map conditions, quests, and a fresh weather system.</p>



<p>Fans are excited, but when is Cold Snap being released in ARC Raiders? Find out everything you need to know about this update below.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-cold-snap-being-released">When is Cold Snap Being Released?</h2>



<p>Cold Snap will be released on December 16th, most likely at 04:30 AM EST. While we know the update is being released on December 16th, Embark Studios has yet to confirm the specific time that the update goes live. However, if it mirrors the launch of North Line on November 13th, it’ll drop at 04:30 AM EST (09:30 AM GMT).</p>



<p>This is the most anticipated update to hit ARC Raiders since the North Line update introduced Stella Montis just over a month ago. While no new maps are being added in Cold Snap, fresh map conditions are coming to blanket the game in snow, altering the landscape.</p>



<p>The Flickering Flames event will also be added to ARC Raiders with this update. Again, not much is known about this event, but it’s widely assumed it’ll be a harsh change that causes players to take damage if they’re stranded outside in snowy conditions. It should function similarly to the other map conditions we already have, like Lush Blooms, Harvester, and Prospecting Probes.</p>



<p>Cold Snap will be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on December 16th. Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re excited to explore ARC Raiders in the snow.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Shelter’s Largest Update Yet Comes 10 Years After Launch]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bethesda Game Studios has invested significant resources into Fallout Shelter, the popular mobile game that has since expanded to multiple platforms, boasting over 250 million downloads as of 2025. The staggering update has introduced a wealth of new content into the game, particularly on Steam, with new quests, characters, themes, and more being added in one comprehensive update.</p>



<p>The supersized update also introduces the first of many Fallout Shelter Seasons, new limited-time events that populate the game with new experiences, exclusive rewards, and a spin-wheel mechanic.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-shelter-is-still-giving-a-decade-later">Fallout Shelter is Still Giving, a Decade Later</h2>



<p>Fallout Shelter is a phenomenal mobile-first title for Fallout fans everywhere. It dropped before the launch of Fallout 4 in 2015 and has remained a staple of the series ever since. In Fallout Shelter, players are charged with building and managing their own vault, embarking on missions into the wasteland, levelling up vault dwellers, and repopulating a fractured planet.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588430/view/514102575975368959">blog post on Steam</a>, the team at Bethesda Game Studios revealed that the <strong>largest update yet </strong>has arrived in Fallout Shelter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Rejoice, Overseers – Fallout Shelter’s biggest update yet is here! Years of content previously only available on mobile is now available on Steam, including new questlines, characters, weapons, themes, and more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This atomic update includes the first Fallout Shelter Season, dubbed ‘Viva New Vegas’ in tribute to the second season of the Fallout television series. It also adds a new questline that mirrors the show perfectly, named Power Struggle. It features all the main characters of the show and boasts <strong>eight </strong>linear quests.</p>



<p>Fans of the show can even unlock CX404, the adorable pup adopted by The Ghoul, as a vault pet.</p>







<p>Are you still playing Fallout Shelter after all these years? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re excited about this content update.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Team Vitality Wins StarLadder Budapest Major After Defeating FaZe Clan]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 has concluded with a series between two titans: Team Vitality, the tournament favorite, and FaZe Clan, an unexpected entrant to the grand final. In the end, Vitality proved unstoppable, defeating FaZe Clan with a memorable 3-1 finish and securing back-to-back Major trophies.</p>



<p>The Major might be over, but Counter-Strike 2 isn’t. Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a>&nbsp;to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>

<h2 id="h-team-vitality-just-got-500-000-richer">Team Vitality Just Got $500,000 Richer</h2>



<p>The grand final began with FaZe Clan picking Nuke, where they managed to edge out Team Vitality with a strong scoreline, presenting fans with promise in the earliest map of the final. However, Vitality quickly regained control, crushing FaZe 13-3 in the follow-up. From there, the French-led roster never looked back.</p>



<p>It was a decisive victory for Team Vitality, which has gone down in the history books after putting up one of the best single seasons in the world of esports this year. The team claimed the half-a-million-dollar prize and lifted <strong>another trophy </strong>in 2025.</p>



<p>This makes Vitality the first team since 2019 to secure consecutive Major titles, which is a perfect way to end the season. For FaZe, the loss is a bittersweet one. It was a rocky year for the team, and many had their doubts going into the tournament, let alone the grand final.</p>



<p>Fans of the organization were begging for a redemption shot at the final Major of 2025, but it just wasn’t to be.</p>



<p>Now, we start looking to the 2026 esports calendar and whatever comes next.</p>
