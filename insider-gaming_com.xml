<p>It has been revealed in a recent report that Sony has cancelled two more PlayStation live service games, one at Bend Studio and the other at Bluepoint Games. It was further highlighted after the report aired that one of the cancelled games, being pieced together but Bluepoint, was a live-service God of War game.</p>



<p>The report stressed that ‘a recent review’ led to the cancellation of these two unannounced titles, and that following this revelation, PlayStation intends to continue supporting the development of single-player and multiplayer games.</p>

<h2 id="h-never-to-be-revealed">Never To Be Revealed</h2>



<p>In a recent article posted by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNzA2ODk1MywiZXhwIjoxNzM3NjczNzUzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUTdFWjJUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.OtpjLAX_fLRPjeIhmdZSXLhsiFNDef1RlL6IxoCIQes&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, it was revealed that two live-service games destined for PlayStation were abruptly cancelled. It was mentioned that neither impacted studio will be closed down:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Bend and Bluepoint are highly accomplished teams who are valued members of the PlayStation Studios family, and we are working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is the latest in a long line of live-service titles canned by PlayStation in recent years.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfm2febc2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Schreier confirmed that the Bluepoint title would have been a live-service God of War game. It’s not known what the Bend Studio game was going to look like, but early last year, the studio was hiring developers to work on an AAA live-service game with a military sci-fi ‘feel’.</p>



<p>Bend Studio suffered <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-live-serivce-images/">some ‘leaks’ in December</a>, with images being shared online of the company’s (now cancelled) game. The images were reportedly produced from a Google Drive and they were subjected to DMCA notices from PlayStation, which lend credence to their legitimacy.</p>

<p>The best Counter-Strike 2 launch options can set you up for a fun, rewarding gameplay session before you even join a server. There a number of launch options that CS2 players can utilize to improve performance, and they’re relatively easy to implement. These will instantly apply settings that will boost your game.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-apply-launch-options-to-cs2">How to Apply Launch Options to CS2</h2>



<p>Launch options can be applied to CS2 through Steam. To access launch options, right-click Counter-Strike 2 and select Properties. Under the main General tab, there will be a section called “Launch Options” with a single text box.</p>



<p>This box is where you will enter your launch options. Each option is a string of text consisting of letters, numbers, and various symbols. Each individual option consists of zero spaces, so you will use spaces between each launch option. Do not include any quotations marks when applying launch options.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-launch-options">Best CS2 Launch Options</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Here are the best Launch Options for maximizing performance and FPS in CS2. If you’re copying and pasting these directly into your settings, make sure you are only copying and pasting the bolded section, including the plus or minus sign at the start.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>+fps_max 0 </strong>– This is an essential launch option for players using high-end PCs, as it removes your maximum frames per second. For PCs that aren’t high-end, set the 0 value to 200.</li>



<li><strong>-high </strong>– This option denotes CS2 as a high priority process for your computer. This is a useful option for lower-end systems, but for all systems it will take divert processes away from other programs you have open. It can also occasionally lead to more frequent crashing.</li>



<li><strong>-softparticlesdefaultoff</strong> – This option disables the blending of particle effects with the background, reducing system stress and improving CS2 performance.</li>



<li><strong>-nojoy </strong>– This options disable joystick support, which will free up a small amount of RAM.</li>



<li><strong>+mat_disable_fancy_blending 1</strong> – This option disables “fancy blending,” making textures look less detailed but more smooth, improving performance.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want to apply all of these launch options at once, enter this into your Launch Options menu in Properties:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>+fps_max 0 -high -softparticlesdefaultoff</strong> <strong>-nojoy</strong> <strong>+mat_disable_fancy_blending 1</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Truth be told, if you have a high-end PC, then most of these options other than removing the max FPS will only be minor improvements. They won’t be substantial enough to explain why you’ve gone negative in your last few Premier matches.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: Microsoft, Activision Deny Report Regarding Financial Performance]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-activision-deny-report-regarding-financial-performance/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-microsoft-activision-deny-report-regarding-financial-performance.1084590/</guid>

<p>On Wednesday, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-purchase-hasnt-helped-xbox-game-pass-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report from The Information</a> claimed that Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard hasn’t resulted in the growth that the company expected with its Xbox business at this point. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-gaming-business-falls-short-despite-activision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report quotes (paywalled)</a> one analyst—portfolio manager Danny Fish—as saying “Activision has been disappointing” for the company’s overall revenue. After reaching out to Activision and Microsoft for comment, representatives from both companies not only said The Information’s report wasn’t accurate and “through omission is misrepresenting the business”, but provided context to show how the company has performed since the purchase along with the state of Microsoft gaming.</p>



<p>In its last four earnings reports, Microsoft has reported revenue increases regularly for Xbox content and services. Going back to Q2 FY2024, Xbox content and services revenue increased by 61% “driven by 55 points of the net impact from the Activision acquisition.” For the next quarter, revenue was reported to have increased by 62% with 61 points attributed to Activision. For Q4 2024, it was up another 61% with 58 points of net impact from the purchase. Lastly, Q1 of FY2025 saw the revenue increase by 61% with 53 points coming from Activision. </p>



<p>Breaking the numbers down, Activision has accounted for over 85% of each quarter’s revenue increase. It also shows, over the last three quarters, a slight steady growth outside of Activision’s impact from a low of one point to eight points as of Q1 FY2025.</p>



<p>What’s more, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella alluded to the purchase’s benefit during the company’s Q1 FY2025 earnings call last October about the acquisition and gaming’s growth.</p>



<p>“We set new records for monthly active users in the quarter, as more players than ever play our games across devices and on the Xbox platform,” he said while saying that the business is “positioned for long-term growth”. </p>



<p>Regarding Xbox Game Pass, Nadella said that the service set a record for the number of new Game Pass subscriptions on Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s launch day. He added that the service “set a new Q1 record for total revenue and average revenue per subscriber.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moving on to the suggestion from the report that, in 2021, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the company could “wind down its games business entirely”, the company flat out denies that. They point to comments made around that time with Nadella expressing that Microsoft is “all in on gaming”. </p>



<p>They closed by saying that engagement on Xbox platforms is “at an all-time high”. Microsoft says that they “are well over&nbsp;500 million monthly players&nbsp;and over the last year, we’ve seen consistent growth in monthly users on cloud”.</p>



<p>Regarding the report’s claims on Azure servers and the Activision deal not being a catalyst to get other studios to release their games on Game Pass, Insider Gaming was told that The Information’s report “conflates an opinion that developers are scared of profit loss with the fact that the business is already set up to pay developers up front if that’s their choice for how they want to structure deal”. </p>



<p>Microsoft is scheduled to announce its Q2 earnings for FY2025 on January 29.</p>
