<p>A new claim reveals that NVIDIA plans to re-release their GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs to counter the ongoing memory shortage. </p>



<p>The GPU market has been suffering from a memory shortage recently, ever since AI has blown up worldwide. We have already heard reports on how it’s going to impact NVIDIA, with some claiming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-prices-to-5000-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prices will get ridiculous</a> in 2026. Now, a new claim reveals how NVIDIA plans to counter this issue.</p>







<h2 id="h-nvidia-is-reportedly-re-releasing-geforce-rtx-3060-to-counter-ongoing-memory-shortages">NVIDIA is Reportedly Re-Releasing GeForce RTX 3060 to Counter Ongoing Memory Shortages</h2>



<p>The new claim about NVIDIA bringing back GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs comes from <a href="https://x.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hongxing2020</a> on X (formerly Twitter), via <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-to-bring-back-geforce-rtx-3060-q1-2026-tackle-memory-shortages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech</a>. The tweet from today only states that NVIDIA is re-releasing GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs along with an expected release window of Q1 2026. However, no additional details were provided, so we don’t know whether they will release one of the variants or both 12GB and 8GB versions when it is expected to arrive. Additionally, no pricing was revealed either. </p>



<p>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 was released back in 2021 and was built on the Ampere Architecture. The GPU was also packed with other gaming features such as Ray Tracing, NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and much more. There were 192-bit 12GB GPUs and 128-bit 8GB GPUs, both featuring GDDR6 memory configurations. The GPU launched at USD $329 when it was released, and players are hoping it returns at a similar price. </p>







<p>In other news, the memory shortage could lead NVIDIA to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-cutting-rtx-50-series-production-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut RTX 50 series</a> production this year. Additionally, an ARC Raiders backpack had single-handedly crashed the NVIDIA website last month. What are your thoughts on NVIDIA re-releasing RTX 3060 GPUs in 2026?

            <title><![CDATA[Can You Preload Hytale Early Access Before Launch?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-preload-hytale-early-access-before-launch/</link>
            <guid>1397119</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long wait for the release of Hytale is coming to a close, with the eagerly anticipated early access release now right around the corner, and if you have questions about the preload status, Insider Gaming has all the crucial information.</p>



<p>Hytale’s early access release is<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> set for January 13 on PC</a>, and thousands of players are expected to dive into the Minecraft-inspired title as soon as they possibly can, which may lead to strain on the servers.</p>



<p>That may lead to slow downloads for players, with preload a potential way to avoid such issues, and this guide explains whether the option is available for Hytale.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-hytale-have-a-preload-option">Does Hytale Have a Preload Option?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Roaring onto the scene. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no preload option available for Hytale. You will need to wait for the early access release on January 13 to download the game in full.</strong></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HytaleInfo/comments/1psbpco/preload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit </a>post covering the topic, a fan responded with details of the lack of preload available in Hytale, with a developer stating that it “would require more system to be built to decrypt downloads” and they “don’t have the capacity for it.”</p>



<p>The good news, however, is that it shouldn’t take too long to download Hytale when early access becomes available, as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">system requirements</a> for the game state an installation size of around 8GB. However, it’s recommended to have at least 10 GB of available storage, with 20 GB stated to be a safe bet.</p>



<p>As Hyutale procedurally generates a world that can continue to expand, the more you explore, customize, and build, the more memory will be required.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hytale-have-a-preload-option-in-the-future">Will Hytale Have a Preload Option in The Future?</h2>



<p><strong>Hytale may have a preload option in the future when major updates are rolled out, allowing you to download the newest content for the game before the servers are live with new content, but this is speculative at this point.</strong></p>



<p>Many live-services games allow players to pre-download major updates before they are able to play them, with major examples including Fortnite, and this approach means players are able to dive into enjoying content as soon as the servers are back online.</p>



<p>At this stage, however, it’s not known what approach Hytale will take, particularly in early access, given that new patches are expected to deploy bug fixes and new content regularly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s shaping up to be another big year for Nintendo, and one of the earliest releases of 2026 is the 3.0 update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons and the Switch 2 edition, with the full details of the release date and start times in this guide.</p>



<p>Though it turns six in Spring, having initially released in March 2020, New Horizons continues to be one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-nintendo-switch-games-to-gift-christmas-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Switch games available</a>, and the drop of new content will keep fans occupied until the inevitable release of the next game in the Animal Crossing series.</p>



<p>If you’re eagerly awaiting the Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 update and Switch 2 edition, Insider Gaming has all the release date details, along with the expected start times.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-amp-switch-2-edition-release">When Does Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 &amp; Switch 2 Edition Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Squad up. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Nintendo announced the Switch 2 edition of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and the accompanying 3.0 free update, will be released simultaneously on January 15.</strong></p>



<p>The Switch 2 edition brings graphics enhancements, including 4k resolution, to the game, alongside online support for up to 12 players at a time, a 3x increase on the maximum number of players supported in the game on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Those without a Switch 2 console will still benefit from the update, however, as there’s an array of new content to enjoy, including the Resort Hotel with customizable rooms, tasks to craft special island goods, expanded storage space, and new collaboration items with the likes of LEGO, Nintendo, The Legend of Zelda, and Splatoon.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-amp-switch-2-edition-release">What Time Does Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 &amp; Switch 2 Edition Release?</h2>



<p><strong>The exact start time for the release of the Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 update and Switch 2 edition has not been confirmed. However, previous update times suggest the new content will be available from 8 pm ET on January 14.</strong></p>



<p>The January 15 date covers the Japanese release of the update, which means players in the United States should be able to play on the evening of January 14, while those in the UK and Europe will likely see the update drop in the early hours of the morning of January 15.</p>



<p>The estimated release time is based on previous major Animal Crossing: New Horizons updates, including the 2.0 edition; however, that release was almost four years ago, so the timings could be tweaked. This article will be updated if an official release time is confirmed.</p>



<p>In the table below, you can see the expected release time and date for the Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 and Switch 2 edition across major time zones.</p>
