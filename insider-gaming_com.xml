<p>Use these Roblox Rogue Piece monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free Gems and Cash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogue Piece is an exciting anime-based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monsterverze-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that is based on the ultra-popular anime series One Piece, while also taking inspiration from various other anime shows. Players progress through the game by exploring various islands, defeating enemies along the way to get stronger and level up. The enemies that players will have to face get stronger as the game progresses, which makes grinding that much harder, and that’s where Rogue Piece codes can be of use to players. The codes will provide players with some much-needed resources, which can be used to get stronger weapons and upgrade existing abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many Roblox games nowadays require players to complete certain steps before they’re able to redeem codes in the respective game. Some require players to follow the social media profiles of the developers, while others force players to join the game’s official Discord server before the code redemption feature gets unlocked for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogue Piece, however, doesn’t fall into the category. Redeeming codes in Rogue Piece is as simple as navigating through the menus and inputting one of the active codes given above into the correct text box. For newer players of the game who may be unfamiliar with the Roblox menu ecosystem, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to redeeming codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Rogue Piece.</li>



<li>Click on the settings button on the left side of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down till you see the ‘code’ text box.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click the ‘Enter’ button to claim your reward.</li>
</ol>

<p>The developers of Rogue Piece often drop new codes during updates or special events, which means that the next set of codes could be released very soon. However, tracking the release of these codes can be a hassle, as it requires players to comb through the game’s social media handles or Discord server regularly. Instead, the easiest way for players to stay up to date with the latest codes would be to bookmark this page. We update this article immediately after any new codes are dropped, making it your one-stop shop for all things Roblox codes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox’s Phil Spencer Congratulates Valve on Steam Machine]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, has commented on Valve’s recently announced Steam Machine. Furthermore, it seems he’s on board with the idea, given Microsoft is a top seller there.</p>







<p>Just announced, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-reveals-steam-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a> is Valve’s answer to the console market. With the device, you can bring your entire Steam library to your TV, complete with a controller. The news has received a lot of positive feedback, particularly from Steam fans, who can now play on the big screen without hassle. With a new console on the market, one would think it would be cause for competition. However, in Xbox’s case, it seems like it’s more welcoming than threatening, at least for Phil Spencer.</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-ceo-welcomes-steam-machine-congratulates-valve-on-the-announcement">Xbox CEO Welcomes Steam Machine, Congratulates Valve on the Announcement</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/1988674569717313578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet on X/Twitter</a>, Xbox CEO Phil Spencer commented on the announcement of the Steam Machine. His comment can be found below:</p>



<p>“<strong>Gaming moves forward when players and developers have more ways to play and create, especially across open platforms</strong>,” Phil Spencer <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/1988674569717313578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a>. “<strong>Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox’s vision from the start. As one of the largest publishers on Steam, we welcome new options for players to access games everywhere. Congrats on today’s launch.</strong>”</p>



<p>Phil mentions that Xbox games are a high seller on Steam, which is partially true. Games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-300-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a>, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and Diablo 3 all rank among the best-selling titles on the platform. Seeing as Microsoft is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-addresses-rumors-surrounding-xbox-console-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planning another console</a> and its shift away from exclusivity, perhaps the next console could be similar to the Steam Machine. If so, it might be best for Xbox to keep a close eye on Valve’s new console. Either way, it is nice to see some camaraderie in the industry, especially with Valve being quite a threat to Xbox with the console now.</p>







<p>What do you think of Phil Spencer’s comments on the Steam Machine? Think Xbox will be doing a similar console? Will you be buying a Steam Machine in 2026?
