<p>Ubisoft has issued a response, somewhat, to recent reports regarding a deal with Saudi Arabia.  </p>



<p>Late last week, French newspaper Les Echoes (<a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/letonnant-deal-dubisoft-avec-larabie-saoudite-2144626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paywall</a>) reported that Ubisoft had reached an agreement with the Saudi-backed Savvy Games Group to develop new content for 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage. The Savvy Games Group is financially backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF)</p>



<p>In a response given to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-claiming-its-signed-a-saudi-deal-for-fresh-assassins-creed-mirage-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Ubisoft wouldn’t confirm nor deny that a deal with the group had been reached.</p>



<p>“We’ll decline to comment,” a Ubisoft spokesperson told the outlet. “We are focused on finishing&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>&nbsp;and excited for players to get to play it on 20th March.”</p>

<p>Ubisoft is currently in the middle of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-explore-all-company-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“exploring company options”</a> in order to turn things around for a company whose value has continued to fall in recent years. Those options also include a potential deal with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese company Tencent</a>, where both companies are in talks for a new venture centered around Ubisoft’s current assets.</p>



<p>At the time of the latter’s report, Insider Gaming understood that no decision or direction had been reached at the time. The belief is that the company is waiting on the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows before making any sort of decision about its future.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is currently scheduled to release its Q3 FY2025 earnings on February 13. It’s likely some sort of update on where things stand for the company will be announced during the call.</p>
