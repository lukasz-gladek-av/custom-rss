            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Mexico’s government has moved another step closer to putting a tax on video games it deems to be violent. On Friday, Mexico’s Chamber of Deputies approved a financial package that includes an 8% tax on violent video games.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://www.finanzaspublicas.hacienda.gob.mx/work/models/Finanzas_Publicas/docs/paquete_economico/cgpe/cgpe_2026.pdf">to the proposal</a>, the tax would apply to games rated “C” and “D” under the Mexican System of Equivalences of Video Game Content Classification. When comparing to the ESRB, a “C” rating is for players 18+ while a “D” rating is for games rated for “Adults Only”.</p>



<p>Back when it was first proposed in early September, the claim was that <strong>“recent studies have found a relationship between the use of violent video games and higher levels of aggression among adolescents, as well as negative social and psychological effects such as isolation and anxiety.” </strong>This was said without providing any examples of those studies.</p>



<p>This new tax would apply to all games, both physical and digital. For free-to-play titles, the 8% tax would apply to in-game purchases and microtransactions.</p>



<p>The bill hasn’t become law in the country yet, as it will now head to the Mexican Senate for debate. Should it continue to move forward and become law, games from popular series like Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat, and others will be subject to this new tax.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A recent interview with Sucker Punch reveals that Ghost of Yotei DLC is possible, but only if necessary.</p>



<p>Released earlier this October, Ghost of Yotei serves as a spiritual sequel to 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima. Following mercenary Atsu, she travels around Edo to get revenge on those who killed her family. The game, a PlayStation 5 exclusive, is one of 2025’s best-reviewed titles alongside Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. Now, with the game all wrapped up, Game Informer chatted with key members of the development team about what may be next for Atsu, if anything.</p>



<h2 id="h-ghost-of-yotei-dlc-possible-if-fans-want-one-says-sucker-punch">Ghost of Yotei DLC Possible If Fans Want One, Says Sucker Punch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/10/17/ghost-of-yoteis-creators-on-atsu-i-see-it-as-a-chapter-is-done" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, Ghost of Yotei co-director Jason Connell and lead writer Ian Miles talked about the game’s success and story. While the article itself is full of spoilers, it did come with some good news for fans. When asked about possible DLC, Connell remarked,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I think for us, we are at the spot in the project where we just get to put it out there and see what’s resonating with people and what people love and what people feel like they wish they maybe knew more about Atsu,” says Connell to Game Informer. “And I think for us, this is like the most important part of the project, in terms of making decisions like these, because same thing with Tsushima. You can listen, you can be like, ‘Oh, okay. People seem to want to know a little bit more about that relationship or what happened to the dad.’ </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Connell, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/10/17/ghost-of-yoteis-creators-on-atsu-i-see-it-as-a-chapter-is-done" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in the quote</a>, refers to Ghost of Tsushima’s Iki Island DLC, which launched with the game’s Director’s Cut in 2021. The story in the expansion revolved around Jin’s father, someone who wasn’t explored much in the main game. He continues,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“How do you further that character?” states Connell. “And you get this rare opportunity to actually listen to millions of people about what resonated within a story versus maybe what didn’t or what are the holes. And I think that’s the mode that you want to be in. And that’s sort of the gift. Certainly we love Atsu, and we think it’s a great character. And just like with Jin, <strong>if there’s rooms to improve it or to bring some new elements to life or clarity for the narrative’s sake and it falls within what is best for Sucker Punch, then we’ll certainly take a hard look at that for sure</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Without going into spoilers for Yotei, there are sure to be some paths that potential DLC can take. While the developers do state that they view Atsu’s story as complete, it’s not out of the picture yet. Given the success the title has had this year, perhaps we may return to Edo in the near future.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-files-injunction-to-bar-tencent-from-using-any-resemblance-to-horizon%E2%80%99s-aloy.1327942/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new update on the lawsuit reveals that Sony has filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to stop Tencent from using Aloy’s resemblance and other elements from the Horizon series. </p>



<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has filed a case against Tencent for copyright and trademark infringement in a California federal court. The company has already called the accused’s upcoming title a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-calls-tencents-defense-in-horizon-clone-lawsuit-nonsense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blatant knock-off</a>” after their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-claps-back-at-sony-playstations-horizon-clone-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion to dismiss</a>. Now, Sony is seeking an injunction. </p>



<h2 id="h-sony-wants-to-hold-a-hearing-next-month">Sony Wants to Hold a Hearing Next Month </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/breaking-sony-asks-judge-corley-for-preliminary-injunction-against-tencents-upcoming-light-of-motiram-in-november-or-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Fray</a>, Sony is seeking a preliminary injunction in the Horizon clone lawsuit against Tencent. The motion is to stop Tencent “from reproducing, preparing derivative works of, displaying, performing, and distributing any works copied or derived from SIE’s Horizon Works, including Light of Motiram, and from using the ALOY Character Mark or any confusingly similar mark pending trial.”</p>



<p>Coming to what the Aloy Character Mark is, “she is a young and fierce tribal warrior huntress characterized by fiery red hair, high cheekbones, and outfits that blend tribal and industrial metallic elements.” The injunction also seeks to stop Tencent from using visual, audio, and storyline elements from the Horizon series.</p>



<p>Sony has asked Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, from the FTC v. Microsoft-Activision Blizzard case, to hold a hearing by November 20, 2025. The company wants a decision by the end of that month or in December. Sony has also added several sworn declarations along with the personal injunction, which includes statements from Guerrilla Games Studio and Art Director Jan-Bart van Beek, the studio’s music lead Lucas van Tol, PlayStation Productions head Asad Qizilbash, and Sony brand IP director Matthew Kuykendall.</p>



<p>In other news, Horizon Zero Dawn movie plans to start shooting in 2026 and is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-zero-dawn-movie-planned-to-release-in-2027-court-documents-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeting a 2027 release</a>. Additionally, Tencent had responded to Sony’s copyright and trademark infringement lawsuit with a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-claps-back-at-sony-playstations-horizon-clone-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion to dismiss</a>.
