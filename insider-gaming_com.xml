<p>Use these Roblox Last Letter monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free spins and much more.</p>



<p>Last Letter is a wordplay-based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-blade-x-zombies-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that shares the same environmental design as the prominent shooter title Rivals. The gameplay depends entirely on your knowledge of words and the overall English lexicon. While this can be a strong way to win, you’ll also need Styles. Styles are in-game features that provide users with special abilities that can be used mid-game or strategically, especially when you’re losing. Redeem the active Last Letter codes to fill your treasury with free Spins. Use these Spins to obtain the best Styles and get a red-hot winning streak.</p>

<p>Last Letter codes, upon redemption, offer free Spins. Spins are vital in Last Letter since they provide Styes. Styles are nothing but playstyles that enhance your avatar’s capabilities to perform better in all the letter game modes. There are different types of Styles, each with its own traits. For example, the Upside Down style is for a messy playstyle, where its ability turns the current word upside down for everyone. Similar to this, each Style, when used at the right time, will rewrite your game’s outcome.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/budapest-major-protestors-face-sabotage-bounty-from-casino-founder.1363423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you want to earn an easy $2,500, you’d better step up and identify who it was that protested Valve’s ‘censorship’ of Gamdom’s branding at the StarLadder Budapest Major. Hours ago, footage surfaced online of protestors wielding ‘f*** Valve’ signs and demanding that the company reinstate Imperial’s new logo sticker, which featured Gamdom branding.</p>



<p>The group wore t-shirts that identified them as Gamdom representatives, but the casino’s founder came out on social media to suggest it was an act of sabotage by a competitor, and promised $2,500 for information leading to the identification of the wrongdoers.</p>



<h2 id="h-and-it-s-only-the-first-stage">And It’s Only The First Stage</h2>



<p>Images and videos surfaced online showing six protestors at the StarLadder Budapest Major, a $1.25 million Counter-Strike 2 tournament. These protestors wore shirts that spelled ‘Modmag’, which is Gamdom backwards, and they were there to ‘protest’ the recent change by Valve that removed a gambling reference from Imperial Esports’ sticker.</p>



<p>As if it wasn’t bad enough that the event had already been hit with audio issues and the incorrect lining up of highlight clips by the stream’s editors.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip from a channel on social media:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>😒 Another ""riot"" accident on CS Major grounds — this time the casino behind the Imperial team hired protestors with "FUCK VALVE" signs.  </p><p>Valve recently reverted the Imperial logo to the old one, as their current logo is a casino one.   </p><p>The video is blurred for ethical… <a href="https://t.co/pctUq85vwy">pic.twitter.com/pctUq85vwy</a></p></div>— CS2 NEWS (@CS2News_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/CS2News_EN/status/1992940298142363935?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>In a shocking response, the founder of Gamdom, <strong>Felix Römer</strong>, commented under the post declaring the protest an act of sabotage by a competing casino.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/GamdomHowly/status/1992952514124411390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">He wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is NOT Gamdom or Imperial “protesting” This is an effort to sabotage us more by a competitor Paying a $2.5k bounty per person that is identified here holding up the signs, we are going to take legal action, this bs doesn’t belong to the majors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, fans of the Counter-Strike scene were quick to pick apart <strong>Römer</strong>, suggesting that it’s <strong>his company </strong>that doesn’t belong in the competitive gaming scene.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playboi-carti-fortnite-skin/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-we-know-about-playboi-carti-fortnite-skin.1363390/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nothing is off the table for Fortnite anymore, so when it’s rumored that a Playboi Carti Fortnite skin could be added to the in-game store, it’s believable. Here’s the latest on the Playboi Carti Fortnite Skin leak, if it’s true, and more.</p>



<p><em>Another </em>small-fry name has been outed for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-hour-chapter-6-finale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>: A small-time rapper with nearly 50 million followers on Spotify, number one albums, and a bunch of other successes. Obvious banter aside, Playboi Carti has established themself as one of the most prominent and mainstream rap artists on the planet.</p>



<p>What could be bigger than Playboi Carti? Why, a collaboration between Fortnite and Playboi Carti. Let’s see if it’s true.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-playboi-carti-coming-to-fortnite">Is Playboi Carti Coming To Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It could be one for the album. Credit to AWGE &amp; Interscope</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Multiple leaks indicated that Playboi Carti was indeed on the way to Fortnite with at least one skin as part of a unique crossover, and then the rapper themself seemed to confirm the collab on Instagram.</strong></p>



<p>Usual leaker Shiina was one of many to suggest a Playboi Carti skin was coming at the very least. The official Playboi Carti Instagram posted a very interesting image to the rapper’s story to bolster the claim.</p>



<p>It’s a very simple and obvious clue: <strong>A giant Fortnite logo</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unless this is either a giant coincidence or evil trolling, it’s safe to assume that Playboi Carti is coming to the live-service shooter in one form or another.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-playboi-carti-content-will-be-included-in-fortnite">Which Playboi Carti Content Will Be Included In Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>The Playboi Carti content isn’t official, but leaks indicate that the game is receiving at least one Playboi Carti skin, and perhaps even a special in-game event to go with it.</strong></p>



<p>Happy Power thinks a skin is a guarantee, and says the content: “Will feature the ‘Evil Jordan’ outfit as well. </p>



<p>The attire in question relates to Playboi Carti’s song Evil Jordan, where the singer has a Batman/demon-esuqe head garment, with a red bandana and other eye-catching qualities.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Kurrco has gone one better and claimed an ‘In-game event’ is also planned.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Until anything is official, take any information with a pinch of salt. But it would be another in the never-ending conveyor belt of crossovers and special skins if it happens.</p>



<p>Where would a Playboi Carti bundle or special items rank on your wanted list? Is Epic and Fortnite’s pulling power officially unlimited?

            <title><![CDATA[Steam Machine—Everything To Know About Valve’s New System]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-machine-everything-to-know-about-valves-new-system/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-machine%E2%80%94everything-to-know-about-valve%E2%80%99s-new-system.1363357/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After months of rumor and speculation, Valve revealed its new Steam Machine console in November 2025, to the surprise of many. The announcement wasn’t advertised and, aside from some insiders, wasn’t expected. But then it happened, a new Steam Machine revealed nearly 10 years to the day of the release of Valve’s first attempt at the living room console space.</p>



<p>Valve’s newest piece of hardware—aside from the Steam Controller and Steam Frame VR Headset—is aiming to bring PC gaming to the living</p>



<p>Ahead of its release in 2026, there’s plenty to learn about the Steam Machine. That’s why Insider Gaming has put together a one-stop shop of information with everything you need to know about the Steam Machine. This page will be updated regularly as any news breaks, so bookmark it and check back often for the latest.</p>







<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-everything-we-know-about-the-steam-machine">Everything We Know About The Steam Machine</h2>



<p>The Steam Machine was <strong>announced on November 12, 2025</strong>, as part of a major announcement of the latest Valve hardware. In addition to the affectionately named “Gabecube”, Valve revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-announces-the-steam-frame-vr-headset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Frame VR Headset</a> and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-controller-2-announced-by-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second Steam Controller</a>. </p>



<h3>Steam Machine Release Date</h3>



<p>When the console was announced in November, Valve said that the Steam Machine would release in early 2026. As of writing, Valve still hasn’t confirmed an official release date. If you want to narrow down a window, it’s expected to launch by April 2026.</p>



<p>More details on a release date are expected to come after the start of the new year. That’s also when you’ll be able to find out where you can buy a Steam Machine for yourself. </p>



<h3>How Much Will The Steam Machine Cost?</h3>



<p>Like the release date, Valve has yet to reveal the price of the Steam Machine. What’s happened since the announcement, though, has been plenty of speculation. </p>



<p>Many fans believed that it would be priced like a traditional video game console. However, Valve has confirmed that it will, instead, be priced as PC because, as you’ll see later on, it is a fully functional computer. </p>



<p>When it releases, there will be two Steam Machine models to choose from: 512GB and 2TB. There will also be an option to buy a bundle that includes the Steam Controller. </p>



<p>That means a variety of prices will be available. There will be one price for the 512GB version of the Steam Machine and a different, more expensive price, for the 2TB. There will also be separate prices for the bundles with the new Steam Controller.</p>







<h3>What Are The Steam Machine Specs?</h3>



<p>When the Steam Machine was announced, the first thing everyone wanted to know was how powerful will it be. Based on the confirmed specs, it is being targeted to compare to most entry level gaming PCs.</p>



<p>Valve says that the system can support 4K 60FPS gaming when using AMD FSR. If you are just looking for 1080P gaming, you should have no problem reaching those numbers on higher settings.</p>



<p>The Steam Machine will feature an Arch-based SteamOS 3 but can support other operating systems if desired. It includes 16GB DDR5 RAM, an internal power supply, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. Where some might be disappointed is the fact that it’s video outputs are DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0. The older technology could limit quality in the coming years as opposed to just including HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.0 or 2.1.</p>



<p>You can check out full details on what’s inside the Steam Machine below.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Spec</th><th>Details</th></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Semi-custom AMD Zen 4 6C / 12T<br>Up to 4.8 GHz, 30 W TDP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>Semi-custom AMD RDNA3 28 CUs<br>2.45 GHz max sustained clock, 110 W TDP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>16 GB DDR5 + 8 GB GDDR6 VRAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Power</strong></td><td>Internal power supply (AC 110-240 V)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>Two models:<br>• 512 GB NVMe SSD<br>• 2 TB NVMe SSD<br>Both include a high-speed microSD card slot</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Wi-Fi</strong></td><td>2×2 Wi-Fi 6E</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bluetooth</strong></td><td>Bluetooth 5.3 with dedicated antenna</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Steam Controller</strong></td><td>Integrated 2.4 GHz Steam Controller wireless adapter</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Displays</strong></td><td>DisplayPort 1.4: Up to 4 K @ 240 Hz or 8 K @ 60 Hz / HDR, FreeSync, daisy-chain support<br>HDMI 2.0: Up to 4 K @ 120 Hz / HDR, FreeSync, CEC support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>USB Ports</strong></td><td>Front: 2 × USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports<br>Back: 2 × USB-A 2.0 (high speed) + 1 × USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Networking</strong></td><td>Gigabit Ethernet</td></tr><tr><td><strong>LED Strip</strong></td><td>17 individually addressable RGB LEDs (for status and custom lighting)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size &amp; Weight</strong></td><td>Size: 152 mm tall (148 mm without feet) × 162.4 mm deep × 156 mm wide<br>Weight: 2.6 kg</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Operating System</strong></td><td>SteamOS 3 (Arch-based)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Desktop Environment</strong></td><td>KDE Plasma</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3>Steam Machine General Features</h3>



<p>The Steam Machine is a uniquely designed system that looks like nothing Valve has ever released. As mentioned, it’s a PC in a box that’s designed to make it easier to quickly play your PC games on your TV.</p>



<p>Size wise, it’s just under 6″ tall, about 6.3″ deep, and just over 6″ wide. Its small size should allow it to fit discretely in more entertainment centers. There is a large fan on the back aimed at keeping the internal power supply and other components cool at all times, and that’s kind of what the box is designed around.</p>



<p>On the back there are two USB-A 2.0 ports and a USB-C 3.2 Gen 3 port to go along with video outputs, ethernet, and power connector. The front of the box includes two USB-A 3.2 ports, a microSD slot, power button, and indicator LED. There are also two features on the front to give the Steam Machine a unique look.</p>



<p>First, the system allows swappable faceplates similar to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-selling-xbox-360-games-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox 360</a>. The plate is magnetic for easy removal, and there’s sure to be a number of third-party designs available when the system releases. For those who want to make their own, Valve is planning on making 3D files available as well. </p>



<p>Under the faceplate is a customizable LED strip that will let you change colors and animations for things like download progress, console updates, errors, and more. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yotei-update-1-100-patch-notes%E2%80%94new-game-plus-cosmetics-bug-fixes.1363303/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The newest update for Ghost of Yotei, Version 1.100, as well as patch notes, are available now. With it, New Game Plus has been added, alongside new cosmetics and various bug fixes.</p>







<p>Released in October, Ghost of Yotei serves as a spiritual sequel to 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima. Following mercenary Atsu, she travels across Edo to exact revenge on those who killed her family. The PlayStation 5 exclusive is one of 2025’s best-reviewed titles alongside Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. While it isn’t nominated for Game of the Year at The Game Awards, it did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snag some huge nominations</a> like Best Music and Best Performance. Earlier this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-new-game-plus-date-revealed-adds-new-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sucker Punch teased Patch 1.100</a>, which would add many new elements. Now, we have a detailed look thanks to the patch notes.</p>



<p>The 1.100 update for Ghost of Yotei isn’t too long, patch notes-wise. However, it finally adds a highly requested mode: New Game Plus.

<p>Finding a good gift for the gamer in your life when you’re working with a tight budget can feel tougher than it probably should. After all, prices keep going up and money feels tighter for many. But not every present needs to cost you a fortune. That’s why Insider Gaming has put together a list of genuinely fun, useful gifts that still feel thoughtful and worth unwrapping. The best part, these gaming gifts are all on the cheap side at less than $25. </p>



<p>Whether you’re shopping for a friend, a family member, or just treating yourself, these picks prove you don’t need to overspend to give something great. When it comes to gifting, sometimes the smaller items end up being the ones people appreciate the most. A clever phone stand, a handy charging dock, or even a retro-themed game or controller can upgrade someone’s setup without hitting your wallet hard. And for those who love gaming culture as much as playing the games, books, card games, and novelty items can be just as meaningful as any big-ticket tech.</p>



<p>Below, you’ll find a mix gifts that stay under that $25 ceiling, making it easier to stick to a budget while still giving something they’ll actually use. Let’s take a look at the best cheap gaming gifts for 2025.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-gaming-gifts-under-25">Best Gaming Gifts Under $25</h2>



<p><strong>1985 Games Mystery Dice</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want to get a new set of dice for your Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaigns or other table-top nights? This mystery dice set takes the decision of what dice to use out of your hand and gives you a random set of seven. This adds a little extra excitement before your next game night. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>FYOUNG Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 Controller Charging Dock</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Charging wireless controllers can be frustrating, especially if you forget to plug them in after use. For those with the Nintendo Switch, you can only charge the ones on your console usually, leaving your extras without the juice. This charging dock keeps up to four Joy-Cons charged and works with both Switch 1 <em>and </em>Switch 2 controllers.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>AZURAOKEY Carrying Case</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X are expensive pieces of equipment. So, why not protect the investment with a carrying cat that also comes with compartments for your chargers, memory cards, and other small accessories?</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>SOUNDANCE Laptop Stand</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Not much you can say about a laptop stand. It opens up room on your desk while bringing the display up higher for your eyes. The stand supports laptops ranging from 12-17.3 inches.</p>











<hr>



<p><strong>Press Reset by Jason Schrier</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>From Jason Schreier himself:</p>



<p><strong>“The business of videogames is both a prestige industry and an opaque one. Based on dozens of first-hand interviews that cover the development of landmark games—Bioshock Infinite, Epic Mickey, Dead Space, and more—on to the shocking closures of the studios that made them,&nbsp;Press Reset&nbsp;tells the stories of how real people are affected by game studio shutdowns, and how they recover, move on, or escape the industry entirely.”</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>8Bitdo M30 Bluetooth Controller</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want a cheap way to play classic Sega Games, or any game for that matter? This M30 Bluetooth Controller is designed to mimic the classic six-button Sega Genesis controller. It works on your Nintendo Switch or Switch 2, Windows PCs, and even mobile devices.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>8BitDo Wireless USB Adapter 2</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want to guarantee you can hook up any Bluetooth controller to any device? This wireless USB adapter allows you connect your controllers to your Switch 2, Switch, PC, Steam Deck, and more. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>8Bitdo Bluetooth Retro Receiver&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If the person you’re buying for still likes to play on their PlayStation (PS1) or PlayStation 2 (PS2), why not give them the gift of wireless control. The 8Bitdo Bluetooth Retro Receiver allows you to use your Xbox, PS4, PS5, Wii U Pro and Switch Pro controllers wirelessly with the PS1 or PS2. Imagine just sitting on your couch that’s more than 10 feet from your TV?</p>











<hr>



<p><strong>UNO: The Legend of Zelda Card Game&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>UNO? Great game. The Legend of Zelda? Great franchise. So, why not combine them with a special version of UNO that features the artwork of The Legend of Zelda. There’s even a special Triforce Card that forces the next player to draw an addition three cards. Get it? Triforce? Three Cards? </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>JSAUX Docking Station</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Ally X, Steam Deck, Legion Go, and other handheld gaming PCs are all great devices, but sometimes you don’t want to play on the small screen. This docking station—which is actively in use by Senior Editor Mike Straw—allows you to not only hook your handheld to a larger display with HDMI 2.1, but also connect two USB-A devices, an ethernet cable, and a 100W USB-C charging port for your handheld to stay powered during use.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Banjo-Kazooie Mobile Phone &amp; Controller Holder</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>An 8.5″ figure made from PVC, this Banjo-Kazooie holder is the perfect place to set your phone, controller, or other small devices when not in use. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>The Oregon Trail Card Game</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you have a millennial you’re shopping for, why not give them the gift of dysentery and let them relive their youth. Supporting 2-6 players with 8-bit art, The Oregon Trail Card Game has you try to stay alive from Independence, Missouri to the Willamette Valley. </p>
