<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/destiny-2/" id="52052">Destiny 2</a>’s next major update has been officially delayed until June 9, 2026.</p>



<p>Destiny 2: Shadow and Order will not be released at the expected time. The game’s development team announced the delay on social media. They explained that the delay is due to “large revisions” and sizable quality-of-life updates.</p>



<p>It was noted that additional details would be disclosed closer to the release, including the previously announced weapons-tier upgrade and other updates. </p>



<p>It was also stated that routine fixes and stability improvements will continue throughout June. There will also be continued portal modifiers, Guardian Games in March, and the return of a more frequent Iron Bar Cadence in April.</p>



<p>The team has also clarified that they will continue to provide updates on live game content, community activations, and general news on their social media channels.</p>

<h2 id="h-destiny-2-shadow-and-order-delay-was-previously-rumored">Destiny 2: Shadow and Order Delay Was Previously Rumored</h2>



<p>In January, it was reported that the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-shadow-and-order-has-reportedly-been-delayed/" id="170645">expected to be delayed</a> to avoid interfering with the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99">Bungie’s </a>Marathon, the upcoming extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Speaking of Marathon, there will be crossovers between the two games. Pre-ordering Bungie’s new game rewards Destiny players with new cosmetics, Sparrows, and Ships. There are also new shaders, emotes, and more to celebrate the upcoming release.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to provide updates on the forthcoming DLC closer to release.</p>

<p>Todd Howard discusses <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-elder-scrolls-6/" id="2711">The Elder Scrolls 6.</a></p>



<p>During a recent interview with the <a href="https://youtu.be/sX4rKpB97L4">Kinda Funny Gamescast,</a> Todd Howard commented on the progression of the sixth Elder Scrolls game. He noted that the game will be powered by Creation Engine 3. Creation Engine 2 powered Starfield, and now, Howard says that CE3 will power Elder Scrolls 6 and beyond.</p>



<p>“That’s going to power Elder Scrolls VI and beyond… We have a game style that we really, really like, and I think people expect from us. There’s a lot of innovation to be done there still, so that when you step into a world, you feel like you’re experiencing it really for the first time, a game like that. I think we’re happy with where it’s headed right now. That’s what I could say.”</p>

<h2 id="h-todd-howard-says-it-s-not-his-preference-to-announce-games-too-early">Todd Howard Says It’s Not His Preference to Announce Games Too Early</h2>



<p>When asked about the 7 years since the announcement of The Elder Scrolls 6, Todd Howard said that if he had his way, he would never announce anything; one day, a game would just appear. However, he reiterated that they’re satisfied with the game’s current state and indicated they were about to pass a significant development milestone.</p>



<p>Regarding earlier pitches for the sixth Elder Scrolls game, Kurt Kuhlmann, a former <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda-2/" id="3469">Bethesda </a>employee, noted that he wanted to incorporate elements of Star Wars into the game’s lore. Ultimately, he did not write the script. Read those comments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-loremaster-says-tes6-could-have-taken-star-wars-inspired-turn/" id="170375">here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Todd Howard Admitted Which Fallout He’s ‘Most Proud Of’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-admitted-which-fallout-proud-of/</link>
            <guid>1439833</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Todd Howard has been around the block when it comes to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda/" id="419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda Game Studios’</a> titles. He has contributed greatly to the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout/" id="311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-elder-scrolls/" id="976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/starfield/" id="307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield</a>, so he’s qualified to speak at length about any of them.</p>



<p>During a recent interview, the head honcho himself took a deep dive into <strong>every game </strong>on that list, stopping briefly to explain which Fallout game he’s <strong>the most proud of</strong> from all the titles he’s worked on. That includes Fallout 3, Fallout 4, Fallout Shelter (kind of), and Fallout 76.</p>



<p>But which one of them is the gem for Todd Howard?</p>







<h2 id="h-you-might-not-expect-it">You Might Not Expect It</h2>



<p>Out of the slew of Fallout games released in the last two decades or so (discounting New Vegas, as Todd didn’t really work on that one), there’s <strong>one </strong>that stands out for the visionary developer.</p>



<p>In a recent super-sized interview on the Kinda Funny Gamescast, Todd Howard gushed over <strong>Fallout 76</strong>, declaring it the post-apocalyptic epic that he’s most proud of.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In many respects, it’s the game that we’ve done that I’m the most proud of. It’s so hard to do and then maintain as a relevent game, and I think if you look across the industry, the amount of games like it that there have been or come and gone, and here’s 76 still there with big numbers and doing well.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of energy in the studio.</p>



<p>Look, people love it. The team on it, led by Jon Rush, they just do a fantastic, fantastic job, and you see the roadmap that’s planned for the game, and it gets even better.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>Todd Howard also admitted that they designed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout-76/" id="438">Fallout 76</a> as a multiplayer title despite knowing that it wouldn’t be ‘for everyone’. That was always an expectation, given how Fallout was a single-player game for twenty years before Fallout 76 landed on the market.</p>



<p>He also stressed that more people need to recognize the work they’re putting into Fallout 76. It’s kind of a sticking point because everyone just keeps crying out for Fallout 5, which is <strong>many years away</strong> from even being revealed. But at the same time, Bethesda Game Studios has this phenomenal MMORPG that they’re keeping updated with reams of <strong>free content drops</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-myrise-details-revealed-by-developer/</link>
            <guid>1439830</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a> developer is providing new details on this year’s MyRise mode.</p>



<p>WWE 2K26 will be released in about 3 weeks, on March 13. One of the key game modes every year is MyRise. This is the professional wrestling take on NBA 2K’s MyCareer. Every year, players take their created wrestlers on a journey to the top of WWE, with each year bringing a new storyline to the squared circle.</p>







<h2>Details on WWE 2K26 MyRise Are Starting to Be Revealed</h2>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/wwe-2k26-myrise-lead-talks-this-years-campaign-and-why-fan-favorite-jordynne-grace-is-taking-on-the-role-of-a-villain-we-work-so-far-ahead-from-wwe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TechRadar Gaming</a>, WWE 2K26’s MyRise lead narrative designer, Sean Conaway, shared details of this year’s storyline, dubbed “The Comeback.” This year, the bones of the campaign mode remain the same regardless of whether you choose to play as a male or female WWE Superstar. In this year’s game, you play as a superstar returning to WWE after a long hiatus, something that has become more common on actual WWE television in recent years.</p>



<p>Your character, known as “The Archetype,” will run afoul of Paul Heyman. Paul Heyman’s main client in the campaign will either be Bron Breakker or Jordynne Grace, depending on the gender you choose for your character. Heyman and Breakker are currently paired on WWE television, but Conway says 2K had the idea to align them before WWE did, as game development takes considerable time.</p>



<p>“We work so far ahead from WWE that we kind of have to look in our crystal balls and try to forecast as best as we can who we think is going to be hot a year from now,” he said.</p>



<p>As for the decision to turn Grace into a villain, something she has yet to portray on WWE television, it was noted that the team at 2K sees a lot of potential in Grace, and that’s why they chose her for the role.</p>







<h2 id="h-don-t-expect-the-story-to-play-out-completely-the-same-depending-on-the-main-villain">Don’t Expect the Story to Play Out Completely the Same Depending on the Main Villain</h2>



<p>While the decision was made not to create two different stories and allow players to craft “The Archetype” as either a man or a woman, it is noted that the decision you make and the division you’re playing through will have substantial differences from its counterpart.</p>



<p>Also, with regard to some players feeling fatigued after being forced to play the WWE 2K25 MyRise multiple times in order to unlock the most content, Conway acknowledged that they were aware of the fatigue and noted it wouldn’t be like that this year.</p>



<p>Speaking of unlockables, learn how the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-dev-confident-fans-will-like-new-ringside-pass/" id="175166">Ringside Pass system</a> shakes up unlockables in WWE 2K26.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 The Final Chapter? Poppy Playtime Chapter 6, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-the-final-chapter-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-explained/</link>
            <guid>1439812</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is finally here, and the twisted story of murderous toys continues. However, before it arrived, plenty of fans were theorising that this could be the final Chapter in the series, with a natural conclusion seemingly drawing near. </p>







<p>Well, now that the game is in the hands of the masses, the answer is pretty clear, and it seems like the fanbase is pretty divided on the outcome. If you’re wondering whether <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a> will continue after Chapter 5, then you’re in the right place, as Insider Gaming has it all figured out.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-chapter-5-of-poppy-playtime-the-final-chapter">Is Chapter 5 Of Poppy Playtime The Final Chapter?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s not over yet. Image by Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is not the final chapter. Judging by the ending of Chapter 5, a sixth chapter is all but guaranteed.</strong></p>



<p>Without spoiling the ending, which raises even more questions, it’s clear that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mob-entertainment/" id="3160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mob Entertainment</a> aren’t quite ready to cut the cord and wrap up Poppy Playtime just yet.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-cost-price-explained/" id="177112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How Much Does Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 Cost? Price, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>For fans of the franchise, this is great news, as that means there is bound to be even more monstrous cuddly toys to evade and mysteries to uncover. But it also raises a new question: When will Chapter 6 be released? </p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-release">When Will Poppy Playtime Chapter 6 Release? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t let him catch you! Image by Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Although it may be obvious that Poppy Playtime Chapter 6 is a given, no official confirmation of its existence has been made by Mob Entertainment. Therefore, there’s no official release date to share. </strong></p>



<p>However, chapters for Poppy Playtime have released fairly regularly, with a new one dropping pretty much every year since the franchise began back in 2021. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-horror-games-ever/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/best-horror-games-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 Best Horror Games Ever, From Resident Evil to Outlast</a></li>
</ul>







<p>With that in mind, it’s highly likely that Chapter 6 will be released sometime in 2027, though that’s purely speculation. The franchise missed a year of content back in 2023, so it’s not a guarantee, but that would imply that it’d arrive by 2028 at the absolute latest.</p>
