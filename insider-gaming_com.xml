<p>The Indie Game Awards took place on Thursday, December 18, and saw 21 awards handed out to deserving games, developers, and people. </p>



<p>This year, I was lucky enough to be selected <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as one of the judges</a> and had the opportunity to vote on 12 awards. Those included the likes of Music, Gameplay, Narrative, Game of the Year, and more. </p>







<p>While the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-indie-game-awards-2025-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awards were given out</a> already, I thought it would be good to show the Insider Gaming audience how I voted this year. To be completely honest, it was a lot tougher than I expected.</p>



<p>Doing a ranked choice vote led to plenty of second guessing and dozens of pages of notes in my black and white marble notebook. There was even a time where I had my votes all ready to submit, only to start over by reviewing my notes again. Eventually, decisions were made and the ballots were sent in. </p>



<p>Not all of my selections won, but I was happy with how I voted and congratulate all of the winners. There really were so many incredible games this year that you could make a strong case for every game that was nominated, and even others that weren’t. But, without any more delay, here’s how I voted for The Indie Game Awards 2025.</p>

<p>All of the games under each category appear in the order that I voted. It was a ranked choice vote, meaning that I had to place the games in the order I felt they belonged. It wasn’t just a “pick one from this list”.</p>
