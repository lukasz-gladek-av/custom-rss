<p>For all of the completionists out there, Mafia: The Old Country provides you with plenty to work towards to complete the entire game. </p>



<p>Hangar 13 returned to the franchise’s roots for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a>. Instead of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open world</a> as seen in Mafia 3, the latest installment is a linear-narrative driven game. As such, the game has a similar expected run time to the first two games of the series, meaning you can expect around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-to-beat-mafia-the-old-country-game-length-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-12 hours of content</a>. </p>



<p>Some fans assumed that less content is what led to the game receiving a $50 pricetag, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-devs-say-game-isnt-short-just-because-its-only-50/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hangar 13</a> assured players that they won’t be “disappointed” by the final package. And although Mafia: The Old Country is shorter than other Triple AAA single-player offerings, there is still a long list of trophies and achievements to earn. </p>

<p>Before reading any further, please note that the achievement and trophy list contains spoilers. If you do not want to have any of the story spoiled beforehand, do not read any more. That being said, the normal achievements and trophies mostly just cover weapon mastery and completing a few simple tasks. The secret trophies contain most of the spoilers. </p>

<p><strong>There are 25 normal and 26 secret trophies and achievements in Mafia: The Old Country.</strong></p>



<p>Completing a playthrough on hard difficulty will earn most trophies and achievements, without having to go too much out of your way. However, there are a few trophies in particular that require skill and patience, such as killing Mazzone without alerting his men and infiltrating the villa without being seen. </p>

<p>Turn 10 and Playground Games will “continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5.”</p>



<p>In a post on social media on Thursday, the developers said that they “appreciate the support of [their] incredible community”. They also wanted to make it clear that support for Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5 wasn’t ending. </p>



<p>“We wanted to assure players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5,” <a href="https://x.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1953508994581938364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said</a>. </p>



<p>The team <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-motorsport-update-21-featured-tours#logitech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">then linked</a> to a post going over what’s coming in the future to Forza Motorsport. Those updates include near featured tours, new cars earned through challenges, and new featured rivals. The new update is scheduled to come on September 4.</p>

<p>While current support continuing is good news for players, what wasn’t mentioned in the statement, however, was anything regarding the future of the Forza Motorsport series. </p>



<p>After Microsoft’s latest layoffs at Xbox in July, one studio reportedly hit hard was Turn 10 games. According to reports, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/turn-10-studios-loses-nearly-half-of-its-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">up to 50% of the team</a> was let go and it was turned into a support studio for the Forza Horizon series with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-motorsport-canceled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the mainline series being canceled</a>. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has made numerous efforts to get clarification on the state of the Forza Motorsport franchise but neither Microsoft or Turn 10 have responded to requests for comment.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 is currently in development. Playground Games, the developers of the Forza Horizon series, are also working on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reboot of Fable</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Has Beaten Almost Every Call of Duty Game Ever Made on Twitch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beaten-almost-every-cod-game-twitch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-has-beaten-almost-every-call-of-duty-game-ever-made-on-twitch.1264884/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 beta commenced earlier today, and it has been skyrocketing all day in social and streaming circles. The game has become one of the most highly anticipated first-person shooters to emerge in several years, and it’s looking like a strong turning point for a series that has found itself on rocky ground for almost a decade.</p>



<p>As the beta unravels, scores of fans are taking to Twitch and YouTube to watch streams as they await the <strong>open portion </strong>of the beta to kick off. As I write this, almost 850,000 people are watching the beta on <strong>Twitch alone</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-huge-numbers">Huge Numbers</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 is being played by some of the most prolific streamers in the world right now, and they’re pulling in gargantuan numbers. At the time of publishing, the Battlefield 6 beta had 830,000 live viewers, which is something of a stunning record for the series.</p>



<p>Not only is it the most-watched Battlefield game ever released (not that it’s released yet), but it’s also effortlessly beating the peak viewership count for <strong>every major Call of Duty game ever</strong>, bar Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>Only the battle royale game stands between Battlefield 6 and total dominance.</p>



<p>For reference, here’s the ranking for peak viewer counts on Twitch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III – 444,866</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 – 481,586</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War – 705,050</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II – 751,937</li>



<li><strong>Battlefield 6 – 844,723</strong></li>



<li>Call of Duty: Warzone – 1,613,626</li>
</ul>



<p>As the weekend approaches, could we see Battlefield 6 threaten Warzone’s record?</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Battlefield 6’s highest peak has also topped Rainbow Six Siege (583,166), Overwatch (634,296), Escape from Tarkov (566,684), and PUBG (597,663).</p>



<p>This is one heck of a high-performing game, and we’re on the first day of the beta. The sky might just be the limit for Battlefield 6.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Owners Having Issues With Madden 26 Access]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-owners-having-issues-with-madden-26-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-owners-having-issues-with-madden-26-access.1264878/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Madden 26 is out now for Deluxe Edition owners, but Xbox users are having issues getting access to the game. </p>



<p>A quick search on social media—or a visit to my DMs—shows a number of players don’t have access to the game they purchased if they got it as part of the EA Sports MVP Bundle that included both Madden 26 and College Football 26. </p>



<p>The specific issue is that the game is showing as unowned. </p>



<p><strong>“For our Xbox MVP Bundle owners, we’re aware of an issue some are experiencing where they’re unable to access the game,” </strong>the <a href="https://x.com/MaddenNFLDirect/status/1953495214695338229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Madden team posted</a>. <strong>“We’re working closely with Microsoft and plan to resolve this as soon as possible.”</strong></p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>For our Xbox MVP Bundle owners, we’re aware of an issue some are experiencing where they’re unable to access the game.</p><p>We’re working closely with Microsoft and plan to resolve this as soon as possible.</p><p>Updates will be threaded below as needed!</p></div>— MaddenNFLDirect (@MaddenNFLDirect) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaddenNFLDirect/status/1953495214695338229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>One work around is that if you have EA Play, you can download the 10-hour trial. After that download completes, it <em>should </em>show that you own the full game and you’ll be all set. Another possible workaround is to do a hard reset of your console. Press and hold the power button down for at least 10 seconds. After it’s off, wait a few seconds before turning it back on.</p>

<p>If you don’t have EA Play or the workarounds don’t work, you’ll have to simply wait for an update from EA and Microsoft on the matter.</p>



<p>Madden 26 is also available for PlayStation 5, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2. Those who bought the Standard Edition of the game have to wait until August 14 to play.</p>



<p>Have you had any issues accessing Madden 26 on Xbox or other consoles? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>
