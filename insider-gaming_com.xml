<p>Season 1 of Battlefield 6 is the start of regular free post-launch updates for the latest game in the Battlefield franchise. The season will be split into three parts: Rogue Ops, California Resistance, and Winter Offensive. </p>



<p>Rogue Ops, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on October 28</a>, includes the Blackwell Fields map as well as the new Strikepoint game mode, Traverser Mark 2 vehicle, three new weapons, and more. </p>



<p>After Rogue Ops comes California Resistance on November 18. Part two of the season also brings a new map in Eastwood, along with the Sabotage mode. Lastly, Winter Offensive won’t give players a new permanent map, but it will introduce the Ice Lock Empire State limited-time event map. </p>



<p>There’s also the planned release of the free-to-play Battle Royale mode. While rumors continue to suggest that the mode will launch alongside the start of Season 1, EA has yet to confirm that to be the case.</p>
