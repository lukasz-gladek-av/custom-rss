<p>Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, has gone on record stating that Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty launch <strong>ever</strong>. This news came amid Microsoft’s first-quarter earnings call, held just days after Black Ops 6 hit the market.</p>



<p>This was the first Call of Duty game to be released on Game Pass on day one, which was a huge win for Xbox. It was mentioned by Nadella that the launch of Black Ops 6 set a record for the number of new Game Pass subscriber adds.</p>

<p>Speaking during the Microsoft call, Satya Nadella said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Last week’s launch of Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty release ever, setting a record for day one players as well as Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day. </p>



<p>And unit sales on&nbsp;PlayStation&nbsp;and Steam were also up over 60% year-over-year. This speaks to our strategy of meeting gamers where they are by enabling them to play more games across the screens they spend their time on.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since dropping worldwide, Black Ops 6 has gone from strength to strength. We reviewed it at launch and awarded it a lofty score, recommending that Call of Duty fans everywhere invest in this wondrous game. From the campaign to the Zombies, and from the multiplayer to everything that’s coming next, it’s well worth the time and effort you’ll pour into it.</p>



<p>On November 14, the game’s first season will go live, introducing the first content drop, amongst other things. Also, on November 1, Nuketown returns to Call of Duty, with Treyarch having assembled a remaster of the original map that appeared in 2010’s Black Ops.</p>

<p>Ubisoft’s major financial update for FY24-25 is here, and it has made clear a few tantalising details about the company. One of the most interesting tidbits was the lifetime earnings of Ubisoft’s brands and live service titles. It was revealed that as a standalone game, Rainbow Six Siege has almost made more money than every other Ubisoft franchise.</p>



<p>That’s a <strong>lot </strong>of dollars.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impressive-performance">Impressive Performance</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege was released in 2016 as Ubisoft’s flagship competitive shooter. It has since become one of the most beloved FPS games on the market, giving way to a thriving esports ecosystem, amongst other things. It is one of the best definitions of the live-service operating model in the gaming world – and it’s still expanding.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5kn4pUVx6Vtb1Hir4vpqvq/fe35b53a1514635b0257418d1409d9e1/Ubisoft_FY25_H1_Earnings_PR_vFinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the recent financial report</a> published by Ubisoft, it was revealed that since 2016, Rainbow Six Siege has made a whopping €3.5 billion ($3.8 billion). It sits just behind <strong>the entire Assassin’s Creed series </strong>at €4 billion ($4.3 billion) and has beat the Far Cry series, which has made just €2 billion ($2.1 billion).</p>



<p>Elsewhere, several franchises have just topped €1 billion in consumer spending:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Division</li>



<li>Ghost Recon</li>



<li>Just Dance</li>
</ul>



<p>That means that if Rainbow Six Siege were to somehow secure €500 million in sales <strong>right now</strong>, it would single-handedly beat the consumer spending for every other Ubisoft franchise ever created, regardless of how long they’ve been on the market or how many games they’ve seen added to their lineup.</p>



<p>Ubisoft further confirmed that Rainbow Six Siege boasts a whopping 30 million unique active users, many of which will be contributing to the ongoing financial stability of the game.</p>
