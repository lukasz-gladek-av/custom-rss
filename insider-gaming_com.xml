            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-devs-beg-fans-give-us-one-more-chance/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-devs-beg-fans-%E2%80%98give-us-one-more-chance-at-our-relaunch%E2%80%99.1277904/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a social media post, the Splitgate 2 development team at 1047 Games promoted the #StopKillingGames campaign. It was seen as somewhat ironic by some gamers, and they took to the comment section under the post to jibe or berate 1047 following the disastrous, self-imploding launch of Splitgate 2 in June.</p>



<p>After Splitgate 2 failed to make a mark in June, hampered by controversial comments and decisions made by 1047 Games‚Äô leadership team, the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developers-say-its-going-back-to-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulled back to beta</a>. The fans left waiting are now holding out for <strong>another launch</strong>, but we don‚Äôt know when that‚Äôll be.</p>



<h2 id="h-splitgate-2-didn-t-make-fps-great-again">Splitgate 2 Didn‚Äôt Make FPS Great Again</h2>



<p>The downfall of Splitgate 2 began when 1047 Games CEO Ian Proulx took to the stage at Summer Game Fest to make some controversial statements about his title. He was wearing a hat emblazoned with the message <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-ceo-apologizes-for-sgf-controversy/">‚ÄòMake FPS Great Again‚Äô</a>, which was enough to trigger many gamers worldwide.</p>



<p>Following that, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-battle-royale-drops-fans-concerned-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some microtransaction prices</a> and design choices further impacted the Splitgate 2 launch, and once the creators moved away from the game, the player count crumbled.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the 1047 Games team was caught begging fans to still have faith:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">give us one more chance at our relaunch üôè</p>‚Äî Splitgate 2 ‚Äì Beta (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/1958637786728157577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The ‚Äòone more chance‚Äô comment was followed up with a similar sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Totally understand we‚Äôve disappointed. Hope we‚Äôll be able to earn your trust back!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And in another:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôve definitely made some mistakes along the way, but supporting our community is always our top priority.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It‚Äôs unlikely that Splitgate 2 will be able to make much of a splash when it does eventually re-emerge. The damage has been done, and despite the game boasting some innovative mechanics, players won‚Äôt forget what happened this year with the game‚Äôs original launch.</p>



<p>Are you waiting for Splitgate 2 to come out (again)? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following a string of controversies and concerns about child safety, Roblox has become the target of several campaigns demanding action, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-petition-ceo-resignation-removal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the resignation</a> of the CEO of the Roblox Corporation. Many believe that Roblox is shutting down in 2025, collapsing under the weight of all these scandals, but is it true, and will a Roblox ban surface this year?</p>



<p>It‚Äôs time to clear this up once and for all. Is Roblox getting shut down, and if not, why do so many people think it is?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-roblox-getting-shut-down-on-september-1st">Is Roblox Getting Shut Down on September 1st?</h2>



<p>Across social media and content platforms, a ‚Äòhoax campaign‚Äô was kicked off, claiming that Roblox will be banned from September 1st. This somewhat ludicrous claim came amidst an ongoing debate regarding the safety of children on the platform.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs no big secret that there‚Äôs an inherent problem at the heart of Roblox. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-child-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is being sued</a> by the state of Louisiana, Chris ‚ÄòTo Catch a Predator‚Äô Hansen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chris-hansen-roblox-plans-documentary-predator-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is making a documentary</a> about it, and content creators are trapping malicious users on the platform.</p>



<p>But is this enough to warrant Roblox shutting down?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-roblox-shutting-down">When is Roblox Shutting Down?</h2>



<p><strong>Roblox is not shutting down on September 1st, or any other date. </strong>The game is not going to be taken offline because of the ongoing controversies, as it still functions as a popular platform for tens of millions of gamers worldwide.</p>



<p>Roblox indeed has an insane and very public issue right now, but it‚Äôs not enough to bring the game to a complete shutdown.</p>



<p>If you‚Äôre one of the many users wondering if Roblox is being banned, fear not ‚Äì the game is safe for now.</p>



<p>Let me know on the Insider Gaming forum if you have any concerns about the security of Roblox right now.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-retiring-destiny/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-stepping-down-replacement-named.1277805/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Longtime CEO of Bungie, Pete Parsons, is stepping down from his position as of today. The news came right in the midst of Gamescom, but a replacement has been named, fortunately. </p>



<p>Parsons, who joined the studio in 2003, has worked on several of the studio‚Äôs major titles, like Halo 2 and Destiny. Becoming CEO of the company in 2016, he helped launch Destiny 2 and worked with PlayStation on the studio‚Äôs controversial acquisition in 2022. For many, he has been the face of the company for quite a while, so the news is quite shocking.</p>



<h2 id="h-justin-truman-now-ceo-of-bungie-replacing-pete-parsons">Justin Truman Now CEO of Bungie, Replacing Pete Parsons</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are proud to announce that Justin Truman will be stepping up as Bungie‚Äôs new Studio Head as Pete Parsons retires from his position to pass the torch to a new generation of leaders.<a href="https://t.co/VSBMccZiXZ">https://t.co/VSBMccZiXZ</a></p>‚Äî Bungie (@Bungie) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1958622787813122374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on Bungie‚Äôs official website, memos from both Parsons and new CEO Justin Truman were posted. Parsons spoke on his leave, saying,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúAfter more than two decades of helping build this incredible studio, establishing the Bungie Foundation, and growing inspiring communities around our work, I have decided to pass the torch,‚Äù Parsons said. ‚ÄúThis journey has been the honor of a lifetime. I am deeply proud of the worlds we‚Äôve built together and the millions of players who call them home ‚Äì and most of all I am privileged by the opportunity to work alongside the incredible minds at Bungie.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>



<p>New Bungie CEO, Justin Truman, also spoke on the matter in the post previously mentioned, stating,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI am committed to supporting and working alongside every member of the team here as we continue pouring our hearts and souls into these worlds,‚Äù says Truman. Worlds that we love, and that we hope have been worth your time and your passion. Because ultimately those worlds only exist, and thrive, with you in them.&nbsp;We are hard at work right now doing that ‚Äì both with Marathon and Destiny. We‚Äôre currently heads down, but we‚Äôll have more to show you in both of these worlds later this year.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Truman, who joined Bungie in 2010 to work on Halo Reach as an engineer, has spearheaded much of Destiny 2‚Äôs community efforts. In the game, he worked as the Gameplay Experience Director. It seems like the Bungie CEO change isn‚Äôt going to delay Marathon or Destiny, as far as we know. While Destiny 2 is still going strong with new expansions, Marathon has had some tough times getting out of the gate. Still, the multiplayer FPS plans to release before the fiscal year ends, though exact details are not clear.</p>



<p>Are you surprised by Parsons‚Äô decision to leave Bungie? Do you think Truman is the best choice for CEO? Let us know in the comments and on the forums</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-release-date-announced.1277703/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After eight years, Escape From Tarkov is finally leaving beta as the release date for Version 1.0 has been announced.</p>



<p>In a trailer posted online, Battlestate Games revealed that Escape From Tarkov 1.0 will launch on <strong>November 15, 2025</strong>. The release comes over eight years after it first entered beta and 13 years after initial development began. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Prepare for Escape" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpeLk_OJ9-M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-escape-from-tarkov-1-0">What to Expect From Escape From Tarkov 1.0</h2>



<p>While no details of what will be in 1.0 were given with the announcement, past reveals should give players an idea of what to expect. First thing‚Äôs first, Escape From Tarkov 1.0 is expected to include a dedicated storyline that will see you actually attempt to, as the name suggests, escape from Tarkov.
