<p>Two more castings have been made in the upcoming God of War series on Prime Video. One is a star of Severance. The other is a legendary actor.</p>



<p>As the Prime Video <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war/" id="106">God of War</a> series continues to take shape, two additional casting decisions have been announced. <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/mandy-patinkin-cast-odin-god-of-war-tv-series-1236702507/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline </a>reports that the legendary Mandy Patinkin, known for playing Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride, will be in the upcoming series playing Odin. Odin is known as the “All-Father.” The Ruler of the Norse Pantheon is also the father of Thor and Heimdall. It was previously confirmed that Max Parker will play Heimdall. However, we now know who will play Thor.</p>



<h2>Thor Will Be Portrayed by a Severance Star in the Forthcoming God of War Series</h2>



<p>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson, known for his role as the stern and violent, when necessary, Mr. Drummond on the Apple TV series Severance, will portray the God of Thunder, according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/olafur-darri-olafsson-cast-thor-god-of-war-1236702443/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>. Furthermore, the series will portray Thor as a former soldier of Asgard and Odin’s former right-hand man. He is dealing with some confidence issues and is struggling with alcohol as a means of coping.</p>



<p>Ironically, Ryan Hurst, the series’ Kratos, previously voiced Thor in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok/" id="107">God of War: Ragnarök</a> video game. It has also been confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-live-action-series-has-reportedly-secured-another-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Teresa Palmer will play Thor’s wife, Sif,</a> in the series.</p>







<h2 id="h-prime-video-s-god-of-war-is-already-renewed-for-season-2">Prime Video’s God of War is Already Renewed for Season 2</h2>



<p>Without even having filmed a single episode, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-god-of-war-director-second-season-greenlit-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon renewed the series for a second season</a>. Production is expected to begin in February 2026. The first two episodes are to be directed by Frederick E. O. Toye, who previously directed the video game–to–TV adaptation Fallout.</p>



<p>As of now, there’s no word on when the series will premiere. Insider Gaming will continue to monitor the story and report any and all updates.</p>

<p>Get ready to kid the kids to the vacant lot. A new Backyard Baseball game is coming this year.</p>



<p>Playground Productions has officially announced a new Backyard Baseball game will launch in Summer 2026. It’s the first new game in the Backyard Sports series since Backyard Sports Baseball 2015 for iOS and Android. With a likely release for console, it would be the first for major platforms since Backyard Sports: Rookie Rush in 2010.</p>







<p>Details on the game itself weren’t revealed, but Playground Productions says that information will come in the near future.</p>



<p>To hold over until more news comes, Playground has released Backyard Sports: The Animated Special on YouTube. The nearly 12-minute show features an all-star cast of Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Ego Nwodim, Donald Faison, Adam Pally, and more. </p>



<p><strong>“In a high-energy new animated special from Playground Productions, the beloved 90’s video game franchise “Backyard Sports” returns as superstar Stephanie “Bubbles” Morgan is in crisis after losing her gotta-have-it, never-play-without-it lucky bubble gum,”</strong> the show’s description reads. <strong>“With just 30 minutes until game time, the Backyard kids embark on a wild, time-sensitive mission to track it down and save their season.”&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/paradox-interactive/" id="199">Paradox Interactive’s</a> fourth quarter showed a sharp swing in profits. Revenue increased 23% from last year to roughly $99 million (MSEK 874.8), supported by sales from Age of Wonders 4, Cities: Skylines II, Crusader Kings III, and new releases Europa Universalis V and Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2.</p>



<p>Even with higher revenue, however, the company <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/latest-events" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported an operating loss</a> of about $28 million (MSEK 245.4 , which is a 162% drop compared to last year. The main reason is Bloodlines 2, which did not meet sales expectations. </p>







<p>Paradox recorded write-downs and amortization of more than $77 million related to the game. That pushed the quarter from profitable to a significant loss.</p>



<p>Profit after tax fell to approximately $22 million, down from around $34 million last year. Earnings per share also turned negative, reflecting the impact of the Bloodlines 2 accounting adjustments.</p>



<p>Despite the hefty loss, Paradox remains financially stable. Cash flow from operations was about $56 million and the company ended the quarter with roughly $151 million in cash. That gives it room to invest in future projects and manage ongoing operations.</p>



<p><strong>“We are now strengthening our strategic focus, reallocating resources, and creating even better conditions for future investments where we have our greatest expertise and long-term potential,”</strong> CEO&nbsp;Fred Wester&nbsp;said.</p>







<p>For the full year, sales were largely unchanged at about $241 million, while operating profit dropped 80% to $16 million. Earnings per share fell from SEK 5.54 ($0.63) to just SEK 1.19 ($0.13).</p>



<p>The company also launched <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-europa-universalis-5-console-commands-cheats-how-to-enable-console-commands-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Europa Universalis V</a>, which the CEO described as an important step for the franchise. Paradox continued to release DLC and remasters for other titles throughout the quarter. The board proposed an ordinary dividend of 5 dollars per share, showing confidence in the underlying business despite the large quarterly loss.</p>

<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>
