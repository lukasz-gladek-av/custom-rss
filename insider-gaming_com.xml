<p>It has been claimed by reputable insiders on social media that in December, Fortnite OG will return <strong>permanently</strong>. It’s expected that this will be announced during the upcoming Final event or The Game Awards in the first week of December. It gets better, though – it has also been suggested that every Chapter One season will return on a month-by-month rotation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-back-to-og">Going Back to OG</h2>



<p>Fortnite returned to OG a year ago and it was the most popular move Epic Games has ever made. In an instant, tens of millions of players poured into the game across all platforms, and records were broken worldwide. It was such a success that other developers have since leant on the idea of bringing back an original map as fan service.</p>



<p>Most recently, it was revealed that Apex Legends will be taking players back to their original map.</p>



<p>On social media, HYPEX and ShiinaBR, two reputable Fortnite leakers, corroborated claims that Fortnite OG is returning in December, but this time, it’ll be here to stay.</p>



<p>Per the claims:</p>



<ul>
<li>All Chapter One seasons (1 – 10) will return, with each one lasting a month</li>



<li>Only OG loot will be available and the map will support both Build and Zero Build</li>
</ul>



<p>This could be huge – but will it have the draw that OG Fortnite had last year when it was reintroduced for the first time? It’s possible. </p>



<p>Recently, it was revealed that Epic is partnering with footwear brands like Jordans to produce new, in-game cosmetics called Kicks. Also, several hip-hop artists including Eminem and Snoop Dogg were added to the game as playable skins and boss characters.</p>

<p>Activision has revealed that as the game passes its fifth anniversary, Call of Duty Mobile has surpassed <strong>one billion downloads</strong>, since 2019. This staggering figure makes Call of Duty Mobile the best-selling COD game ever, and it’s almost guaranteed that it’ll never be topped as long as we all live.</p>



<p>On November 6, the game’s tenth season went live, and hundreds of millions of players set about exploring another battle pass, new weapons, maps, modes, and more.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-best-selling-call-of-duty-game-ever-made">The Best-Selling Call of Duty Game Ever Made</h2>



<p>COD Mobile is the most accessible and universally appreciated Call of Duty game ever. It has a huge esports market and competitive ecosystem, and in some areas of the world, it’s the number-one Call of Duty game, even with the traditional premium releases coming around once a year.</p>



<p>In 2019, COD Mobile was released, and today, the developers are still adding more maps, modes, and operators, allowing players to earn COD points and unlock more to flesh out their free profile. While we’re on the topic, you can check out our guide to unlock <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-free-cod-mobile-points/">free COD Points</a> in COD Mobile.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-mobile-season-10-fifth-anniversary-celebration-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent blog post</a>, the Activision team made a small announcement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Happy 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>&nbsp;players! Thanks to you,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>&nbsp;has now reached over *ONE BILLION downloads worldwide since its launch in 2019*.</p>



<p>Join the celebration when Season 10 — 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary launches November 6 at 5 PM PT.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s short and sweet, but it’s super impactful. Few mobile games are as universally beloved as COD Mobile, which is represented quite nicely in that one billion download milestone.</p>
