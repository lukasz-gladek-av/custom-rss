<p>Just a week after its release, Mafia: The Old Country is adding a fan-favorite mode to the game for players to try out that many are sure to enjoy.</p>



<p>The game, which received decent reviews from critics and fans, took the story back to its roots in 1900s Sicily. From the start, the game made a point to change many controversial aspects from Mafia 3. The biggest was to return the series to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-devs-removed-open-world-because-of-mafia-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a more linear format</a>, akin to Mafia 1 and 2. Yet, with the returning mode, announced on the game’s official website, that may not be the case.</p>



<h2 id="h-free-ride-mode-is-coming-to-mafia-the-old-country">Free Ride Mode is Coming to Mafia: The Old Country</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://mafia.2k.com/the-old-country/news/free-ride-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thank you message</a> from the team, Hangar 13 and 2K Games hyped up the future of the gangster series’ fourth entry. To celebrate, the team announced the return of Free Ride mode, which made its debut in Mafia: Definitive Edition. The mode allowed players to ride and drive around the open world and take on a variety of optional missions. Mostly, it serves as a great way to take in the beautiful sceneries, especially now with the Italian countryside. While the game is linear, Free Ride isn’t technically open world like Mafia 3, but it’s a rather interesting addition.</p>



<p>The mode will be available for free at a later date, along with new content for players to enjoy. While details were sparse on the timing and specifics, it does bode well for returning fans. Toward the end, we got some fun statistics on player behavior to look at. For example, 600 million bullets were fired, though only 185 million enemies were hit by them. Regardless of the decent reception, it seems Hangar 13 and 2K Games are planning to stick with the Torrisi family for a while longer.</p>



<p>Are you excited to try out Free Ride mode in Mafia: The Old Country? Let us know what you think down below or in the Insider Gaming forums.</p>
