<p>I don’t play bingo, so I didn’t have a bingo card available specifically for this situation (sorry!), but it appears Sony wants you to play more video games within its ecosystem, so the company’s pushing a new update for the PlayStation Portal today. The update includes cloud streaming, which is still in beta, with support for 120 PlayStation 5 titles available via the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog. Of course, you must subscribe to PS+ Premium to enjoy a cloud streaming performance of 1080p resolutions in 60 frames per second. Fancy!</p>



<p>That said, according to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, several features are available during the beta, some that aren’t available, and a number of locations where you can check out the cloud streaming beta. We’ll start there:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-beta-features">Beta Features</h2>



<p>As for new features available as part of the PlayStation Portal cloud streaming beta, you can enjoy:</p>



<ul>
<li>Stream select PS5 games in the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog
<ul>
<li>Over 120 PS5 games from the PS Plus Game Catalog, including Dave the Diver, Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Monster Hunter Rise, and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, will be accessible on PS Portal via cloud streaming*</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Streaming up to 1080p/60fps**</li>



<li>DualSense wireless controller features, including haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, speakers, touchpad (emulated on the touch screen for PS Portal), and motion sensor***</li>



<li>PlayStation Plus Cloud storage
<ul>
<li>Save data and game progress can be stored up to 100GB and will be automatically synced with your PS5 console, making it easy to switch seamlessly between local and streaming gameplay, and between multiple devices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-how-to-join-the-cloud-streaming-beta">How to Join the Cloud Streaming Beta</h2>



<p>If you want to participate in the beta, you require an active PlayStation Network account, an active PS+ Premium subscription, access to high-speed broadband internet, and the PlayStation Portal. Once you have everything, you can access the new update and activate cloud streaming by:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open “Quick Menu” and access “Settings” on your PS Portal.</li>



<li>Select the “Cloud Streaming (Beta)” button</li>



<li>Switch the Cloud Streaming (Beta) toggle on (this will be off by default).</li>
</ol>



<p>Unfortunately, per the blog post, some features will not be readily available for this beta. This includes Game Trials, system features like party voice chat, the create button, 3D audio, and in-game microtransactions.</p>

<p>Like many, I gave Warhammer 40,000: Darktide a fair shake. I spent nearly 100 hours leveling multiple classes, completing every mission, and checking out the most recent updates. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game recently, and it appears the experience will improve vastly in December. The launch of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide Grim Protols offers a new game mode, missions, weapons, and limited-time events across all systems.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-features-in-warhammer-40-000-darktide-the-grim-protocols">New Features in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide The Grim Protocols</h2>



<p>As mentioned, the brand-new update for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide features a new game mode, mission, weapon families, limited-time events, quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and more. There’s even a fantastic narrative trailer to help get you in the mood for its launch!</p>

</p></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>New Game Mode – Havoc:</strong>&nbsp;Think you’ve mastered the threat over Tertium? Think again. Havoc is a new end-game experience that will test the resolve of the most seasoned operative. Be ready to face daunting challenges and earn new cosmetic rewards.</li>



<li><strong>New Mission – Dark Communion:</strong>&nbsp;Return to the Carnival and explore its darkest corners. Steel yourself as you face hordes of cultists who will stop at nothing to achieve their dark communion.</li>



<li><strong>Three New Weapon Families:&nbsp;</strong>tear through waves of enemies by wielding the destructive might of the Two-Handed Force and Power Swords, and the Ogryn Heavy Stubber.</li>



<li><strong>Anniversary Special Event:</strong>&nbsp;to celebrate the second anniversary of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, the game will host an event that will reward players with a unique weapon trinket.</li>



<li><strong>And more:</strong>&nbsp;including the expansion of the Penance progression track with new challenges and rewards, as well as quality of life improvements such as an extension of the Party Finder feature.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-when-does-the-next-darktide-update-come-out">When Does the Next Darktide Update Come Out?</h2>



<p>Darktide Grim Protocols launches alongside the PlayStation 5 release on December 3. The first-person horde shooter is now available on PC and Xbox Series X|S, and it’s an enjoyable time if you don’t mind paying $40 for admission. It does go on sale frequently, though, especially with the upcoming holiday sales Steam intends to run for Fall and Winter, so keep an eye out for a deal!</p>
