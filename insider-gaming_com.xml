<p>According to a new claim, Starfield’s Switch 2 port appears to be delayed and might never see the light of day. </p>



<p>A Starfield PlayStation 5 and Switch 2 port has been rumoured for a long time, but we have yet to hear any official details about it. This week, we have already heard a claim about Bethesda <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-playstatiion-5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planning an April 2026 release</a> for Starfield on PlayStation 5. We have now received claims about the Switch 2 Port as well. </p>







<h2 id="h-starfield-switch-2-port-reportedly-pushed-out">Starfield Switch 2 Port Reportedly ‘Pushed Out’ </h2>



<p>The claim that Starfield’s Switch 2 has a chance of never releasing comes from Shinobi602’s recent comments on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ppe-pl-starfield-is-coming-to-ps5-on-april-7th.1426351/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>. When asked whether the Switch 2 port will release at the same time as the PS5, Shinobi602 stated, “That’s been pushed out. And might not even come out at all.” When asked whether the delay was to target holiday sales, the insider replied, “They’re having problems with it, nothing to do with holidays or anything.” </p>



<p>The Starfield Switch 2 and PS5 ports are expected to release with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2-0-could-be-real-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.0 update</a> for the title, which will bring significant changes to some mechanics, help reduce load times, and be optimised for lower-power devices like handhelds. However, if the Switch 2 version is experiencing issues, the latter half of the 2.0 update might take longer than expected. Readers should take all the information with a grain of salt. </p>







<p>In other news, Starfield co-lead designer recently reflected on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-co-lead-designer-reflects-on-games-shortcomings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s shortcomings</a>.&nbsp;Additionally, the words ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terran Armada</a>‘ were teased in an anniversary post.

<p>The Pokémon commercial that was supposed to play at Super Bowl LX on Sunday has already leaked online, featuring a star-studded cast. </p>



<p>Pokémon is one of the franchises that gets leaked on all fronts. <span>We have seen the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-pokemon-company-coo-calls-for-pokemon-leaks-to-be-removed/" target="_blank">mainline games leaking</a></span>&nbsp;ahead of announcement, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-a4a-set-secluded-springs-leaks-ahead-of-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TCG Pocket cards</a>, packs, and so much more. Now, something really unexpected has happened: even their Super Bowl commercial leaked a few days earlier than planned. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-super-bowl-commercial-features-lady-gaga-charles-leclerc-and-young-miko">Pokémon Super Bowl Commercial Features Lady Gaga, Charles Leclerc, and Young Miko</h2>



<p>Only a small clip of the Pokémon Super Bowl Commercial, posted by CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/2019650640088297854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), has surfaced online, but it provides plenty of new information. The video features American singer, songwriter, and actress Lady Gaga, Puerto Rican rapper, singer, and songwriter Young Miko, and Formula 1 driver Charles Leclerc. All 3 personalities seem to be talking about their favourite Pokémon and what they like about it, but it could be something else. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Young Miko is first shown with a Gengar, with the words “He’s mischievous, that’s sort of his love language”. Then we see Charles Leclerc with a Growlithe, uttering the phrase “his loyalty, his speed.” We also see Lady Gaga with a Jigglypuff, but as this is just a clip, her statement wasn’t revealed. When asked whether the commercial was about a “specific game”, CentroLeaks responded, “It doesn’t promote a specific game…”</p>



<p>In other news, A Pokémon mod was recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-is-getting-a-pokemon-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed for Red Dead Redemption 2</a>.

<p>A reliable insider has stated that Rockstar Games still plans to release the Red Dead Redemption 2 Enhanced Edition in 2026. </p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2’s enhanced edition is one of the most sought-after remasters, and we have been hearing rumours about it for a long time. A current-gen version of the original Red Dead Redemption was released recently, which made fans worry that RDR2 would never receive the same treatment. An insider confirmed it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-enhanced-version-is-still-coming-insider-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was still in the works</a>, and they have now provided a bit more information. </p>







<h2 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2-current-gen-update-could-release-in-2026">Red Dead Redemption 2 Current-Gen Update Could Release in 2026</h2>



<p>Insider NatetheHate was recently asked on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2019452498805752008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) whether they knew about Red Dead Redemption 2 Enhanced Edition’s release plans and whether it had been pushed to 2027. Nate replied that, as far as he knows, the release plans are for “this year”. </p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One back in 2018. It has been close to 8 years since the game was released, and we have yet to receive a current-gen update. Fans have been yearning for a 4K 60 FPS update for a game that already looks so good, but Rockstar hasn’t provided any form of official confirmation on whether a current-gen update is in the works. </p>



<p>The original Red Dead Redemption recently received that treatment, getting a 4K 60FPS update for current-gen consoles. What’s more, the update brought iOS and Android versions of the game. What’s more, the title is free to claim through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> and includes the Undead Nightmare expansion. </p>







<p>In other news, an interesting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-is-getting-a-pokemon-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon mod</a> was revealed for Red Dead Redemption 2 recently. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jeffrey-dean-morgan-arthur-morgan-red-dead-redemption-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeffery Dean Morgan wishes to play Arthur Morgan</a> in a RDR show.

            <guid>1427911</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s almost time for another progression wipe in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, as the next Expedition Project deadline is fast-approaching. This mechanic allows you to reset your account, go back to square one, whilst earning some exclusive rewards, bonuses, and temporary buffs.</p>



<p>Of course, you don’t have to reset, but Embark Studios has updated the rewards and requirements, and it seems much more worthwhile when compared to the first one. It’s a big decision to make, so you’ll want to be well-informed.</p>







<p>Luckily for you, Insider Gaming has all the information you’ll need for ARC Raiders’ Expedition <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project</a>, including the requirements, rewards, and when you’ll need to complete it.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-arc-raiders-second-expedition">When Is ARC Raiders’ Second Expedition?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to get packing. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Expedition window opens on February 25, and departures take place on March 1, meaning you’ve got until the end of February to complete the Expedition Project.</strong></p>



<p>It might seem like you still have a good amount of time to complete the Project, but be warned, you’ll need a lot of different resources if you want to finish it. It’s best to start sooner rather than later, as you might wind up missing the wipe and regretting it.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-requirements-for-the-second-expedition">What Are The Requirements For The Second Expedition?</h2>



<p><strong>There are six stages to the Expedition Project in ARC Raiders, with each one having four requirements each.</strong></p>



<p>The items vary from materials to ARC parts, but the toughest stage is bound to be the fifth one, which requires you to sell 800,000 Coins’ worth of supplies! The Expedition won’t come cheap, but if you want to complete it, here are all of the Project’s stages:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Expedition Project Stage</th><th data-align="center">Expedition Project Requirements</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 1: Foundation</td><td data-align="center">– 150 Metal Parts<br>– 200 Plastic Parts<br>– 80 ARC Alloy<br>– 15 Steel Springs</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 2: Core Systems</td><td data-align="center">– 35 Durable Cloth<br>– 25 Wires<br>– 20 Electrical Components<br>– 4 Cooling Coils</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 3: Framework</td><td data-align="center">– 4 Light Bulbs<br>– 30 Batteries<br>– 10 Shredder Gyros<br>– 1 Exodus Modules</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 4: Outfitting</td><td data-align="center">– 5 Frequency Modulation Boxes<br>– 5 Advanced Electrical Components<br>– 3 Ion Sputters<br>– 3 Leaper Pulse Units</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 5: Load Stage</td><td data-align="center">– 250,000 Coins worth of Combat Items<br>– 100,000 Coins worth of Survival Items<br>– 150,000 Coins worth of Provisions<br>– 300,000 Coins worth of Materials</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 6: Departure</td><td data-align="center">No donations needed, you’re ready for the Expedition</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-rewards-for-the-second-expedition">What Are The Rewards For The Second Expedition?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Is it worth it? Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You don’t get direct rewards from the Expedition Project like you would from other Projects, as you’ll instead be rewarded with permanent and consecutive bonuses for your character.</strong></p>



<p>However, your rewards will vary depending on whether you completed the first expedition or not, as well as how many Coins you have when you depart, which can all seem a bit confusing. Luckily for you, Insider Gaming has broken it down in the table below, splitting the rewards into two tiers:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Rewards If It’s Your First Expedition</th><th data-align="center">Rewards If It’s Your Second Expedition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">The Patchwork Outfit (Permanent)</td><td data-align="center">The Patchwork Outfit—Evolved (Permanent)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Scrappy Cosmetics (Permanent)</td><td data-align="center">Scrappy Cosmetics (Permanent)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">The Expedition Indicator Icon (Permanent)</td><td data-align="center">The Expedition Indicator Icon (Permanent)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">+ 12 Stash Spaces (Permanent)</td><td data-align="center">+ 24 Stash Spaces (Permanent)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">+ 0-5 Skill Points (Permanent, dependent on player wealth)</td><td data-align="center">+ 0-5 Skill Points (Permanent, dependent on player wealth)<br>+ Catch up on missed Skill Points (Permanent, dependent on player wealth)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">+ 5% XP Boost (Consecutive Buff)</td><td data-align="center">+ 10% XP Boost (Consecutive Buff)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">+ 6% Scrappy Materials Boost (Consecutive Buff)</td><td data-align="center">+ 12% Scrappy Materials Boost (Consecutive Buff)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">+ 60% Repair Value Increase (Consecutive Buff)</td><td data-align="center">+ 70% Repair Value Increase (Consecutive Buff)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The key thing to note regarding the Expedition rewards is the extra Skill Points, as they’re dependent on your Coin total when you depart on the Expedition. Each extra Skill Point is worth <strong>600,000 Coins</strong>, meaning you’ll need to have <strong>3,000,000 Coins</strong> to your name if you want all five Skill Points on offer. </p>







<p>If it’s your second Expedition, and you didn’t manage to claim all of the Skill Points from the first one, then you’re in luck, as there’s a way to make up for lost time. Those now have a value, too, as they’re worth <strong>300,000 Coins</strong> per Skill Point. If you want to claim all five of them, you’ll need an extra <strong>1,500,000 Coins</strong>; add that onto the original five Skill Points, and that totals a whopping <strong>4,500,000 Coins</strong>!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Larian Isn’t Involved in the Baldur’s Gate TV Show, and They’re Not Happy]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/larian-not-involved-baldurs-gate-tv-show-not-happy/</link>
            <guid>1427908</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was recently revealed that HBO plans to produce a Baldur’s Gate live-action adaptation, helmed by Craig Mazin, one of the leads who has brought The Last of Us to life over the last few years. It has been confirmed that the show will continue after the events of Baldur’s Gate 3 and will feature the characters from the smash-hit 2023 game.</p>



<p>However, shortly after the news dropped regarding the show, it was confirmed that Larian Studios, the <strong>developer </strong>behind Baldur’s Gate 3, will have <strong>no involvement in the series</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-bucking-the-trend-and-not-involving-the-developer">Bucking the Trend and Not Involving the Developer</h2>



<p>Larian having zero involvement in a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hbo-developing-baldurs-gate-series-from-the-last-of-us-showrunner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3 television series</a> is a bold move. From what we’ve seen already, developers of these popular games have had a direct input in the production of their live-action adaptations. For instance, Neil Druckmann is a writer and executive producer on The Last of Us, which surfaced in 2013 from Naughty Dog.</p>



<p>Similarly, the likes of Todd Howard (Bethesda Game Studios) have executive producer credits and deep involvement in the creation of Fallout, another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-more-than-a-decade/">award-winning adaptation</a> that just wrapped its second season this week.</p>



<p>In recent years, one of the only examples of a developer <strong>not </strong>being involved in a live-action adaptation would be the Borderlands movie. Randy Pitchford, of Gearbox, revealed to Insider Gaming at Gamescom 2025 that he didn’t have any input in the movie and would have felt uncomfortable if he had.</p>



<p>On social media, the Director of Publishing at Larian Studios, Michael Douse, <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2019571113345396945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Except that we made it popular enough for it to be referred to as Baldur’s Gate 3.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When prompted in the comments to confirm if Larian would ‘sue or something’, he simply said, ‘Not really.’</p>



<p>He then wrote a lengthy series of posts talking about Larian having some of the best video game writers in the world, explaining, ‘I genuinely don’t think anyone can trump our writers.’ He wrapped by saying, ‘Don’t abandon hope, but do expect the world. That’s the job.’</p>



<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Later, Swen Vincke, the CEO of Larian, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures. There’s plenty of directions they could go. I’m eager to find out which ones Craig and his team will pick. He’s reached out for a chat so we’ll have the opportunity to tell him our thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Do you think it’s a huge concern that Larian won’t be invested in the creation of a Baldur’s Gate 3 television show? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Regular new content drops continue to take place in Fortnite, and February 2026 is stacked, with Epic Games dropping a big teaser roadmap of what to expect.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/battle-royale/">Battle Royale</a> behemoth is in the latter stages of the current season, but a new Fortnite Festival season has only just begun. Additionally, updates are also coming to other modes, including Reload and Fortnite OG.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for all of the dates and new content coming in the Fortnite Roadmap for February 2026, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Lots to come. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite has plenty to add in February with the month-long Love Legends event, featuring new collabs, free rewards, and more.</strong></p>



<p>The Love Legends event kicked off immediately after the update on February 5, with the first major content coming the following day with the second wave of KPop Demon Hunter Skins. </p>



<p>Later in the month, players can expect new weapons and items in Battle Royale, along with the long-awaited return of The Seven.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the major additions coming to Fortnite in February 2026, as revealed by Epic Games. New announcements will be added regularly.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-there-more-coming-in-february-2026">Is There More Coming in February 2026?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Fortnite will definitely have plenty more to add in February 2026, including content added beyond February 23.</strong></p>



<p>Epic Games’ reveal teaser only covered up until February 23 and the additions beyond that date will likely center around the long-awaited return of The Seven.</p>



<p>There will also be a significant build-up to the first seasonal change of 2026, with Chapter 7, Season 2 kicking off in early March.</p>



<p>Players should also expect further collab skins to drop in the Item Shop, as Epic Games is on a roll of major additions so far this year.</p>
