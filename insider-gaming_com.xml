<p>Sony has announced that Cloud Streaming for PlayStation Portal is officially arriving today for PS Plus Premium Members. </p>



<p>A new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> on the PlayStation blog confirms that the PS Portal players will be able to stream select PS5 games directly to their devices with the help of PS Plus Premium. The update will be available for players on November 5 at 6:00 p.m. PT / November 6 at 2:00 a.m. GMT. This update introduces several new features, including an enhanced gameplay experience, a redesigned UI, and more. </p>

<figure></figure>



<p>PlayStation Plus Premium members will be able to stream select PS5 digital titles from their own libraries, which includes some big names like Astro Bot, Borderlands 4, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Fortnite, Ghost of Yōtei, Grand Theft Auto V, Resident Evil 4, Cyberpunk 2077, God of War Ragnarök, Hogwarts Legacy, Sword of the Sea The Last of Us Part II Remastered and more. You can check out the <a href="https://playstation.com/ps5-game-cloud-streaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">complete list here</a>. </p>

<figure></figure>



<p>PlayStation Portal’s cloud streaming update comes with a refreshed home screen, which will have three tabs: Remote Play, Cloud Streaming, and Search. The first tab will let you use the device as you did initially, pair the PS5 and PS Portal, and play games installed on the console. </p>



<p>Cloud Streaming is a new dedicated home screen that enables PS Plus members to stream compatible titles without waiting for downloads. Lastly, the search screen helps look up games that support the new feature.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Where Winds Meet is one of the most anticipated releases remaining this year, with millions of players pre-registering for launch, and we’ve got all the details on the title’s free-to-play status.</p>



<p>Launching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a> as a PlayStation console exclusive and also on PC, Where Winds Meet has seen over seven million pre-registrations ahead of its global launch, having achieved vast success in China, where it was released in December 2024.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering how much you will need to splash out to play Where Winds Meet or whether it is free to play, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-where-winds-meet-free-to-play">Is Where Winds Meet Free to Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty to do. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Where Winds Meet is completely free to play, with optional monetization coming in the form of cosmetics for your character and in-game currencies.</strong></p>



<p>While there are bonuses that can be purchased ahead of launch, including PlayStation’s $14.99 pre-order edition that includes an outfit set, Player Name Card, in-game common currency, and two in-game draw items, that approach is entirely optional. It does not provide any major gameplay boosts.</p>



<p>Additionally, cosmetics and in-game currency can also be purchased separately inside the game, though, again, it’s entirely optional and won’t lock you out of any major content if you decide not to splash out.</p>



<p>Instead, you can enjoy Where Winds Meet without spending a single dollar, as the game is available in its entirety for free.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-where-winds-meet-for-free">How to Play Where Winds Meet For Free</h2>



<p><strong>There are two big steps to playing Where Winds Meet for free, as it requires downloading the game and creating an account.</strong></p>



<p>While Where Winds Meet can be played entirely in single player, a constant internet connection is required, and you also need a dedicated account with the game in order to play. The bonus of this is regular benefits, including pre-registration rewards, being distributed into your account.</p>



<p>Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to jump into Where Winds Meet without spending a single dollar.</p>



<ol>
<li>Sign in to your Steam or PlayStation account.</li>



<li>Search for ‘Where Winds Meet’.</li>



<li>Download the title.</li>



<li>Launch the game.</li>



<li>Create an account.</li>



<li>Sign in to the game.</li>



<li>Have fun!</li>

<p>We could finally be getting PS5 &amp; PC cross-buy capabilities as the symbol has been discovered in PlayStation Store data. While it’s not official, the new report means that PlayStation is testing the waters with PS5 &amp; cross-buy, and owners of both platforms could be in for dual-entitlement sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>For the longest time, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-games-for-november-2025-wave-1-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-insomniacs-spider-man-will-be-playable-on-next-xbox-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> owners have been able to enjoy cross-buy purchases. Meaning, you can buy a game on Xbox and also play the title on PC, and vice versa. If a new report is accurate, PC players might be about to get the best of both worlds.</p>



<h2 id="h-we-could-be-getting-ps5-amp-pc-cross-buy">We Could Be Getting PS5 &amp; PC Cross-Buy</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This would be big. Credit to PlayStation</figcaption></figure>



<p>News first broke on November 4 that new symbols had been discovered in the PlayStation Store’s files. The initial findings came from X account <a href="https://x.com/yAmethxst" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amethxst</a>.</p>



<p>They said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>New Symbols will be added soon (website &amp; tool), but here some nice new features from PlayStation (yes, some are old, other are unseen): A kind of “echo mode,” “PS5/PC games,” and “Cross-Buy.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The message also showed the symbols, what they look like, and it all seemed very real.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New Symbols will be added soon (website &amp; tool), but here some nice new features from PlayStation (yes, some are old, other are unseen):<br>– A kind of "echo mode"<br>– PS5/PC games<br>– "Cross-Buy" <a href="https://t.co/YxIAXp750g">pic.twitter.com/YxIAXp750g</a></p>— Amethxst (@yAmethxst) <a href="https://twitter.com/yAmethxst/status/1985788815030861860?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>It was a big, yet confident statement, but there has been a fair amount of trepidation about the potential claim. However, reliable outlet <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/du-cross-buy-ps5-pc-en-preparation-chez-playstation-voici-les-resultats-de-notre-enquete-60757" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a> has done some testing into the matter: “We decided to conduct our own investigation on the new symbols discovered, but especially on their date of addition to determine if they are not really old symbols.”</p>



<p>The ever-reliable billbil-kun described how they were “<strong>Inserting special characters in the “About” section of our PlayStation Network account. And the result does indeed show that these symbols actually exist.</strong>“</p>



<p>More evidence was found on top of this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Before the addition of these symbols, other clues were present through the PlayStation Store data. In some of the site’s CSS files, we also discovered&nbsp;the mention of “<strong>crossbuy-tag</strong>”&nbsp;in some properties of the file.</p>



<p>We tried to reproduce this CSS style on text and the result corresponds exactly to the symbol found on consoles. The result is shown in the image below. You can also do the test by yourself through this&nbsp;<a href="https://codepen.io/billbil-kun/pen/ByjEXZw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">template created by us on CodePen</a>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Would this be a huge coup for PC gamers, and PS5 players, for that matter?

<p>Reef Entertainment has confirmed that Terminator 2D: No Fate has been delayed to December 12, 2025. </p>



<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate has been delayed multiple times since its release date announcement. The game’s release was initially pushed back to October 2025 due to issues with the physical edition. It was then moved to November 2025 due to global trade and tariff changes. Now it has been delayed again due to more physical edition hurdles. </p>

The developers have revealed that “physical components for all editions have now finally arrived.” However, they will need some additional time to assemble them, which is why both the physical and digital editions will be available in December. The devs have sincerely apologized for the repeated delays. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>First of all, we want to start by saying thank you. We know you’ve waited longer than expected for the release of Terminator 2D: NO FATE, and we truly appreciate your patience and support throughout this journey.</p><p>The physical components for all editions have now…</p></div>— Reef Entertainment (@Reef_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reef_Games/status/1986003116022493467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>For those unaware of the title, Terminator 2D: No Fate is an upcoming 2D platformer featuring pixel graphics that allows players to experience the events of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. You will be able to play as Sarah Connor, John Connor, and the T-800 as they face the full force of Cyberdyne and Skynet’s arsenal, with multiple enemy types and boss fights.

<p>Minecraft has received a Dragon Ball Z DLC out of nowhere, adding Goku, Vegeta, and more to the game with different battle game modes. </p>



<p>Minecraft has been receiving really extensive DLCs lately, which don’t just add cosmetics, but new worlds and gameplay elements to the title. We saw this with the Superman DLC in September, where players could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-players-can-use-supermans-abilities-in-new-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use the Man of Steel’s abilities</a>. Now, the Dragon Ball Z DLC has arrived, and it is receiving a similar treatment. </p>



<h2 id="h-minecraft-s-dragon-ball-z-dlc-will-let-players-enter-solo-co-op-or-5v5-free-for-all-showdowns">Minecraft’s Dragon Ball Z DLC Will Let Players Enter Solo, Co-Op, or 5v5 Free For All Showdowns </h2>



<p>Minecraft’s Dragon Ball Z DLC is available now to purchase for 1,510 Minecoins on the Minecraft <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace/pdp/cyclone/dragon-ball-z/4730409a-ba78-416b-9589-6d089218047c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marketplace</a>. In this DLC, players will receive 11 new characters: Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Piccolo, Frieza, Trunks, Krillin, Android 18, Cell, Android 17, and Majin Buu. Some of these characters will also have Super Saiyan forms. Moreover, several iconic locations from the popular anime will make their way to the game, too, including Cell Games Arena, World Martial Arts Tournament Arena, Planet Namek, Capsule Corp, and more. </p>



<p>Furthermore, these are not just cosmetics; players will be able to bring out their inner Z warrior with the new Dragon Ball Z DLC for Minecraft. From the trailer, we could see that players will be able to use not only Ki Blasts, but special moves for different characters, including the Kamehameha for Goku, Gallick Gun for Vegeta, Special Beam Canon for Piccolo, and more. Each character brings their own moves, ultimate attacks, and custom VFX. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Two new freebies will be included as well, the first is ‘Become Saiyan’, where players can stay in character inside their “own Minecraft world with this skin pack that includes every famed combatant from Goku, Gohan, and Piccolo, to Vegeta, Bulma, and Frieza.” Second is the Scouter Character Creator item, which makes players look like a member of the Frieza Force. </p>

<p>New data from Alinea Analytics reveals that Battlefield 6 has sold over 10 million copies across all platforms. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has taken the gaming world by storm, hitting new heights of player numbers on Steam with both the full release and the battle royale mode. We already knew that BF6 had become the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest launch in series history</a>, selling over 7 million copies. Now, it seems that the game has reached a brand new sales milestone. </p>

However, he feels that this momentum is not enough to overtake “Call of Duty’s overall market dominance – this year, at least.” Elliot added that Battlefield 6 has gained a lot of popularity amongst the PC players; however, Call of Duty is a “multi-platform powerhouse” whose sales base “extends far beyond Steam and the PC market.”</p>



<p>Elliot explains that Battlefield 6 is experiencing “a huge amount of goodwill” from the community, thanks to all the improvements they have made from the previous title, Battlefield 2042. Call of Duty, on the other hand, is experiencing a “perception problem” due to the inclusion of “Fortnite-esque cosmetics” and excessive repetition within the series. However, these factors will not significantly impact COD’s sales. </p>



<p>The analyst elaborated that Call of Duty has established a massive audience across PC and consoles, with a vast number of casual players comprising this player base. These casual players end up purchasing the game “each year out of habit and brand loyalty.” Moreover, Call of Duty’s casual player base “dwarfs” Battlefield’s, and thanks to the integration with Warzone, “millions of players are constantly exposed to marketing, in-game promotions, and social tie-ins that convert attention into purchases.”</p>
