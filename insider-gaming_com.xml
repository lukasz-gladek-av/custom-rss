<p>Fortnite recently released its new anti-cheat policy, which revealed that players with lifetime bans will be offered a second chance in April 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-cheaters-will-receive-a-second-chance">Fortnite Cheaters Will Receive a Second Chance</h2>



<p>Fortnite has confirmed that players who have received a lifetime ban for cheating in the game and have been banned for more than a year can return to matchmaking in April 2025, when the new update rolls out. Players who have cheated in tournaments will not be able to participate in competitive events; however, they can also enter matchmaking in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in April, Fortnite’s lifetime ban policy for cheaters will change. First-time offenders will now receive a year’s ban, after which they will receive a second chance to return to the game. However, if they cheat again, a lifetime ban will be enforced. Players who sell cheats or break other rules, resulting in a lifetime ban, will not receive a second chance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s new <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-anti-cheat-update-february-27-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">anti-cheat policy</a> also introduces new PC requirements for tournaments. Players should have an Account Level of 350 or higher to participate in tournaments and enable TPM and Secure Boot while playing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many players wonder whether they will see the return of popular content creators who received lifetime bans for cheating. Jarvis, who was banned in 2019 for using cheat software while live-streaming, has also <a href="https://x.com/liljarviss/status/1895161943725613220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a> to Fortnite’s recent announcement about giving cheaters a second chance.</p>

Also, Epic Games recently banned a Fortnite cheater and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-bans-fortnite-cheater-forces-them-to-apologize-and-give-back-winnings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced them to apologise and return their winnings</a>.

<p>Netease recently spoke about their plans to grow Marvel Rivals as a franchise, and one avenue they are focusing on is “crossover events and promotions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/marvel-rivals-crossover-events-and-promotions-with-other-media-confirmed-by-netease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, Netease spoke about its growth strategies for Marvel Rivals during a Q&amp;A section of its Q4 2024 <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netease-inc-ntes-q4-2024-070339624.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a>. When asked about marketing expansions, the developers confirmed that Marvel Rivals will receive “crossover events and promotions with other media to expand the user base.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from crossovers in Marvel Rivals, the developers also spoke about the “wide acclaim” the game has received since the release of Season 1. Moreover, their investments in development and marketing have continued following a “long-term operational strategy”. Regarding esports, the team has a plan in the works and will announce it soon to “enhance the gaming ecosystem”.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has massive potential for crossovers with a name like Disney behind it. Players will also look forward to collaborations with the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as other games. A game like Fortnite already has its own Marvel Universe; imagine if Marvel Rivals were to join the fray, too. </p>
