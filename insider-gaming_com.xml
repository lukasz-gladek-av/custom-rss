<p>While the full release of Path of Exile 2 will feature a total of 12 playable classes with 36 Ascendancies to choose from, the Early Access launch on December 6 will not. It will include access to six playable classes—a mere handful of the potential. By the time we’re done with EA, we’ll all have mastered these six classes. Here’s what you can play as!</p>



<h2 id="h-six-path-of-exile-2-early-access-classes">Six Path of Exile 2 Early Access Classes</h2>



<p>On Early Access launch, we’ll receive a nice variety of classes, from your Strength-based Warrior to the Intelligence-favoring Witch, along with the Monk and Mercenary, which should offer unique playstyles. But most players will likely opt for Ranger or Witch on their first playthrough. Both classes are staples of the franchise.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Warrior</strong>
<ul>
<li>Titan</li>



<li>Warbringer</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Sorceress</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stormweaver</li>



<li>Chronomancer</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Ranger</strong>
<ul>
<li>Deadeye</li>



<li>Pathfinder</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Monk</strong>
<ul>
<li>Invoker</li>



<li>Acolute of Chayula</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Mercenary</strong>
<ul>
<li>Witchhunter</li>



<li>Gemling Legionnaire</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Witch</strong>
<ul>
<li>Blood Mage</li>



<li>Infernalist</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>So, six classes, each with two Ascendancies to test out. You can easily spend a few hundred hours playing through the most basic class builds across each playable class. Then, you can turn around and mess about with your very own build, mixing and matching skills and passives to create a workable prototype before full release!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-class-to-play-first-in-path-of-exile-2">What Class to Play First in Path of Exile 2?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, let’s get this out of the way. Path of Exile 2 is a massive ARPG offering countless viable build and playstyle paths, with every class in the game capable of pushing end-game content. As such, you should choose to play whichever class speaks to you, whether you want a high-damage glass cannon or a tank worthy of defeating any of the optional bosses in the game.</p>



<p>But if you’d like a recommendation, then we suggest you play as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Witch</li>



<li>Mercenary</li>



<li>Ranger</li>
</ul>



<p>Witch is always a fan-favorite, Mercenary is new to the sequel and shows a lot of promise, and Ranger, while initially weak, winds up as a powerful and hard-hitting solo class that’s easy to manage from the jump.</p>



<p>Hop into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a> to tell us which class you intend to play! Maybe—just maybe—you’ll find someone to party up with for the game’s six-player co-op!</p>

<p>It has been reported that Troy Baker, one of the industry’s most sought-after talents, will return to work under Neil Druckmann on whatever comes next at Naughty Dog. Baker has been in bed with ND since 2013’s The Last of Us, and the developer is unwilling to part ways with the superstar VA just yet.</p>



<p>In an interview with GQ, Troy Baker discussed his recent ventures. In one segment, he promised to return to work with Naughty Dog on Druckmann’s new project, whatever that may be.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-always">‘Always’</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/troy-baker-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with GQ</a>, it was reported that Neil Druckmann, the creator of The Last of Us, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In a heartbeat I would always work with Troy</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was quoted alongside a report that Baker <strong>will </strong>return to Naughty Dog to play a role in Druckmann’s next project, which for now remains under wraps.</p>



<p>It has been an uncharacteristically quiet year for Troy Baker, but he is playing the chief role in the upcoming Indiana Jones: The Great Circle, which will be released on December 6. He also had a spot in Arkham Shadow, playing Joker.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, I caught up with Troy Baker and talked about a project away from video games. He provided his vocal talents to James Cox for an audiobook, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-troy-baker-james-cox-grand-theft-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covering ‘Grand Theft AI’</a>, a cyberpunk novel of epic proportions.</p>



<p>It isn’t clear what Neil Druckmann’s next game looks like, but in 2025, Baker will surface in Ken Levine’s Judas, a spiritual successor to BioShock and a long-awaited first-person title.</p>



<p>What do you think Neil Druckmann’s next project looks like at Naughty Dog? Are we talking about another game set in The Last of Us’ universe, or could it be something else entirely? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/where-can-you-play-path-of-exile-2-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>While I primarily play on PC, like many other ARPG fans, the genre is growing on other systems, too. You can now play some of the best titles in the genre on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, including Path of Exile and Diablo IV. But what about the upcoming PoE2? What are the Path of Exile 2 platforms for Early Access? Here’s what you need to know to prepare for the monolithic ARPG!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-systems-is-path-of-exile-2-releasing-on">What Systems is Path of Exile 2 Releasing On?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-path-of-exile-2-early-access-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access release day</a>, you can play Path of Exile 2 on PC (Steam and Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. On PC, you can buy a supporter pack ranging in price from $30 to nearly $500, depending on where you purchase. More options are available on the Grinding Gear Games’ official website, all offering game keys. But if you’re playing the ARPG on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, then you can scoop up one of the multiple supporter packs, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Path of Exile 2 Early Access Supporter Pack – $30</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lord of Ogham Supporter Pack – $60</strong></li>



<li><strong>King of the Faridun Supporter Pack – $100</strong></li>



<li><strong>Thamaturge of the Vaal Supporter Pack – $150</strong></li>



<li><strong>Warlord of the Karui Supporter Pack – $220</strong></li>



<li><strong>Liberator of Wraeclast Supporter Pack – $370</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Prices will vary depending on your platform, region, and associated taxes.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-path-of-exile-2-be-free-to-play-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s">Will Path of Exile 2 Be Free to Play on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>While the full 1.0 launch of Path of Exile 2 will be a free-to-play experience available to anyone who wishes to download and enjoy the game, the current Early Access launch for PoE2 is a paid endeavor. If you want access, you must purchase one of the supporter packs mentioned earlier, all of which include a key to the early release of the ARPG. These packs, once again, range in price, with the cheapest being $30. </p>



<p>Now, if you’re a long-time fan of the ARPG genre, eating up all of the grind you can, $30 isn’t a high asking price. Many people wind up playing PoE for hundreds or thousands of hours.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will release in March 2025. That’s according to the latest rumors published by popular Nintendo news channel Nintendo Prime.</p>



<p>According to the latest rumors, which the channel found on Chinese forum <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5103984429499076#comment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Weibo</a> and the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-speculation-thread-st-this-is-furukawa-president-of-nintendo.7757/page-2146#post-1426497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famiboards gaming forum</a>, Nintendo will officially reveal its next system in January 2025 followed by a March launch. </p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>Nintendo has not responded to requests for comment as of publishing. As always, until something is made official or Insider Gaming can independently confirm the details, please take all rumors with a grain of salt. That said, this isn’t the first time a March 2025 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-reportedly-headed-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date has been rumored</a> for the follow-up console. Also, the last update from the company is that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console will be announced</a> before April.</p>



<p>As far as what to expect with the next Nintendo Switch console, Nintendo confirmed that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-backwards-compatible/">will have backwards compatibility</a> as well as feature the same Nintendo Switch Online service that players currently have. </p>



<p>Other rumors about the console include magnetic Joy-Con <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controllers with additional buttons</a> as well as support for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">up to 4K resolution</a> when docked. It’s also been claimed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-get-aaa-games-at-launch-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new system will get AAA games</a> around its launch, something the current Nintendo Switch didn’t have. </p>



<p>None of those reports have been confirmed, either. </p>
