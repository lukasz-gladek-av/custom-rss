<p>It’s not every day that we receive a competent “Battlefield-killer,” though Delta Force, from developer Team Jade, is shaping up to take on the crown with its free-to-play first-person shooter. From what we played during past beta periods, it’s an exceptionally good time, with fast-paced, satisfying ground combat, high-speed vehicle encounters, and customization options that keep us grinding for more weapon XP round after round. Here’s everything we know about Delta Force!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-can-you-play-delta-force">When Can You Play Delta Force?</h2>



<p>Delta Force’s official release date is <strong>December 5</strong>. While Team Jade considers this an open beta, the game launches on Steam Early Access for everyone to download and play. If you missed out on previous beta periods, this is an excellent time to give the first-person shooter a genuine shot!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-delta-force-system-requirements">What Are the Delta Force System Requirements?</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the FPS launching first on PC, knowing the system requirements beforehand is essential to ensure your computer can run the game successfully. Thankfully, they’re not overly demanding.</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>

<h2 id="h-is-delta-force-coming-to-consoles">Is Delta Force Coming to Consoles?</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Yes! Delta Force is coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, though there is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-console-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no official release date</a> for either system yet. Developer Team Jade revealed it’s targeting a Q1 2025 console release for the free-to-play first-person shooter. </p>



<p>Alongside the console release, PC players will receive full controller support.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-delta-force-feature-cross-progression">Does Delta Force Feature Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p>When Delta Force is finally available on all systems—PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S—it will feature cross-progression between each platform, allowing you to download and play anywhere you want. If you have multiple systems, download the FPS on PC and Xbox Series X|S, for example, and you’ll find that your stats, weapon XP, and rank all transfer over.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-game-modes-does-delta-force-offer">What Game Modes Does Delta Force Offer?</h2>



<p>On launch, Delta Force will include three game modes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Operations</strong>: An extraction shooter game mode featuring 3-person squads of Operators surviving, looting, and escaping with high-end items, all the while fighting against both AI and other squads of human players.</li>



<li><strong>Warfare</strong>: The iconic, expansive game mode featuring PvP combat with large-scale encounters, including vehicles and Operators, across massive maps.</li>



<li><strong>Black Hawk Down</strong>: An old-school, cinematic experience for those who grew up playing the Delta Force: Black Hawk Down games of old.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-who-are-the-delta-force-operators">Who Are the Delta Force Operators?</h2>



<p>Delta Force features a wide array of unlockable Operators, or unique characters with abilities and personalities, to play as, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Uluru</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hackclaw</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vyron</strong></li>



<li><strong>D-Wolf</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shepherd</strong></li>



<li><strong>Luna</strong></li>



<li><strong>Stinger</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Team Jade promises additional Operators in the future, though it’s unclear how many they have planned.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-delta-force-feature-vehicle-combat">Does Delta Force Feature Vehicle Combat?</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Delta Force features extensive vehicle combat—land, sea, and air—across its various game modes. On launch, we’ll have access to multiple military vehicles, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>M1A4 Battle Tank</strong></li>



<li><strong>FSV Wheeled Tank Destroyed</strong></li>



<li><strong>AH-1035D Assault Helicopter</strong></li>



<li><strong>All-Terrain Vehicle</strong></li>



<li><strong>LAV-G1 IFV</strong></li>



<li><strong>LAV-AA</strong></li>



<li><strong>Assault Vehicles</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>A few of these are generic military vehicles meant for quick insertions. Others, like the M1A4 or AH-1035D, fill more specialized roles on the battlefield.</p>

<p>It’s been a big year for video games, with countless hits, such as The Outlast Trials, Dragon’s Dogma 2, Elden Ring’s first and only expansion, and numerous indie titles that stole the show, but the year isn’t over yet. There’s still one month to go, and it’s often the big one. December is typically filled with a few significant releases to prepare for the holiday season and countless sales to capitalize on Christmas. For now, let’s focus on the games. Here are the biggest video game releases of December 2024!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-major-video-game-release-in-december">Every Major Video Game Release in December</h2>



<p>Honestly speaking, this December is a little more lackluster than usual. We don’t have as many high-profile releases to discuss, besides Delta Force, Marvel Rivals, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. While I’m excited to play all three, Caves of Qud steals the month for me, and I’ll probably lose myself to another few playthroughs of that one.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete (iOS / Android) – December 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Delta Force (PC) – December 4</strong></li>



<li><strong>Caves of Qud (PC) – December 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fantasian Neo Dimension (PS4 / PS5) – December 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>Marvel Rivals (PC / PS5 / Xbox Series X|S) – December 6</strong></li>



<li><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (PC / Xbox Series X|S) – December 9</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered (PC / Switch / PS4 / PS5 / Xbox Series X|S) – December 10</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind (PC / PS4 / PS5 / Xbox One / Xbox Series X|S) – December 10</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fairy Tail 2 (PC) – December 11</strong></li>



<li><strong>Alien: Rogue Incursion (PSVR2 / PC VR / Quest 3) – December 19</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-a-taste-of-what-s-to-come-in-january">A Taste of What’s to Come in January</h2>



<p>Of course, as you start to get older, you’ll find that the months begin to blend as one moves into the next rapidly. Before you know it, the holidays end, and January and the new year begin, so there will be plenty of new video game releases!</p>



<p>Here’s a taste of the upcoming game releases in January 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana (PS4 / PS5 / Switch) – January 7</li>



<li>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD (Switch) – January 16</li>



<li>Tales of Graces f Remastered (PC / PS4 / PS5 / Xbox One / Xbox Series X|S) – January 17</li>



<li>Dynasty Warriors: Origins (PC / PS5 / Xbox Series X|S) – January 17</li>



<li>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 (PC) – January 30</li>



<li>Sniper Elite: Resistance (PC / PS4 / PS5 / Xbox One / Xbox Series X|S) – January 30</li>
</ul>

<p>In December, the grand final of the PUBG Mobile Global Championship will unravel in London, England. With a $3 million prize pool up for grabs, this has snatched the record for the most valuable esports event to ever be held in the United Kingdom. It’s the first time the tournament has taken place in the UK, and fans are <strong>excited</strong> to say the least.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-money">Big Money</h2>



<p>The PUBG Mobile Global Championship is one of the most valuable tournaments in the modern esports calendar. A single event will rarely reach such epic proportions in terms of a prize pool, and few tournaments come close to the $3 million pot that this game boasts.</p>



<p>During the event, 49 teams will compete for a chance at snatching the coveted PMGC trophy. In 2023, it was IHC Esports that walked away with the prize. The tournament was a roaring success in 2023, with a whopping peak viewership of 980,123 users being recorded, which decimates most competing events.</p>



<p>In recent years, the concept of mobile-based esports tournaments has skyrocketed in popularity. It’s estimated there at 2 billion mobile gamers worldwide, and many of them invest time and effort in games like Free Fire and PUBG Mobile.</p>



<p>While the United Kingdom’s gaming expo scene is crumbling, the esports ecosystem across the region remains relatively solid. In the last few years, we’ve seen the likes of the League of Legends World Championship, the Halo Championship Series, a BLAST R6 Major, and the Rocket League Championship Series all make their way into the region.</p>



<p>Will you be watching the PMGC unfold in London? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-ad-revenue-drop-streamers-adpocalypse/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-streamers-see-ad-revenue-plummet-amid-platform-struggles.1037436/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-ad-revenue-drop-streamers-adpocalypse/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you’ve heard the term ‘adpocalypse’ in the streaming world and haven’t got a clue what it means, you’re not alone. Recently, it was revealed that some Twitch streamers are suffering immeasurably from plummeting ad revenue rates, and nobody knows why. On the streaming platform, some users have reported a drop in ad revenue of as much as 95%.</p>



<p>This adpocalypse came on suddenly and has impacted some of Twitch’s biggest streamers, some of whom were picking up thousands of dollars a month through ad revenue. They’re now looking at just a few hundred dollars, and on their end, nothing has changed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-taken-for-granted">Taken for Granted</h2>



<p>Admittedly, this is the bread and butter earnings for some Twitch streamers. On social media, clips have surfaced showing users complaining about their ad revenue drops, <a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/1857455706376450514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">such as Lacy</a>, who stressed that his $10,000-a-day ad revenue stream has dropped to around $2,000 a day.</p>



<p>That’s still <strong>far, far </strong>more than the average worker earns, but for someone who has built a way of living out of those earnings, it could be devastating. Twitch allowed them to secure the bag in this way, and then without warning or forethought, the rate of earnings has been slashed immeasurably.</p>



<p>Imagine if your place of work suddenly cut your salary by 80% without telling you – that’s effectively what’s happening here. Sure, the creators still have subscriptions, bits, and other donations, but it’s not <strong>good</strong>.</p>



<p>One streamer, TheStockGuy, revealed that he’s disabling ads on his streams because the returns aren’t worth the disruption. He was reporting a 95% drop in earnings – one of the most significant examples of the adpocalypse we’ve seen.</p>



<p>Twitch has yet to comment on why ad revenue is plummeting – I’ve reached out for a statement in the meantime.</p>



<p>Do you think streamers needed their earnings adjusted, or is this an unfair change from Twitch? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>Dying Light 2 is available on PS Plus this month as a free game, but Techland has gone one step beyond that provision and added a series of PS5 Pro-focused enhancements to the game. One of the best open-world zombie games ever made has just gotten better with these recent changes – read on to find out what they are.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-the-world-looks-gorgeous">The End of the World Looks Gorgeous</h2>



<p>With a PlayStation 5 Pro, users can soak up several key advantages, from boosted resolutions to enhanced frame rates. There’s a sizeable processing boost under the hood of the PS5 Pro, and many developers have leant on that to strengthen their games. </p>



<p>It was recently revealed that 2022’s Dying Light 2: Stay Human will be added to PS Plus this month as a free game. It was then announced by Techland, the game’s developer, that PS5 Pro enhancements are also inbound.</p>



<p>This includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enhanced graphics settings (Balanced, Resolution, Performance, Quality)</li>



<li>Increased base resolution</li>



<li>Improved shadows, screen-space reflections, and sub-surface scattering</li>



<li>Better weather (including fog)</li>
</ul>



<p>Dying Light 2 already looked phenomenal, boasting one of the best apocalyptic environments in recent years, but this latest round of changes takes things to an entirely new level. If you’re a PlayStation 5 Pro owner and you want to pick up a copy of Dying Light 2 when it goes live on PS Plus, I’d recommend doing so.</p>



<p>In recent news, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-one-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> had surpassed one million wishlists. Are you looking forward to the next instalment in the popular post-apocalyptic series? Let us know in the comments.</p>
