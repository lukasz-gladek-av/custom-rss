<p>High on Life 2 has just received a brand new gameplay showcase, revealing early parts of the title’s campaign. </p>



<p>The sequel to the popular Squanch Games was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/high-one-life-2-revealed-at-xbox-showcase-with-release-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed earlier this year</a> during the Xbox Showcase at the Summer Game Fest, with a release date set for February 2026. What’s more, the game is set to release on PlayStation 5, along with Xbox Series X/S and PC at launch. Now, let’s check out the title’s early campaign gameplay below. </p>







<h2 id="h-high-on-life-2-campaign-gameplay-reveals-pinkline-harbor-hub">High On Life 2 Campaign Gameplay Reveals Pinkline Harbor Hub</h2>



<p>The new High on Life 2 campaign gameplay comes through a new video posted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vpw9qg_AaM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> on YouTube. It showcases Pinkline Harbor, one of the three in-game hubs players will encounter earlier in the game. The latest video starts with the player meeting two guards while holding the same guns we saw in the previous gameplay trailer. The conversation options differ depending on the weapons they have, with each gun providing a response that suits their personality. </p>



<p>We then see the player character explore the Pinkline Harbor, grinding some rails on their skateboard, even receiving a new one from one of their newly made allies. The video also includes a side mission in which the player saves one of the NPCs from drowning with their suction weapon. The player then proceeds to grind rails and jump across roofs in the city with their skateboard, taking down one of the wanted posters of them in the process. </p>



<p>The High On Life 2 campaign gameplay ends when the player reaches the destination for the primary mission, Pinkbellies Bar and Grill. However, to get this location, we see the player find and use two Lugblobs to open the door. Interested readers can check out the new trailer below: </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you thought the Skill-Based Matchmaking conversation was going anywhere, you might want to boil the kettle. Not only is Treyarch adamant about having SBMM, but Black Ops 7’s playlist options will now feature SBMM modes more prominently.</p>



<p>The letters ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sbmm-cod-creator-debunk-conspiracies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM</a>‘ will forever be synonymous with FPS games. Skill-based matchmaking plays a huge role in modern-day matchmaking, and there was a lot of interest around Black Ops 7 after Treyarch revealed that it would feature a greater emphasis on ‘Open Matchmaking.’</p>



<p>Slowly but surely, the developer might be backtracking.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-season-1-moving-standard-matchmaking-to-featured">Black Ops 7 Season 1 Moving Standard Matchmaking To Featured</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Was it always going to happen? Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since launch, the Standard Matchmaking playlist option—which emphasizes SBMM—has been a regular playlist option. This will change with Black Ops 7 Season 1.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-patch-notes-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 patch notes</a> have revealed some interesting notes on SBMM:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’ve continued to see increased engagement with Standard Moshpit, so we’ll be featuring it in the Featured tab for players who prefer an experience with more similarly skilled opponents. With the main tab changing to Featured, the other tab will now become Party Games, which will include Prop Hunt, Sharpshooter, One in the Chamber, and Gunfight at the launch of Season 01, as well as the debut of Sticks &amp; Stones and Gun Game in Week 2.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In layman’s terms, players are apparently playing modes that prioritize SBMM for matchmaking. This is more player engagement here; therefore, Treyarch is now rewarding this by adding Standard Moshpit to the featured playlist—making it a center-stage attraction.</p>



<p>There have been suggestions that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-findings-show-sbmm-might-not-be-as-open-as-advertised/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM might not be as open as advertised</a> in Black Ops 7. This ‘Featured’ move doesn’t necessarily support this theory, but it shows that SBMM is becoming prevalent in Call of Duty once again.</p>



<p>Is this Treyarch u-turning on the idea of moving Black Ops 7 more toward open matchmaking? If you have thoughts on this or SBMM in general, head to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> for more gaming conversations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Use these Roblox Death Ball monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Gems, Crystals, Cosmic Orbs and much more.</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of intense anime-style battles and the popular gym class game dodgeball, then you need to check out Death Ball immediately. Death Ball is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sols-rng-codes-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> dodgeball game where players use an energy ball instead of a traditional ball. This is done not by throwing the ball as would usually be the case, but by using various abilities and movement skills. Players must try to parry the ball in order to hit an opponent instead of trying to catch it, as each hit and change of direction increases the speed and power of the ball.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Players initially queue into a massive arena with multiple other players, where the main objective is to be the last player standing after all of the competitors have been eliminated. The game also tends to get harder and harder as it progresses into the latest stages, making things like timing, reactions and general positioning that much more important. With a variety of Champions to choose from, each with varied abilities, Death Ball can offer hours of entertainment. Stronger weapons and Champions can be unlocked using the in-game currencies, and one way to get more of them is by using the following Death Ball codes.&nbsp;</p>

</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-death-ball-codes">How To Get More Death Ball Codes</h2>



<p>Death Ball codes are usually released either through the game’s official Discord server or through the Roblox game page. However, tracking both of these regularly can be a hassle, and moreover, they never notify the players when any of the previously released codes expire. That’s why we recommend that all players keep this page bookmarked, as we update the article as soon as any new codes drop, while expired codes are also promptly removed from the active codes list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale will not be available on Steam when it launches in January, Hypixel Studios confirmed, with the developers keen to avoid negative reviews during the early access stage.</p>



<p>After being axed by Riot Games, Hytale was saved by the initial founders of the game and will be released into early access on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 13</a>, with an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-price-revealed-ahead-of-early-access-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">affordable price of $19.99 for the base version</a>, and, while Steam won’t be available at launch and may never be required, there are plans for a console release.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-skipping-steam-but-coming-to-console-in-future">Hytale Skipping Steam But Coming to Console in Future</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Wait. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Answering a series of frequently asked questions on the <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hytale website</a>, executive director Patrick ‘Lyall’ Derbic confirmed Hytale won’t be supported on Steam at launch, with the intention to avoid “overindexing on negative reviews from players that aren’t as well-informed yet about what we are doing.”</p>



<p>The intention is to spend time “working with the community and improving the game,” and, while “Steam is a great marketing tool,” it’s one that may not ever be required. However, the door hasn’t been closed on a Steam launch entirely.</p>



<p>There are plans for launches on console and other platforms in the future, though the early access period will be on PC only. Launching on console “requires a lot of work on backend systems,” and the initial desire is to “focus on making a good game first.”</p>



<p>A mobile version will also not be available during early access, and it remains to be seen whether it’s on the cards at all, as Hypixel Studios are “still evaluating what it would take to make this a feasible reality.”</p>

<p>Fortnite players are set to be treated to another new game mode, according to leakers, with a mode for five-player squads in the works.</p>



<p>Battle Royale in Fortnite currently supports 1-4 players, but larger groups have been restricted. However, that could be set to change with five-player squads on the horizon.</p>







<h2 id="h-leakers-say-fortnite-will-add-five-player-squads">Leakers Say Fortnite Will Add Five-Player Squads</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More players, more fun. Credit Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/Fecooo_/status/1996365066212696385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter post from Fecoo_</a>, five-player squads are “likely coming” to Battle Royale soon, with a sub link code to the data of the playlist of the mode showing details of ‘Quints’, which also confirms that five players can be in a team.</p>



<p>The string has come in the same area where the Battle Royale modes of Solo, Duos, Trios, and Squads are shown, suggesting there is strong legitimacy to the claims.</p>



<p>Five-player squads would be the first variation to the standard Battle Royale since the introduction of Trios in January 2019, which initially came as a limited-time mode before being later added as a permanent option.</p>



<p>Since then, Battle Royale has branched into entirely separate modes with the likes of Blitz, Reload, Fortnite OG, and Delulu, but the lobby sizes have largely remained the same.</p>



<p>The leaks do not specify when to expect the addition of five-player squads to Fortnite, nor is it indicated whether the addition will arrive permanently or as a limited-time mode.</p>



<p>It does serve as further evidence of Epic Games’ plans to continually expand Fortnite to cater to a wider range of players, with the game now containing separate ecosystems with their own passionate playerbase.</p>

<p>Fortnite has confirmed an iconic character has survived the shocking attack that occurred in the trailer for Chapter 7 Season 1, with the Battle Bus poised to return and the driver being safe from harm.</p>



<p>One of the biggest shake-ups in recent history in Fortnite occurred at the start of Chapter 7, with players landing on the Battle Royale Island after surfing a wave after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-the-battle-bus-fortnite-chapter-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shocking destruction of the Battle Bus</a>. However, the iconic vehicle isn’t gone for good.</p>







<h2 id="h-battle-bus-returning-to-fortnite">Battle Bus Returning to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Survival. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1996338694383714586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Twitter</a> was shared confirming the safety of the driver, alongside a message that read “The Bus Driver, who was obliterated by an energy beam last week, just texted me this.”</p>



<p>The exchange of messages included one from the driver himself, saying “i lived *****,” and a dramatic return to Fortnite is expected to take place later today.</p>



<p>Players have been hard at work completing quests to repair the Battle Bus, including finding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-custom-battle-bus-pieces-chapter-7-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">custom Battle Bus pieces</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-bus-wheels-pump-n-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Bus wheels</a>, and the work has seemingly paid off, with Dummy successful in their repairs.</p>



<p>The return of the Battle Bus coincides with the return of additional modes to Fortnite, following a brief absence, with Reload, Blitz, and Ranked now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-roadmap-blitz-reload-og-delulu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available from December 4</a>.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG remains unavailable for the time being until the launch of a new OG Season on November 11, while Delulu is back for Chapter 7 the following day.</p>



<p>At this stage, it’s not clear whether the surfing mechanic will be removed entirely or retained with a varied approach to landing in matches.</p>
