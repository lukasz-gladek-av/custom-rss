<p>Capcom’s Monster Hunter Wilds carries on the series’ legacy of beast battling, and its file size and GB demands have mostly been revealed. Ironically, they’re not as monstrous as some of its contemporaries, and we think you might be pleased.</p>



<p>Few games deliver the thrill of the hunt quite like Capcom’s long-running series. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is a natural continuation of this, and its 2025 iteration is supersizing the scale and the sleekness of the slaying. One thought pops into the head though, is Wilds going to be too big?</p>



<p>I’m here to answer for this for you, but I can give you a quick spoiler: <em>It’s not bad at all</em>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gb-is-monster-hunter-wilds-on-ps5">How Many GB is Monster Hunter Wilds on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of meat on the bone. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Monster Hunter Wilds file size is 52.826 GB on PS5.</strong></p>



<p>First news of the confirmation came from reliable X account <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>. The user specializes in this information and usually manages to reveal a game’s file size well ahead of time.</p>



<p>A February 12 post seemingly locked in Monster Hunter Wilds’ GBs required. I have to say 53 GB (rounded up) is fantastic for a game that looks to be substantial and stunning. It’s common for many AAA titles with high polish to get close to—if not succeed—100 GB.</p>



<p>Wilds’ file size is a welcome change of pace.</p>



<div><article><p><span>🚨 𝙈𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝙃𝙪𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝙒𝙞𝙡𝙙𝙨

– 𝐃𝐨𝐰𝐧𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐒𝐢𝐳𝐞 : 52.826 GB
– 𝐕𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 : 01.000.010

– 𝑺𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒅𝒂𝒓𝒅 ($69.99)
Pre-Load : February 26
Release : February 28

</span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#PS5</a><span> </span><span></span></p></article></div>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gb-is-monster-hunter-wilds-on-pc">How Many GB is Monster Hunter Wilds on PC?</h2>



<p><strong>The official Steam page for Monster Hunter Wilds indicates at least 75 GB of storage is required.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds’ system requirements</a> explains “75 GB available space” is needed. Now, there’s a chance this total could be updated as we get closer to release. For now, it’s a safe approximation of the number, and could turn out to be the final number. </p>



<p>Or, Wilds might end up requiring less than 75 GB anyway. We’ll keep checking the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> if alterations are enforced.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-how-many-gb-monster-hunter-wilds-is-on-xbox">Do we Know How Many GB Monster Hunter Wilds is on Xbox?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, Xbox has not disclosed accurate details on Monster Hunter Wilds’ file size.</strong></p>



<p>If you check the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9p7pd6wp5ghx?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s Xbox store page</a>, under its “Additional Info,” it clearly states the approximate size is <strong>328.76 MB</strong>. It’s safe to assume this is a placeholder or typo, but I think we can discredit this as file size information.</p>



<p>This figure is sure to be updated, so stay tune for further updates.</p>



<hr>



<p>The file size requirements are actually not wild. It’s quite refreshing all things considered. Are you happy to see relatively tame GB sizes? Do modern games need to find a way to lessen the load on your platform storage?</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is likely going to be in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2025-is-the-year-of-the-rpg-upcoming-rpg-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 GOTY contention where RPG</a>s are concerned. So keen on top of the latest content such as its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-editions-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editions</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-denuvo-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Denuvo</a> status.</p>

<p>Official modding support is coming to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. In a post on social media on Wednesday, developer Warhorse Studios announced the new feature with a simple message.</p>



<p>“Bohemia is about to get even more exciting,” <a href="https://x.com/KingdomComeRPG/status/1889706030226956469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said</a>. “Official modding support is coming to [Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2] on Steamworks.”</p>



<p>No specific release date for when the feature will be added to the game was announced. All that was said on that front was “stay tuned”. Based on the tease, modding will be available exclusively to those with a Steam version of the game.</p>



<p>Since its release, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has been a critical and commercial success. The game sold over one million copies in its first day, and Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calls it a “masterpiece”</a>.</p>



<p>”&nbsp;From ethereal sequences packed with tearjerker scenes to a phenomenal weather engine, and from genuinely interesting side activities to a neat little photo mode, I cannot find one major fault with this game,” Taylor-Hill says in the full review.</p>



<p>What do you think of modding coming to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p>Developer Rebellion has released a brand new features trailer for the upcoming action survival game, Atomfall. In this trailer, players get a look at various settings and landscapes in the game while also learning about what to expect as you play.</p>



<p>“This slice of Northern England includes everything from open moors, rugged hills, dense woodlands and the picture-perfect English village Wyndham,” Rebellion says. “But beware, this is a dangerous and hostile landscape filled with gangs of outlaws, crazed cultists and unexplained horrors. </p>



<p>“Even the local wildlife poses an immense threat to your life. If you are to navigate this land and survive, you will need to fight for your life and scavenge resources.”</p>



<p>You can check out the full trailer for yourself below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Atomfall launches on March 27, and will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. The game will also launch Day One on Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-preview-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview of the game</a> last summer, Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill touched on how interacting with the game’s characters can change your overall experience.</p>



<p>“Get too close to a faction that doesn’t trust you, and you’ll be set upon pretty quickly,” he said. “In conversations, you can choose from what might be several choices, each of which can lead a different way. If you want to be stealthier, you’ll put enemies on edge, and if you go in guns blazing, you’ll quickly draw an entire force down upon you.”</p>

<p>The Alters has been delayed once again by 11 Bit Studios. The announcement comes via a post on social media on Wednesday morning.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://x.com/altersgame/status/1889675839434010677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post online</a>, the game’s official account said that the planned release for Q1 2025 has been pushed to later in the year. An exact window, however, wasn’t given.</p>



<p>“While we recognize that this may not be the update you were hoping for, this additional time is being dedicated to further refining mission parameters and ensuring that all essential systems meet Ally Corp’s uncompromising standards,” the statement reads. “Furthermore, it is also allowing us to integrate new enhancements into Project Dolly, ensuring that your eventual deployment is more exciting and rewarding than originally projected.”</p>



<p>They continued: “This additional time will allow us to ensure that every aspect of Project Dolly operates at peak efficiency, leading to an outcome that benefits both the organization and, of course, yourself.”</p>



<p>For those unfamiliar with the game, The Alters is a “emotional sci-fi game with a unique blend of survival, adventure, and base-building elements.” Players have to work to create alternate versions of the main character Jan Dolski in order to escape a hostile planet after he was left as the lone survivor of a space expedition.</p>



<p>The game was announced back in June 2022. When it does finally release, The Alters will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It will also be available via Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>What do you make of The Alters being delayed to later this year? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>
