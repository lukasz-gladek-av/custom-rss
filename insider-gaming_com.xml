<p>The Simpsons are on their way to Fortnite, and it appears Bart Simpson is the first to make his arrival, as his iconic treehouse can be found on the Battle Royale island, and we’ll tell you exactly where to go.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s mini-season themed around The Simpsons kicks off this week, starting with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge live event</a>, which marks the final part of Chapter 6 in the game, with Epic Games now gearing up for the big release of Chapter 7 at the start of December.</p>



<p>Ahead of the big live event, a new quest is live in Fortnite that tasks you to investigate the Mysterious Anomaly, and we’ve got a full breakdown of where you need to go.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-the-mysterious-anomaly-in-fortnite">How to Find The Mysterious Anomaly in Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Head here. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Mysterious Anomaly in Fortnite, aka Bart Simpson’s treehouse, is located in the northwestern part of the map, close to the Creepy Camps POI.</strong></p>



<p>Approaching this location, you’ll immediately spot a cell-shaded treehouse that sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the environment, which serves as a huge teaser ahead of the Simpsons-themed mini-season that will serve as the final swansong of Chapter 6 in Fortnite.</p>



<p>To claim the 20,000 XP and complete the quest, which provides a huge bump to your season level and can help you unlock any remaining rewards from the Battle Pass and Fortnitemares, simply approach the Treehouse. When you appear close enough, the challenge will automatically tick off and provide the reward.</p>



<p>There’s no need to head inside the treehouse, but if you do, you’ll be treated to another mini easter egg for the forthcoming season, with a TV that has a sketchy signal in the corner of the building. Periodically, images will flash up with memes from The Simpsons, another major hint at what is coming.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-any-other-simpsons-easter-eggs-in-fortnite">Are There Any Other Simpsons Easter Eggs in Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, there are other Simpsons-themed easter eggs located on the Fortnite app, though none of the others provide an additional quest or XP bonuses.</strong></p>



<p>In the Steamy Shacks location, a workstation very similar to Homer Simpson’s at the nuclear power plant can be found, with no secret as to who it belongs to, as pink-glazed donuts are also there, many of which have had a bite taken out of them.</p>



<p>Additional teasers could be added before the start of the live event this weekend, but it’s not too long to wait now until the big reveal of everything there is to enjoy.</p>
