<p>The latest Call of Duty title will have the usual seasonal Battle Passes. It gives you the chance to grind matches, earn battle pass XP, and earn in-game items. We’ve got the latest information on the Black Ops 7 Season 1 battle pass.</p>



<p>You know what to expect from the first season of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-split-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>: All the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a> content, new Warzone integration, and of course, a snazzy Battle Pass packed with lots of tiers.</p>



<p>The Season One Battle Pass is the first thing on most of your minds, so let’s fill you in.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-black-ops-7-season-1-battle-pass-release-date">When Is The Black Ops 7 Season 1 Battle Pass Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Be patient. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s not confirmed, but we expect the Season 1 Battle Pass to go live on <strong>December 4</strong> with the expected start of Black Ops 7 Season 1.</strong></p>



<p>It’s always the same with new seasonal content. We never know the <em>exact </em>information until it’s close to happening, but historical data means it’s quite easy to figure out the start date, or not far off. The only thing between now and Season 1’s start is the mini-preseason beforehand. Even then, it would be a separate Battle Pass.</p>



<p>We’ve seen from the Vault Edition that the Season One Battle Pass is coming. Speaking of which, if this is your first Call of Duty, you probably need a walkthrough on the pass itself.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-black-ops-7-season-1-battle-pass">How To Get Black Ops 7 Season 1 Battle Pass</h2>



<p><strong>There are two main ways to acquire the Black Ops 7 Season 1 Battle Pass: Buy it from the CoD Shop using CoD points, or by getting it automatically through buying the Vault Edition.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-cod-points">CoD Points</h3>



<p>A Call of Duty seasonal Battle Pass is usually <strong>1,100 CoD Points</strong>—which equates to roughly <strong>$9.99</strong>. There’s the BlackCell Season Pass, but this costs a lot more, and there’s usually an upgraded Season Pass (without BlackCell gear), which offers Tier Skips.</p>



<h3 id="h-vault-edition">Vault Edition</h3>



<p>If you shelled out <strong>$99.99 or £99.99</strong> for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-vault-edition-contents-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vault Edition</a>, not only do you get a ton of goodies like skins and Mastercraft Weapons, but you’re also entitled to the <strong>BlackCell Season One Battle Pass</strong>.</p>



<p>This means you automatically get the best version of the Season 1 Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Whichever method you opt for, you’ll get the Battle Pass for the multi-week duration of Season 1. Let us know if you intend to buy the Season 1 Battle Pass. Is there anything in particular you buy seasonal passes for?

<p>GSC Game World has once again proven it’s dedicated to the ongoing support of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, released almost one year ago. The open-world, (almost) post-apocalyptic shooter turned heads when it dropped on November 20 last year, and in the most recent update pushed out by the team, it has evolved once again.</p>



<p>The latest update, ‘Expedition’, introduces hundreds of bug fixes and stacks of new additions, improvements, and upgrades across the board, impacting everything from AI and controller handling to UI and player character behavior.</p>







<h2 id="h-stalker-2-patch-1-7-notes">STALKER 2 Patch 1.7 Notes</h2>



<p>STALKER 2 is set to be released on PlayStation 5 on November 20, which is probably why GSC Game World has issued such a massive update to the game in the 1.7 patch.</p>



<p>The team has boosted A-Life, the in-game AI system, to allow for territory control mechanics and faction battles. There’s a new ‘Master’ difficulty rating, as well as an Expedition Mode that offers a new level of immersion. When paired with the new ‘Immersive Mode’ that serves as a replacement for a traditional photo mode, things get seriously engaging.</p>



<p>NPC vision and combat mechanics have had a major overhaul, making stealth more viable, and the game’s UI has been upgraded to make certain stats easier to understand. Skif, the player character, can adopt new ‘conditions’ based on the consumption of certain drinks, and two new anomalies pose threats in the game’s open world.</p>



<p>Controller players have had their aim assist features buffed, DualSense support has been added (of course), and, as I mentioned, <strong>hundreds</strong> of bug fixes have been applied.</p>



<p>Here they are.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Lqgend, who was most recently an active competitor in Halo esports and ascended to win the Halo World Championship in 2024 with Spacestation, has officially merged into the Call of Duty League. He follows a transitional path that <strong>many </strong>other CDL competitors have, but it has been a very long time since a Halo world champion wound up in the top-tier Call of Duty esports space.</p>



<p>One of the most notable competitors to walk that path before Lqgend was Shotzzy, OpTic Texas’ frontman and one of just two esports pro players in history to win a world championship title in <strong>two games</strong>.</p>



<p>Will Lqgend be the third?</p>



<h2 id="h-from-sci-fi-to-sci-fi">From Sci-fi to Sci-fi</h2>



<p>It’s an appropriate time for Lqgend to merge into the Call of Duty League, given that the 2026 season will play out on Black Ops 7, a near-future game with some Halo-like mechanics. It’s a natural transition, and in recent weeks, Lqgend has already proven his Call of Duty talent in scrims and streams.</p>



<p>The 22-year-old French player has enjoyed a rapid rise to fame in the Halo space, but now that Halo Infinite’s esports structure has all but finished, he’s ready to make that all-important move.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The all-new Surge roster was uncovered hours ago, and it contains mostly young and fresh players keen on cutting their teeth in the Call of Duty League this coming season.</p>



<p>Last season, Vancouver Surge had a stunning run, but couldn’t close out a tournament. The team wound up in second place numerous times, including at the Call of Duty League Championship in Canada, falling in second against a dominant OpTic Texas.</p>



<p>Do you think Lqgend will go far in the Call of Duty League? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>T1 Esports has confirmed the departure of Lee ‘Gumayusi’ Min-hyeong, closing the book on a seven-year chapter that saw the team secure three consecutive League of Legends World Championship titles, including the 2025 win that came mere days ago.</p>



<p>While Choi ‘Zeus’ Woo-je’s controversial exit in 2024 left T1 fans stunned, Gumayusi’s decision to depart feels different, given that it has come very early in the off-season and coincides with the expiration of his contract with T1.</p>



<h2 id="h-gumayusi-goes-into-the-open">Gumayusi Goes Into the Open</h2>



<p>T1’s recent announcement regarding Gumayusi’s departure from the roster was loaded with gratitude and respect for all the player has given the organization over the last few years. It was confirmed that the choice to leave the team was ‘his alone.’</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="ko" dir="ltr"><p>𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐲𝐨𝐮, 𝐆𝐮𝐦𝐚𝐲𝐮𝐬𝐢</p><p>'Gumayusi' 이민형 선수가 T1을 떠나 새로운 도전을 시작하게 되었습니다.<br>함께한 시간 동안 들어 올린 트로피와 'Gumayusi' 선수가 남긴 발자취는 팀과 팬들의 마음에 오래도록 빛날 것입니다.<br>T1은 'Gumayusi' 선수의 헌신과 희생, 그리고 눈부신 활약에 대해… <a href="https://t.co/zhiC6v7Qqu">pic.twitter.com/zhiC6v7Qqu</a></p></div>— T1 LoL (@T1LoL) <a href="https://twitter.com/T1LoL/status/1990389461771816974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Despite his MVP-winning performance at Worlds 2025, Gumayusi had a trying 2025 leading up to the monumental win. Earlier this season, the competitor was <strong>benched</strong>, and T1 only just managed to scrape up a qualification to Worlds. The tough year and cracks showing in the foundations might have pushed Gumayusi to seek pastures new.</p>



<p>Speculation is now swirling like wildfire in the League of Legends esports space. Gumayusi’s next home could be under the Hanwha Life banner, or it could be assuming a spot with Gen.G’s roster, changes pending.</p>



<p>In social circles, rumors have already begun circulating about Gumayusi’s replacement. T1 appears to be wasting no time in filling that spot, and suggestions have emerged that Kim ‘Peyz’ Su-hwan could join the squad in place of Gumayusi.</p>



<p>Wherever he winds up, Gumayusi will be an asset to every roster he sits within.</p>



<p>Where do you think Gumayusi is headed? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what your pick would be.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rebecca-heineman-co-founder-of-interplay-has-passed-away.1356505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Yesterday, the unfortunate news broke that Rebecca Heineman, co-founder of Interplay, Logicware, Contraband Entertainment, and Olde Sküül, and the first national United States esports champion, had passed away. Following a battle with aggressive lung cancer, Heineman was recently hospitalized and given days to live.</p>



<p>As a pioneer in the games industry for women in development, video game archival, and lifetime creator of some of the most influential video games, Heineman leaves behind a stunning legacy.</p>







<h2 id="h-generational-run">Generational Run</h2>



<p>In 1980, Rebecca Heineman traveled to Los Angeles to attend an enormous Space Invaders championship event, hosted on the Atari 2600. Not expecting to get anywhere close to the top spot, Heinemen unexpectedly won the entire event, going on to later win a second championship in New York.</p>



<p>That made Heineman the United States’ first national esports champion.</p>



<p>As young as 16, Heineman was diving deep into coding, creating games and software at a time when concepts were just being framed. She co-founded Interplay Productions in 1983, a legendary studio that would go on to create Baldur’s Gate, The Bard’s Tale, Wasteland, and, probably most importantly, <strong>Fallout</strong>.</p>



<p>Heineman was rumored to be one of the last people in possession of the source code for the original Fallout game, released in 1997.</p>



<p>Her career took her through some of the most prolific companies in gaming, from Electronic Arts and Ubisoft to Microsoft and Sony, and she was a stalwart advocate for LGBTQ+ representation in the industry.</p>



<p>In a post on a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebecca-ann-heineman-fight-aggressive-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GoFundMe page</a> set up to help with medical costs, Heineman explained her story:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>How did this start? I noticed when I was at PAX prime that I was out of breath climbing a single flight of stairs. When I got back to Dallas, I went to the emergency room and they found I had 2300ml of fluid in my lung cavity (see photos). They drained another 1600ml a week later. After cat scans, X-rays, and blood tests they finally found that the cancer is in my lungs and liver.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yesterday, a final post was shared, along with a last image:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s time. According to my doctors. All further treatments are pointless. So, please donate so my kids can create a funeral worthy of my keyboard, Pixelbreaker! So I can make a worthy entrance for reuniting with my one true love, Jennell Jaquays.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Heineman, who predominantly went by the nickname ‘Burger’ for two decades, leaves behind five children.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-switch-2-claimed-insider/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-6-could-come-to-switch-2-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1356499/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p> In a recent post on social media, a rumor has once again surfaced that Grand Theft Auto 6 could arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 <strong>after </strong>it has launched on other major platforms. This rumor was partially backed up by NateTheHate, who confirmed hearing that Rockstar was ‘doing tests to bring it to Switch 2’.</p>



<p>If Rockstar Games could optimize the hell out of Grand Theft Auto 6, it could be the biggest game to ever land on a Nintendo platform, alongside the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-gta-6-coming-to-switch-2">Is GTA 6 Coming to Switch 2?</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, user ‘Nash Weedle’ published a claim that GTA 6 is actively in the works for Nintendo Switch 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can CONFIRM that a GTA VI port for SWITCH 2 is in the works. I haven’t said much about it; I had to be cautious until now. I can also comment that: – The game’s delay isn’t due to this version. – It doesn’t seem like it will be a launch title.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nash has a decent track record when it comes to Nintendo leaks and insider tidbits.</p>



<p>NateTheHate, another notable insider, <a href="https://xcancel.com/NateTheHate2/status/1990491837182980193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was summoned</a> to the post to offer his two cents, and he confirmed that Rockstar Games was at least <strong>testing </strong>bringing GTA 6 to Switch 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I said a while ago that R* was doing tests to bring it to Switch 2; but tests don’t always equal release. I know an effort has been made to see if they can bring it to the platform. I don’t know the current state of that effort.</p>

<p>It wouldn’t be the first Grand Theft Auto game to wind up on a Nintendo platform, but it would by far be the biggest. In recent years, the remastered GTA Trilogy landed on Switch, but Grand Theft Auto 5 always eluded the platform.</p>



<p>It’s believed that GTA 6 could <strong>technically </strong>run on the Switch 2, but with some major performance downgrades, such as a lower frame rate, reduced visual fidelity, and tapered resolution. It certainly wouldn’t offer anything close to the performance of a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X, for example.</p>



<p>If GTA 6 comes to Nintendo Switch 2, could you see yourself buying it? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
