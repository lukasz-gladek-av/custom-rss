<p>What’s the end game of any role-playing game? It’s fashion, right? Many of us play RPGs and MMORPGs because we feel a deep connection to a character we built from the ground up. As that character progresses in level, becomes stronger, and finds better gear, a part of ourselves flows into said character. And upon reaching the end game, when you’re all-powerful, what then? Well, it’s time to learn how to transmog gear in <strong>Diablo 4</strong>!</p>



<h2 id="h-travel-to-kyovashad"><strong>Travel to Kyovashad</strong></h2>



<p>You can transmog your gear in Diablo 4 by traveling to the central city of Kyovashad. You’ll find a small inn directly to the north of the waypoint. On the top floor, the only room at the top of the landing that players can enter, is a bed and a cabinet. It’s here that you’ll transmog your equipment.</p>



<p>Once you activate the cabinet, you’ll find various options to customize your character better. You can alter your appearance by adding cosmetic items like the wolf pup backpack cosmetic from the beta or transmog your gear based on available cosmetics.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-earn-transmogs-in-diablo-4"><strong>How to Earn Transmogs in Diablo 4</strong></h2>



<p>If your selection of transmogs feels lackluster, it’s because you’ve been spending all your time raking in the gold instead of salvaging items.</p>



<p>By visiting the local blacksmith in any settlement, you can salvage unwanted gear and, occasionally, receive a new transmog. You can tell when you’ll earn a new cosmetic look based on the hammer-like icon over the item.</p>



<p>Of course, you’ll also be able to buy premium cosmetics through the in-game store. Those, however, can be pretty expensive. As we’ve seen since the Early Access launch, the store features quite the pricing scheme. A single outfit collection can cost up to $25!</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can buy the occasional single piece, like a shield cosmetic, for much less.</p>







<h2 id="h-saving-outfits-for-later-use"><strong>Saving Outfits for Later Use</strong></h2>



<p>Perhaps one of the most annoying aspects of a transmog system in RPGs is having to continually update your appearance after acquiring new gear. For some, it’s easier to wait until max level. Others, however—myself included—like to look like an absolute unit throughout the game.</p>



<p>Thankfully, in the transmog section, you’ll find ‘Ensembles.’ You start with a single ensemble slot and pay gold to unlock additional slots.</p>



<p>This feature allows players to quickly transmog an entire gear set to suit their style and appearance desires with one click.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-co-ceo-open-to-bringing-back-classic-franchises/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-best-single-player-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot released</a> in September, many players loved the nod to the history of Sony and PlayStation classics throughout the game. From tributes to more recent franchises like Horizon and Uncharted to older series like Ape Escape, the game fed into nostalgia in a big way. This has led to questions about whether PlayStation could dip into its backlog of classic franchises for new games in the future.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/26274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a>, PlayStation Co-CEO Herman Hulst was asked about past PlayStation series and the possibility of bringing them back. According to Hulst, it’s not something that’s out of the question for the company.</p>



<p>“The numerous IP holdings we hold are important assets for PlayStation, and as part of our efforts to strengthen our portfolio, we are continuously looking at opportunities to leverage past IPs, as well as developing new franchises,” Hulst said via auto translation.</p>



<p>Hulst added that the company’s goal is to release games made by the best developers whether they are a part of PlayStation Studios or not. He tipped the hat to external studios for the “many successes so far”.</p>



<p>The idea of reviving past franchises has picked up steam across the games industry over the years. Currently, fellow Japanese company Sega <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-outlines-segas-plans-for-new-slate-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is in the middle</a> of a massive revival of classic games like Golden Axe, Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, and more. </p>



<p>Whether PlayStation decides to bring back classic titles down the line obviously remains to be seen. Still, it has to be nice for longtime fans of the studio to see that the door isn’t closed if the right opportunity comes along.</p>



<p>What classic PlayStation franchises do you hope to see get a revival in the future? Let us know down below and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/earn-money-fast-in-red-dead-online-this-holiday-season/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Alongside the countless story missions available—both in the single-player campaign and in Red Dead Online—the multiplayer mode features countless ways to earn decent money fast. You could, for instance, sift through treasure maps, take part in free roam events, earn money by completing daily challenges, take on the trader role, do delivery missions, and overall maximize efficiency to earn quick money to beat the vast majority of players economically.</p>



<h2 id="h-go-treasure-hunting"><strong>Go Treasure Hunting</strong></h2>



<p>If you’d rather not get your hands dirty as a lawless gunslinger in the Wild West or don’t feel like taking part in the often-lengthy story missions of Red Dead Online, then consider locating treasure maps and becoming a defacto treasure hunter instead!</p>



<p>You can earn treasure maps in several ways, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Leveling Up</strong> — Rockstar Games is kind enough to provide the occasional map when you level up. More specifically, every five levels. The maps are in the camp lockbox or at the local post office.</li>



<li><strong>Gang Hideout Challenges </strong>— If you finish off a gang hideout in Red Dead Online, you can earn a map by taking down the boss or via a lock box at the very end of the missions.</li>



<li><strong>Outlaw Passes </strong>— If you pay for one of the Outlaw Passes in Red Dead Online, you’ll occasionally receive maps via the Benefits page.</li>



<li><strong>Posted on Trees</strong> — While exploring the world in free roam, you may stumble upon treasure maps stuck to various trees. The tree in question will appear illuminated, and you can snag the map and find the treasure chests for yourself.</li>



<li><strong>Treasure Hunters</strong> — Scattered about the world of Red Dead Online, you’ll stumble upon other treasure hunters. These NPCs are out there earning money, sometimes very good money, and they’ll sell you a map for a few dollars. Or, you could take it at gunpoint! After all, the in-game economy works at the end of a barrel sometimes.</li>
</ul>



<p>While perhaps not the fastest way to earn money in Red Dead Online, becoming a treasure hunter can be fantastic fun, especially from a role-play perspective.</p>



<h2 id="h-become-a-bounty-hunter"><strong>Become a Bounty Hunter</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most lucrative and enjoyable ways to make money in Red Dead Online is by tackling the bounty hunter role. You can earn decent money in Red Dead Online by taking on bounty-hunting missions posted throughout the massive game world. You’ll track down targets and can even earn weekly bonuses to earn the most money.</p>



<p>It’s simple! Alongside tracking down bounties, including legendary bounties, you can earn higher rewards by looting fallen enemies to make more money faster. Then, you can buy something powerful, like a bolt action rifle. With the said rifle, you can snipe your bounty and their bodyguards from afar before moving in to loot.</p>



<p>Speaking of legendary bounties, numerous story missions are associated with the bounty hunter role in Red Dead Online.</p>



<p>But first, you’ll have to pick up the Bounty Hunter License in Rhodes. The usual cost for the role is 15 Gold Bars, though various promotions may discount the total price in Red Dead Online. Then, you can tackle bounty-hunting missions from various Bounty Posters scattered about the game world, all of which will earn you money, gold, and experience.</p>



<p>Then, if you want to acquire the Prestigious Bounty Hunter License to tackle new ranks and acquire high-level items, and new skills, you’ll have to pay 30 Gold Bars. This license will also unlock Infamous Bounty Targets, which prove more lucrative overall.</p>







<h2 id="h-loot-gang-hideouts"><strong>Loot Gang Hideouts</strong></h2>



<p>There are various rewards for completing gang hideout missions in Red Dead Redemption 2, especially if your goal is to earn huge amounts of cash. Most hideouts are completely manageable solo, meaning you can earn money through bounty hunting, then buy a few powerful weapons and clear hideouts with ease.</p>



<p>Once all is said and done, you can scoop up the cash from the fallen bodies and perhaps even complete a few daily challenges for taking down foes along the way.</p>



<p>What’s the best way to take down a hideout, you ask? Personally, I would recommend utilizing a strong weapon like the repeater. It offers an excellent range advantage along with a high rate of fire to take down numerous foes without putting yourself in harm’s way.</p>



<p>Furthermore, each time you complete a hideout, you’ll earn a treasure map from the camp’s leader. The treasure map will spawn either on the corpse of the fallen commander or via a nearby lockbox, which usually contains some cash, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-play-free-roam-events-and-missions"><strong>Play Free Roam Events and Missions</strong></h2>



<p>As a multiplayer open world, Red Dead Online features countless free-roam events, and the occasional story mission, to help players earn money fast. If making money is the end goal, then why not have fun along the way by taking part in, say, the Showdown Series or horse races event?</p>



<p>You can quick join free-roam events throughout the game to earn money fast in Red Dead Online.</p>



<p>If you’re a new player to Red Dead Online, then the Rockstar-hosted events can be quite lucrative. These often weekly events usually offer double money and gold for Free Roam Events, with rewards handed out for completing specific challenges.</p>



<p>If you play online in a party, then tackling missions and events together is the easiest way to earn money quickly in Red Dead Online. It’s also a lot more enjoyable than tracking and killing NPCs to sell their meager inventories to the traders.</p>



<h2 id="h-take-on-a-player-role"><strong>Take On a Player Role</strong></h2>



<p>Along with the Bounty Hunter role is the Specialist Role, Naturalist Role, and Moonshiner Role. These unique in-game roles in Red Dead Online can help you earn a gold bar now and then, pick up raw materials to sell, acquire a fishing rod to catch lucrative trout and other wildlife, and gain a reasonable amount of cash in the game.</p>



<p>Of the three previously mentioned roles, the Moonshiner Role proves most effective at earning cash in-game. It does take some start-up, however, as you’ll have to complete a story mission or two, along with opening the business and acquiring supplies.</p>



<p>To make the best moonshine, you’ll have to pay upfront. Once you do, that little shack will begin to earn cash fast in Red Dead Online. Along with crafting moonshine, you’ll also take part in Bootlegger Missions, which will reduce the cost of production overall. But in doing so, you will contend with other players. Someone could easily grief your efforts. Or, you could pay out of pocket, though doing so will eat away at your profits.</p>



<p>Furthermore, invest in the upgrades! More potent moonshine will earn you more money per sale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-best-multiplayer-game-of-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Multiplayer games live and die by the experiences they offer — gameplay, features, and the community surrounding them. It takes something truly exceptional to shine in a crowded field. Enter Helldivers 2. Combining fun gameplay, diverse missions, and a thriving community, this game didn’t just check the boxes — it nailed them. That’s why it earned the title of Insider Gaming’s Best Multiplayer Game of 2024.</p>



<p>In a poll held on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forums</a>, the results spoke volumes. Helldivers 2 dominated, capturing 47% of the votes while Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 came in second with just 23%.</p>



<p>So, what makes Helldivers 2 the definitive multiplayer experience of the year?</p>



<h3 id="h-a-game-built-around-unity-and-chaos"><strong>A Game Built Around Unity and Chaos</strong></h3>



<p>At its core, Helldivers 2 thrives on its unparalleled sense of community. The premise is simple yet brilliantly executed: spreading democracy, one battle at a time, alongside thousands of other players working toward the same grand objectives. Whether you’re toppling robot regimes, escorting citizens to safety, or obliterating Bile Titans, teamwork is the name of the game. Success isn’t just rewarding, it’s downright euphoric.</p>



<p>And then there are the moments that keep players coming back for more. Maybe it’s the flawless execution of a mission, where everyone plays their part like a well-oiled machine. Or perhaps it’s the chaotic hilarity of failure like a teammate accidentally triggering a mine that you laid or an unexpected ambush leading to utter mayhem and friendly fire. Every session is a mix of camaraderie and comedy, making even defeat an unforgettable experience.</p>



<p>Unlike many multiplayer titles, Helldivers 2 offers a dynamic, player-driven story. There’s no predetermined ending here as your actions shape the game’s future. Each day’s decisions ripple through the universe, influencing what happens weeks or even months down the line. This evolving narrative keeps the stakes high and ensures there’s always a reason to return to the battlefield with friends.</p>



<h3 id="h-why-helldivers-2-stands-above-the-rest"><strong>Why Helldivers 2 Stands Above the Rest</strong></h3>



<p>What truly sets Helldivers 2 apart is its emphasis on connection. Arrowhead Game Studios nailed the delicate balance of making players feel like a cog in a massive, universe-spanning machine, while still letting them revel in personal and team triumphs. It’s a rare feat that few multiplayer games achieve so seamlessly.</p>



<p>Whether you’re chasing victory or laughing through chaos, Helldivers 2 delivers on all fronts.</p>

<p>Sony’s neverending success is sure to carry on in 2025 with another stacked schedule already planned. Between PS5 exclusives and major third-party releases, it’s going to be a big year, so let me take you through the biggest PlayStation games set to launch in 2025. </p>



<p>As a PS5 owner, I’m always eager to know what’s next. I’ve invested serious time into big-time PS5 titles this year: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-is-releasing-for-pc-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rise-of-the-ronins-ps5-pro-update-is-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rise of the Ronin</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a>, and more. The nature of the games industry means there’s little time to dwell though, and I’m already looking ahead to what 2025 has in store.</p>



<p>2024 was somewhat tame compared to 2023, but if the stars align, I feel 2025’s biggest games could usurp them all.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-ps5-exclusives-coming-in-2025">Biggest PS5 Exclusives Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>As it stands, there are only two major PS5 exclusives with official release dates for 2025. This can change at a moment’s notice, but we’ll go with what we know for now.</p>



<h3 id="h-ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</h3>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is set after the events of Ghost of Tsushima, and Sucker Punch Productions has lofty expectations to meet. The acclaimed studio has brought us Sly Cooper, Infamous, and its newest franchise is the most ambitious of the lot. Ghost of Yōtei is set to grant players more control over the narrative’s twists and turns, and the PS5 is sure to make Feudal Japan look as flawless as possible.</p>



<h3 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What bizarreness awaits this time? Credit to Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure>



<p>The only PS5 exclusive we know for sure destined for 2025 is Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. The sequel is the brainchild of Hideo Kojima again, and the Japanese visionary only knows how to conjure the weird and wonderful. Trailers and gameplay features have revealed many returning characters and various malevolent forces. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-only-30-40-complete-says-hideo-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kojima has indicated a 2025 release</a> is likely, and it could end up being one of PlayStation’s biggest exclusive launches of the year.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-2025-ps5-games">Biggest 2025 PS5 Games</h2>



<h3 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I’m so excited. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>As a lifelong PlayStation main and DOOM lover, I was really scared for a while I’d seen the last of new DOOM software on PS5. However, due to the insistence of id Software, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> releases simultaneously on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. I don’t even need to say much about The Dark Ages itself. It’s DOOM, it’s the over-the-top FPS action we all know and love, and it has a gun that chews up skeleton heads and regurgitates them as destructive bullets. Book the day off for this one.</p>



<h3 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s go, Lucia. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Whereas you need to book a week off for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-about-grand-theft-auto-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft A</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-about-grand-theft-auto-6/">uto 6</a>—if it meets its rumored 2025 launch window. GTA 5 broke countless records—and continues to do so—and has made Rockstar more money than it knows what to do with. GTA 6 is expected to be bigger in every conceivable way, and it can shatter all expectations and records. IF GTA 6 comes out in 2025, it would automatically make the year when one of the best ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</h3>

<p>Like DOOM: The Dark Ages, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle’s future on PS5 was looking bleak. The Microsoft and Bethesda deal put the fate of many titles in doubt, but The Great Circle is getting a PS5 release. Given the title’s glorious reception and its testament to the Indiana Jones name, PS5 owners are in for a treat when it eventually comes to PlayStation 5.</p>



<h3 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Action is going to be intense. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>2025 is one of the biggest years for Ubisoft in recent memory. Its 2024 was nothing short of disastrous and even catastrophic. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-xdefiant-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant is shutting down</a>, and Skull and Bones and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-underperformed-ubisoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws bombed</a>—leading to layoffs. Meaning, the company needs a hit soon. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the first of Ubisoft’s ambitious plan to release at least two new Assassin’s Creed games a new year for the next 10 years. Here’s hoping the famed franchise can bounce back and deliver classic stealthy, sneaky, sleuth-like action!</p>



<h3 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Give me bazillions of guns. Credit to Gearbox Software</figcaption></figure>



<p>The world is ready for a new Borderlands game. I’ve loyally played every single iteration—even the Tales spin-offs—and I’m not going to stop now. It’s true, the series’ staple of gun loot and gameplay is becoming stale, and I don’t think Borderlands 3 managed to replace Handsome Jack—or come close. However, one unfortunately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terminally-ill-fan-played-borderlands-4-and-said-it-was-amazing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ill fan has tried out the latest sequel</a>, and it bodes well for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>. If Gearbox can reinvent the wheel, Borderlands could be back, baby.</p>



<h3 id="h-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I’m a Snake. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>The story of Naked Snake and his rise to the top begins with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. 2025 is expected to welcome the fully-fledged remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and you already know it’s going to be good. Featuring the original voice lines—including the ever-iconic David Hayter—and paying homage to the 2004 story, Delta: Snake Eater means we’re eating good.</p>

<p>One of the defining traits of the ARPG genre is the abundance of loot you’ll acquire by clearing zones. Some of it proves helpful, and most of it’s junk, but a game like Path of Exile 2 also features many extras. You’ll find copious amounts of currency, cards, waystones, essences, and more. It’s too much. Sooner rather than later, you’ll need to buy the best stash tabs in Path of Exile 2 to sort your inventory!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-stash-tabs-to-buy-in-poe2">The Best Stash Tabs to Buy in PoE2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>You don’t have to spend much money to enjoy Path of Exile 2. The occasional cosmetic to help the studio with ongoing development costs certainly helps, and I’m more than guilty of buying cosmetics in PoE. Still, you’ll get your money’s worth more so from the stash tabs. A few to invest in include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Premium Stash Upgrades</strong>: You can upgrade your current stash tabs from standard to premium for relatively cheap, allowing you to customize the tab with various colors, affinities, and names to help you better sort through your copious amounts of gear.</li>



<li><strong>Currency Tabs</strong>: Path of Exile 2 features an insane amount of currencies to sift through, and having a dedicated tab allowing you to sort the general and exotic game currencies will help with crafting and upgrades in the future.</li>



<li><strong>Map Tabs</strong>: The more you play PoE2, the more areas you’ll unlock as part of the extensive end game. To ensure you can sort through all of the zones and maps, a map tab allows you to hold maps and waystones more efficiently.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-where-to-buy-stash-tabs">Where to Buy Stash Tabs</h2>



<p>The best way to buy stash tabs in Path of Exile 2 is from the in-game menu. Pause the game and open the menu, then select Microtransaction Shop. It will bring you to the store tabs, where you can find Stash Tabs as one of the top choices. Enter the category, and here you’ll find the various stashes available to you, all of which will cost money via points.</p>



<p>Before you start spending, however, keep in mind that developer Grinding Gear Games often holds sales, allowing you to buy stash tabs and other microtransactions for significantly cheaper than their going price.</p>
