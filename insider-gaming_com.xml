<p>CES 2026 is here, and Nvidia is set to reveal its latest major update to its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology with DLSS 4.5.</p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-dlss-4-5-to-feature-2nd-gen-transformer-model-and-dynamic-6x-frame-generation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Videocardz</a>, DLSS 4.5 will feature “changes centered on Super Resolution and a new ‘Dynamic Multi Frame Generation’ path”.</p>







<p>With Super Resolution, Nvidia is moving to a “2nd generation transformer” model that will cover more failure cases while using larger datasets. The goal of the updated technology is to offer “better temporal stability, less ghosting, and cleaner anti-aliasing”. Regarding Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, users will see three-to-six times more frames, depending on their settings. </p>



<p>DLSS 4.5 will be available through the Nvidia app, and will have day-one launch support for a number of games. The Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, however, is coming later on. </p>



<p><strong>“Nvidia also says that users will be able to set a target FPS in the app up to the display’s maximum refresh rate, with the feature dynamically adjusting how many frames are generated to meet that goal,”</strong> the report says.</p>







<p>DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution will be available for all GeForce RTX GPUs from the 20 series through 50 and beyond. That said, the new frame generation features are available exclusively for RTX 50 graphics cards, and will be available in Spring 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Sales Estimate Hits 12 MILLION As New Peak Player Record Looms]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/</link>
            <guid>1397356</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is proving to be the gift that keeps on giving. In the last 24 hours, at the time of writing, the game soared to a peak player count of 466,372 users on Steam. That’s ever-so-slightly behind the all-time peak of 481,000 secured just after launch in November 2025.</p>



<p>In a recent data-driven estimation, it was claimed that ARC Raiders might have surpassed <strong>12 million sales</strong> in just over two months, a whopping 53.5% of which have landed on <strong>Steam</strong>. It was also claimed that the game is enjoying a daily active user count of a staggering 3.2 million gamers.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-continues-to-shatter-expectations">ARC Raiders Continues To Shatter Expectations</h2>



<p>When ARC Raiders was released on October 30, no one thought it would reach such lofty heights. It has become known as one of the (if not <strong>the</strong>) best extraction games ever made. The accessibility of the game has introduced millions of extraction novices to a genre previously populated almost exclusively by crushing and challenging titles.</p>



<p>Things have changed, and ARC Raiders is here not just to stay, but to evolve.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a recent post on social media, Alinea Analytics’ Rhys Elliot <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superhys.bsky.social/post/3mbocqp3vzc2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published a graphic</a> showcasing some pretty stellar figures.</p>



<p>First, it was estimated that ARC Raiders now sits at a total sales count of 12 million units across Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox. It has made Embark Studios around $350 million, and it enjoys a daily active user count of 3.2 million players.</p>



<p>It was theorized that a sizeable discount over the festive period, a 20% price reduction, drove additional sales through December. The arrival of Cold Snap, the Flickering Flames event, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-second-expedition-window-confirmed/">first Expedition Project</a>, and a new Raider Deck all combined forces to welcome back stacks of players to the game that <strong>some </strong>thought was starting to slow down.</p>



<p>Far from it, though. Embark Studios has a stunning amount of content in the pipeline and is only just getting started with ARC Raiders. This post-apocalyptic extraction adventure title has legs that stretch on ad infinitum, and it’s easy to see why the developer originally pledged to support the game for ‘years to come’.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Could Be Dead on Arrival as Gamers Fear a Flop is Inbound]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-dead-on-arrival-gamers-fear-a-flop/</link>
            <guid>1397323</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was always going to be tough for Highguard to succeed after the anticlimactic reveal it experienced during December’s The Game Awards ceremony. Many millions of viewers sat through hours of trailers and speeches to see what the ‘final reveal’ would be, and then Highguard graced screens worldwide, falling somewhat flat and leaving gamers disappointed.</p>



<p>Highguard is a new PvP shooter from former Apex Legends and Titanfall developers, and it’s set to drop in just <strong>three weeks</strong>. Aside from the prestigious trailer spot at The Game Awards, almost nothing has been shown, revealed, or discussed regarding the game that many have dubbed ‘Concord 2’.</p>



<p>Is Highguard going to be dead on arrival? The consensus isn’t looking good.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-has-already-drawn-negative-impressions">Highguard Has Already Drawn Negative Impressions</h2>



<p>Highguard took up the most anticipated trailer spot at The Game Awards, but it might have blown back on Wildlight, the game’s developer. It has already been labelled DOA by many owing to an almost complete lack of marketing, a slew of negative first impressions, and a mishandled reveal that didn’t inspire much confidence.</p>



<p>It was unexpected, but ultimately it’s just another live-service hero shooter that was too quickly compared to titles like VALORANT, Overwatch, and yes, Concord, the ill-fated PlayStation shooter that was so bad <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-shut-down-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it killed an entire studio</a>.</p>



<p>Many were left bewildered by the cacophonic trailer that didn’t explain much. It was a visual showcase, revealing players scooting across maps on the backs of horses and bears while wielding swords, magic, and assault rifles, all in a bid to resolve classic first-person shooter arena modes set in destructible maps.</p>



<p>There’s so much going on there, it’s unreal.</p>



<p>That’s one of the first failures of Highguard – it’s trying to be so unique while taking inspiration from many other games, that it has spawned with a twisted, hard-to-place identity that gets lost in the complexity of it all.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Highguard | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9v_z7SmcUUE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-track-record">Track Record</h2>



<p>The hero shooter and live-service FPS space is overcrowded and bursting at the seams with recent failures. Players are arguably fatigued by now, and Highguard’s reveal just failed to convince them that it brings anything <strong>new </strong>to the table, despite Geoff Keighley’s attempt to hype the game up at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>.</p>



<p>Right now, the most glaring red flag is the radio silence and lack of marketing for Highguard. It’s coming out in just <strong>three weeks </strong>and has no major marketing beats, no influencer previews or campaigns lined up, and absolutely no social media momentum.</p>



<p>On Steam, the game boasts <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">just <strong>7,460 followers</strong></a><strong> </strong>at the time of writing, which is a pinprick in the userbase compared to other, similar titles. It echoes Concord, which only had a few thousand before it launched in August 2024.</p>



<p>Even a cursory glance at Highguard on search engine trend platforms reveals nobody is curious about the title.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The official channel uploaded the game’s inaugural trailer on December 12, and it has garnered just 90,000 views at the time of writing. It has an overwhelmingly negative like-to-dislike ratio (89% disliked). IGN managed to get 400,000 views on the same trailer, but that came with a 92% count of dislikes and an alarming number of negative comments:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘ChatGPT, generate a hero shooter with fantasy elements.’</li>



<li>‘This was outdated when the developer first imagined it.’</li>



<li>‘Oh God, I thought people were joking. It actually does look like Concord.’</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HighGuardgame/comments/1q27yex/what_are_you_playign_with_23_days_to_go_for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> fan-created subreddit</a> has just 113 members, and on there, most of the posts concern questions about the lack of updates from the developers. One user wrote, ‘Either the devs are stupid, or this game is getting delayed.’</p>



<p>It might boil down to the backlash being more emotional than anything else, as many have written the game off without a) seeing raw gameplay, and b) without trying it out for a single second. Perception is reality in gaming, but the community is firmly unconvinced, and that might drive prospective users away without giving this free-to-play shooter even a first glance.</p>



<p>Unless Wildlight Entertainment pulls off a rapid and aggressive marketing campaign to compel users to invest, the narrative of Highguard being dead on arrival might be a prophetic one.</p>



<p>Let’s just hope they didn’t spend too much on The Game Awards ad spot.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-platforms-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s/</link>
            <guid>1397320</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long wait for Hytale is rapidly approaching a conclusion, but not every player around the world will be able to dive in immediately due to platform restrictions.</p>



<p>Hytale’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early access release is set for January 13</a>, which marks the start of a long development journey before the full release of the game, and there are plenty of hurdles to overcome.</p>



<p>If you want to know what platforms Hytale can be played on, this Insider Gaming guide has all the details you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-hytale-on-playstation-5">Is Hytale on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Long wait. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Hytale is not available for PlayStation 5 and launches as a PC early access exclusive. However, there are plans to expand to other platforms in the future.</strong></p>



<p>While no specific consoles were mentioned, executive director Patrick ‘Lyall’ Derbic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-skipping-steam-initially-to-avoid-negative-reviews-console-launch-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed plans for a console release</a> in future, but that it would likely come after the early access period has concluded.</p>



<p>There is no indication of how long the early access period for Hytale will last, and it likely depends on the development process and will be subject to change, so expect a pretty long wait before you can play the title on PlayStation.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hytale-on-xbox-series-x-s">Is Hytale on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>No, as Hytale launches as a PC early access exclusive, the game is not available on Xbox Series X|S. However, Hypixel Studios plans to bring the game to other platforms in the future.</strong></p>



<p>Confirmation of plans for a console release came ahead of the start of early access, though it was stated it would not arrive during that period. Instead, Xbox players will have to wait until the full release of Hytale, at the earliest, before the game can be played on the Microsoft consoles.</p>



<p>Given there’s no indication of how long early access will last, the game could skip Xbox Series X|S entirely and instead launch on the next generation of consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hytale-on-nintendo-switch-2">Is Hytale on Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Hytale is not available on Nintendo Switch 2, as it is a PC early access exclusive, and while there are plans to expand to additional platforms, it’s not clear yet whether that includes Nintendo Switch 2.</strong></p>



<p>While plans for a release on other platforms are confirmed, Nintendo Switch 2 is slightly different due to the system requirements, although Nintendo did make huge strides to lessen the gap between the console and its rivals with the Switch 2, as shown by the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 releasing on the platform.</p>



<p>There’s no guarantee Hytale will arrive on the console, however, and a priority would likely be to bring the game to Xbox and PlayStation first, especially if a release on Nintendo Switch 2 requires detailed attention.</p>
