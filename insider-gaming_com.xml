<p>It has been discovered by eagle-eyed Hollow Knight fans that Silksong has been listed on GameStop on Nintendo Switch for just $19.99.  This price has prompted many to believe it’s a ‘simply a placeholder’ because they can’t understand why Team Cherry isn’t charging more for one of the most anticipated games of 2025.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that users have reportedly tried to check out with Hollow Knight: Silksong in their basket at that price, but it ‘does not go through.’</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-silksong-just-19-99">Is Hollow Knight: Silksong Just $19.99?</h2>



<p>In a post that surfaced on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1n3hj7a/gamestop_listed_silksong_with_price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight subreddit</a>, it was revealed that GameStop has priced the upcoming title at just $19.99.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>When Hollow Knight was released way back in 2017, it came with a price tag of just $14.99, but it was a brand-new title from a remarkably small team. It was said that Team Cherry wanted to make the game accessible to more players, which is still a theme prevalent among some small studios today.</p>



<p>The lowest price Hollow Knight dropped to is around $5.99.</p>



<p>On Reddit, users started debating the price, with some being bewildered that Team Cherry isn’t pushing the popularity of the game to charge more. One user wrote, ‘I was ready to pay 40 bucks. Am I crazy? I’m not even as big a fan as you guys, but it’s been the going rate for quality games, especially if they’re a sequel to a well-loved one.’</p>



<p>Many stressed that Team Cherry doesn’t <strong>need </strong>to charge more because ‘they are really rich because of Hollow Knight.’</p>



<p>Another user pointed out how the price is potentially harmful to subscription services:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Wild if true.</p>



<p>At that price there’s basically zero reason to play it on Game Pass unless you already have it. PC Game Pass is $12 a month, Xbox is $15. A few more $ to keep the game for life is a no brainer honestly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong will be released on September 4 after years of painstaking waiting. Are you going to pick it up, whatever the price is? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
