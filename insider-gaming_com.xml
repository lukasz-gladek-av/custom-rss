<p>Chances are, you’ve had the Advance Ticket sitting idly in your Pokémon TCG Pocket inventory for the best part of a year. The mysterious item has left everyone confused, but not anymore. </p>



<p>It’s been 12 months since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pockets-card-dex-registration-update-will-arrive-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> launched. The free-to-play card-collecting and pack-opening feast has provided daily joy, and this is thanks to numerous new card sets, features, and fun battling. Something more Unown than the Pokémon itself is the Advance Ticket—which is about to be redeemed. </p>

<p>A random draw is set to take place very soon, which will see very Pokemon TCG Pocket users with an Advanced Ticket be rewarded for their patience with a set number of Hourglasses.</p>



<p>“We’ll be holding a drawing for players, so please make sure to check your Gifts in-game to see your rewards,” said the official X page.</p>



<p>The random draw will happen at 11 PM PDT on October 29, and the prizes are divided into three different potential outcomes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>1st Prize:</strong> 1,200 Pack Hourglasses for 100 lucky winners.</li>



<li><strong>2nd Prize:</strong> 120 Pack Hourglasses for 10,000 lucky winners.</li>



<li><strong>3rd Prize:</strong> 24 Pack Hourglasses for all players.</li>
</ul>



<p>Whatever the result, if you have the Advanced Ticket in your possession, you are guaranteed to get some Pack Hourglasses. Obviously, we’d all love to be the recipient of 2nd Prize, let alone 1st Prize.</p>



<p>Interestingly, according to the small print, even if you don’t have the Advance Ticket: “The 3rd prize will also be distributed to players with no advance ticket.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The Advance Ticket finally gets used! 🎫 </p><p>We'll be holding a drawing for players, so please make sure to check your Gifts in-game to see your rewards. 🎁 <a href="https://t.co/EU2oV59BQV">pic.twitter.com/EU2oV59BQV</a></p></div>— Pokémon TCG Pocket (@PokemonTCGP) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1983428587479798268?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>If you’ve been waiting to see what the Advance Ticket does, do you feel it’s fair that players without it still get Packs? Or are you disappointed with the Advance Ticket reveal in general?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-battlefield-6-to-play-redsec/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/do-you-need-battlefield-6-to-play-redsec-how-to-play-battlefield-redsec-battle-royale.1337986/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield REDSEC offers several new ways to play Battlefield 6. It arrived after Battlefield 6’s launch, just like Warzone did after MW 2019, and we’re here to let you know if you can play for free, and if so, how.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launched with a campaign and multiplayer. Throw in Portal, and you’ve got yourself a pretty meaty bundle. However, we always knew EA and Battlefield Studios had more ideas up their sleeves. This materialized on October 28 with the launch of Battlefield 6’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-review-br-warzone-coded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REDSEC</a>.</p>



<p>It came bundled with battle royale (no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale-solo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solo mode</a>, though) and the hot new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gauntlet-mode-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gauntlet</a> playlist. Let’s see if you need Battlefield 6 to play it, though. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-redsec-without-owning-battlefield-6">Can You Play REDSEC Without Owning Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty to enjoy for free. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, you can play Battlefield: REDSEC for free without needing to own a full, paid copy of Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>Just like Call of Duty and Warzone, REDSEC is an independent release separate from Battlefield 6. This means you can enjoy a premium Battlefield 6 experience without needing to pay a single penny. If you want to, you can buy Battlefield 6 from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-amazon-us/">Amazon</a>!</p>



<p>All BR modes are free-to-play, as is Gauntlet Mode. We’re sure REDSEC will add new features and modes over the coming months and years as well. Has there ever been a better time to be a Battlefield fan?</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-battlefield-redsec">How To Play Battlefield REDSEC</h2>



<p><strong>To play Battlefield REDSEC, you need to go into your relevant storefront, download it, wait for it to install, and you can jump straight into EA’s free-to-play Battlefield experience.</strong></p>



<p>For an easy breakdown of what to do, check out these simple instructions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, or Steam.</li>



<li>Search for <strong>Battlefield REDSEC</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on the game.</li>



<li>Choose to download <strong>Battlefield REDSEC</strong>.</li>



<li>Wait for the download to complete.</li>



<li>Once it’s ready, you can now boot up REDSEC and play it for free!</li>
</ol>



<p>There was speculation that REDSEC was going to be free, but only for players who already own Battlefield 6—technically making it not free. However, this is a smart decision on EA’s part and should do a lot to help both Battlefield 6 and REDSEC have a long battery life.</p>



<p>Let us know if you’ve had a chance to play REDSEC yet. Can you not get enough of Gauntlet? Or is the allure of battle royale still proving to be too much?

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is in the midst of its one-year anniversary celebrations, and a new set is right around the corner in Mega Rising, for which we have all the release date and start time details.</p>



<p>New sets in Pokémon TCG Pocket have been a regular occurrence since the title first released, but Mega Rising is a big moment for the title as it introduces the mechanic of Mega Evolution, adding further complexity to deck building to consider.</p>



<p>For all the release details of the Mega Rising set, check out our guide below.</p>

<p>The launch of the set marks the start of the second year of Pokémon TCG Pocket with the start of ‘B’ sets, though it’s not clear at this stage exactly how that will shake up the meta and what restrictions, if any, will be in place for cards.</p>



<p>There’s still time to get your hands on Pack Hourglasses ahead of the release of the set, and it’s worth taking every opportunity you can ahead of the release.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-b1-mega-rising-start-times">Pokémon TCG Pocket B1 Mega Rising Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>The B1 Mega Rising set will be available in the game from 11 PM PT on October 29, with a release on October 30 for the majority of the world.</strong></p>

<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-b1-mega-rising-confirmed-cards-list">Pokémon TCG Pocket B1 Mega Rising Confirmed Cards List</h2>



<p><strong>The Mega Rising set in Pokémon TCG Pocket</strong> <strong>is headlined by the introduction of Mega Evolutions, following the release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Mega Evolutions returning in the physical TCG.</strong></p>



<p>Ahead of release, the full set list has been <a href="https://www.serebii.net/tcgpocket/megarising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">detailed by Serebii</a>, featuring Mega Pinsir, Mega Blaziken, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Altaria amongst the cards.
