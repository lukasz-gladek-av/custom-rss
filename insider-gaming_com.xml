<p>In a recent report published by Newzoo, the full-year game performance metrics for 2025 were revealed. The graphs and numbers told a telling tale about the state of play across both console and PC markets, revealing the biggest movers and shakers, and by contrast, the games that fell out of fortune with players worldwide last year.</p>



<p>Two slides in particular, one addressing the biggest money-makers on console and the other answering the same question on PC, offered a sort of axiomatic revelation. Year after year, console gamers can’t escape their sports games.</p>







<h2 id="h-sports-games-don-t-make-money-on-pc">Sports Games Don’t Make Money on PC</h2>



<p>Newzoo’s newest annual report breaks down the numbers across PC and console for a 12-month spread, uncovering the best-selling games, the titles with the highest revenue, and those with the most sizeable MAU counts.</p>



<p>On the PC front, the top ten games by <strong>revenue</strong> (in six major markets) were:</p>



<ol>
<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Schedule 1</li>



<li>Monster Hunter: Wilds</li>



<li>Borderlands 4</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>R.E.P.O.</li>



<li>Oblivion Remastered</li>



<li>Expedition 33</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li>
</ol>



<p>By contrast, the console market seemed laser-focused on <strong>sports games</strong> in 2025:</p>



<ol>
<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>NBA 2K26</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Madden NFL 26</li>



<li>MLB The Show 25</li>



<li>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</li>



<li>EA Sports College Football 26</li>



<li>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</li>



<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>ARC Raiders</li>
</ol>



<p>Those lists indicate that 50% of the best-selling games on console platforms in 2025 were <strong>all </strong>annual sports releases. These are the relatively safe, simple purchases that players often make out of habit rather than anything else. As the report indicates, this is suggestive of PC players being more ‘experimental’ in their gaming habits.</p>



<p>You get a lot of early access titles launching on PC, for instance. It gives players a more diverse repository to pull from, even if a lot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/keeping-game-early-access-nine-months-kill-it-data/">those games fall flat</a> because they remain in that state for too long.</p>



<p>The MAU stakes on console are drastically different, though. At the top of the table sits Fortnite, followed by Call of Duty, then GTA 5, Roblox, and Minecraft. You don’t get into a sports title until the sixth spot on the list, and even then, it’s EA Sports FC 25, which is followed swiftly enough by EA Sports FC 26.</p>



<p>Rocket League is arguably a sports title, and that sits in seventh place for console players, but it’s not an annual release.</p>



<p>The PC MAU trend is pretty similar to console. The number-one spot is secured by Counter-Strike 2, but Minecraft, Roblox, and Fortnite are all in the top five. Call of Duty finds a place in the top ten as well, but the other games are made up mostly of those that are unique to PC, like League of Legends and Dota 2.</p>



<p>In 2024, Newzoo revealed that PC gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-gaming-gained-more-players-than-console-in-2024/">gained <strong>more new players</strong></a><strong> </strong>than console platforms, which was an eye-opener. It was also revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/58-of-pc-gaming-revenue-came-from-microtransactions-in-2024/">58% of PC gaming revenue</a> came from <strong>microtransactions</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard’s 5v5 Raid Mode Has Been Added Permanently]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When Highguard was released last week, one of the biggest points of contention concerned the game’s player structure. Each ‘raid’ in the game could accommodate just six players, three on each team. It made the game feel empty and promoted awkward pacing, and it was mere days before Wildlight, the game’s developer, introduced a 5v5 mode.</p>



<p>It was supposed to be a temporary thing to test the waters, but Wildlight has just confirmed that 5v5 is ‘here to stay’ after a successful trial period.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-5v5-do-anything-to-save-highguard">Will 5v5 Do Anything to Save Highguard?</h2>



<p>Highguard’s player count continues to drop, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-update-target-games-biggest-gripe/">the sentiments</a> surrounding the game are in a critical state. Any viewership has been almost eradicated, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-roadmap-reveals-year-of-content/">the year-long roadmap</a> has done little to instill a sense of confidence in those who would call themselves fans.</p>



<p>Last week, Highguard launched after several weeks of radio silence following the game’s grand reveal at The Game Awards. It was an unveiling marred by negativity, and the game’s full release did nothing to abate the disappointment of gamers everywhere.</p>



<p>When it was discovered that this ambitious first-person shooter would accommodate just six players per match, prospective fans found themselves questioning the depth of their matches.</p>



<p>Then, along came Wildlight Entertainment, with an idea to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-adds-5v5-raid-playable-now/">trial a 5v5 mode</a>.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Wildlight confirmed the trial was a success:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’ve been asking, and we’re happy to share—5v5 Raid Mode is here to stay!</p>



<p>We appreciate everyone hopping in over the weekend to give the mode a try. We saw a fairly even split between 3v3 and 5v5, which helped inform our decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the comments under the post, the game’s fans put a positive spin on the change, suggesting it would cater to the more casual players and attract a wider audience. That hasn’t been reflected in the game’s player count, though.</p>
