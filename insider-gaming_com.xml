<p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve loved strategy games. It started as real-time strategy matches against AI opponents in titles like Age of Empires, Age of Mythology, and Company of Heroes. I quickly found myself drawn to base-building and colony sim titles for the sense of progression and expansion they offer, though, and few compare to RimWorld. But then, there’s also Oxygen Not Included. They’re both exceptional, both offering countless hundreds or, in some cases, thousands of hours of gameplay. Which do you choose? Why not both? You can score two of the best colony sim games for under $35 with the new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/46465/Terraform_Titans_Duo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Terraform Titans Duo</a> bundle on Steam!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-rimworld">What is RimWorld?</h2>



<p>RimWorld is often considered the quintessential colony sim game, following in the footsteps of titles like Dwarf Fortress but offering a unique spin on the story generation mechanics. You’ll take control of a science fiction-fueled colony full of intelligent pawns that must contend with unique enemies, flora, fauna, psychology, climate, interpersonal relationships, and more.</p>



<p>After spending 1,000 hours playing the game, I can tell you that even the base version is worth every penny. But with the expansions and countless mods, you’ll easily score hundreds of hours from RimWorld if it’s your type of game.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-oxygen-not-included">What is Oxygen Not Included?</h2>



<p>Also in the bundle, we have Oxygen Not Included. It’s another sci-fi colony sim game that focuses on the dynamic crew as they overcome obstacles, like alien lifeforms while harnessing the power of the asteroid they’re currently stranded on. For instance, you must consider logistics, like piping water and waste to and from the colony, to ensure no one falls ill. It’s complex and compelling in equal measures.</p>



<p>With ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’ reviews, Oxygen Not Included is a grand time for any colony sim or base-building game fan!</p>



<h2 id="h-score-them-both">Score Them Both!</h2>



<p>With this partnership between Ludeon Studios and Klei Entertainment, you can currently score both colony sim games for less than $35. Oxygen Not Included is on sale, dropping the price of the bundle to its current total. You really cannot pass this one up!</p>



<p>Let us know in the comments below if you grab the bundle! Don’t forget to stop by and share screenshots of your colony in our General Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Did you know it can cost up to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/it-can-cost-up-to-500000-for-a-spot-on-opening-night-live-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$500,000 for a spot on Opening Night Live 2025</a>? That’s an insane price to pay, and many indie developers can’t afford such extreme advertising costs!</p>

<p>Ubisoft has provided players with new stealth gameplay details for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The main focus of the new gameplay was Naoe, the agile shinobi. However, some skills are applicable to Yasuke the Samurai, too.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-new-stealth-features">Assassin’s Creed Shadows New Stealth Features</h2>



<h3 id="h-observe-and-eagle-vision">Observe and Eagle Vision</h3>



<p>With the removal of the eagle companion, players in Assassin’s Creed Shadows will have to rely on two different scouting mechanics. The first is Observe, allowing players to identify targets, tag and monitor enemies, and highlight lootable stashes, collectables, and quest objectives. Players can also examine nearby locations through a Synch Point while using the Observe skill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next is Eagle Vision, and this Assassin’s Creed Stealth mechanic identifies enemy positions and lets you tag them behind walls and other objects. Eagle Vision will also isolate any relevant sounds the enemies make and let you find hiding spots. Naoe can use these skills separately and concurrently to survey the area better.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-hiding-crouching-and-going-prone">Hiding, Crouching and Going Prone</h3>



<p>The next Assassin’s Creed Shadows Stealth Features are movement mechanics, which include hiding in shadows, crouching, and going prone. During the nighttime, players will find different hiding pots covered in shadows—the best way to ambush their enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crouching is an effective movement mechanic for indoors. If players crouch, then the sound they make decreases drastically. Also, their visibility is much lower when compared to standing. Crouching will also reduce the chance of you walking into any noisy objects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next Assassin’s Creed Shadows stealth mechanic is for both Yasuke and Naoe. Players can be prone to reducing their visibility further when on rooftops, on the ground, or even underwater. When using prone as Naoe, players will be able to roll side to side or front to back by pressing the dodge buttons. There are also certain locations that you can crawl under by using prone.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-stealth-tools">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Stealth Tools</h3>



<p>As a stealthy shinobi in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Naoe uses an array of tools to move around as sneakily as possible. Naoe has four primary tools: Smoke Bomb, Shinobi Bells, Kunai and Shuriken. The first two are great for escaping or distracting enemies, while the others are better for damaging or stunning them.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-return-of-double-assassinations-nbsp">Return of Double Assassinations&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players can go on the ultimate stealth runs, thanks to the return of Double Assassinations. All you need to do is have Tanto as your primary weapon and unlock the dedicated skill to perform the Double Assassination with the Hidden Blade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also a non-lethal stealth mechanic, which is grabbing. Players can silently assassinate their enemies by grabbing them and pulling them into the shadows or bushes to get rid of them. Moreover, Naoe is the “smallest Assassin to date”, so she will be able to squeeze through tiny wall cracks and hide inside small storage spaces and boxes to surprise her enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Grab Mechanic" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5y4HB6S_Mew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-enemy-reactions">Enemy Reactions</h3>



<p>While developing Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ stealth mechanics, the developers also focused on enemy tactics. Servants are a new non-lethal enemy that will be introduced in this game. They cannot harm you but can raise alarms to reveal your location to other enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enemies will be more suspicious in the game once you have been detected. If you hide after being spotted, they will start looking for you in pairs and be more on guard moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another unique enemy in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a Samurai. They cannot be tackled as you would with a regular enemy, as they are much more skilled. For example, players can’t assassinate them with a smoke bomb, and Samurai are likelier to deny their assassinations. Moreover, Samurais will also slice bushes when searching for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassination Denial is also a new system, where an enemy is denoted with a white colour if they are an instant kill, a yellow colour if you need to deal some damage, and a red colour if the enemy will completely deny your assassination attempt.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-yasuke-s-stealth-features">Yasuke’s Stealth Features</h3>



<p>Last but not least are Yasuke’s stealth mechanics in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Yasuke is a samurai, a character that players should pick for a more aggressive approach. However, players can be stealthy if they use their bow and start picking enemies off from a distance. Yasuke can get behind enemies and deal swift finishing blows with his melee weapons.&nbsp;</p>
