<p>Pokémon Day is right around the corner, and a flood of news is expected to mark the 30th anniversary of the franchise, so there’s a long line of things on our wishlist.</p>



<p>Taking place on February 27, 30 years since the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Red and Green in Japan, a special Pokémon Day Presents showcase is being aired. While the precise contents are unknown, there’s plenty that could be on the agenda.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has curated a wishlist of the biggest things we want to see announced on Pokémon Day, which you can see below.</p>







<h2 id="h-7-things-we-want-to-see-at-pokemon-day-2026">7 Things We Want to See at Pokémon Day 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-gen-10-teaser">Gen 10 Teaser</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Successor. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Undoubtedly, the biggest drop that could be revealed on Pokémon Day is the full reveal, or first teaser, for the 10th generation of the franchise.</p>



<p>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were initially released in November 2022, so it’s already been longer than the standard three-year cycle between Pokémon generations. As such, there is a huge expectation that Gen 10 will be officially teased or revealed during Pokémon Day.</p>



<p>Even a short teaser would set the internet alight, and a likely release window of Fall 2026 means there’s still ample time for a detailed reveal later this year.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokopia-dlc">Pokopia DLC</h3>



<p>Pokopia is the newest game released by Pokémon, landing on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-countdown-exact-release-date-start-times/" id="177262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 5</a>, and there’s plenty to be excited about as the franchise delves into the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/life-simulation/" id="2994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-simulation</a> genre for the first time.</p>



<p>There has already been a host of reveals for Pokopia, but the game is surely set to appear in the presentation in some capacity. It could well be just more details of what to expect, but there could be a reveal of DLC or a post-launch update.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview/" id="176556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia Hands-On Preview</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Pokopia has the potential to launch an entirely new series of games for Pokémon, so there is plenty that could shine.</p>



<h3 id="h-johto-love">Johto Love</h3>



<p>Last year marked the 25th anniversary of Pokémon Gold and Silver, but the anniversary was largely overlooked, apart from Chikorita and Totodile being starter choices in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a-2/" id="3627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>



<p>A relaunch of Heart Gold and Soul Silver would be the dream, but is unlikely to follow on from the Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green announcements; there are other options, however. For the past few years, persistent speculation has surrounded a potential sequel to Pokémon Let’s Go.</p>



<p>Whether it’s a new game or a big feature in an existing game, Johto deserves some love and shouldn’t be forgotten.</p>



<h3 id="h-black-white-remake">Black/White Remake</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Return? Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Pokémon remake schedule was hit hard by the disappointment of Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, but remakes haven’t been wiped from the schedule entirely.</p>



<p>Gen 5 is the next in line for a remake, and there is a chance that a teaser for remakes of Black and White appear. Though it would be a surprise to see the titles squeezed in before Gen 10 releases, it’s not entirely out of the question.</p>



<p>Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl were released in November 2021, just two months before the drop of Pokémon Legends: Arceus and a year before Scarlet and Violet, so there’s certainly room in the schedule.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-spin-off-game">New Spin-Off Game</h3>



<p>Pokémon already has one spin-off title on the schedule with Pokopia, but there could be more to appear before Gen 10, and there are some options.</p>



<p>Pokémon Champions’ release date announcement is surely inevitable, with the World Championships in August being competed on the title, but there could be something else. Over the years, the likes of Pokémon Snap have appeared, and there’s a long line of fan favourites that could be revived.</p>

</ul>



<p>It might be too early for a new Mystery Dungeon title, but I’m not giving up hope just yet.</p>



<h3 id="h-30th-anniversary-tcg-set">30th Anniversary TCG Set</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Big reveals. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>A 30th anniversary TCG set is a certainty this year and the first reveal should take place on Pokémon Day. As usual, expect it to be released in Japan first, before then seeing an international year.</p>



<p>The Japanese TCG schedule is now set until June, with Abyss Eye in May and Storm Emeralda in July, which leaves the perfect spot for an anniversary release. Trademarks for Celebration Collection have already been uncovered, and a full reveal on Pokémon Day makes too much sense.</p>



<h3 id="h-netflix-live-action-news">Netflix Live Action News</h3>



<p>A live-action Netflix series has been reported for years, first emerging in 2021, and it’s surely time for the first teaser or official confirmation to be shown.</p>



<p>Pokémon has expanded much deeper into TV series in recent years, with the likes of Pokémon Concierge released, and the live-action series would be an instant hint for fans. Partnering with Netflix is also a smart move, opening the doors to an entirely new audience.</p>



<p>There are murmurs of a Detective Pikachu sequel, which would be great, but a live-action Netflix series would certainly be better.</p>

<p>Pokémon collecting will never die from now until forever, whether it’s cards, games, movies, or novelty Gengar slippers. Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green are coming back, but there are questions over physical copies and how much these modern-day remakes will cost.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-release-for-switch-next-week/" id="178067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green</a> are re-releasing in 2026, and it’s a good year to be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> fan—to be fair, it normally is. </p>



<p>If you’re already wishlisting either game, you need to know if they’re digital-only and how many Nuggets you need to sell to buy them.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-buy-a-pokemon-fire-red-or-pokemon-leaf-green-physical-copy">Can You Buy A Pokémon Fire Red or Pokémon Leaf Green Physical Copy?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>At launch, the 2026 Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green games will be available online-only as a Nintendo eShop digital purchase.</strong></p>



<p>You can’t have it all, sadly. If you love collecting Pokémon games, then (for now at least) Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green will need to be in your intangible collection, as neither <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a> nor The Pokémon Company has revealed a physical edition.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-all-differences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All Differences Between Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green</a></li>
</ul>



<p>They were both on Game Boy Advance cartridges when they came out in 2004—we feel your pain if you’re a 90s kid. This time around, the purchase is tied to a digital download with no physical media.</p>



<p>The official Pokémon site had this to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“These classic remakes of&nbsp;Pokémon Red&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pokémon Green&nbsp;will be available to download from&nbsp;Nintendo eShop&nbsp;after the conclusion of the Pokémon Presents.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nintendo is exceptional when it comes to business, which is why you shouldn’t rule out a physical edition. Many publishers opt to go digital first and then release a physical copy later on. That could easily be the case for Pokémon Fire Red or Pokémon Leaf Green, and there might come a time when you can catch ’em all AND a case!</p>



<p>As always, Insider Gaming will update you if this proves to be the…case.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-does-pokemon-fire-red-amp-pokemon-leaf-green-cost">How Much Does Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green Cost?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green cost $19.99 or £16.99 each, and there’s currently no bundle to buy them together, or promotion to reduce the price.</strong></p>



<p>As we said, Nintendo is a smart business company, and people are going to flock to these releases like Pidgeys to a Caterpie, regardless of the $20 price tag.</p>

</ul>



<p>Should both games have been released as freebies for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers as part of the Game Boy Advance library offering? That’s a debate for another day, and it’s sure to go on.</p>



<p>Is this a fair price for what is an updated port? Should it have been included with Nintendo Switch Online?

<h2 id="block-e2995432-719e-4ed6-8fad-a1db37670203">How To Play Wordle</h2>



<p id="block-da980997-0420-4527-946e-b66c49bf3d07">Wordle is a simple but addictive word puzzle. Each day, players have to guess a five-letter word answer in no more than six attempts. After each guess:</p>



<ul id="block-d0bea02d-4b9f-4991-b9db-3b35778ff3bf">
<li>Green letters are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li>Yellow letters are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>



<li>Gray letters are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>



<p id="block-5e597b53-af1c-4c06-a00c-6c5a4694e9e0">The goal is to guess the word in as few tries as possible. Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a popular online trend.</p>

<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>Pokémon fans have plenty to get excited about in 2026 as the franchise celebrates its 30th anniversary, and now is the time to pre-order Pokopia if you haven’t already.</p>



<p>Pokopia is a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/life-simulation/" id="2994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-simulation</a> game developed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/koei-tecmo/" id="1193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Koei Tecmo</a>, putting players in control of a Ditto in a mysterious world where humans have disappeared. </p>

<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia is priced at $69.99, with the price the same for both the digital and the physical version. </strong></p>



<p>However, the physical version of Pokopia does not include much physical content, and instead provides a virtual Game Card. Rather than a download code, which cannot be re-used, the Key Card can be resold or shared with friends or family.</p>

</ul>



<p>There are no special editions of Pokopia offering extra incentives or paid-for pre-order bonuses. However, it remains to be seen whether Pokopia will have paid-for DLC releasing in the future.</p>



<p>Both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a-2/" id="3627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> and Scarlet &amp; Violet had post-launch DLC, which is becoming more commonplace for the Pokémon franchise, so there is every chance Pokopia follows suit.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-pokemon-pokopia-pre-order-bonuses">All Pokémon Pokopia Pre-Order Bonuses</h2>



<p><strong>There are several pre-order bonuses available for Pokopia, which vary based on where you purchase the game from.</strong></p>



<p>Bonuses range from physical rewards, like a Ditto Sitting Cuties plush or a wooden tray, to in-game rewards, including a Ditto rug and Flat Leaf Plant Decoration. In-game rewards are not exclusive and can be earned through gameplay progression.</p>
