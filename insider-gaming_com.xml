<p>Final Fantasy 14 is gearing up for the colossal 7.2 update titled Seekers of Eternity. Square Enix isn’t content to sit around and leave us all wondering though. The developer has already showcased the preliminary patch notes revealing much of what’s to come in the update.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-director-leaves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square Enix</a> can release as many remakes and new mainline FF entries as it wants. However, none of them are likely to have as great an impact as Final Fantasy 14 Online continues to have. With tens of millions of subscribers coming back each month, FF14 Online is where it’s at—and new DLC expansions help.</p>



<p>Every so often a giant update comes along with a content pile so big it makes the content of Santa’s sleigh seem minimal. The Seekers of Eternity 7.2 update is the latest and great patch for Final Fantasy 14, so let’s check it out.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-14-update-7-2-release-date">Final Fantasy 14 Update 7.2 Release Date</h2>



<p><strong>March 25 is when the Seekers of Eternity update goes live in Final Fantasy 14.</strong></p>



<p>There’s also a cinematic trailer to get you ready for the incoming content and patch notes. You can check it out here.</p>

<h3 id="h-battle-system-bolstered">Battle System Bolstered</h3>



<p>We know there’s a new dungeon to explore called the Underkeep. Plus, Season 8 of Final Fantasy 14’s PvP is set to get underway, and many other changes and tweaks have been made to combat.</p>



<h3 id="h-greater-graphics">Greater Graphics</h3>



<p>Square Enix has made a serious graphical improvement to lots of the game’s weapons and accessories, improved the resolution for vegetation and environmental objects, and adjusted lighting and shadows to appear more realistically.</p>

<p>After a hugely successful release, it seems several studios are already set to battle it out to claim the rights to a full-length Split Fiction movie—bringing the dramatic journey of Mio and Zoe to life.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-trophy-and-achievement-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> had the tough job of following up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a>—2021’s Game of the Year. I’d argue that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-reaches-major-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">milestone of two million copies sold in just one week</a> has put this doubt to rest. Josef Fares and his team have done it again, and it looks like another triumphant statement that cooperative multiplayer sells.</p>



<p>Now, it’s time to see if the medium is as effective on the big screen. A Split Fiction movie is heavily rumored—barely two weeks removed from its debut—and it looks promising.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-movie-could-make-a-great-co-op-caper">Split Fiction Movie Could Make A Great Co-op Caper</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, the 2025 Game Developers Conference has birthed Split Fiction movie talk. Story Kitchen is the company potentially “<strong>Putting together the film’s cast, writers and director into a package as offers for the rights keep coming in from multiple top Hollywood studios.</strong>“</p>



<p>Again, the rumor and chatter come directly from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gdc-awards-balatro-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDC 2025</a>, so it remains to be seen if the talk will continue once the event has concluded. Hopefully, a Split Fiction movie has better luck than the It Takes Two one. A movie for the previous co-op title was given the go-ahead, but it apparently remains on hold for now.</p>



<p>If we do get a Split Fiction movie, will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-split-fiction-voice-actors-revealed-who-voices-zoe-mio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoe and Mio’s voice actors</a> get to reprise their roles? Only time will tell. For now, we’ll continue to lap up every second of Split Fiction. After all, new secrets keep being discovered such as the now-infamous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-split-fiction-laser-hell-secret-level/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laser Hell Secret Hell</a> featuring a guest appearance from director Josef Fares himself!</p>
