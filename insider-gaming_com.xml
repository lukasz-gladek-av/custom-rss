<p>Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition drops digitally tomorrow on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>In 1995, Rayman launched on the original Sony PlayStation, and more than three decades later, the original game is returning to PlayStation. During the Sony PlayStation State of Play presentation, it was announced that a special 30th Anniversary Edition of Rayman will launch digitally on February 13, just one day away from this writing. Physical editions will be available later in the year.</p>



<p>This will be a five-game collection, featuring five versions of the original game. The Nintendo Game Boy version was shown. The game was also originally released on PC, Sega Saturn, and the Atari Jaguar. There will also be a long-lost playable prototype and an interactive documentary featuring interviews and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-on-rayman-s-30th-anniversary-edition">More on Rayman’s 30th Anniversary Edition</h2>



<p>Tom Henderson of Insider Gaming recently reported that Ubisoft is developing two new Rayman projects. </p>



<p>One of these projects, codenamed “Steamboat,” is thought to be a remake of Rayman Legends. This project was believed to be the one under the codename “Iceman.”</p>







<p>The game was previously rated in Australia as well. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-rated-in-australia-for-ps5-and-switch/" id="171818">here</a>.</p>

<p>Beast of Reincarnation, the highly anticipated post-apocalyptic Soulslike coming from Game Freak, has received a release date during the State of Play showcase. The game, which is a far cry from Game Freak’s Pokémon days, takes players and plunges them into a ruined Japan thousands of years in the future.</p>



<p>It has already been compared to games like Sekiro, Stellar Blade, and Elden Ring, but it has a focus on nature, mythical creatures, and an ever-changing, evolving world.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-beast-of-reincarnation-coming-out">When is Beast of Reincarnation Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Thanks to the new State of Play showcase broadcast on February 12, we know that Beast of Reincarnation is coming on August 4, 2026. The game had carried a 2026 release window since being revealed in 2025, but now we’ve got a much firmer date locked in.</p>



<p>While it was PlayStation that uncovered the release date, it was confirmed a short while ago that Beast of Reincarnation will be playable on Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer that was shared during State of Play to announce the game’s release date:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>In Beast of Reincarnation, you assume control of Emma, a warrior infected with the same blight that has brought down the planet, but she alone can change the course of what’s unravelling to save humanity and its fragments. She’s joined by Koo, a powerful canine companion with his own affliction.</p>



<p>As you explore Beast of Reincarnation, you’ll uncover a sprawling world fraught with dangers, but you’ll have the ability to shape <br>Emma and Koo through RPG mechanics and varied approaches.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Edmund McMillen is one of the creators behind the new cat-breeding roguelike game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mewgenics/" id="170919">Mewgenics</a>. The game has been a tremendous success in its first few days. Now, McMillen is addressing an issue affecting some players, some problematic personalities that have voiced some of the in-game cats.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/edmund-mcmillen-on-assembling-mewgenics-meow-cameo-list-the-inclusion-of-people-with-clashing-ideologies-felt-appropriate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">McMillen, in a statement to Rock Paper Shotgun, </a>explained that in some cases, the names included were listed years ago, such as Ethan and Hila Klein from h3h3, who have recently received criticism for their views on the conflict between Israel and Palestine.</p>



<p>McMillen noted that he wanted the game to feature iconic voices from most of his time online. He also argued that “The inclusion of Ethan and Hila was counterbalanced by iDubbbz and Anisa.” iDubbbz is another long-time internet personality who was once friendly with h3h3 but has since called them out for their views.</p>







<h2 id="h-mcmillen-says-inclusion-of-those-with-differing-ideologies-felt-appropriate-for-mewgenics">McMillen Says Inclusion of Those With Differing Ideologies Felt Appropriate for Mewgenics</h2>



<p>Edmund McMillen told Rock Paper Shotgun that he contacted both parties to let them know about the other’s inclusion and said everyone was “very adult about it.”</p>



<p>Furthermore, he believes it was appropriate to have people with clashing ideologies in the game, saying that if the game simply included people with whom he shared the same opinions, he’d probably be the only one meowing in the game.</p>



<p>“I understand we live in a time where a meow from someone who has different beliefs as you is scary and frustrating, confusing and controversial…” McMillen continued, “But it felt interesting, so I decided to explore it.”</p>







<p>Still, the game has received tremendous critical acclaim, and it’s currently sitting at 89 on Metacritic with an overall user score of 8.1</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Laid Off Highguard Tech Artist Reflects on Game’s Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/laid-off-highguard-tech-artist-reflects-on-games-launch/</link>
            <guid>1434130</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Josh Sobel, a tech artist who worked on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/highguard/" id="3394">Highguard</a>, is reflecting on the highs and lows of the game’s development and launch in the wake of mass layoffs at Wildlight Entertainment.</p>



<p>Josh Sobel was one of the individuals laid off by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wildlight-entertainment/" id="3393">Wildlight </a>on February 11. After the announcement, he shared a lengthy post on Twitter reflecting on his experience working on the game. He mentioned that he had personally worked on the project for two and a half years.</p>







<p>His Twitter statement says that before the game’s reveal at the Game Awards in 2025, the team was receiving positive feedback. In cases of negative feedback, it was always constructive criticism. After the trailer dropped, Sobel says it was “downhill from there.”</p>



<p>“Even if Highguard had a rocky launch, our independent, self-published, dev-led studio full of passionate people just trying to make a fun game, with zero AI, and zero corporate oversight…deserved better than this.” </p>



<p>He then wished the remaining staff members luck and said he hopes the game can continue because he still believes in the project.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-wildlight-previously-stated-a-core-team-will-continue-to-work-on-highguard">Wildlight Previously Stated A Core Team Will Continue to Work on Highguard</h2>



<p>Confirming the news of layoffs in a social media post on February 11, Wildlight stated that a core group of developers would remain on staff to continue “innovating and supporting the game.” This came after a senior designer revealed on LinkedIn that he had been let go, along with most of the team.</p>







<p>Unfortunately, Layoffs continue to be a trend in the gaming space. Riot Games recently issued a statement very similar to theirs about their decision to downsize the team working on 2XKO. Read that full statement <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">here</a>.</p>
