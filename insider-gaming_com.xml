<p>Use these active Roblox Fireworks Playground monthly redeem codes to get your hands on free rewards like coins and more.</p>



<p>Fireworks Playground is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-walk-or-die-codes/">Roblox</a> experience that drops players into the middle of a vibrant world of pyrotechnics and explosive celebrations. Players can immediately begin lighting various fireworks upon launch, and from there, progress through the game to unlock the best pyrotechnic displays available. With over 2,163 different fireworks to collect and launch, ranging from simple firecrackers to elaborate multi-shot aerial displays, pyrotechnic enthusiasts will have a fantastic time playing Fireworks Playground.</p>



<p>Having been released in beta during 2023, Fireworks Playground has gradually gained traction over the course of the following years and now boasts a dedicated player base with over 360,000 members. The game, developed by Pseudo Studio (specifically by creators PseudoDaemon and YuckMaster), offers a unique experience where players can enjoy realistic firework sounds and visuals year-round without annoying their neighbors.</p>







<p>Although simply lighting fireworks is enough for players to earn coins to unlock more spectacular displays, using redeem codes to get some extra rewards is never a bad idea.</p>

<p>Redeeming Fireworks Playground codes is a fairly straightforward matter, and they have made sure that even newer players to the game can navigate to the codes section and claim their rewards without too much fuss. Here’s how:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up Fireworks Playground in Roblox</li>



<li>Click on the menu at the bottom-left corner of the screen</li>



<li>Scroll through the menu and click on ‘Code’</li>



<li>Paste or type the code into the textbox</li>

</ol>



<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-fireworks-playground-codes">Where to get more Fireworks Playground Codes</h2>



<p>Fireworks Playground codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Pseudo Studio Discord server, which has a dedicated codes channel where all new codes are posted first, and the developer’s social media accounts (specifically the PseudosStudios X page) where they announce updates and milestones for this popular pyrotechnic-inspired game.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around game milestones but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>



<p>This page is refreshed as soon as fresh codes go live, and any codes that have expired are taken out quickly so you always see only the ones that still work.</p>

<p>The cartoon crossovers keep coming in Fortnite. The wackiness of Matt Stone and Trey Parker’s South Park world has entered the holy grounds of Fortnite, and there’s a bunch of hilarious skins to unlock and use in the shooter.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> eventually has to run out of collaboration ideas, right? The Simpsons was a monumental achievement for Epic Games, and having Harry Potter content is always a blessing. But now South Park has entered the game, bringing skins sure to put a smile on the faces of long-time fans.</p>



<p>Epic knows how to pull off a collab, and the South Park skins prove this.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-south-park-skins-in-fortnite-crossover">How Many South Park Skins In Fortnite Crossover?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a collaboration. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five fun South Park skins to choose from in the January 2026 Fortnite crossover.</strong></p>



<p>You’ve definitely got a decision to make with the South Park skins. Each of the series’ main characters—and another fan-favorite—has been given the honor of a Fortnite skin.</p>



<p>Cartman’s is instantly recognizable, but it may come down to who’s your favorite character.</p>







<h2 id="h-every-south-park-skin-in-fortnite-collab">Every South Park Skin In Fortnite Collab</h2>



<p><strong>There are Eric Cartman, Kenny McCormick, Kyle Broflovski, Stan Marsh, and Butters Stotch South Park skins to choose from in Fortnite.</strong></p>



<p>The four main heroes who’ve graced TV and movie screens for nearly 30 years were always going to be first in line for skins. Then you’ve got Butters, who quickly morphed into another of the main characters, and could be considered the ‘fifth’ member of the friends’ gang.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-every-south-park-skin-in-fortnite-cost-explained">How To Get Every South Park Skin In Fortnite, Cost Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cough up the V-Bucks. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are no special quests tied to skins; you simply need to pay a fixed fee of V-Bucks to acquire any of the South Park skins found in the Fortnite collab.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick rundown of each skin and the cost.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">South Park Skin Name</th><th data-align="center">Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Eric Cartman</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kenny McCormick</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kyle Broflovski</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stan Marsh</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Butters Stotch</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Each skin (if purchased separately) comes with the base skin, a couple of customizable styles, and a Back Bling item particular to the character.</p>



<p>You can also buy them as a fixed group with the ‘Gonna Have Myself A Time’ bundle, which will set you back <strong>4,000 V-Bucks</strong> at present.</p>



<p>How A.W.E.S.O.M.-O are these skins, seriously? But, with over 20 seasons’ worth of material, the time has come to let IG know which ones you’re sad didn’t make the cut, and what future South Park content the game needs.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-3-shaping-up-to-be-monster-dev/</link>
            <guid>1401424</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This year, The Division celebrates its tenth anniversary, having emerged way back in 2016 as a solid post-apocalyptic MMO of sorts. It plunged players into a devastated New York City, torn apart by a viral pandemic and taken over by factions hellbent on twisting the city into their crime-fuelled playground.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft gave us an encouraging update regarding the future of the franchise, specifically targeting The Division 3, which is officially in production. Julian Gerighty, the game’s executive producer, said the game is ‘shaping up to be a monster.’</p>







<h2 id="h-the-division-3-could-be-the-biggest-game-in-the-series">The Division 3 Could Be The Biggest Game in the Series</h2>



<p>In a recent appearance on the New Game+ showcase, Ubisoft’s Julian Gerighty spoke about the past, present, and future of The Division. Last year, it was revealed that The Division 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-saved-by-team-five-developers-ubisoft/">was almost shuttered</a> until a dynamic team of five developers stepped up to ‘resurrect’ the game.</p>



<p>Now, the series is booming, and that includes the production of The Division 3, which is yet to be formally revealed by Ubisoft.</p>



<p>However, Gerighty had bold promises for the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret; it’s been announced. It’s <strong>shaping up to be a monster</strong>.</p>



<p>Within these walls at Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will have <strong>as big an impact as Division 1</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>From beautiful, cinematic trailers to a solid and original premise, the first Division game was released to a very positive reception almost a decade ago. It became a key pillar in Ubisoft’s portfolio and was expanded in 2019 with The Division 2, an evolution of sorts.</p>



<p>Fans of the franchise have long been calling out for an update regarding The Division 3, and while it’s only a small one, they finally have something to mull over.</p>

<p>Season One Reloaded has kicked off in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, bringing a new Fallout collab that includes a stacked Event Pass of rewards, though some are locked behind an additional purchase.</p>



<p>The Fallout collab in Black Ops 7 is widespread, with limited-time game modes, unique challenges, and items available to purchase in the shop, showing that the collab is not just about cosmetic items.</p>



<p>If you’re on the fence about splashing out on the Fallout Event Pass, Insider Gaming has all the details on the price, the rewards available, and a verdict on whether it’s worth grabbing.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass">How Much is The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to earn. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Upgrade Track for the Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass is priced at 1,100 CoD Points, which works out at around $10 for the extra content.</strong></p>



<p>Splashing out on the Upgrade Track provides 10 additional rewards alongside the 10 free rewards in the Event Pass, most of which are cosmetics.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass">All Rewards in The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass</h2>



<p><strong>The Fallout Event Pass in Black Ops 7 comes with 20 rewards, 10 of which are available for free, with the other half limited to those who purchase the Upgrade Track.</strong></p>



<p>Free rewards in the Event Pass include two Operator Skins, a loading screen, XP Tokens, and a new base weapon, while the Upgrade Track includes a new Operator, alongside an additional Operator Skin, a finishing move, weapon blueprint, Emote, and more.</p>



<p>A full breakdown of the rewards available in the Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass is shown in the table below.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass-worth-it">Is The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass Worth It?</h2>



<p><strong>If you’re a fan of the Fallout TV Series, the Blacks Ops 7 Event Pass is worth the cost as it provides the best content from the major collab.</strong></p>



<p>Unlocking the Upgrade Track is the only way to obtain the Power Armor and The Ghoul Operator Skins, two iconic looks from the famed series, along with other eye-catching additions, including the Torch Blade Weapon Blueprint and Minigun Teardown Finishing Move.</p>



<p>The Free Track, meanwhile, features much smaller collab items, with the two Operator Skins not being characters from the TV series, and the other cosmetic items being much less eye-catching.</p>

<p>Quantic Dream has just announced that Detroit: Become Human has surpassed 15 million units sold in 2026. </p>



<p>Detroit: Become Human was released back in 2018 and quickly gained popularity in the community thanks to its cinematic storytelling and decision-based gameplay. We were recently informed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/detroit-become-human-sold-one-million-copies-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 1 million copies in two weeks</a>, thanks to a massive Steam discount that was instrumental in reaching a new milestone. </p>







<h2 id="h-detroit-become-human-reaches-massive-sales-milestone-in-2026">Detroit: Become Human Reaches Massive Sales Milestone in 2026</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466707/detroit-become-human-sales-top-15-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGChartz</a>, a <a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2026/01/08/detroit-become-human-surpasses-15-million-units-sold-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> from Quantic Dream reveals that Detroit: Become Human has sold 15 million units worldwide across PlayStation 4 and PC. The report shows that the game has been steadily hitting new milestones since 2020, with 5 million units in that year, reaching 11 million units in the next 5 years. 2025 was an excellent year for the game, as it sold 4 million more units, bringing total sales to 15 million by January 2026. </p>



<h2 id="h-about-detroit-become-human">About Detroit: Become Human</h2>



<p>Detroit: Become Human takes place in 2038, where technology has advanced so much that human-like androids can be found worldwide. Players get to play as three of these androids, each of which has different moral dilemmas and obstacles to overcome. The game places a significant focus on player decisions, where your choices not only shape your characters’ journey but also impact the entire city of Detroit. The game features “thousands of choices and dozens of possible endings,” so no playthrough is exactly the same, as the most minute decisions can have a significant impact on how the story plays out. </p>
