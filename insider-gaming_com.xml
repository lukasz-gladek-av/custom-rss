<p>Epic Games continues to give people what they want. More OG Fortnite content is on the way thanks to OG Season 3, and there‚Äôs plenty of love for this early season, meaning the anticipation is already building.</p>



<p>OG Fortnite Season 3‚ÄîAKA Meteor Strike‚Äîis next up for the battle-royale title in 2025. Fortnite has a plethora of game modes at this point with regular battle royale, LEGO Fortnite, a Rocket League crossover, and so much more. But Fortnite OG is another shrewd move from Epic: Giving us all a chance to enjoy the earlier years.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG Season 3 was first released in February 2018, and yet we‚Äôre celebrating it again in 2025‚Äîpossibly with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-mortal-kombat-mythics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat Mythics</a> and maybe some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-receiving-yakuza-skins-soon-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yakuza skins</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-og-season-3-releases-in-march">Fortnite OG Season 3 Releases in March</h2>

<p>A message on the <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1903099532868505615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite X social media channel</a> has confirmed <strong>Fortnite OG Season 3 gets underway on March 25</strong>. One of its standout additions was a new POI‚ÄîLucky Landing (shown in the screenshot above).</p>



<p>Lucky Landing is characterized by its Asian-themed buildings and lush, eye-popping Cherry Blossom tree in the center. The majority of the season‚Äôs storyline focused on a meteor heading for the map. </p>

Back to where it all started‚Ä¶OG Season 3 launches March 25 üöÄ </span></p></article></div>



<p>The map slowly started altering as the season progressed, and we were beginning to see the creativity of the Fortnite map and how your experience would dynamically change as the weeks went on. I also fondly remember the Battle Pass having the ‚ÄúTake the L‚Äù emote which I unashamedly dropped on fallen enemies after I two-tapped them with Pump Shotguns.</p>



<p>It was a simple time. Long may the OG Fortnite map trend continue.</p>
