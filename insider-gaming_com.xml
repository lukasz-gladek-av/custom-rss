<p>The Witcher’s Ciri actor has stated that she spent some time considering whether they should leave the series, along with Henry Cavill. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Witcher series first had Henry Cavill playing Geralt of Rivia; however, he had to leave the show before it ended, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-season-four-first-clip-hemsworth-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liam Hemsworth</a> stepping in to wrap up the rest of the seasons as Geralt. Henry Cavill’s leaving was shocking news to all the fans, and it seems it was a shock to cast members as well, because one of them considered quitting along with him. </p>

<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/tv-interviews/freya-allan-interview-the-witcher-netflix-ciri-henry-cavill-3915069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NME</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/the-witcher-ciri-actor-says-she-considered-quitting-the-show-with-former-star-henry-cavill-hes-the-geralt-i-grew-up-with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), The Witcher’s Ciri actor, Freya Allan, opened up about considering quitting with Henry Cavill. Allan spoke about how season 3 of the show was difficult for everyone and how she was only informed about Henry Cavill quitting one day before it was announced to the public. Allan added that she cried as she wanted to complete the series with the guy who had played her “adoptive father”. </p>



<p>Allan added that, for the first time, she began to see what life would be like away from The Witcher and spent a “solid amount of time” considering whether she should quit her role as Ciri alongside Henry Cavill. However, as we all know, she ultimately chose to stay back and make the most of every moment. Allan also talked about how she was inspired to take on Henry’s role after he left, who was always so “knowledgeable and loyal to the books, push for certain lines to be included.” </p>

<p>Legendary game developer Tim Cain has returned to the gaming industry spotlight to team up with Obsidian Entertainment once again, and they’ve confirmed that they’re working on a new game already.</p>



<p>If you didn’t know, Tim Cain helped mastermind the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-revealed-what-makes-fallout-special/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a> franchise and co-directed The Outer Worlds, amongst other work. The developer semi-retired several years ago, but has announced that he’s back into the swing of things with Obsidian, and is developing a mystery game.</p>

<p>In a December 5 ‘Cain On Games Update’ on his YouTube channel, Cain discussed what was happening in his life regarding game development and the next steps:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m back at Obsidian. I’m there, full-time employee, and in person. So not remote. I’m not a contractor anymore.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Cain explained that while he will have his name attached to at least one other game coming up—due to his relaxed contractor status in recent times—he is now firmly on Obsidian’s books. Cain explained that he’s not at liberty to discuss the new project, and it gives more questions than it does answers:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I also can’t talk about the project I’m working on at Obsidian, just because that’s covered under NDA. Don’t bother guessing, you’re not gonna guess right.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Cain explains that he’s “A lot less retired now,” and this new game will likely be the center of his focus moving forward.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video and everything said by Cain about the life change.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Outer Worlds and The Outer Worlds 2 have been the two main games Cain has worked on in the last 10 years. It’ll be interesting to see what the new title is, but it’s hard to imagine it’s not something to do with an RPG!</p>



<p>What do you think Cain is working on? Is it an old IP being brought back to life? Or is Obsidian cooking up yet another franchise?
