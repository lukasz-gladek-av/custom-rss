            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-beta-matches-were-%E2%80%98nearly-99-%E2%80%99-cheater-free.1324084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a post on social media, Activision’s Team RICOCHET has highlighted that ‘nearly 99%’ of matches in the Black Ops 7 beta were free of cheaters. This statistic has already been met with criticism, with many users claiming that they had cheaters or other malicious operators in their matches during the open beta.</p>



<p>Team RICOCHET has remained positive, emphasizing continuous improvements, and the median time to identify cheaters has been reduced to ‘under three matches’. What’s not clear is how many matches that 1% represents. Is it 1000 matches, or 100,000 matches?</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-still-won-t-be-free-of-cheaters">Black Ops 7 Still Won’t Be Free of Cheaters</h2>



<p>It’s impossible to rid Black Ops 7 of cheaters entirely, as with each new improvement made by Team RICOCHET, the world’s cheat manufacturers respond with their own evolutions. It’s a never-ending battle that can only <span><strong>improve&nbsp;</strong>and will never be entirely resolved</span>.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1977766811916746869" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent post</a> on social media, Team RICOCHET stressed those improvements:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve crunched the numbers for Black Ops 7 Beta, and RICOCHET Anti-Cheat achieved the strongest Beta results in Call of Duty history. </p>



<p>Each&nbsp;day, our cheat detections got faster and your matches got cleaner. </p>



<p>By the end:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nearly 99% of matches were cheater-free</li>



<li>The median detection time for cheaters was three matches.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Clips still surfaced online of cheaters ruining the fun for legitimate players worldwide, but Activision was quick to stamp these out and point out that the wrongdoers had been forcefully removed from the Call of Duty platform.</p>



<p>In recent years, Call of Duty has suffered immeasurably under the weight of cheaters, especially in modes like the game’s ranked play platforms. It’s a gruelling place to try and enjoy yourself, and it always seems like it ebbs and flows quite dramatically.</p>



<p>This year, the hope for Call of Duty players is that Team RICOCHET is in the best place possible and that foul cheaters worldwide have their attentions fixed elsewhere, such as on the recent release of Battlefield or the upcoming 1.0 launch of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>I’m not wishing ill will on those games, but the diversification might help spread the cheaters across a wider base rather than having them all focus on one game.</p>



<p>Will it be enough to propel Black Ops 7 into a better space when it’s released next month? Let me know what you think on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-jurassic-world-evolution-3-have-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-jurassic-world-evolution-3-have-early-access.1324075/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is right around the corner, but is there early access so you can play even sooner than that normal release date?</p>



<p>Looking at the calendar will fill sandbox fans with joy that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date is nearly here</a>, but sometimes, the super fans will do all they can to get their hands on a game as soon as possible.</p>



<p>Here is the answer to whether or not Jurassic World Evolution 3 has early access.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-jurassic-world-evolution-3-in-early-access">Can You Play Jurassic World Evolution 3 in Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can you guys see any early access up there? Image via Frontier</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no early access available for Jurassic World Evolution 3. Everyone will have access to the game on October 21 at 10 AM ET.</strong></p>



<p>Life may find a way, but early access did not find a way to follow <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a> to release. The sandbox and park simulation game will have you building up your own Jurassic World amusement park, which has always gone well for people in the movies, right? Whether that is on PC, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X, you will have to wait until the 21st to get your dino fix in.</p>



<p>Sometimes, a video game release will work in a three-day early access release for players who purchase a deluxe edition, but that is not included this time around. Instead, all you get for the extra $15 spent on the deluxe is four additional family units and some bonus skins and scenery. Whether or not that is worth it is completely up to your tastes.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-jurassic-world-evolution-3-have-a-playable-demo">Does Jurassic World Evolution 3 Have a Playable Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, no, there is not a playable demo available for Jurassic World Evolution 3 either. Your only chance to play the game is to buy it outright.</strong></p>



<p>With this being the third game, you could maybe find the previous two games for cheap to see if you like it before spending the full price tag on <a href="https://www.jurassicworldevolution.com/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a>. That, or if you are an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, you can play the second game with your subscription.</p>



<p>When it comes to demos, many games these days avoid offering them to players. The thinking for that is, while it could be exciting for some players to give the game a try and fall in love with it, others may be turned off, and then the developer and publisher wouldn’t get any money out of the deal. It sucks, but that is where we are in gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 review embargo date is quickly approaching, giving everyone a first glimpse at what you can expect from the upcoming game from your favorite critic or content creator.</p>



<p>This sequel is easily <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-the-outer-worlds-2-pre-order-bonuses-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the more anticipated games of 2025</a>, with many RPG fans ready to jump back into this galactic universe full of flawed people and chaos.</p>



<p>Here is when you can expect The Outer Worlds 2 review embargo to lift.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-review-embargo-date-explained">The Outer Worlds 2 Review Embargo Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No need to rush, the reviews are coming soon. Image by Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Outer Worlds 2 review embargo is set for October 23 at 9 AM ET.</strong></p>



<p>When the clock strikes 9 in the morning along the East Coast, you can expect plenty of sites and YouTube channels to start dropping their reviews for the game. If you are curious if one of your favorite critics or content creators is covering the game, you should consider checking their social media accounts. Many have already posted that they are playing the game early and will be working on a review when the time comes.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-review-scores-prediction">The Outer Worlds 2 Review Scores Prediction</h2>



<p><strong>Given that the game is a direct sequel and will do many of the same things that the original did, but expanded, you can probably expect The Outer Worlds 2 to have a similar review score to the first game. Somewhere between 83-87 makes sense for this kind of game.</strong></p>



<p>The first Outer Worlds game sits at 85 on MetaCritic, with the remastered Spacer’s Choice at 72 because of performance issues and not really bettering the experience in any way. Unless the sequel is absolutely mired in bugs and glitches, it shouldn’t fare too poorly with critics.</p>



<p>To some who are thinking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-outer-worlds-2-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a> might be their most anticipated game of 2025, an 85 might seem low. Of course, we haven’t played the game yet to know for sure, but that is actually a very good score for any game release, let alone an RPG. That being said, if you are expecting the game to contend with other top games this year that reach well into the 90s, you might come away disappointed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Obsidian Entertainment</a> is a brilliant development studio with tons of talent and a great back catalog of games, they’ve never been one to have a game score 90 on MetaCritic outside of Pentiment, which was a shock to just about everyone. We’re willing to be surprised, but don’t expect it.</p>



<hr>



<p>What are your guesses for The Outer Worlds 2 review scores? Do you think it can contend for the best Obsidian games ever? Or will it be more in line with the original game? Let us know in the comments or on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>More leaks about Pokémon Gen 10, Wind and Wave, have surfaced online, revealing details about the boss fight and the MMO features. </p>



<p>Today has been a big day for Pokémon leaks, with new information coming up online by the minute. We have already been informed about Pokémon Wind and Wave’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story, setting, new mechanics</a>, and other details. Now, more leaks have appeared detailing the Gen 10 title’s boss fight and MMO features. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-wind-and-wave-has-18-boss-fights">Pokémon Wind and Wave Has 18 Boss Fights </h2>



<p>According to new posts by CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977825751467704701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, in Pokémon Wind and Wave, players will be able to beat the game without having to complete all the gyms or even capturing the legendary. All these missions are optional, but must be completed to get the true ending. Players will have the option to challenge the final boss as soon as they receive the ability to traverse the sea. However, beating it in the early game “will be a lot more difficult”.</p>



<p>Coming to the bosses, players will have to fight Wind and Wave Gyms and Titan/Lord Pokémon mixed. There are 18 total challenges, each belonging to a specific Pokémon type. These challenges are inspired by the ‘Sustainable Development Goals’, and clearing all of them allows the player to challenge the champion.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>In Pokémon Wind/Wave the Gyms and the Titan/Lord Pokémon are mixed together</p><p>– There are in total 18 challenges, one for each type.<br>– They will be inspired by the Sustainable Development Goals<br>– Clearing all the 18 challenges allows you to challenge the Champion <a href="https://t.co/78je4sCij4">pic.twitter.com/78je4sCij4</a></p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977827351137591608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-wind-and-wave-mmo-details-codename-naia">Pokémon Wind and Wave MMO Details: Codename ‘Naia’</h2>



<p>Moving on to the MMO part, leaks suggest that Game Freak is looking to blend open-world and MMO elements into the Gen 10 title. The MMO features have been codenamed ‘Naia’, where players can upload the procedurally generated islands they discover to the Naia servers and play with other players. </p>



<h2 id="h-gen-10-wind-and-wave-seed-pokemon-details">Gen 10 Wind and Wave Seed Pokémon Details</h2>



<p>Lastly, more details about the Seed Pokémon have surfaced online. These Pokémon will be provided to the player at the start of their journey, and they need to train them to a certain level to enter the island where the main legendary resides. The island will be procedurally generated based on how trained the Seed Pokémon is. Lastly, the evolution of the Seed Pokémon is procedurally generated as well and includes unique patterns. Which means every player will have a unique Seed Pokémon. </p>



<p>Readers should take this information with a grain of salt as it doesn’t come from an official source. </p>

<p><strong>As of this writing, we do not know for sure how many playthroughs are absolutely required to get all achievements and trophies in The Outer Worlds 2, but it appears that it will require at least two. If certain factions are locked off depending on your choices, it could be more.</strong></p>



<p>The achievement list in this game shows that <a href="https://outerworlds2.obsidian.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Outer Worlds 2</a> follows a lot of the same methods that the original game used when it comes to achievements and trophies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, difficulty achievements tied to multiple achievements are not really common for RPGs, but both games do them here. Hopefully, players who play through first on Very Hard will automatically receive the Hard trophy as well, but if it doesn’t, you will be stuck with an additional playthrough.</p>



<p>It appears that the max level in the game is 30, much like it was in the original, and there are a lot of collectibles to find, including 100 Pitch/Tossball cards, grounding stations, audio logs, and mural pieces. Hopefully, none of those are locked off in areas if you miss them the first time through.</p>



<p>Outside of that, there seem to be a lot of miscellaneous achievements and trophies in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-the-outer-worlds-2-have-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a>. Things like never buying anything in the game or getting kills in various ways. If you want the platinum in this game, you are going to have to cover a lot of ground.</p>
