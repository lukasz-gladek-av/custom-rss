<p>Palworld devs have teased upcoming Pals through new concept art revealed from their 2nd Anniversary video. </p>



<p>Pocketpair has been hard at work growing the Palworld game and the franchise. In terms of content, we saw the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworlds-ultrakill-collab-arrives-in-december-2025-with-home-sweet-home-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultrakill Collab and the ‘Home Sweet Home’ update</a> arrive last month. Additionally, we also saw a new Palword <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-facing-more-pokemon-rip-off-allegations-with-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TCG announced last week</a>, extending the franchise’s reach in the card game genre. Now, we have got a small tease for what’s in store for their 1.0 update, which will finally get the game out of early access. </p>







<h2 id="h-palworld-reveals-concept-art-for-upcoming-pal">Palworld Reveals Concept Art for Upcoming Pal </h2>



<p>Palworld’s 2nd <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0M82qgvIxE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Anniversary video</a> starts with Bucky, Head of Publishing &amp; Communications at Pocketpair, addressing the community. Bucky reveals that developers are working hard on the Palworld <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-1-0-release-window-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.0 update</a>, which seems to be the game’s “biggest update ever”. However, they can’t show a sneak peek of this update at the moment, as it is still in development. They did have some concept art to showcase for upcoming Pals in Palworld. </p>



<p>The first concept art depicts a dragon-like creature with elements of a Lotus flower around it. The next one had a fluffy but angry-looking creature that seemed to have electric abilities. The third Pal concept art in Palworld featured a blue-and-white-coloured bird with a cloud around its face. The fourth concept art featured an eel-like Pal that could seemingly detach its lower half to turn into a blade. The last art showcased twin creatures in blue and red accents. </p>



<p>Apart from the Pal concept art, towards the end of the video, Bucky also teases another creature, asking, “That sounds like…a whale???” The statement was followed by an in-game cinematic that showed the player atop a mythical, whale-like creature, en route to a mysterious tree. Interested readers can check out the 2nd Anniversary teaser below: </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Cloud Gaming Ad-Supported Tier Reportedly Releasing in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-ad-supported-tier-reportedly-releasing-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1409854</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report discusses the Xbox Cloud Gaming ad-supported tier launching in 2026 and how it will work. </p>



<p>For those unaware, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-preparing-free-xbox-cloud-service-with-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report from last year</a> mentioned a free Xbox Cloud Gaming platform supported by ads which doesn’t require a Game Pass subscription. It seems this tier might be released in 2026, as teaser images of the service have already started surfacing online, suggesting an ad-based playtime model. </p>











<p>For those unaware, an image surfaced last week for Xbox Cloud Gaming, which stated “1 hour of ad-supported playtime per session”. The messages shown in the image appear to be an error, and a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xbox-cloud-gaming-will-get-an-ad-supported-tier-this-year-rumors-coalesce-after-ad-support-notices-appear-prematurely" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a> report explains how this service will work. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The report stated that the ads will not apply to all Xbox Cloud Gaming tiers; instead, they will apply to a separate tier. Players who use Xbox Cloud Gaming with ads will be able to stream Xbox Games they purchased digitally, but will not have access to Game Pass titles. </p>



<p>The upcoming ad-supported Xbox Cloud Gaming tier will remove the requirement to have purchased at least one tier of Game Pass to access cloud gaming titles. Additionally, the exact release date for when the service drops hasn’t been revealed; however, Jez Corden has been told it is releasing “this year.” Maybe we could get an official reveal at the upcoming Xbox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-games-confirmed-for-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Developer Direct</a></p>



<p>The amount of playtime they will receive and the duration of ads they will have to watch were not revealed. However, the report from last year stated that Microsoft was testing “a limit of one hour for sessions, with up to five hours free a month.” These details are subject to change when the service officially drops. </p>







<p>In other news, the next Xbox will reportedly feature “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-will-reportedly-feature-full-bore-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-bore Windows</a>.” Do you think the Xbox Cloud Gaming ad-supported tier will be released in 2026?

<p>Rockstar North, a developer of GTA 6, has been hit by reports of an explosion, with police and fire services on the scene in Edinburgh responding.</p>



<p>The offices, located in Scotland, are currently cordoned off by police following reports of an explosion at around 5 AM GMT, with early suggestions, yet to be confirmed, stating a boiler was the cause.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/police-have-cordoned-off-rockstar-north-after-explosion-reportedly-caused-by-malfunctioning-boiler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, <a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-fire-crews-rush-ongoing-33257244.amp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EdinburghLive stated</a> that Scottish Fire &amp; Rescue have been on the scene for over two hours since reports of the incident came in, with a statement provided to the outlet that said the team “mobilised three pumps and four of our specialist appliances.”</p>



<p>A spokesperson told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0lx7x5d81lo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBC</a> that firefighters were called out to deal with structural damage at the building and crews were stood down at 9:21 AM GMT.</p>



<p>No deaths or injuries have been reported, and, while the cause is yet to be publicly confirmed, local outlets have stated it was a suspected boiler explosion.</p>



<p>Rockstar North is, of course, one of the developers working on the highly-anticipated sixth instalment of the Grand Theft Auto series, and the company has not commented on the incident.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/code-veronica-reveal-up-next-not-resident-evil-5-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>1409806</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A notable Resident Evil insider has stated that the RE5 Remake will not be announced in 2026; instead, Code Veronica Remake will be revealed.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Resident Evil 5’s voice actor made a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-5-voice-actor-hints-at-possible-30th-anniversary-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptic post</a> last week, leading the community to speculate that Resident Evil 5 Remake will be revealed on the franchise’s 30th Anniversary. However, it seems this won’t be the case, and a remake of an older title could be shown instead. The insider has also discussed reasons why this might be the case. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-code-veronica-reveal-reportedly-coming-in-2026">Resident Evil Code Veronica Reveal Reportedly Coming in 2026</h2>



<p>The latest bit of information comes from DuskGolem, who accurately leaked Resident Evil Requiem’s reveal and that Leon Kennedy would be part of the game. In the insider’s latest <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012597154825515449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter), they debunk the community’s theories that Resident Evil 5 Remake will be announced this year and reaffirm their claim that Code Veronica Remake will be revealed. </p>



<p>Late last year, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-remakes-scheduled-for-2027-2028-respectively-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that Code Veronica and Zero Remakes were scheduled to release in 2027 and 2028, respectively, with the former being revealed in 2026.</p>



<p>Another <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012675455250235692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> by the insider also discusses the probable reasons Code Veronica and Zero Remakes took priority over others. The first reason is surveys, where fans have apparently voted for these two titles to be remade. The second reason is that several devs at Capcom worked on the original RE Zero and have ideas to improve it. The third reason is seemingly scope and scale, where RE5 and RE6 are considerably bigger titles. </p>



<p>As always, readers should take this information with a grain of salt, as the information doesn’t come from an official source. </p>
