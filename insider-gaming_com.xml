<p>Krafton is publishing Inzoi and feels strongly about the game’s attempt at the life-sim genre. This isn’t a case of art imitating life as Inzoi almost looks like life itself, and its system requirements on PC might make your eyes water.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-simulator-inzoi-early-access-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a> looks to follow in the steps of other life-sim hits such as The Sims, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, and Animal Crossing. It allows you to escape the rigors of everyday life to create the ultimate, perfect society in virtual form. Inzoi looks to incorporate all aspects of life and roll them into one streamlined experience.</p>



<p>Developer Inzoi Studio’s creation was birthed several years ago, and it’s nearly time to be born.</p>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-minimum-requirements-on-pc">Inzoi Minimum Requirements on PC</h2>

<p>The Inzoi minimum requirements let us play Inzoi—and that’s good enough for many. It sucks to miss out on a game for technical reasons, so at the very least we want to hit the minimum requirements.</p>



<p>Check out the complete list of minimum PC specs below, which is provided on the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2456740/view/518581441632667234?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Inzoi Minimum PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Inzoi Minimum Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 / 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 5 3600 / Intel i5 10400</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT (6G VRAM) / NVIDIA RTX 2060 (6G VRAM)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">12 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">Need 40 GB of Available Space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-medium-requirements-on-pc">Inzoi Medium Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>In between the minimum and recommended requirements are Medium settings. This is for those with better hardware than the bare minimum, but still falling short of optimal performance.</p>



<p>Here’s every Medium requirement for Inzoi. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Inzoi Medium PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Inzoi Medium Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 / 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D / Intel i7 11700</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Radeon RX 6600 (8G VRAM) / NVIDIA RTX 3060 (8G VRAM)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">Need 50 GB of Available Space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-recommended-requirements-on-pc-0">Inzoi Recommended Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>We’re moving up to the upper tiers of requirements now. The recommended PC specs are quite powerful compared to most, but if you can meet most (if not all) of these requirements, Inzoi will look very fine.</p>



<p>Check each of these values carefully.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Inzoi Recommended PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Inzoi Recommended Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 / 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D / Intel i7 12700K</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT (16G VRAM) / NVIDIA RTX 3070 (8G VRAM)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">Need 60 GB of Available Space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-high-requirements-on-pc">Inzoi High Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>The High requirements—otherwise known as the best specs—are reserved for mighty rigs and heavyweight computers comprised of thousands of dollars worth of parts. A lot of top-end gear is required to meet the High requirements.</p>



<p>However, this is how to enjoy peak Inzoi performance and bring the game to life.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Inzoi High PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Inzoi High Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 / 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D / Intel i7 14700K</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX (24G VRAM) / NVIDIA RTX 4080 (16G VRAM)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">32 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">Need 75 GB of Available Space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Fallout 76’s Ghoul Within update is live and allows players to transform into a ghoul.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-transform-into-a-ghoul-in-fallout-76">How to Transform into a Ghoul in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>After being updated to version 1.7.18.22, players can turn into a Ghoul, but they will have to go through a quest to do so. The quest in question is called “Leap of Faith”, which takes players into a new section of the Savage Divide. Here, players will find new characters who will help them transform. Completing the questline will allow players to fully transform into a ghoul and use abilities like Glow and Feral. They will also have access to 30 new Ghoul-exclusive <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/24uIqswESsK1aunG5a2oyS/fallout-76-ghoul-within-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">perks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players need to be at level 50 to undergo this transformation, and after becoming a Ghoul in Fallout 76, they need to watch out for some things. Factions like Brotherhood of Steel and others will be hostile towards Ghouls, so players will have to disguise themselves with new costumes that they receive from Jaye, a new NPC. This disguise will allow players to interact with blocked content they may find when playing a Ghoul.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, your transformation into a Ghoul in Fallout 76 is not final, and players can become Human again. To do so, you must return to the character selection screen. However, once you become a human, you cannot transform into a Ghoul again, as the questline for the Leap of Faith cannot be replayed. If you still wish to return to the Ghoul life, you can purchase a Ghoul Retransformation from the character screen for 1,000 Atoms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Palworld’s highly anticipated cross-play update is now live, adding additional features, adjustments and other changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After today’s update, Palworld players can play with friends across any platform, thanks to the new cross-play feature. The Global Palbox has also been added, allowing the storage of Pal data and the transfer of Pals between worlds. A new storage system called Dimensional Pal Storage provides players with 10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox. Guild members can access this box, which can also be used as personal storage.</p>



<p>Apart from cross-play and world transfer for Pals, Palworld has some cosmetic and photo mode changes for the game in the new update. The new cosmetic armour system is essentially a transmog system, allowing players to equip armour cosmetically at the Antique Dresser without affecting any stats. Moreover, the photo mode is now accessible through the Pal Command Wheel, and players can combine low-rarity blueprints to make high-rarity ones. Lastly, Mac has dedicated servers now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, Palworld has made specific adjustments, like connecting pieces of a roof or foundation, which will automatically align, and players can now sit on chairs and cushions. There are some balance adjustments, like summoned raid bosses cannot damage other bases and adjustments to the NPC rewards. Players interested in these adjustments, the new UI changes, and bug fixes can check out the full <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1902195801461514742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">patch notes here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pocketpair also confirmed that dedicated servers for the PS5 version of Palworld are currently unavailable. The devs are working towards adding support and releasing this feature in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, Snail Games USA revealed a new trailer for ARK: Aquatica, an all-new expansion coming to ARK: Survival Ascended. The chief developer behind the series, Studio Wildcard, distanced itself from the project on social media by directing fans to Snail Games, and it’s clear why.</p>



<p>The published trailer was little more than a gen-AI showcase, except for a few seconds of gameplay at the start of the video. It’s glaringly obvious and it has drawn blowback from fans online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-naturally">Naturally</h2>



<p>The one-minute trailer that announces ARK: Aquatica is studded with blatant gen-AI footage, and even the most uneducated eye can look at it and know something is wrong:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ARK: Aquatica Official Trailer GDC 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2eCWWaCzwQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The entire contents of the trailer reveal <strong>nothing </strong>about the expansion. It’s just a visual reel that shows janky AI characters exploring some kind of water-themed underworld. In one sequence, a character fires a harpoon gun, and it’s so bizarre it’s a wonder this thing managed to pass muster at Snail Games.</p>



<p>What’s worse is it isn’t even <strong>good </strong>gen-AI content. I’ve seen better and more accurate renditions in Snapchat filters. From a cursory glance beneath the video, I failed to find a single positive comment about the trailer. When I checked, more than 1,000 comments were ripping the AI-generated content to shreds.</p>



<p>Per the description of the DLC, ARK: Aquatica will have players taking their ‘survival to the deep blue with new creatures, mechanics, and dangers lurking below.’</p>



<p>Recently, the team at Wildcard Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ark-next-major-expansion-set-scene-ark-2/">revealed ARK: Lost Colony</a>, the first major expansion for ARK: Survival Ascended that will help bridge the gap between ARK and ARK 2, which still doesn’t have a release date.</p>



<p>Are you miffed by the use of gen-AI in the trailer for ARK: Aquatica? Let me know in the comments.</p>
