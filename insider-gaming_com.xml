<p>The signs pointing to the next Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater game continue to find their way out, this time via a tease in a different Activision game.  </p>



<p>Spotted in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s Grind map, there is a skateboard area with a logo similar to that of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skate 1 + 2. Within that logo reads a date: March 4, 2025.</p>

<p>Coincidently, if you go by month-date-year formatting, the month and day equates to 3-4, the expected next remaster from the classic skateboarding series. </p>



<p>The latest tease comes just days after pro skater&nbsp;Tyshawn Jones said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-remaster-is-coming-skater-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during an interview</a> that a new game was “about to come out”. It was then followed up with claims from eXtas1s that the game will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/">be shadow dropped</a> when it launches.</p>



<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2—a remaster of the first two games—launched in 2020. That game was developed by Vicarious Visions, which has since been rebranded as Blizzard Albany after becoming fully merged into Blizzard Entertainment in 2022. There were talks that the follow up remaster was in development, but that it had been cancelled sometime in 2021-2022. In September 2024, however, Hawk himself said that there would be a future for the franchise as it celebrated its 25th Anniversary and that it was something <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-is-talking-to-activision-about-tony-hawk-pro-skater-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he was excited about</a>.</p>



<p>“I’m not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future,” Hawk said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-continues-to-tease-future-pro-skater-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via an Instagram post</a>.</p>
