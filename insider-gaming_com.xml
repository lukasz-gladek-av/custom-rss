<p>Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 2 was supposed to arrive on March 4, 2026, but is now arriving on March 19. </p>



<p>Chapter 7 Season 1 of Fortnite introduces a bunch of new content, including a brand new island, new weapons, collaborations with Hollywood, including Back to the Future and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-to-feature-quentin-tarantinos-dream-kill-bill-chapter-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kill Bill</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Park</a> crossover, and so much more. It seems players will now have to spend some more time with this Season, until Epic Games works on CH7S2. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-7-season-2-now-arrives-on-march-19">Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 2 Now Arrives on March 19 </h2>



<p>A new post on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2019788648376393947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) by the official Fortnite Status account confirms that Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 2 will now release on March 19, 15 days later than intended. It also includes the caption “opens the loot vault &amp; starts cooking” with a ‘Let Him Build’ version of the Let Him Cook meme. It seems that Fortnite is hinting that they have something special in the works with the upcoming Season, and that’s the reason for the holdup. </p>



<p>Players have a little over a month until the next season begins, and there is a lot to look forward to. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-february-2026-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February roadmap</a> reveals details on events, maps, skins, collabs, and more coming throughout the month. Additionally, the game’s director has teased a “fun update” coming in February, which is designed to “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-director-teases-fun-update-to-spice-up-current-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spice things up</a>” in the current season. </p>



<p>In other news, Paul Heyman wants players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paul-heyman-wwe-2k26-play-instead-fortnite-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to play WWE 2K26</a> instead of Call of Duty and Fortnite. Additionally, Fortnite has teased a brand new collaboration <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-teases-brand-new-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Honkai Star Rail</a>.

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cloud9 New York Failing to Build New CDL Roster After Dropping Team]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cloud9-new-york-failing-to-build-new-roster/</link>
            <guid>1428229</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Cloud9 New York has had a <strong>very </strong>tough time of late. Since entering the Call of Duty League in 2024 after buying out the New York Subliners, the organization, one of the oldest in the esports space, has failed to secure traction. Multiple major roster overhauls have led to a lack of identity, and now, an entire squad wipe has left the brand without a team <strong>again</strong>.</p>



<p>However, things are getting worse. The proposed picks are actively turning down a spot on Cloud9 New York, which is shaping up to be the worst-paid team in the Call of Duty League. Even players who should be actively accepting any offer put before them aren’t eager to step into a C9NY role.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-cloud9-new-york-have-a-roster-for-major-2">Will Cloud9 New York Have a Roster For Major 2?</h2>



<p>Major 1 just wrapped in the Call of Duty League recently, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-fails-to-secure-major-i-after-perfect-run/">Paris Gentle Mates snatching the victory</a> – and the tiny trophy – from OpTic Texas in the grand final in Dallas.</p>



<p>Cloud9 NY was the first team to be eliminated, almost without firing a shot. The organization is joint last place in the CDL standings right now, sitting (not so) pretty at the bottom of the board alongside Vancouver Surge with just a single match win this season thus far.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It was <a href="https://x.com/SpawnUpgg/status/2019110866248167859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored recently</a> that Cloud9’s leadership was eyeing up the likes of QK4B, Renegade, Kips, Spart, and Owakening for spots on a new roster. In the last few days, both <a href="https://x.com/SpawnUpgg/status/2019212962721112438" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">QK4B</a> and <a href="https://x.com/CoDClipped/status/2019562452988637313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spart</a> have reportedly <strong>declined </strong>those spots. Many have suggested that Kips and Renegade, currently in Challengers, should stay where they are, as C9NY’s offer isn’t even worth a pick.</p>



<p>The owners at Cloud9 have had to cut costs dramatically, which is why folks are talking about it being the worst-paid spot in the Call of Duty League. It’s hardly a lucrative concept for any rookie player, even if it’s a guaranteed entry to the top tier of COD esports.</p>







<p>Could we see Cloud9 withdraw from the Call of Duty League before the season is out? If so, which organization will assume control of that spot? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>1428172</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="114633">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> (GTA 6) is Rockstar Games’ next mainline GTA release and easily one of the most anticipated video games in years. Rockstar itself has stayed mostly quiet since confirming the game is in development, but reporting, leaks, and publisher comments have steadily filled in the gaps around GTA 6’s setting, release window, and gameplay direction.</p>



<p>This hub is where Insider Gaming keeps everything together—what’s confirmed, what’s been reported, what’s changed, and what still isn’t clear—and it’s updated as new information comes in.</p>







<h2 id="h-latest-gta-6-update">Latest GTA 6 Update </h2>



<p><strong>Latest Update (February 6, 2026)</strong></p>



<p>While details surrounding the game’s features have yet to be officially announced, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-marketing-to-start-this-summer-will-have-physical-version/" id="173882">it has been confirmed</a> that the game’s marketing will begin sometime this summer. It was also confirmed that Rockstar is planning to release a physical version of the game. </p>



<p>Also, with generative AI being a heavy talking point in the industry right now, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick said in a recent interview that GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-genai-has-zero-part-in-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t be using GenAI</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-gta-6-stands-right-now">Where GTA 6 Stands Right Now</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Developer: </strong>Rockstar Games</li>



<li><strong>Publisher: </strong>Rockstar Games</li>



<li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S</li>



<li><strong>Status: </strong>In Development</li>
</ul>



<p>Rockstar officially announced GTA 6 in December 2023, with the game’s first trailer amassing over 270 million views on the official Rockstar Games YouTube Channel. Beyond that, however, news has been limited. Fans have received one other trailer as well as some information about the game’s location—Leonida (Florida)—and main characters Jason Duval and the franchise’s first female protagonist Lucia Caminos.</p>

<h2 id="h-gta-6-release-date-what-we-know">GTA 6 Release Date: What We Know</h2>



<h3 id="h-what-s-confirmed">What’s Confirmed</h3>



<p>Rockstar’s latest release date for GTA 6 is November 19, 2026. That release date announcement came in November 2025, when it was revealed that GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was being delayed</a> from its May 26, 2026 release. This was the third announced release for the game after it was originally announced for a fall 2025 launch. That then turned into the May 2026 release that became November 2026.</p>



<h3>Will GTA 6 Be Delayed Again?</h3>



<p>Rockstar and Take-Two Interactive seem adamant on making sure GTA 6 launches on November 19. However, anything is possible with this franchise, and it won’t be released until the developers feel it’s ready. Should any news or rumors come out about the release date, Insider Gaming will have full details. </p>



<h3 id="h-will-gta-6-come-to-pc">Will GTA 6 Come To PC?</h3>



<p>GTA 6 has only been confirmed for a release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. While it won’t come to PC at first launch, it should be expected on the platform at a later date.  </p>

<h2 id="h-gta-6-setting-and-map">GTA 6 Setting and Map</h2>



<p>For the first time in two decades, Grand Theft Auto returns to Vice City in GTA 6. But it’s not just Vice City that players will explore. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-gta-6-location-confirmed-so-far-vice-city-included-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game is set in the state of Leonida</a> (Florida), with multiple locations to visit and learn about. </p>



<p>While Vice City is the main locale, there are five other key places in GTA 6. The settings for Grand Theft Auto 6 include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Vice City</strong> – The main location based on Miami, Florida</li>



<li><strong>Leonida Keys</strong> – A tropical archipelago based on the Florida Keys</li>



<li><strong>Grassrivers </strong>– Known as the “untamable jewel”, it’s based on the Florida Everglades</li>



<li><strong>Port Gellhorn</strong> – An area filled with “cheap motels, empty strip malls and shuttered attractions”</li>



<li><strong>Ambrosia – </strong>A town in the middle of Leonida</li>



<li><strong>Mount Kalaga National Park </strong>– Located in the northern part of the state, the park features areas to explore, hunt, and fish.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-how-big-is-the-gta-6-map">How Big Is The GTA 6 Map?</h3>



<p>GTA 6 is set to feature the largest map in the history of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. It’s also expected to be an evolving map that will change overtime, though those reports are unconfirmed as of now. </p>

<h2 id="h-gta-6-gameplay-details">GTA 6 Gameplay Details</h2>



<p>As of February 6, officially gameplay details have yet to be released. All that’s known is that, like past GTA games, it will be an open-world action-adventure game. More details will come as the marketing picks up this summer.</p>



<p>One thing that seems to be confirmed is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-support-will-seemingly-continue-after-gta-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online support</a> will continue after the game’s release. That makes sure that, at least for a little while, longtime players still have something to go to, especially on platforms where the game isn’t launching yet like PC. </p>

<h2>Latest GTA 6 Leaks</h2>



<p>With any game as anticipated as the next Grand Theft Auto title, many will look for as much information as possible about the game. That can also lead to leaks making their way out of the studio.</p>



<p>For the most part, however, there hasn’t been much in that sense over the past year or so. Back in 2022 and 2023 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-leaks-online-with-90-gameplay-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there were plenty</a> of leaks from the game, but Rockstar had caught the party responsible. That lead to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hacker-sentenced-for-gta-6-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arion Kurtaj being sentenced</a> for the leaks.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-trailers">GTA 6 Trailers</h2>



<p>There have been two trailers released so far for Grand Theft Auto 6. You can check them both out below.</p>
