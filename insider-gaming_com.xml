<p>A Universal Time is an action-adventure game within <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-roblox-safe-for-kids-truth-parental-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a>, boasting core RPG elements and a world that’s been heavily inspired by Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure and other similar anime stories. A Universal Time requires players to explore a large world and gain powers along the way. Alongside their exploration of the map, they will be required to take on various opponents, including NPCs as well as real players. Although the biggest inspiration for A Universal Time is Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, with the game including many of the anime’s ‘Stands’, it also showcases characters from other popular anime, including Dragon Ball, One Piece, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will have to progress through the game to get stronger and unlock more powerful moves, and for newer players to the game, that can be a daunting task. With both PvP and PvE fights involved, getting ahead of the competition fast is of utmost importance, and using codes is a good way to make some quick progress. A Universal Time codes give players various rewards in the game, including Skin Chests, UCoins, UShards, and more, all of which will come in handy to the average player.</p>

Although you can keep track of new codes by joining the game’s official Discord or through their socials, keeping tabs on our page is going to be the easiest way to do so.</p>

<p>Details of the recent Discord data hack continue to paint a darker picture for the company and its users. According to Discord news source Discord Previews, the group taking responsibility for the compromise claims to have an enormous amount of user data, specifically millions of user photos.</p>



<p>In a post on social media <a href="https://x.com/DiscordPreviews/status/1975909634293854364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord Previews</a> said that <strong>“the perpetrators of this attack claim to have obtained 1.5 TB of age-verification photos totalling 2,185,151 images.”</strong> It was added that the stolen data is being used, as with most instances like this, to “extort Discord”.</p>



<p>On October 3, Discord publicly announced that an “unauthorized party compromised one of Discord’s third-party customer service providers.” This incident, which happened in late September, had the following data impacted:</p>



<ul>
<li>Name, Discord username, email, and other contact details if provided to Discord customer support</li>



<li>Limited billing information, such as payment type, the last four digits of your credit card, and purchase history, if associated with your account</li>



<li>IP addresses</li>



<li>Messages with our customer service agents&nbsp;</li>



<li>Limited corporate data (training materials, internal presentations)</li>
</ul>



<p>Information such as full credit card and CCV numbers, private messages, passwords, and other authentication data wasn’t involved.</p>



<p>According to Discord’s own policies, ID submissions are supposed to be deleted after age verification is complete. </p>



<p><strong>“Discord and k-ID do not permanently store personal identity documents or your video selfies,” </strong>they say. <strong>“The image of your identity document and the ID face match selfie are deleted directly after&nbsp;your age group is confirmed, and the video selfie used for facial age estimation never leaves your device.”</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Discord for comment on how the company is looking to move forward and why so many age-verification photos were still within the company’s database. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>
