<p>Publisher Focus Entertainment has announced that Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 is officially in development. The game will once again be developed by Saber Interactive.</p>



<p>“Your duty is not done,” the publisher posted on social media. “We’re pleased to announce that the development for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 has officially begun…”</p>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 released <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17120/warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to favorable reviews</a> from both critics and players alike. A follow up to 2011’s Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine, the latest game has sold more than 5 million copies as of November 2024.</p>



<p>While it took 13 years between releases of the first two games, it shouldn’t be expected to take that long between Space Marine 2 and 3. That said, details on the next game are limited due to it being so early in development. More information on the game will be revealed at a later date.</p>

<p>MADFINGER Games has revealed the Winds of War update (0.3), coming soon to Gray Zone Warfare, an open-ended tactical extraction shooter released in April 2024. It’s a massive, community-led update that is positively packed with new features and changes, and as a fan of the game, I’m here for all of it.</p>



<p>At the heart of the update are changes to the game’s PvP mechanics, which will encourage players to actively engage in fights with one another. But beyond that, there are <strong>many </strong>features that will improve the game’s realism, quality of life, and accessibility.</p>



<p>Let’s dive into what we know about Winds of War, the next update for Gray Zone Warfare.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-paradigm-shift">Paradigm Shift</h2>



<p>I’ve already covered the PvP changes coming to Gray Zone Warfare in another walkthrough, so feel free to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-gameplay-loop-pvp/">check that one out here on Insider Gaming</a>.</p>



<p>I can’t stress how much the Winds of War update is filling me with anticipation for the future of Gray Zone Warfare. I recently sat down with MADFINGER Games’ Rick Lagnese to go through everything that’s coming to this stunning open-world tactical shooter, which has sold 1.5 million units since being released in April 2024.</p>



<p>The immersion and realism in Gray Zone Warfare is being bolstered in Winds of War.</p>



<p>For instance, the dynamic weather system is being introduced and fully fleshed out, and some of the effects, such as rain, are nothing short of jaw-dropping. Having seen them first-hand before the update was revealed, I can attest to the depth these mechanics will add to the open world of Lamang.</p>



<p>This weather system includes storms, fog, wind, and sun, and every setting has an impact on the game’s world. There’s even a forecast system that’ll allow you to plan your raids more effectively. </p>



<p>The team at MADFINGER has also updated the game’s health system and changed how you’ll fight and stay alive. The new mechanic that allows you to drag downed teammates into cover is something I’m very interested in.</p>



<p>On that note, playing as a squad will now offer an enhanced experience, with dynamic, real-time tasks popping up as you explore the game’s open world. These tasks will be much more challenging and will <strong>actively require </strong>a dedicated team for them to be completed, but similar events will also be up for grabs for solo operators.</p>



<p>In terms of accessibility, localisation has been expanded, with more translated content being available. The team has made sure that <strong>eleven </strong>languages are represented in the Winds of War update. </p>



<p>The quality-of-life change I’m most looking forward to is the ability to radio back to base when you’ve completed a task, rather than needing to call in a chopper and go back just to seek confirmation of completion. That’s a game-changer, and in the massive open-world environment of Lamang, it’s a sorely needed upgrade.</p>



<p>Oh, and MADFINGER is working to eradicate LZ camping in the Winds of War update, so look forward to that!</p>



<p>What change are you most looking forward to as part of the Winds of War update? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
