<p>Game Science revealed the first look at Black Myth: Zhong Kui at Gamescom Opening Night Live, a brand new game that follows on from the success of Black Myth: Wukong.</p>



<p>The reveal came right at the end of Gamescom, with Geoff Keighley keeping it as one last big reveal up his sleeve, announcing Game Science has begun development on the title.</p>



<h2 id="h-game-science-next-title-revealed-as-black-myth-zhong-kui">Game Science Next Title Revealed as Black Myth: Zhong Kui</h2>



<p>The trailer showed two brothers hiding from group, which included Zhong Kui riding on the back of a giant tiger. While the first-look trailer didn’t reveal too much about the title, it was more than enough to raise excitement in the audience given the vast success of Black Myth: Wukong.</p>



<p>Following the trailer, the <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a> provided more details on the game, explaining the decision to announce the title now was because of a “tradition to report our progress to players on every August 20.” However, it was made clear that the project is early in development and is “little more than an empty folder at this stage.”</p>



<p>Given the early stage of development, there is no rough release date for the game, with Game Science admitting “even Yocar himself has absolutely no idea,” and that it “looks like we’re not even done with the outline” of the story and gameplay.</p>



<p>Additionally, it was confirmed that Black Myth: Zhong Kui will release on PC and “all mainstream console platforms,” with final information provided closer to release. </p>



<p>Take a look at the reveal trailer below.</p>

<p>Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Yotei made a special appearance at Gamescom Opening Night Live with a brand new trailer. The sequel to 2020’s acclaimed Ghost of Tsushima, the game spearheads PlayStation’s first-party titles for 2025, releasing on October 2nd, 2025. If the trailer is anything to go by, it’ll be one for the history books. </p>



<p>Taking place over 300 years after Tsushima, Ghost of Yotei lets you play as Atsu, a vengeful mercenary, on a quest to kill the Yotei Six. With a variety of weapons at your disposal, you can charge or sneak into battle in a vast open world. We last saw the title in its own State of Play, but now, we get a bit more info thanks to Geoff Keighley and Gamescom.</p>

<p>In the new trailer for Ghost of Yotei, seen above, we see Atsu confront the Yotei Six, who killed her family and scarred her. On her quest to get redemption, she’ll travel Yotei and take those on who hurt her. As a stinger in the trailer, it was revealed that the free multiplayer Legends will come in 2026.</p>



<p>The game, while not having Tsushima’s Jin Sakai as the protagonist, will take a lot from it. Aside from the free roam and stealth/action combat, players will be able to approach situations however they want. This time, you’ll have new weapons like the chain-blade kusarigama and the spear-like yari.</p>



<p>Ghost of Tsushima, despite releasing in a packed 2020, was one of the year’s finest. The game won multiple accolades from various outlets and numerous Game of the Year nominations, including at <a href="https://thegameawards.com/rewind/year-2020">The Game Awards</a>. All that said, fans have high hopes that Ghost of Yotei will live up to Tsushima’s legacy.</p>
