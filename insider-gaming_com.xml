<p>Eminem will be featured in the next elusive target mission in Hitman: World of Assassination, available to purchase between December 1 and December 31. </p>



<p>We have seen many huge personalities enter the world of Hitman: World of Assassination, but Eminem might just be the biggest one yet. Eminem has recently taken a liking to gaming. We saw him earlier come as a skin and host an in-game concert in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-next-concert-will-feature-snoop-dogg-eminem-juice-wrld-and-ice-spice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, and now he has set foot in the world of Hitman.</p>

<p>Eminem will be the biggest highlight for the next Elusive Target mission in Hitman: World of Assassination. The artist will be a fellow operative for Agent 47, briefing him on his mission to help “untangle the twisted mind of Slim Shady.” The blog post’s character description states: “Eminem rose to his superstardom with the help of his alter ego, Slim Shady.” In his latest album, “The Death of Slim Shady,” the rapper tried to put his unhinged other self away, but it seems his past continues to haunt him.”</p>



<p>Players will explore psychological, dreamlike twists that mirror Slim Shady’s fractured reality in the new level. It is set in a medical facility in Hokkaido, which has been transformed into a Popsomp Hills Asylum.</p>



<p>Players as Agent 47 will be infiltrating this “surreal environment where doctors, patients, and performers blur into one.” Eminem will be found in a fully equipped broadcasting studio, where he delivers erratic live performances to a captive audience of staff and inmates. The mission will also feature Eminem-inspired details, including a poisoned Spaghetti Sandwich served in his restaurant. </p>



<p>The Eminem vs Slim Shady pack for Hitman: World of Assassination can be purchased for $4.99/€4.99/£3.99 from December 1 to December 31. It contains a new suit, four items, and home base cosmetics connected to the mission. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The creators of Little Nightmares, Tarsier Studios, shared a new look at Reanimal at Xbox Partner Preview. In addition to new gameplay, we now know the release date and a free demo.</p>







<p>While not much is known about the game, Reanimal looks like a darker version of Little Nightmares, which is pretty grim. A synopsis of the title says it follows a brother and sister as they escape a hellish version of their home and attempt to save their friends. The game can be played single-player or with a friend online or local. With a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarsier-studios-new-game-reanimal-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gory first teaser</a> last year, fans have been anxious to learn more. Fortunately, Xbox Partner Preview gave us a new look at Reanimal, as well as some new information.</p>



<h2 id="h-reanimal-releasing-on-february-13th-2026-free-demo-available-now">Reanimal Releasing on February 13th, 2026, Free Demo Available Now</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, shown above, we see new gameplay of Reanimal. The gory world looks incredible and is sure to bring in the scares. Furthermore, we finally get a release date for the title: February 13th, 2026. However, fans can get in on the action now with a free demo, available on Xbox Series X|S, PC, and PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>The demo will consist of Reanimal’s opening chapters, letting you and a friend explore the hellish scenery. If you were on the fence about the game, now’s the chance to try it out. The demo, as well as the release date, did leak prior to the announcement, but now it’s been confirmed.</p>



<p>Seeing as Tarsier Studios has been working on Reanimal for quite a while, it looks like it’s been worth the wait. The company did not work on Little Nightmares 3, which was released in October to mixed reviews. It’ll be interesting to see how similar and different it will be to the studio’s other titles.</p>







<p>What do you think of the new trailer for Reanimal? Excited for the February release date? Going to play the demo? Looking forward to it? Going in alone or with a friend? Let us know in the comments and on the official Insider Gaming!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new trailer for 007 First Light has been released during Xbox Partner Preview. The title, releasing on March 27th, 2026, looks to bring the films and books to life in a new way through an iconic car.</p>







<p>From IO Interactive, the creators of Hitman, 007 First Light is shaping up to be one of the biggest hits for next year. With an&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gemma-chan-announced-for-007-first-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all-star cast</a>, there’s a lot riding on it given the franchise’s pedigree. We’ve seen a lot so far thanks to the dedicated State of Play in September. Now, we have a lot more to go off of and it’s as thrilling as James Bond can be.</p>



<p>This article is currently in development and will be updated once more information is available.</p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-brings-aston-martin-valhalla-to-gaming">007 First Light Brings Aston Martin Valhalla to Gaming</h2>

<p>In the trailer for 007 First Light, shown above, we see James Bond driving an iconic brand from the series: the Aston Martin. Specifically, the car is the Valhalla, the company’s first-ever mid-engine PHEV hypercar. It will be one of many cars coming to the game.</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see how the game shapes up given it’s legacy. James Bond has been an icon in many media, especially gaming with Goldeneye. While it won’t reach those heights, bringing the series to life in a new way is always a good thing.</p>
