            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/amd-announces-new-ryzen-9000-cpus-at-ces-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>AMD has officially unveiled its new Ryzen 9000 CPUs during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJoaV5NnPtw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">its press event</a> at CES 2025 in Las Vegas.</p>



<p>AMD started with the reveal of the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D processors. Starting with the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, the high-end CPU features 16 cores with 32 threads. It also features up to 144MB in total cache thanks to 3D V-cache boosted CCDs (Core Chiplet Dies). Breaking the cache down, it’s 64MB Zen 5 CCDs and 64GB from X3D. There’s also 16mb L2 cache for the 144MB total. For everything it includes, the CPU carries a TDP of 170W.</p>



<p>The 9900X3D CPU comes in with a little less power, but not by much. The processor comes with 12 cores and 24 threads with 140MB of total cache and a 5.5GHz max clock speed. It has a TDP of 140W. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Ryzen 9 9950X3D</th><th>Ryzen 9 9900X3D</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cores</td><td>16</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Threads</td><td>32</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Max Boost</td><td>5.7GHz</td><td>5.5GHz</td></tr><tr><td>Total Cache</td><td>144MB</td><td>140MB</td></tr><tr><td>TDP</td><td>170W</td><td>140W</td></tr><tr><td>Release Date</td><td>Q1 2025</td><td>Q1 2025</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>TBA</td><td>TBA</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As far as performance is concerned, AMD says the new cards are up to 8% faster — on average — than the Ryzen 9 7950X3D. Some games like Black Myth Wukong only saw a  1% performance increase. Games like Counter-Strike 2, however, saw a 58% jump.</p>



<p>When comparing to Intel’s latest Core Ultra 285K CPU, AMD says the Ryzen 9950X3D sees an average performance increase of 20% at 1080p on high settings. Games like Final Fantasy 14, FarCry 6, and Watch Dogs: Legion were over 40% faster per AMD. Black Myth Wukong saw performance around the same while Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora performed slightly better.</p>



<p>Both of the new CPUs are scheduled to launch in March. An exact release date along with final pricing will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Intel isn’t leaving the discrete graphics card market anytime soon. During the company’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwYUiSXDZ5A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CES 2025 keynote</a> on Monday, Intel’s new co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus said that the company remains “committed” to the market moving forward.</p>



<p>“I get this question a lot,” Holthaus said. “We are very committed to the discrete graphics market, and we will continue to make strategic investments in this direction.”</p>



<p>Intel launched its latest Arc Battlemage graphics card, the B580, last month for $249. The entry-level card features 20 Xe2 cores, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM, and a 192-bit memory bus. The next Battlemage card, the B570, is scheduled to launch on January 16. That card will cost $219 and feature 10GB of GDDR6 VRAM and 18 Xe2 cores. </p>



<p>In addition to the new Battlemage cards, Intel is working on the next-gen Celestial and Druid cards. Those, however, are still years away. Intel has made it clear their goal isn’t to contend with cards like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 and 5090. Instead, they want to give budget conscious PC users more options.</p>



<p>What do you think of Intel continuing on with graphics cards? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/tech.9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>The Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls update is more star-studded than an all-star Avengers movie line-up, and we’ve got everything you need to know about the free-to-play shooter’s first major content injection.</p>



<p>Season 0 is coming to an end, sparking the beginning of a new chapter. Marvel Rivals has got off to a start so sharp even Blade would cower—joking, he would never do this. Rivals is the new kid on the block looking to stay and make its presence known until it matures into a wise Doctor Strange-esque figure. The first few weeks firmly established the hero shooter’s impressive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">player count</a>, but Season 1 is the first real test.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls isn’t make or break, but it could shape the F2P title’s future.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-release-date">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fantastic. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>January 10 is the start date for Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls</strong>, neatly coinciding with the end of Season 0.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals X</a> social media channel posted a <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1876297704340385803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message</a> on January 6 saying, “Season 1: Eternal Night Falls begins on Jan 10, 2025.”</p>



<p>If you’re familiar with any live-service shooter—Call of Duty, Fortnite, and Overwatch are common contemporaries—you’ll recognize the Battle Pass formula stays the same. Each pass has a counter showing you how many days are left. The final day allows the title to execute a seamless transition to the new season.</p>



<p>Some downtime or maintenance might happen, but otherwise, in this circumstance, we expect Marvel Rivals Season 0 to end with its timer on January 10, and Season 1 to get underway.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-start-time">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Start Time</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-arrives-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1’s Eternal Night Falls</a> commences at <strong>1 AM PST / 3 AM CT / 4 AM ET / 9 AM GMT</strong>.</p>



<p>Again, the verification comes straight from the same X status cited above. Check out the start time specific to you, make sure everything is updated and ready to go, grab some chips, and be heroic.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-heroes-in-marvel-rivals-eternal-night-falls">New Heroes in Marvel Rivals Eternal Night Falls</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-is-dropping-a-fantastic-4-trailer-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantastic Four</a> featuring <strong>Mr Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, and The Thing</strong> are the confirmed names making a spectacular entrance in Season 1. Also, <strong>Dracula</strong> has been outed as another potential character to use in the shooter.</p>



<p>We know this for definite as the Season 1: Eternal Night Falls Official Trailer&nbsp;showed off the fab foursome. </p>

<p>Microsoft has announced that it is bringing Xbox Cloud Gaming to LG Smart TVs. The <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/06/xbox-lg-smart-tv-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company says</a> that the deal will bring the feature to new LG Smart TVs later this year. </p>



<p>With Xbox Cloud Gaming, LG Smart TV owners who are Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will be able to stream games from the library within the gaming portal. In addition to games in the service, players will also be able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-cloud-streaming-of-own-games-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stream their select games</a> that they happen to own on the TVs.</p>



<p>“This gives players even more choice in how they enjoy their favorite games,” Corporate Vice President of Xbox Lori Wright said. “We’ll share more details on the Xbox Cloud Gaming experience with LG TV in the coming months.”</p>







<p>It’s currently unclear if any older models — those released in 2024 and sooner — will get access to the feature in the future.</p>
