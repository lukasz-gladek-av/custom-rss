<p>Remedy Entertainment has given fans and investors an update on all of its current games. The updates come via the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest earnings report</a> on November 1.</p>



<p>Starting with Alan Wake 2, it was reveal that it has made most of its development and marketing cost back since its release.</p>



<p>According to company CEO Tero Virtala, Alan Wake 2 has yet to “generate royalties”. The studio released The Lake House expansion on October 22, wrapping up post-launch plans for the game. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-about-the-other-remedy-entertainment-games">What About The Other Remedy Entertainment Games?</h2>



<p>With Alan Wake 2 in the rear view mirror, Remedy is continuing its focus on a number of projects internally. FBC: Firebreak, which was codenamed Condor at the studio, “continues in full production with a focus on iterating on the core loop and implementing more of the UI for more player clarity based on playtesting feedback.”</p>



<p>FBC: Firebreak is scheduled to launch in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass as well as the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for Extra and Premium subscribers. It will be self-published by Remedy and be a “mid-priced” title.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Control 2 remains in the production readiness stage with plans to enter full production in 2025.</p>



<p>“Many of the critical features of the game have been implemented to mitigate production risk, and workflows and pipelines are being  tested in preparation for full production,” Virtala said.</p>



<p>Lastly, the Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake continues in full production. No update on a potential release for that game was revealed.</p>

<p>First announced in 2010, Stalker 2 was originally scheduled to release in 2012. Unfortunately, due to studio closure, an eventual reformation, a restart of development, and numerous delays, fans have had to wait 15 years for the follow up to Stalker: Call of Pripyat.</p>



<p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl finally launches on November 20 for Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Xbox Game Pass. That exclusivity to the Xbox Series consoles is expected to be for at least three months.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-zombies-split-screen-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Zombies</a> brings the traditional round-based format back, and players have been digging their teeth into Liberty Falls and Terminus, reaching high rounds and discovering the Main Quest for both maps.</p>



<p>Treyarch love to hide little secrets and Easter eggs in Zombies, which have become an integral part of the experience in the mode. Speaking of which, you may have found Loot Keys in both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liberty Falls</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terminus</a> and wondered what they are and how to use them.</p>



<p>So, here’s what to do with Loot Keys in Black Ops 6 Zombies.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-loot-keys-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How to use Loot Keys in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>You can use Loot Keys to <strong>open safe deposit boxes in the Liberty Falls Vault and lockers in Terminus Armory</strong>. You can get different rarities of Loot Key. The higher the rarity, the better the loot will be in the respective caches.</p>



<p>If you’re lucky enough, you can earn yourself a free Perk, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wonder-weapons-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Weapon</a>, or even a Legendary weapon. You can also get Equipment, Scorestreaks, Salvage, and more. You can only open one safe deposit box or locker per Loot Key.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-loot-keys-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How to get Loot Keys in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>You can get Loot Keys in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a> Zombies via r<strong>andom drops from mini-boss enemies</strong> such as Manglers, Abominations, and Amalgams. Once you pick a Loot Key up, you’ll find it in your Personal Items inventory.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-liberty-falls-vault-combination-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How to get Liberty Falls Vault combination in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>The Vault is in the Liberty Falls Bank and you’ll need to enter the combination to enter it. You can find the combination by following these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>On the front desk of the Bank, you’ll find a yellow post-it note with a number and three blank spaces. This is the first number for the Vault combination. </li>



<li>You’ll find the second number in Fuller’s Liberty Lanes on the front desk just under the desk lamp to the right of the lanes.</li>



<li>The final number is in Olly’s Comics on the inside of the shelf in the middle counter area where the employee’s dead body can be found.</li>
</ol>



<p>Combine the numbers in the correct order and enter the combination at the Vault to open it and earn some great loot. </p>

<h2 id="h-where-to-use-loot-keys-in-terminus">Where to use Loot Keys in Terminus</h2>



<p><strong>You can use Loot Keys on Terminus in the Armory</strong>, which is located in the same room as Stamin-Up (lower floor of the Control Center). Here, you’ll see a door with some computers near it and a set of windows looking into the Armory. Simply walk to the door, enter the Armory, and use a Loot Key on one of the lockers to earn some loot.</p>



<p>You don’t need to do anything to unlock the Armory door, all you need to do is walk up to it and enter. Don’t worry about Zombies pilling up outside the Armory either, as once you leave a massive blast will eliminate Zombies in the area so you can get out scot-free.</p>
