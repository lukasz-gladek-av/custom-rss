<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is just getting into the hands of players, but Capcom has already revealed its plans for the game’s first title update.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2246340/announcements/detail/534343407476147236" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, the developers gave a first look at what players can expect when Title Update 1 releases. </p>



<p>Right off the bat, Capcom says that the update will arrive sometime in early April and will be free for all players. The timing, they say, allows players to have “enough time to prepare for the new content, and challenges”.</p>



<p>Speaking of challenges, the update will introduce a new monster “at a level above Tempered”. There will also be a new place for players who’ve completed the game’s main story to gather with other hunters.</p>







<p>More information on what else is coming in the update will be revealed as its release gets closer.  That will include any other new features being added as well as any fixes or changes to the game.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is available for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>
