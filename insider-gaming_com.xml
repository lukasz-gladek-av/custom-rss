<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows hits the open market tomorrow, and Japan’s government is eagerly discussing whether to address certain scenes in the game on a legal level. The most controversial scenes in Assassin’s Creed Shadows were revealed as Yasuke, an African samurai, desecrating and destroying shines, which drew intense blowback from the Japanese people.</p>



<p>In a Diet discussion today, the Japanese government – including Prime Minister, Ishiba Shigeru – brought up the question of what to do about Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ scandalous sequences.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-assassin-s-creed-issue">‘The Assassin’s Creed Issue’</h2>



<p>A report from <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2503/19/news167.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ITMedia</a> (circulated by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/japanese-government-addresses-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy-as-ban-rumors-spread-3165590/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>) breaks down the discussion in the Diet, which was centred around the legality of Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Hiroyuki Kata, a Lib Dem party member, raised concerns about ‘the Assassin’s Creed issue’, highlighting sequences that see Yasuke devastate a revered shrine in the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to ask about the Assassin’s Creed issue. </p>



<p>In the game, the samurai protagonist smashes drums, sacred mirrors, and altars inside the worship hall of a shrine that appears under its real name. He slashes at people who appear to be priests, shoots arrows, and engages in other violent mayhem. When I asked the chief priest, he said that the game company had not contacted the shrine to ask for permission to use the name.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stressed that the necessary bodies in Japan are ‘keeping an eye’ on the situation, as they’re intently concerned about possible copycat attacks on shrines across the country. The government is also concerned about tourist pollution, worried that the eventual success of Assassin’s Creed Shadows could see these shrines flooded with visitors.</p>



<p>Ishiba Shigeru, Japan’s Prime Minister, had some tough words on the matter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is absolutely unacceptable to graffiti a shrine. It is nothing but an insult to the country.</p>



<p>It is natural to have respect for the culture and religion of a country, and I think it is important to send out the message that we will not tolerate any behavior that does not respect the culture and religion of a country and will not tolerate it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The lobby found a clear issue with the destruction of Japanese culture and facilities in this game, claiming that it wasn’t possible to replicate such acts in previous games. It’s not clear what their plans are beyond monitoring the situation, but it was noted that the Prime Minister’s comments, however strict, aren’t indicative of further action.</p>



<p>Before this, the existence of Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows was also subject to intense speculation and scrutiny, with many highlighting his dubious and unclear historical position and the accuracy of his character. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-hardware-sales-continued-to-fall-in-february/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The state of video game hardware continues to be somewhat bleak across the board. After falling 45% year-over-year in January, video game hardware sales fell 25% year-over-year for February 2025.</p>



<p>The drop from $341 million to $256 million is the “lowest February total for video game hardware sales spending since the $184 million reached in February 2020”. That, according to Circana and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqaie744m2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">analyst Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>



<p>When looking into specifics, the PlayStation 5 (PS5) was the best-selling console in terms of both units sold and dollar amount. The Xbox Series systems came in second in both metrics.</p>



<p>Moving on to accessories, that also saw a fall of 8% from $248M to $228M year-over-year. After two months of sales data, accessory spending is 18% behind 2024’s pace. A big reason for that, according to Circana’s data, is that controller spending has fallen 17% and headset spending has dropped off 25%.</p>



<p>As far as what remains a top seller, the PlayStation Portal’s base model was February’s best-selling accessory in terms of dollars spent.</p>



<p>Seeing the continued trend of falling hardware sales shouldn’t be surprising to many in, and around, the industry. It seems pretty clear that players either already have the system they want or there’s simply a desire to spend their money elsewhere as a result of increased cost of living. </p>



<p>It should be expected that hardware sales will get an uptick during the year when Nintendo releases its highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 system in the coming months.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was the best-selling game of February 2025 in the United States (US), knocking Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 from the top spot after four months.</p>



<p>In the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqahyb5hk2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, four of the top five games from February were brand new releases. Coming in second was Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 while Civilization 7 and PGA Tour 2K25 were third and fourth, respectively. Rounding out the top five was NBA 2K25, which fell from second.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 finished sixth.</p>



<p>Regarding new game releases, six releases found their way into the top 10 for February after just one <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-was-january-2025s-best-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the top 20</a> in January. Aside from what was mentioned above, the other new games that made February’s list of best sellers were Avowed at seven and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii at eight.</p>



<p>Lastly, a number of games that found themselves near the top of the sales charts for months have continued to fall. In addition to the aforementioned Call of Duty and NBA 2K25, EA Sports College Football 25 has fallen out of the top 10 for the first time, coming in at 16th compared to seventh. The only game to stay in its same spot from month to month is Elden Ring at 18.</p>

<p>A game called Plants vs Zombies Reloaded has been rated by the Brazil rating board, sparking discussion that a remaster of the original could be in development.</p>



<p>The rating, which simply says “Plants vs Zombies Reloaded” was rated for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X, PC, Nintendo Switch, and mobile with an ‘L’ rating.</p>



<p>Plants vs Zombies was first developed and published by PopCap Games in May 2009 and later was acquired by EA in July 2011. Despite the initial game being a success and multiple spin-offs and a few sequels, the Plants vs Zombies community has criticized the developers for not replicating the success of the original game.</p>



<p>“I hope it means ea (or popcap idk if they can make decisions by themselves) will get his shit together to deliver a proper sequel in the future but at this point the mere thought of it falls into hopium territory, they fumbled the franchise so hard that it hurts,” said Reddit user kdk_2002.</p>



<p>“Thankfully you don’t have to even look to EA, I sure as hell don’t, since the fans have taken it upon themselves to continue PvZ and have made a plethora of great mods expanding upon PvZ1 and PvZ2. We’re eating good and not giving EA a dime, as it should be until they deliver something actually worth paying for,” said another user.</p>



<p>Would you welcome a Plants vs Zombies remaster? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
