<p>Prepare your lines and gather your bait; it’s time to test the upcoming Fallout 76 fishing update on the Public Test Server. Those using the PTS will now be able to head to The Mire and find Fisherman’s Rest, kickstarting the ‘Casting Off’ questline that teaches players the wonders of fishing in Fallout 76.</p>



<p>Getting your first fishing rod is only the start – there’s a whole world out there in this long-awaited update, including legendary fish, a range of bait and upgrades, and even collectable Axolotls. Bethesda Game Studios has gone so deep on the Fallout 76 fishing update that even the world’s weather can impact your chances of catching the best fish.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-casting-out">Casting Out</h2>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios is bringing fishing to Fallout 76 as a full-fledged micro ecosystem. It introduces new daily quests, collectables, and activities, adding another layer of entertainment to the post-apocalyptic endgame.</p>



<p>Players will be required to buy, loot, or unlock bait, which ranges from Common to Superb, then head to the various bodies of water around Appalachia to cast out and (hopefully) catch some great fish.</p>



<p>Naturally, this update unlocks new cooking recipes, as you can fish for the table as well as fish for prize catches that you can display around your C.A.M.P.</p>



<p><a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/FJGd9MX5Mkrg45M3eAoIk/inside-the-vault-fishing-in-appalachia-public-test-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a release</a>, Bethesda Game Studios revealed that common fish can be found all over the world, but each region will have specific fish locked to that zone. There are also variants scattered around in each region, such as ‘glowing’ fish.</p>



<p>Oh, and there are a dozen unique Axolotls to capture while fishing in the irradiated waters of West Virginia.</p>



<p>Those with a penchant for fishing will feel right at home with this Fallout 76 update. Your rod isn’t just practical but cosmetic, and with that in mind, you can tweak your rod style, bobbers, reels, and skins. The team has advised that some fish will be ‘near impossible’ to catch without upgrading your rod – so get grinding!</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the fishing update in Fallout 76? Let me know in the comments, or hit us up on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-new-deus-ex-game-pitched-by-eidos-montreal.1155606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-deus-ex-game-pitched-by-eidos-montreal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Eidos-Montreal wants to bring back Deus Ex, and it’s been looking for ways to do so. </p>



<p>While working on details regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-another-embracer-studio-suffers-large-scale-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent layoffs</a> at the Montreal, Quebec-based studio, it was learned that the company had been actively pitching to external partners and publishers a new Deus Ex game.</p>



<p>According to multiple sources close to the studio’s plans, Eidos-Montreal was pitching the new game regularly, but it hasn’t led to any commitments from publishers. </p>



<p>One source said that there was a belief from a couple possible partners that the series was “too niche” at this stage. Another said that it became clear after a few meetings that publishers aren’t willing to take on the financial risk that comes with the Deus Ex franchise at the moment.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Not much is known about the details behind this new Deus Ex game being pursued. However, it was said that the concept for the game had “charm and novelty”, but that it didn’t match up with the “expectations or standards typically associated with the Deus Ex brand”.</p>



<p>To make it clear, this game, sources say, is different from the one that had been in development for two years <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-cancels-deus-ex-game-lays-off-eidos-montreal-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before Embracer canceled</a> it in early 2024 as part of the parent company’s restructuring efforts. It was also said that the lack of agreement for the pitched game had nothing to do with the layoffs. Insider Gaming is working on more information surrounding what led to 75 people losing their jobs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Eidos-Montreal ahead of publishing this story. As of publishing, however, no response has been received. Should one come in, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty Warzone in 2025 has Verdansk, and the world is a better place for it. The best Meta Loadout in Warzone is the perfect combination of firepower, precision, and fun, and we’ve got it.</p>



<p>Warzone is partying like it’s 2020 again with the reintroduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/with-verdansk-return-call-of-dutys-player-count-jumps-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a>. Players wanted it for years, the community pleaded, and Activision listened. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-season-03-patch-notes-warzone-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 and Warzone 2 Season 3</a> brought back the nuked and nullified map. Veterans are hopping back in, and newbies are jumping into the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-warzone-casual-in-call-of-duty-battle-royale-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Mode</a> before getting the itch for full-scale, human-focused battle royale.</p>



<p>You need the right loadout once you’re ready for Normal and Ranked Warzone in Verdansk. I’m here to drop you our ultimate loadout. Forget multiple variations or options, as this is the best Warzone Meta loadout that should serve you well.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Tried and trusted. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>We think the CR-56 AMAX Assault Rifle is unbeatable and the best meta primary weapon to use in Warzone’s Verdansk battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>The AMAX has been a fan-favorite in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/warzone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warzone</a> before, and it’s still the same in 2025. Various trackers of Warzone gun data show the AMAX is the most-used gun and (debatably) the most powerful if you have the perfect loadout.</p>



<p>I know you’re here for it, so this is the optimal Warzone CR-56 AMAX Assault Rifle Meta Loadout for Verdansk:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Otero Red Dot</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Monolithic Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Gain-Twist Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Vertical Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Extended Mag II</li>
</ul>



<p>You might need to level up a bit to unlock these attachments, but rest assured, it’s worth it!</p>







<figure><figcaption>Good times are here again. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Our secondary weapon of choice is the HDR Sniper Rifle in CoD Warzone.</strong> </p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-hdr-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a> is back, and Sniping feels back, and you can one-shot-down players if you’re accurate. The HDR has incredible range, damage, and mobility, and it gives you an option at longer distances. While you can go with something smaller and nimble to assist the AMAX, we feel the AMAX is perfectly viable at close and mid-range.</p>



<p>We want a long-range option, and a one-shot gun at any distance is a no-brainer, so here’s the best loadout:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Monolithic Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Gain-Twist Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Combat Stock</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong> Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods:</strong> 108MM Suppressed</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>We’ve gone with the Survivor, Quick Fix, and Ghost Perks for our best Warzone Verdansk Meta Loadout.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick list showing our selections:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong> Survivor</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong> Quick Fix</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong> Ghost</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Survivor </strong>regenerates health quickly, and you revive allies faster. We think this is necessary for either solo or team-based play. We also need ways to survive and tank enemy damage, so Survivor gets the vote here.</p>



<p>For Perk 2, <strong>Quick Fix</strong> gets the nod, and it wasn’t a hard choice. This is another Perk based around health regeneration. Plus, it comes with the huge benefit of <strong>plating up with one hand</strong>—freeing you up.</p>



<p>Finally, the third slot goes to <strong>Ghost</strong>. It’s not quite as powerful as it was in the original Verdansk days, but we need it. As long as you’re on the move, you can’t be detected by UAVs or radar ping technology. Anything keeping us covert is fine by us.</p>







<p><strong><strong>Overkill is our Wildcard pick to equip a primary and secondary weapon.</strong></strong></p>



<p>The only other realistic contender is Gunfighter, but that’s being considerate to its feelings. If we’re being a cold-hearted killer like we want to be in Warzone, go with Overkill.</p>
