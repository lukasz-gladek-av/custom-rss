            <title><![CDATA[OpTic Comes Under Fire for Roobet Gambling Streams]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent weeks, OpTic’s most prolific creators, alongside the likes of Nadeshot, have come under intense scrutiny after jumping on board with Roobet, a crypto-based online casino. In streams featuring Scump and H3CZ, followers have been subjected to the OpTic team playing slots and games on Roobet, also taking their gambling activities to Kick.com.</p>



<p>It was just days ago that H3CZ and Scump revealed they’d secured a bag in an all-new Roobert partnership that predicated them setting up and hosting gambling livestream events, but fans are <strong>not happy</strong> and are venting on social media.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-scump-gambling-on-stream">Why is Scump Gambling on Stream?</h2>



<p>It wouldn’t be <strong>as bad</strong> for some, but many viewers have commented on how Scump, in particular, doesn’t appear to be genuine during his gambling streams and is not playing his part properly. He and H3CZ have started streaming certain slots on Roobet, hosting broadcasts that many assume are worth tens of thousands of dollars.</p>



<p>Roobet has previously partnered with other celebrities, so this isn’t new, but many are on the side of this being irresponsible by Scump, whose audience is mostly impressionable youngsters.</p>



<p>Nadeshot has also spent a few weeks dabbling in the gambling game, flying out to Mexico to circumvent laws in the United States that prohibit some gambling activity and broadcasting from there instead. He faced backlash after jetting out to Mexico to host gambling streams while 100 Thieves, the organization he founded, held layoffs.</p>



<p>It has been argued that OpTic’s endorsement of a gambling platform like Roobet sends a troubling message to reviews, especially considering the brand’s legacy and influence in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-amazon-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> esports space. It’s a well-known fact that <strong>betting </strong>makes up a huge portion of esports revenue, but slots are a different thing entirely.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Birdman was quick to address a spot of irony, suggesting that Pred was once removed from OpTic’s roster for having a prolific gambling problem:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">why did optic kick pred off the team just for them to get sponsored by roobet they tarnished that guys pr for nothing 😭😭😭</p>— Anthony (@omgitsbirdman) <a href="https://twitter.com/omgitsbirdman/status/1986972390522286156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a clip uploaded to Reddit, Scump and H3CZ were seen standing before a virtual slot machine and ‘feigning excitement’, running around the room, and screaming as the slot machine hit multipliers and bonuses.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The comments under the video were representative of the community sentiment around this situation. One wrote, ‘I don’t know how anyone can look at these two the same again. This is beyond cringe.’ Another said, ‘Been a fan for over a decade. I’m truly disappointed.’</p>



<p>Bag or no bag, this is an alienation step that doesn’t look good and will not be forgotten quickly by fans.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-prediction-grand-final-t1-vs-kt-rolster/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/t1-vs-kt-rolster-league-of-legends-worlds-2025-grand-final-preview-prediction.1347808/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Once again, it all comes down to this. The 2025 League of Legends World Championship tournament is about to culminate in a dream final: T1 vs. KT Rolster, two titans of the LCK. It’s a battle between the ultimate underdog and the reigning champions, and it’ll be a fight to determine <strong>a first Worlds win </strong>or <strong>another trophy in the expansive cabinet.</strong></p>



<p>We’re here to look at the match being dubbed a ‘Telecom War’ in Chengdu, the Grand Final of the League of Legends World Championship 2025. Read on to learn about the gravity of this match, what it means for League esports, and most importantly, which team is predicted to win.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-will-win-lol-worlds-2025">Who Will Win LoL Worlds 2025?</h2>



<p>T1 enters the battle on November 9 (depending on where you are) as the defending champion, chasing <strong>a third consecutive </strong>League Worlds championship and a record sixth win overall. Led by the iconic Faker, the team has weathered a pretty turbulent journey through the earlier stages, managing to peak when desperately required.</p>



<p>KT Rolster, meanwhile, is the hungry challenger and has made history just getting to the Grand Final. It’s the first time the organization has made it this far in League of Legends, and along the way, it required the squad to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kt-rolster-shatter-worlds-2025-finals-first-time/">take down one of the frontrunners</a> in Gen.G.</p>



<p>Will KT Rolster make history?</p>



<p>Faker (T1) vs Bdd (KT) presents an opportunity for a generational clash to take place. It’s experience versus aggression, and it’s a coin flip to decide which way it’ll go.</p>



<p>There’s a huge prize pool on the line, and the winning team will grab a $1 million portion of the pot. This series is more about legacy than it is about the financials, though.</p>



<p>While T1 certainly holds the edge in experience and championship pedigree, it’s KT that has the momentum and hunger that could carry a roster all the way. They’re dangerous, and that might put T1 on the defensive going into the match best-of-five.</p>



<p>I’m ultimately predicting that this will be a relatively close series, with T1 closing it out 3-2 and walking away with yet another LoL Worlds trophy, pushing Faker even deeper into the history books.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> which team you think will win LoL Worlds.</p>

<p>Use these Invincible Showdown monthly redeem codes for November 2025&nbsp; to get plenty of free cash and other items, allowing you to buy more powerful characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Invincible Showdown is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-heads-please-codes/">Roblox</a> fighting game inspired by the popular animated superhero TV series, Invincible. The game features all of the characters from the show, offering an added level of immersion to fans of both the show and Roblox. With realistic-looking abilities and deadly finishers involved, the combat gameplay of the game is one of the main reasons why it’s so highly rated. Players can also acquire and upgrade new abilities and skills in the game, which means that making cash as quickly as possible is of utmost importance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s exactly where these Invincible Showdown codes will be of aid. These can be used by anyone, irrespective of how far into the game they are, so players are urged to make use of all of them immediately, before they eventually expire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of the writing of this article, there is only one Invinvible Showdown code that has expired. However, as and when new codes are released, the older ones could be withdrawn. This makes the timely use of codes crucial to maximising the possible output. Here’s the expired code:</p>

</ul>

<figure><figcaption>Invincible Showdown Codes redemption page | Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unlike many popular Roblox games today, redeeming codes in Invincible Showdown requires players to complete an additional step by following Invincibly Group and liking the game on Roblox. Once that’s done, though, it’s as simple as navigating through the menus of the game and inputting one of the active codes into the text box that pops up. For players who may be new to the Roblox environment, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to redeem Invincible Showdown codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Follow Invincibly Group on Roblox and like the game</li>



<li>Launch Roblox and open up Invincible Showdown</li>



<li>Click the ‘Rewards’ button on the right side</li>



<li>Click the ‘Codes’ button</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Redeem Code’ button to receive your rewards</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-invincible-showdown-codes">How To Get More Invincible Showdown Codes</h2>



<p>New Invincible Showdown codes are usually released during updates or special events, mostly through the game’s official Discord server or Roblox game page. However, tracking these multiple times a month can be a hassle. Instead, we recommend that all users keep this page bookmarked, as we update it with new information as soon as any codes are dropped by the developers, making it the most efficient way for players to get the latest codes.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-8-881/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-881-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-saturday-november-8.1347649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the weekend, but don’t feel like you can relax until you’ve completed today’s NYT Connections puzzle! I’ve got the solutions and NYT Connections hints you need to dominate today’s puzzle, which happens to be pretty tricky. Before you roll into your weekend, scroll down and get the answers I know you’re looking for.</p>



<p>NYT Connections hints await!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-8">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 8)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #881:</p>



<ul>
<li>SIGN</li>



<li>SPY</li>



<li>STOP</li>



<li>ROBOT</li>



<li>SEAL</li>



<li>BODY</li>



<li>DELIVER</li>



<li>PRESENT</li>



<li>BEAM</li>



<li>PLUG</li>



<li>PROGRAMMING</li>



<li>CHING</li>



<li>GIVE</li>



<li>SPOKEN</li>



<li>CLOSE</li>



<li>PRONOUNCE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These all suggest <strong>obstructing or closing</strong> something</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each word implies <strong>offering or stating something publicly</strong></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are all <strong>forms or systems of communication</strong></em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each of these can follow <strong>“I” </strong>to form a phrase</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 8.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-8-881">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 8 (#881)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CLOSE, PLUG, SEAL, STOP</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DELIVER, GIVE, PRESENT, PRONOUNCE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BODY, PROGRAMMING, SIGN, SPOKEN</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BEAM, CHING, ROBOT, SPY</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
