<p>The true testament to an ARPG’s longevity is always in the endgame. While the campaign is an excellent appetizer, it’s often only meant to introduce the world, mechanics, and gameplay to new players. Once you complete the story mode, the game opens up. Thankfully, you don’t have to fret because Path of Exile 2 endgame activities offer hundreds of hours of playtime. It’s a lot to take in!</p>



<h2 id="h-exploring-the-endgame-in-path-of-exile-2">Exploring the Endgame in Path of Exile 2</h2>



<p>Once you finish the multi-act campaign in Path of Exile 2, the game opens up with various endgame activities. You can explore unique biomes, uncover robust crafting mechanics, challenge optional bosses, and run mysterious dungeons with varying difficulty levels, challenges, and rewards. </p>

<p>The game’s endgame includes Trial of the Sekhemas, The Trial of Chaos, Breach, Expedition, Ritual, Delirium, and the Pinnacle Threats.</p>



<h3 id="h-trial-of-the-sekhemas">Trial of the Sekhemas</h3>



<p>If you intend to evolve your class with one of the many available Ascendencies, you must run The Trial of Sekhemas—a challenging gauntlet that tests your resolve. It features rogue-like mechanics, with every room posing a unique trial, and every floor offers a potent boss fight at the end. The rewards will help you push to new heights, though.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-trial-of-chaos">The Trial of Chaos</h3>



<p>Throughout the Vaal Jungle, you’ll uncover the Temple of Chaos, another test that allows you to unlock class Ascendencies. To gain access, you require a token from the Trialmaster. From there, every room within the ordeal poses a hazard to your health, and you can go double or nothing on rewards.</p>



<h3 id="h-breach">Breach</h3>



<p>An endgame Breach is a portal from another dimension in which demons and monsters await. Upon entering a Breach, you will bridge the worlds and enter the opposing realm, slaying demons to keep the Breach open while unlocking XP and rewards for killing mobs.</p>



<h3 id="h-expedition">Expedition</h3>



<p>Expeditions task you with uncovering rare artifacts dug up using explosives. But the site isn’t clear of enemies, which means you’ll utilize your class abilities to punish corpses and put down monsters before reclaiming artifacts from the area. The more you uncover, the more mobs you draw to the dig site. </p>







<h3 id="h-ritual">Ritual</h3>



<p>Scattered across Wraeclast, you’ll discover Ritual Altars built by the King in the Mists. These altars require a tribute in the form of monster kills, which feed the ritual site and resurrect the King in the Mists’ dark forces. You’ll squash everything in sight for mighty rewards.</p>



<h3 id="h-delirium">Delirium</h3>



<p>Endgame maps in Path of Exile 2 may occasionally succumb to Delirium, in which a mysterious entity reworks the zone, creating a nightmarish landscape. The longer you remain in the Delirium, the greater the rewards, but the more powerful the enemies you face with every passing minute.</p>



<h3 id="h-pinnacle-threats">Pinnacle Threats</h3>



<p>As you explore the various areas in PoE2, you’ll encounter a Fortress of flame and ash, with a maze full of mystery, danger, and potential rewards. If you’re willing to venture into Pinnacle Threats, you’ll be rewarded for your efforts, but the challenge is not without perils that could end your adventure.</p>

<p>As if things couldn’t get more interesting for Ubisoft, the company now finds itself with a lawsuit on its hands. Unions at Ubisoft Barcelona have sued the French publisher over its recent return to office mandates.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-ubisoft-barcelona-unions-file-lawsuit-against-return-to-office-mandate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a> (GIBiz), the unions — for both AAA and mobile teams —  are demanding Ubisoft ensure protections for remote work and walk back the recent policy changes. </p>







<p>The changes that were announced back in September mandated that all Ubisoft employees work in office <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-mandating-3-days-in-office-for-all-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at least three days per week</a>. At the time, Ubisoft said these changes were being done to “enhance creativity and teamwork”. Under the old remote work policy, employees were able to chose up to 60% of days to be worked remotely. On top of that, there were also fully-remote workers on staff. The new mandate was to be followed by all employees, even t hose with prior full-time remote agreements.</p>



<p>According to the unions via GIBiz, the change by Ubisoft was done “suddenly and without transparency”. It would also “create logistical problems as offices aren’t prepared to accommodate all remote workers at once.”</p>



<p>It was added that both parties were ready for negotiations. However, Ubisoft management hadn’t submitted a proposal before the lawsuit was filed on October 14.</p>



<p>Ubisoft has yet to comment on the lawsuit.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ubisoft being sued by union employees over their return to office mandate? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

<p>PlayStation is set to release black variants of three premium accessories: the DualSense Edge, the Pulse Elite, and the Pulse Explore, according to reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ces-accessoires-ps5-sortiront-bientot-dans-un-tout-nouveau-coloris-59696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>.</p>



<p>At the moment, these accessories are only available in standard white, with the exception of the DualSense Edge, which has received a 30th anniversary version.</p>



<p>As well as revealing that Sony is working on these new variants, billbil-kun went further, revealing the price of each of the products:</p>



<ul>
<li>DualSense Edge wireless controller – Black: €239.99 / £209.99 / US$199.99.</li>



<li>Pulse Elite wireless headphones – Black: €149.99 / £129.99 / US$149.99.</li>



<li>Pulse Explore wireless headphones – Black: €219.99 / £199.99  / US$199.99.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-when-the-announcement-may-happen">When the announcement may happen?</h2>



<p>PlayStation’s 30th anniversary will be on December 3rd, so there’s no better time to announce these new versions.</p>



<p>If they follow the pattern, the announcement should be made on the PS Blog followed by posts on social media.</p>



<p>Of course, fans aren’t waiting for an announcement of new accessory colors. The community has long been demanding an event with the next PS5 exclusives. With The Game Awards approaching, maybe PlayStation will surprise everyone there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-classes-are-available-in-path-of-exile-2-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>While the full release of Path of Exile 2 will feature a total of 12 playable classes with 36 Ascendancies to choose from, the Early Access launch on December 6 will not. It will include access to six playable classes—a mere handful of the potential. By the time we’re done with EA, we’ll all have mastered these six classes. Here’s what you can play as!</p>



<h2 id="h-six-path-of-exile-2-early-access-classes">Six Path of Exile 2 Early Access Classes</h2>



<p>On Early Access launch, we’ll receive a nice variety of classes, from your Strength-based Warrior to the Intelligence-favoring Witch, along with the Monk and Mercenary, which should offer unique playstyles. But most players will likely opt for Ranger or Witch on their first playthrough. Both classes are staples of the franchise.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Warrior</strong>
<ul>
<li>Titan</li>



<li>Warbringer</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Sorceress</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stormweaver</li>



<li>Chronomancer</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Ranger</strong>
<ul>
<li>Deadeye</li>



<li>Pathfinder</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Monk</strong>
<ul>
<li>Invoker</li>



<li>Acolute of Chayula</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Mercenary</strong>
<ul>
<li>Witchhunter</li>



<li>Gemling Legionnaire</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Witch</strong>
<ul>
<li>Blood Mage</li>



<li>Infernalist</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>So, six classes, each with two Ascendancies to test out. You can easily spend a few hundred hours playing through the most basic class builds across each playable class. Then, you can turn around and mess about with your very own build, mixing and matching skills and passives to create a workable prototype before full release!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-class-to-play-first-in-path-of-exile-2">What Class to Play First in Path of Exile 2?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, let’s get this out of the way. Path of Exile 2 is a massive ARPG offering countless viable build and playstyle paths, with every class in the game capable of pushing end-game content. As such, you should choose to play whichever class speaks to you, whether you want a high-damage glass cannon or a tank worthy of defeating any of the optional bosses in the game.</p>



<p>But if you’d like a recommendation, then we suggest you play as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Witch</li>



<li>Mercenary</li>



<li>Ranger</li>
</ul>



<p>Witch is always a fan-favorite, Mercenary is new to the sequel and shows a lot of promise, and Ranger, while initially weak, winds up as a powerful and hard-hitting solo class that’s easy to manage from the jump.</p>



<p>Hop into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a> to tell us which class you intend to play! Maybe—just maybe—you’ll find someone to party up with for the game’s six-player co-op!</p>
