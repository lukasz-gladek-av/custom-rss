<p>Battlefield 6 has been out for nearly a week, and Electronic Arts (EA) is calling it the biggest launch in series history.</p>



<p>In a press release posted on the studio’s website, EA says that Battlefield 6 has sold “over 7 million copies and counting” since release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. They added that there have been over 172 million online matches played with over 15 million hours watched during the first weekend.</p>



<p><strong>“First and foremost we want to thank our players,” </strong>Battlefield general manager Byron Beede <a href="https://news.ea.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/Battlefield-6-Shatters-Records-Becoming-the-Biggest-Launch-in-Franchise-History/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in the release</a>. <strong>“Battlefield 6 was built with our fans. From the initial concept through to the implementation of Battlefield Labs and into the record-shattering Open Beta we have been obsessed with player feedback. Together, with our players we’ve had a singular goal: to craft the best Battlefield ever. And this is just the beginning – our first season of new content is just 12 days away.”</strong></p>
