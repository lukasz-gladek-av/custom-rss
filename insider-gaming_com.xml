<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released in one month, and fans are <strong>excited</strong>. It’s a solid return to Raccoon City as <strong>both </strong>Leon Kennedy and Grace Ashcroft, and it’s a diverse title shot from two perspectives – first- and third-person. It also features the kind of dual story that has been seen in the series before, with Leon and Grace exploring the same locations at different times.</p>



<p>In a recent walkthrough by Xbox Wire, the nature of this duality is perfectly portrayed. While Leon Kennedy is a combat master and a powerhouse of the apocalypse, Grace Ashcroft is, by all accounts, demure and frightened – but <strong>willing to survive</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-leon-cracks-skulls-grace-kind-of-avoids-them">Leon Cracks Skulls, Grace Kind of Avoids Them</h2>



<p>The mixed perspective available in Resident Evil Requiem effectively makes this ‘two games’, as recently explained <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/26/resident-evil-requiem-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Xbox Wire</a>. Grace’s journey puts players in control of a timid, terrified individual with a tighter inventory, a lack of combat experience, and the clear inability to take down the game’s heftier enemies.</p>



<p>Leon, on the other hand, is blasting the undead and tearing enemies to shreds (even ones Grace can’t touch) while offering quips and one-liners.</p>



<p>When you assume control of Grace, you’re taking a more investigative approach, and combat is more of a last resort than a first approach. Leon flips that script and weilds chainsaws, a hatchet, and hands and feet that must be registered as lethal weapons somewhere to dispatch all comers.</p>



<p>Xbox Wire referred to Leon’s sections of the game as ‘big, loud, and dumb, and a relieving change of pace’ compared to Grace’s slower, methodical approach that orders you to think twice about every door you open and every corner you turn.</p>







<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on February 27. Let us know which character you’re most excited to control on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[How Much Does YAPYAP Cost? Price, Explained]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>YAPYAP is talking aloud, as it could be a huge indie hit, and wants everyone’s attention. Its yapping is literal, but one thing it’s remained silent on is the pricier tag.</p>



<p>The genre of games that includes hit titles such as Lethal Company, REPO, and PEAK has lovingly been titled ‘Friendslop.’ Seen as cheap and easy-to-make indie titles with a pure multiplayer appeal, centered around bedlam and busy work. It’s harsh, but it doesn’t matter when the games are so much fun. Besides, plenty of people seem to like them! <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-official-release-date-countdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YAPYAP</a> looks to be the first of many ‘Friendslop’ games in 2026, and its concept means it could be the best.</p>



<p>However, a quick dive into YAPYAP’s price first is on the cards.</p>







<h2 id="h-do-we-know-yapyap-s-price">Do We Know YAPYAP’s Price?</h2>

<p><strong>So far, Maison Bap has yet to reveal YAPYAP’s price across any of its social media, and Insider Gaming has also tried reaching out for an early sneak peek at the price, to no avail.</strong></p>



<p>Either Maison Bap is keeping its cards close to its chest until YAPYAP’s launch, or the developer simply sees no reason to let people know. There’s nothing wrong with this, and it’s something many indie games on Steam opt for.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will keep checking for price updates, so check back to this guide. If you hear or see nothing, it’s probably a case of waiting until release day to find out.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-yapyap-expected-to-cost">How Much Is YAPYAP Expected To Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A magical price tag surely awaits. Credit to Maison Bap</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A reasonable price tag of between $7.99 and $9.99 is expected for YAPYAP.</strong></p>



<p>There’s a similar trending price tag for these types of games, and based on YAPYAP’s first trailer and announcements, it’s safe to assume the game will go in a similar direction to those that have come before it.</p>



<p>For example, Lethal Company’s RRP on Steam is $9.99 or £8.50, PEAK is $7.99 or £6.39, and REPO has also opted for the $9.99 or £8.50 approach.</p>



<p>Unless there’s a staggering amount of work and production that has gone into YAPYAP, you should expect to pay no more than $9.99 for YAPYAP.</p>



<p>Never say never in this industry. How much do you think YAPYAP will end up costing? Drop your guesses via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>
