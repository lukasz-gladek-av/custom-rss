<p>The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have suffered a massive leak, with datamined information revealing details about the Gen 10 games, seemingly called Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves. </p>



<p>With just a few days left for the release of Pokémon Legends Z-A, the upcoming game has already suffered from a massive leak, with its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pokedex-leaked-in-full/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokedex surfacing online</a> in its entirety. However, the leaks haven’t stopped there, as the new datamined information mentions the Gen 10 Pokémon Game, Winds and Waves. Players should know that the leaked documents are from 2021, so everything is subject to change. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-winds-and-waves-will-infinity-as-the-theme">Pokémon Winds and Waves Will ‘Infinity’ As the Theme</h2>



<p>Thanks to a reputable source, CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977756558495731892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), several new details from the Pokémon Leak are surfacing online, including details about the Gen 10 title. The first thing is the name, which will be Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves. The upcoming game’s theme is Infinity and will be directed by Shigeru Ohmori, who is known for his work on games like Sun and Moon, Sword and Shield, and the Latest Scarlet and Violet. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="de" dir="ltr"><p>Pokémon Gen 10: </p><p>Pokémon Wind and Pokémon Waves<br>Theme: Infinity<br>Directed by Shigeru Ohmori</p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977756558495731892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The datamined information also states that the game’s original setting is Indonesia and Southeast Asia, contrary to previous information that pointed to Greece. </p>



<h2 id="h-gen-10-legendary-pokemon">Gen 10 Legendary Pokémon</h2>



<p>Coming to Legendary Pokémon, machine translation states that there are two of them, Package Storm and Package Wave. Package Storm’s role is that of an old man who possesses the power of the wind to properly guide humans and Pokémon. It lives on an island that keeps humans away and only accepts humans who have correctly raised seed Pokémon. The wave package is slightly different; its role is that of an old woman and possesses the power of waves to properly guide humans and Pokémon. The rest of the details are the same. </p>



<h2 id="h-new-battle-mechanic-and-seed-pokemon-systems">New Battle Mechanic and Seed Pokemon Systems</h2>



<p>Coming on to Pokémon Gen 10, Winds and Waves, mechanics, and systems. The game will feature a new battle mechanic called Tenko-Waza, which can be translated as Weather Moves. The other system is the Seed Pokémon system, where a baby Pokémon of the Seed species can be found in resort areas. </p>



<p>The Seed Pokémon are the unevolved form of Pokémon that are rare in sight. It evolves when it travels to the island where the legendary Pokémon resides, and its evolutions are said to have infinite variations. Furthermore, it seems every Pokémon can be ridden or touched in the upcoming title. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-winds-and-waves-characters-and-plot">Pokémon Winds and Waves Characters and Plot</h2>



<p>The new leaks also reveal the characters and story in the upcoming Pokémon Gen 10 title. Starting with the protagonists, they are 13 years old, a city kid living in Kuala Lumpur who travels on vacation after their mother wins a lottery. The mother is 33 years old, raising two children, and is looking forward to the vacation. There is a baby who is said to be 0 years old; they cannot walk or talk, but learn to do so by the end of the story, “symbolizing the future”. </p>



<p>Next up is the friend, a local child residing on the resort island who serves as the protagonist’s rival. The child is knowledgeable about Pokémon and nature and becomes friends with the main character. Then we have the chairman of the hotel group who whos many resorts nationwide, their goal was for people and Pokémon to coexist with nature, but after their child was killed by a pokemon, they started hating them. </p>



<p>Then we have the ‘Heir’, who is the chairman’s child and also an executive in the organisation. The game doesn’t say it clearly, but their older brother has died, and they are either the second son or adopted. Then we have the evil team, or the ‘Land Development Team’, which destroys nature and expands land for profit. Lastly, we have the professor who is 21 years old, researching the relationship between weather and Pokémon.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-winds-and-waves-could-have-an-mmo-lobby-and-players-can-explore-underwater-and-procedurally-generated-islands">Pokémon Winds and Waves Could Have an MMO Lobby, and Players Can Explore Underwater and Procedurally Generated Islands</h2>



<p>Coming to the next bit, the upcoming title seems to start in a big tourist city rather than a small town. The adventure is set in a big resort hotel that apparently serves as a large MMO lobby, where players can see and interact with other players and access quest boards. However, this detail is from early development and could have been scrapped by Game Freak by now. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers want to tackle a jungle environment in the Pokémon Gen 10 game, which hasn’t been fully explored in past games. Moreover, players will have the ability to explore underwater. Sticking to the infinity theme, the game will seemingly feature procedurally generated islands, meaning the region is “technically infinite” and ever-changing. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-gen-10-budget-leaks-online">Pokemon Gen 10 Budget Leaks Online</h2>



<p>Details about the development budgets for past, present, and upcoming Pokémon titles have surfaced online. The development budget for Scarlet and Violet DLC was 500 million Yen, the budget for Pokémon Legends Z-A was 2 billion yen, and the budget for Pokémon Winds and Waves is set at 3 billion yen. </p>



<p>Players should take all the leaked and datamined information with a grain of salt. Moreover, as the leaked documents are years old, any of the details mentioned above could have been scrapped or changed by now. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Longevity shouldn’t be an issue in Battlefield 6 as the FPS has hundreds of challenges. From guns to general combat, there’s so much for you to do and keep on top of. It’s made slightly difficult when a few Battlefield 6 challenges don’t track, though, so let’s find out everything we know about why this is happening.</p>



<p>You’re not short of content and things to do in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-reasons-you-should-buy-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>. Between its Mastery Camos and Challenges, you’ve got stuff to keep you going until Battlefield 9 (slight hyperbole) at this point. At launch, BF 6 faced Challenge issues with the community complaining about certain objectives not tracking.</p>



<p>If this applies to you, we’ve got the latest from EA on the cause and potential fixes.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-challenges-not-tracking-issues-explained">Battlefield 6 Challenges Not Tracking Issues, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So many spinning plates mean some must fall. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>EA’s Community Manager has said: “Battlefield 6 is a live game, and some issues are expected at release.” This is the explanation for any challenges incorrectly tracking in Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not the deepest explanation ever, unfortunately, but it makes sense. You can do alpha and beta tests, as well as general open betas, all you want, but the fact is that mistakes can slip through the cracks with a game of this size, offering as much content as it does. </p>



<p>Expect them to be fixed when the devs get a chance.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-battlefield-6-challenges-are-not-tracking">Which Battlefield 6 Challenges Are Not Tracking?</h2>



<p><strong>Resupplying teammates and using Supply Crates are some examples of Challenges not tracking and working as they should in BF 6.</strong></p>



<p>As of October 13, these are the challenges currently not tracking properly in Battlefield 6, according to <a href="https://forums.ea.com/blog/battlefield-game-info-hub-en/info-battlefield-6---known-issues-1-0-1-0/12728456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA’s Community Manager</a> EA_Leeuw:</p>



<ul>
<li>“Challenges: “Resupply teammates with the Supply Pouch” is not tracking progress.</li>



<li>Challenges: The Progress bar for “Repair Vehicles” does not update when repairs are made.</li>



<li>Challenges: “Use Vehicle Supply Crate” does not progress even after completing the action.</li>



<li>Challenges: The Weapon Expert Unit Challenge is not tracking correctly. The description says you must “Get a kill with each type of weapon in a match,” but the actual requirement is to get 15 longshot kills in a single match.</li>



<li>Assignments: Helicopters are incorrectly counted as Ground Vehicles in the “Land Vehicle Expert“ assignment.</li>



<li>Assignments: Helicopters are not counted properly in Vehicle Challenge 1.”</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s every chance that as Challenges are fixed, more become broken: It’s the glorious roundabout of online FPS gaming. We’ve seen it for years with Call of Duty, and we fear that you Battlefield 6 players won’t have everything your own way. So keep your eyes peeled for more updates and patches for the Challenges not tracking.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-battlefield-6-challenges-be-fixed">When Will Battlefield 6 Challenges Be Fixed?</h2>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 Challenges will be updated and fixed in “future updates.”</strong></p>



<p>This information also comes from EA’s Community Manager. The only thing we can do is wait for more updates and patch notes. They will tell us what is being fixed, and checking the <a href="https://x.com/battlefieldcomm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Comms</a> page is another way to see what the devs are working on.</p>



<p>Get down into the comments below and let us know if you’ve found any other Challenges that aren’t tracking, unrelated to the ones mentioned above. Also, head to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a> if there are more Battlefield 6 problems causing you a tank-sized headache.</p>
