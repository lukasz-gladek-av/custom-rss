<p>A brand new season in Marvel Rivals has arrived with the launch of Season 6, and with it comes the usual balancing update full of fresh nerfs and buffs. </p>



<p>Season 6 of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-players-can-now-buy-gift-items-directly-from-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> features many tweaks fans have long called for, along with an update to Team-Up Abilities. Some new ones have been added, whilst a couple have instead been removed. </p>







<p>If you’re looking for the full breakdown of nerfs and buffs coming alongside Season 6 of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deadpool-is-marvel-rivals-most-versatile-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>, then you’re in the right place—it’s all available below.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A flurry of nerfs is coming. Image by NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Season 6 offers a large variety of balance changes, though the likes of Star-Lord and Hela manage to evade nerfs despite their OP nature.</strong></p>



<p>A handful of Vanguards have seen some notable buffs, including the likes of Doctor Strange, Hulk and Emma Frost. Hulk has received a variety of cooldown improvements, whilst Doctor Strange has been given some movement adjustments to his Cloak of Levitation. Meanwhile, Angela is slightly easier to deal with, now that her shield value has dropped from 350 to 300.</p>



<p>Duelists have seen some hefty changes, too, with Black Panther and Iron Fist both receiving buffs. Diving the backline should be slightly easier now, thanks to some damage increases to some of their abilities. Blade has seen some tweaks, as you’ll need to choose between your weapons more carefully. Sadly, though, Daredevil is the main target for nerfs, as the Devil of Hell’s Kitchen was running riot last season. </p>







<p>Finally, the Strategists have come out the worst with Season 6’s balance changes, as the likes of Rocket Raccoon, Invisible Woman, and Gambit have all been nerfed. Rocket Raccoon has been slowed down slightly during his Wild Crawl, whilst Sue Storm’s Guardian Shield has dropped from 250 to 200 health. Gambit’s overall healing output has been lowered, as NetEase look to weaken his cards.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals Season 6 is here, and based on the Roadmap released by NetEase, it’s going to be a content-heavy season.</p>



<p>Of course, nobody needs a roadmap to know that the Merc with a Mouth is the latest hero to join the ever-growing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-cosmic-invasion-characters-how-to-unlock-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel</a> Rivals roster. Deadpool will arrive with the launch of Season 6, but there’s much more to come than just a new character.</p>







<p>Check out the Marvel Rivals Season 6 Roadmap below, which details all of the upcoming content and when you can expect it to release. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-marvel-rivals-season-6-content-amp-roadmap">All Marvel Rivals Season 6 Content &amp; Roadmap</h2>

<p><strong>NetEase has revealed the Season 6 Roadmap for Marvel Rivals, which features a myriad of content, from new maps and heroes to skins and events.</strong> </p>



<p>Here’s the complete roadmap for Season 6:</p>



<h3 id="h-january-16-season-6-release">January 16—Season 6 Release </h3>

<li>New Team Ups: Parker Power Up &amp; Mr Pool’s Interdimensional Toy Box</li>



<li>New Event: Whac-A-Jeff</li>

</ul>

<figure><figcaption>She’ll be joining the roster soon. Image by NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Not too much is known about what you can expect from Marvel Rivals Season 6.5, but one thing is clear: Elsa Bloodstone is on the way. </strong></p>



<p>NetEase has confirmed that Elsa Bloodstone will be the next playable hero in Marvel Rivals. She’ll be joining the roster on February 13, when Season 6.5 kicks into gear.</p>







<p>If you’re not familiar with who Else Bloodstone is, then don’t worry. She’s a relatively new figure in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-blade-dev-is-super-proud-of-special-game-its-creating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel universe</a>, as she first appeared in Bloodstone #1 in 2001. Elsa is a British monster hunter who gains her powers from her father’s magical bloodstone choker. </p>



<p>As things stand, it’s unknown what her role will be in Marvel Rivals, but judging by her gun and sword combo, the odds are she will most likely arrive as a Duelist. Considering she hunts monsters for a living, she should have no trouble going toe-to-toe against the rest of the heroes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>007 First Light devs have now released an updated set of PC System requirements after the community pointed out several errors. </p>



<p>IO Interactive’s next big title, 007 First Light, is all set to release on May 27, 2026, across all major platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC. The title was initially set to release in March, but it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-delay-may-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed late last year</a>, providing the devs enough time to refine and polish the build. Check out the PC System requirements for 007 First Light below to see if your PC is capable of running the title. </p>







<h2 id="h-updated-007-first-light-pc-system-requirements">Updated 007 First Light PC System Requirements </h2>



<p>In a new post on <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2011735420631982151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the developers of 007 First Light have admitted there were a few “inconsistencies” in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-pc-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously released</a> PC system requirements. The recommended RAM has been reduced to 16GB from 32GB, and the error in the minimum CPU line, which previously stated “Intel Core i5 9500K” (K being the issue), has been updated as well. The VRAM has also been reduced for both sets of requirements. Additional performance targets for the title will be shared closer to launch. Check out the updated set of PC system requirements for 007 First Light below: </p>



<h3 id="h-minimum">Minimum: </h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel Core i5 9500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new rumor has emerged online suggesting that Fortnite may be collaborating with Minecraft.</p>



<p>Fortnite is a major player in the realm of collaborations within the gaming industry, partnering not only with various media franchises but also with different games. In the past, we have seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-rare-fortnite-skins-that-need-to-return-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters from iconic games</a> such as God of War, Halo, Street Fighter, Resident Evil, and more appear in Fortnite. Now, it appears the devs may be collaborating with one of the largest games of all time, Minecraft.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-minecraft-seemingly-in-early-development">Fortnite x Minecraft Seemingly in Early Development </h2>



<p>The information about Fortnite’s Minecraft being in early development comes from <a href="https://x.com/AdiraFNInfo/status/2011541834959671372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> user (formerly Twitter) AdiraFNInfo, which was reposted by reliable Fortnite leaker <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/2011542845010952494" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>. However, HYPEX’s post has the word ‘rumored’ in it, which means that they haven’t been able to confirm whether this is indeed true. At the same time, if this is true, it could go down in the books as one of the biggest Fortnite collaborations of all time. </p>



<p>Fortnite has definitely levelled up their collaborations game over time, from just introducing skins, to introducing mythics and special abilities, and now designing their Island inspired by the collab. If Minecraft gets a similar treatment, we might see the Island adopt Minecraft’s unique art style. We could also see skins like Steve and other items make it into the game. However, this is just speculation, and readers should take this information with a massive grain of salt. </p>







<p>In other news, another claim states that Fortnite could be collaborating with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-office-x-fortnite-collaboration-could-be-coming-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Office</a>. Additionally, here are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch notes</a> for the January 9 39.20 update.
