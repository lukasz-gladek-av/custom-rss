<p>PlayStation Plus subscribers will be able to access Undisputed, the latest attempt at a realistic boxing game, for free starting in February 2026.</p>



<p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-voici-le-titre-phare-de-la-selection-de-fevrier-2026-60911" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/undisputed-review-redefining-the-boxing-game-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Undisputed </a>will be the flagship PlayStation Plus free game for February 2026. Undisputed was released in October 2024 on PlayStation and Xbox after years of being an early access title on Steam.</p>



<p>Undisputed sets out to bring dream fights to the ring with everyone from Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali to Buster Douglas and Jake Paul. Even Lupe Fiasco’s in the game.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>The game currently has a mixed reaction on Metacritic with a 70 Metascore. The user rating is a little more unforgiving, currently at 4.8. Some reviews knock the game for being buggy and urge others not to buy. Well, PlayStation Plus users won’t have to buy the game in February if they want to try it out. </p>



<p>Currently, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed and Need for Speed Unbound are available to download for free on PlayStation Plus.</p>

<p>The latest trailer for the Super Mario Galaxy movie reveals a couple of fan-favorite characters. Also, it shows that the upcoming film has taken more inspiration from recent Mario games than was once believed.</p>



<p>In a special Nintendo Direct specifically for the Super Mario Galaxy movie, Shigeru Miyamoto revealed the latest trailer for the upcoming film. The trailer begins with Mario and Luigi traveling through the Sand Kingdom from Super Mario Odyssey. They run into several Tostarenans who are excited to see the plumbers. </p>



<p>They point them toward the disturbances they’ve been experiencing. This leads to a dark cavern, requiring Mario and Luigi to use a fire flower, and when they reach the center warp pipe, Yoshi is revealed. At first, they are just as afraid of Yoshi as he is of them, but they quickly realize that they have found a new companion in everyone’s favorite green dinosaur.</p>

<h2 id="h-yoshi-is-not-the-only-character-revealed-in-this-new-trailer">Yoshi Is Not the Only Character Revealed in This New Trailer</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In addition to Yoshi, there was a brief fight scene featuring Princess Peach and Birdo, paying homage to the fact that Birdo was a boss battle in the second Super Mario Bros game. In the trailer, Birdo was shooting eggs at Princess Peach with great ferocity. There was also a brief moment of Luigi wearing a frog suit.</p>



<p>Keegan-Michael Key’s Toad also returns, and he is initially annoyed at the fact that Yoshi immediately joins the group. The whole gang is later seen running away from the realistic dinosaur featured in Super Mario Odyssey.</p>







<p>Chris Meledandri from Illumination also appeared at the end of the presentation to say that the movie was currently in post-production and had finished animation. The movie will be released in theaters on April 1.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Ball ‘AGE 1000’ is Revealed, and Fans Think It’s Dragon Ball Online 2]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/</link>
            <guid>1415407</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Dragon Ball team recently revealed an all-new project, codenamed ‘AGE 1000’, set to be released in 2027. In a short trailer posted online that showcased a never-before-seen character, it was confirmed that a full reveal will take place on April 18 during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to pick up on the AGE 1000 reference, which until now, has only been used in connection with Dragon Ball Online. This MMORPG debuted in 2010 but has long since been shut down, being replaced somewhat by <em>Xenoverse</em>.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-dragon-ball-game-coming-2027">New Dragon Ball Game Coming 2027</h2>



<p>The Dragon Ball team wrote on social media that AGE 1000 offers ‘a new world and new characters brought to life by Akira Toriyama,’ the father of Dragon Ball. You can see the two-minute teaser trailer below:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Announcing a New Dragon Ball Game Project, "AGE 1000", set for 2027!<br>A new world and new characters brought to life by Akira Toriyama!</p><p> The latest updates will be unveiled at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 in the U.S. on April 18-19.<br>Stay tuned for more information. <a href="https://t.co/ouBqvz5FwA">pic.twitter.com/ouBqvz5FwA</a></p></div>— Dragon Ball Games (@dragonballgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/2015246051461210565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Eagle-eyed fans spotted the AGE 1000 reference in seconds, pointing out that, until now, the only other game to use that setting was Dragon Ball Online.</p>



<p>In <strong>that </strong>game, players are transported to the age 1000 in a time-traveling adventure that sees them explore an open-world environment, search for Dragon Balls, and interact with NPCs and other players on their journey. It boasted multiple classes and races, several settings in terms of time and location, and diverse quest mechanics.</p>



<p>While Dragon Ball Online died years ago, <em>Xenoverse </em>almost took its place, adopting the core story elements and character creation features that surfaced in DBO.</p>



<p>This is why fans think AGE 1000 is a direct follow-on (or reboot) of Dragon Ball Online.</p>

<p>As announced on January 23, WWE 2K26 will also have a special <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/">Attitude Era edition</a>. The key art for that edition features many legends from the 1990s and 2000s. WWE and 2K have yet to announce who will be featured on the standard edition of the game. Still, much more information has been revealed about the forthcoming WWE video game.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/">As first reported by Insider Gaming, </a>four new match types will be playable in this year’s release. WWE 2K26 will introduce the new Dumpster Match while reviving three classic match types once playable in previous games: the Inferno Match, the I Quit Match, and 3 Stages of Hell. </p>



<p>Also, the Island mode is slated to return this year with an all-new storyline providing the backdrop for the open-world action. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-island-returns-wwe-2k26-new-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>







<p>As of now, 2K Games has not announced any perks for pre-ordering the game, but noted the Monday Night War Edition would provide access to the most content. There’s also no set release date or price point. Previous iterations of the game have released in March. Insider Gaming will keep you up-to-date with the latest WWE 2K26 news.</p>
