If yes, then the popular Roblox game Jump And Splash is one that you need to check out immediately.&nbsp; Like the name suggests, Jump And Splash is all about swimming and splashing around in the pool, with the added drama of players having to jump off platforms of different heights to register scores.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/5-reasons-you-should-buy-battlefield-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-big-reasons-you-should-buy-battlefield-6.1322551/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re on the fence about buying Battlefield 6 because you’ve been burned by EA before, or you simply think Battlefield 6 doesn’t look good, we’ve got 5 reasons to convince you why you should buy Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Let’s start by making things clear: We are not paid by EA to promote <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>.</p>



<p>The reason we’re bigging it up is because it’s one of the best Battlefield games in years. It fills a void in the FPS market that desperately needed a game like this. Battlefield 6 has learned from past mistakes, resulting in an excellent single-player and online shooter. </p>



<p>We’ve isolated 5 key talking points that could convince you to be a Battlefield believer (we’ll never say that again, promise).</p>



<h2 id="h-1-it-has-a-campaign">1. It Has A Campaign!</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No burning bridges this time. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even if you’re someone who jumps straight into online multiplayer the second you get a new shooter, you can’t deny that having a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-campaign-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 single-player campaign</a> makes for a better overall package. It’s also better value for your money. Battlefield 2042 not having a campaign was borderline criminal, and EA didn’t learn from the negative reception Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 received for doing the same thing.</p>



<p>Yes, it’s not the best campaign in the world, nor is it that memorable. We think it doesn’t necessarily need to be. Having it there is better than not having it at all. It’s also a good little training tool to warm up your shooting skills; learning how weapons work in the game and getting a sense of recoil and movement against AI before you need to use these skills against real people.</p>



<p>It also offers many tough <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-trophy-list-all-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophies and achievements</a> to tick off as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-ea-is-listening-to-you">2. EA Is Listening To You</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Leave all the feedback. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>“With over 30 Battlefield Labs sessions successfully completed alongside our community, and a total of 92,351,578 hours played during the Open Beta, Battlefield 6 is the most tested and iterated Battlefield game in history, and player agency remains at the heart of it,” said a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-play-your-way" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6 community post</a>.</p>



<p>It’s no secret that EA has been on something of a vendetta against itself with Battlefield 6. The failure of Battlefield 2042 sent the game’s team back to the drawing board. Battlefield 6’s MO from the beginning has been clear: Listen to the community. If you don’t believe us, take it from Battlefield Studios:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We appreciate all of your suggestions, and want you to know we’re listening. With Season 1 and our roadmap ahead, we’re excited to continue to build a Battlefield that reflects what players want. We’ll continue reading and listening to community channels, and we cannot wait to share more with you, so keep the feedback coming.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The whole team knew that Battlefield 6 couldn’t fail, or it could be the end for the franchise. Time will tell if this remains the goal from day one until a potential next Battlefield release. In the meantime, you can play Battlefield 6 knowing that if you have feedback or criticism, it will be heard.</p>



<h2 id="h-3-more-content-than-any-other-battlefield">3. “More Content Than Any Other Battlefield”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Content upon content. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now we head to the Battlefield Comms channel—a terrific communication line between players and the developer. A detailed post outlining the game’s current and upcoming content delivered a simple message: <strong>“Our Seasons will have more content than ever before in a Battlefield game.”</strong></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is a live-service game at the end of the day. This means the usual dripfeed of new content, but we’ve already seen with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 Roadmap</a> how seriously EA is taking this. If you commit to the purchase, you know you’re getting a plethora of new maps, weapons, game modes, and everything that <em>you </em>want for the next few years.</p>



<p>We’ll probably get beloved maps and fan-favorite playlists.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-4-free-to-play-battle-royale-mode">4. Free-To-Play Battle Royale Mode</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fire away. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>This won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but a free-to-play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-pois-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode</a> arrives shortly after the game’s full release. It freshens up the concept slightly with the new insta-death circle, and will also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-and-multiplayer-has-the-same-destruction-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feature the multiplayer’s destruction</a>—meaning if someone is camping in a house, try to bring it down on them to win the game!</p>



<p>Even though the Battle Royale concept is a bit stale and played out at this point, adding a BR mode to Battlefield 6 once again helps the game’s overall package and value.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-it-s-fun">5. It’s Fun</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Beautiful. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The reality is that few AAA games offer the level of destruction and versatility that Battlefield does. Even a ‘bad’ Battlefield game is still pretty good—2042 being the outlier—and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-destruction-improved-after-dropping-ps4-and-xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s decision to skip the PS4 and Xbox One</a> has allowed Battlefield Studios to improve the franchise’s destruction.</p>



<p>Our time in the Open Beta was delightful, and this really is Battlefield back to its brilliant best. From long, back-and-forth Conquest matches to the pitfalls and pressure of defending an objective in Rush, there really is nothing like Battlefield and its signature ‘moments’. </p>



<hr>



<p>As always, this is the part where you get to say your piece. Either leave a comment or head to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> and share your thoughts on Battlefield 6 with us. Did you buy Battlefield 6? If so, what do you think? Or tell us why you won’t be buying it, and why our reasons aren’t convincing enough.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-852-october-11/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-852-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-saturday-october-11.1322494/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Saturday, and while I’ve not been around for a while, I hope that your streaks are all going strong, pushing into the weekend. I unfortunately lost mine, but it’s time to kick that back into gear with more NYT Connections hints and solutions for Saturday, October 11.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know about today’s NYT Connections hints.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-11">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 11)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #852:</p>



<ul>
<li>ALLEY</li>



<li>SPORT</li>



<li>TACKLE</li>



<li>LANE</li>



<li>TOM</li>



<li>COURT</li>



<li>KIT</li>



<li>BOB</li>



<li>DON</li>



<li>BILL</li>



<li>WEAR</li>



<li>GEAR</li>



<li>PAT</li>



<li>WAY</li>



<li>PUT ON</li>



<li>STUFF</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Whether you’re camping or competing, this collection has you covered.</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Ready for the runway or the rugby pitch? These words help you get suited up.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – You’ll find these at the end of addresses — just don’t take a wrong turn</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – These names double as everyday nouns — from currency to movement.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 11.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-11-852">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 11 (#852)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– GEAR, KIT, STUFF, TACKLE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DON, PUT ON, SPORT, WEAR</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – ALLEY, COURT, LANE, WAY</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BILL, BOB, PAT, TOM</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>



<p>How did you do? Did you get a perfect run? Let me know what your streak looks like on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a></p>

<p>Battlefield 6 was released yesterday, and some PC-based players have been experiencing issues tied to the EA App, a digital storefront and launcher that supports the game. It has been actively blocking users from booting the game and presenting an error message, which is something that has actively ’embarrassed’ EA leadership.</p>



<p>In a series of social media posts, Respawn Entertainment CEO and co-founder Vince Zampella actively criticized the EA App, suggesting that users consider refunding the game and purchasing it through Steam instead, which offers a more stable experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-vince-zampella-bags-on-the-app-his-owner-created">Vince Zampella Bags on the App His Owner Created</h2>



<p>Respawn Entertainment is one of the many subsidiaries under the Electronic Arts banner, but that hasn’t stopped CEO Vince Zampella from taking to social media to lead a crusade against the EA App.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/VinceZampella/status/1976718941063151656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a post</a> responding to a communication about the rampant EA App issues, Zampella wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I have yelled about ea app people. Any suggestions on next levels of escalation?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the comments beneath that post, Zampella admitted he’s playing the game on Steam, and he actively advised others to do the same. When one user explained they had similar issues, Zampella asked if they could refund the game on the EA App and buy it on Steam instead.</p>



<p>He also confirmed that other platforms, like Xbox, aren’t having these issues whatsoever.</p>



<p>When one user demanded that Zampella ‘yell at Andrew Wilson’ (EA’s CEO), Zampella said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s not his fault, he’s just as upset as me</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth stressing that <strong>as of a few hours ago</strong> (at the time of publishing), the EA App was no longer exhibiting these issues and things had returned to normal for users across the platform.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In July, a PEGI rating surfaced for Assassin’s Creed Shadows on Nintendo Switch 2. This was just days after Ubisoft stated the game, which is one of the best-received Assassin’s Creed games in <strong>years</strong>, would be headed to ‘other machines’.</p>



<p>Now, a listing on a French storefront has revealed a placeholder cover and a product description for the game. It could be the site getting ahead of the game, or it could be a slip that was posted early in error. The listing was spotted by eagle-eyed fans, but if it’s a real listing, it comes as no surprise.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-assassin-s-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2">When is Assassin’s Creed Shadows Coming to Switch 2?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing, there’s no release date for Assassin’s Creed Shadows on Switch 2, but it’s widely believed that it will land in the coming months. It’s looking as though it’ll follow a similar path to Star Wars: Outlaws, which landed on Switch 2 on September 4.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-rating-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a PEGI rating</a> for Nintendo Switch 2 back in July, which is usually applied within a few months of launch and no earlier. Now, a French outlet <a href="https://www.auchan.fr/assassin-s-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2/pr-C1851867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">named Auchan</a> has shown a listing for the game.</p>



<p>On the French storefront, it’s written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Experience Assassin’s Creed Shadows in a whole new way with Nintendo Switch 2!<br></p>



<p>MASTER THE SERIES’ MOST DEPTH-BASED STEALTH MECHANISMS AND ENJOY VISCERAL COMBAT.<br>Play as Naoe, a cunning shinobi, and use light, sound, and shadows to avoid detection. Infiltrate enemy strongholds with a variety of free-running options, including the new grappling hook, distract guards with shurikens or smoke bombs, and assassinate targets with your Hidden Blade. As the samurai Yasuke, perform silent takedowns with a bow or unleash devastating combos with a katana or naginata.<br></p>



<p>Switch between these two heroes to adapt your strategy and experience feudal Japan through two radically different approaches: stealth or power, shadow or steel.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was released in March 2025, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our review</a>, we praised the game’s visuals, world, and cinematic campaign, all of which were on point for this stellar release.</p>

<p>Pre-orders for Resident Evil Requiem are set to go live on October 29, along with a special series-themed video.</p>



<p>The Resident Evil franchise has been delivering the scares since 1996. With the 30th anniversary coming next year, a new entry, Resident Evil Requiem, is releasing on February 27th, 2026. From what we’ve seen (and played), it looks to capitalize on what makes the series iconic: terrifying creatures and survival skills. If you cannot wait to return to Raccoon City, like I am, we know know when pre-orders will start. Plus, we’ll get an extra special video to go along with it.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-special-video-requiem-pre-orders-to-release-on-october-29th">Resident Evil Special Video, Requiem Pre-Orders To Release On October 29th</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The nightmare begins soon. <br>Resident Evil Requiem pre-orders will start on October 29th, US time. Plus, we'll be releasing a video celebrating the Resident Evil franchise at the same time (note: no new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay will be shown). Keep an eye out.… <a href="https://t.co/M8ssS8PJsS">pic.twitter.com/M8ssS8PJsS</a></p>— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1976773536883609715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/1976773536883609715?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a>, Capcom has announced that pre-orders for Resident Evil Requiem will go live on October 29th, 2025. No specifics were given as for what time that will be other than “US time”. In addition, a special video celebrating the Resident Evil series will premiere on October 29th as well. Unfortunately for fans hoping to see more Requiem gameplay, Capcom confirmed that no new footage will be shown.</p>



<p>However, for the optimists in the room, it doesn’t confirm that nothing new from the series will be shown. Rumors of a remake of Resident Evil 0, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-resident-evil-5-getting-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5</a>, and Code Veronica have made the rounds for a while. Perhaps we could see a reveal for one of those titles during the video? Furthermore, the film adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-2026-resident-evil-movie-will-be-in-spirit-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-2026-resident-evil-movie-will-be-in-spirit-of-games/"> Evil</a>, directed by Weapon’s Zach Cregger is currently in production. Maybe we’ll see some footage or principal photography? We’ll just have to wait and see on October 29th.</p>

<p>Are you looking to play PowerWash Simulator 2 in early access? Are you hoping for any chance to jump in as soon as possible?</p>



<p>With the first game being a surprise hit, PowerWash Simulator 2 is looking to be another rewarding experience, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-powerwash-simulator-2-splitscreen-local-multiplayer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this time with more friends</a>.</p>



<p>Here is everything you need to know about any potential PowerWash Simulator 2 early access.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-powerwash-simulator-2-have-early-access">Does PowerWash Simulator 2 Have Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You have to wait just like everyone else to clean this. Image via FuturLab</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no early access period in PowerWash Simulator 2. The game’s full release is set for October 23, which is when everyone will be able to access the game.</strong></p>



<p>The original <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/games/powerwash-simulator-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerWash Simulator</a> was released into early access, in the way that it did not have its 1.0 release until much later, but that is not the case with the sequel. All content in PowerWash Simulator 2 can be considered the game’s full launch, with any future maps likely coming via DLC packs, like the first game saw.</p>



<p>It is not necessarily surprising that there is no early access for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>. Typically, only very large games offer that kind of benefit for buying a deluxe edition or something like that. With a smaller, but still anticipated, game like this, that doesn’t happen much.</p>



<p>With that said, it is nice to see the game have a full 1.0 release so soon after the release date announcement.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-does-powerwash-simulator-2-have-a-demo">Does PowerWash Simulator 2 Have a Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, there is a demo available for download for PowerWash Simulator 2, but it is only available on Steam. There is no demo for the game on Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X|S, at least as of this writing.</strong></p>



<p>In the demo, you get a look at the early portion of the game, with two jobs available: Removal Van and Public Facility. You can also walk around your home base and see how this new area will be in the full game.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, with the demo only available on Steam, console players are left out of the early fun. There is always a chance that these storefronts will get access to the demo before the game releases, but as of now, there is no indication that it is happening.</p>
