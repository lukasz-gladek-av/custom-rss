<p>With its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-gameplay-releases-on-may-15-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May 15 release date</a> confirmed, Bethesda and ID Software have announced the DOOM: The Dark Ages Collector’s Bundle for players. Retailing for $199.99, the collector’s bundle comes with a number of extras for fans of the 31-year-old franchise. </p>



<p>In addition to the Premium Edition of the game that includes post-launch campaign DLC, the Collector’s Bundle comes with a 12″ DOOM Slayer statue with detachable weapons and cape, a metal red key card replica, a SteelBook case, a digital artbook and soundtrack, and the Divinity Skin Pack that features skins for the DOOM Slayer, Dragon, and Atlan. Lastly, players who pre-order the Premium Edition or get the Collector’s Bundle will get two days of early access to the game.</p>



<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is a prequel to 2016’s DOOM, and the third game in the modern DOOM trilogy. In addition to the new Medieval setting of the game that shows the origin of DOOM Slayer, the game features a new 30-story mech called an Atlan as well as a cybernetic, fire-breathing Dragon.</p>



<p>“Bound to serve as the super weapon of gods and kings, the DOOM Slayer fends off demon hordes as their leader seeks to destroy the Slayer and become the only one that is feared,” the game’s description reads. “Witness the creation of a legend as the Slayer takes on all of Hell and turns the tide of the war.”</p>
