<p>For the longest time, you could only find me using Steam. I wouldn’t touch another digital storefront or launcher if I could help it, but GOG inevitably won me over. Now, I have a growing library of classic titles, such as Jade Empire, The Suffering, and World in Conflict—all classics in their own right. Well, it turns out their offerings continue to improve. GOG is launching its game preservation program to ensure titles like Fallout and Resident Evil remain available and functional for players years after release.</p>



<p>As of this writing, the program features 100 unique titles, with an average rating of 4.2 out of 5, and more than 500 game improvements implemented by the restoration team at GOG. Some of the titles in the program include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Theme Hospital</li>



<li>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</li>



<li>SWAT 4</li>



<li>Empire Earth</li>



<li>Fallout: New Vegas</li>



<li>Diablo + Hellfire</li>



<li>System Shock 2</li>



<li>Dungeon Leeper 2</li>



<li>MYST</li>



<li>Heroes of Might and Magic III Complete</li>



<li>Jagged Alliance</li>



<li>Dragon Age: Origins</li>



<li>Demonicon</li>
</ul>



<blockquote>
<p>The GOG Preservation Program ensures classic games remain playable on modern systems, even after their developers stopped supporting them. By maintaining these iconic titles, GOG helps you protect and relive the memories that shaped you, DRM-free and with dedicated tech support.</p>



<p>In a world of rapid technological change, we see the urgent need to save video games from vanishing. The GOG Preservation Program is committed to keeping beloved classics alive and playable for future generations.</p>



<p>Our goal is for all games, whether recent or classic, to eventually become part of the Preservation Program. For a game to qualify for the Program, our team must run it through many quality tests. If these tests fail, our team updates and improves the game until it matches our quality standards. Only then, we stamp the game with our Preservation Program and grant it Good Old Game status.</p>



<p>There is a long backlog of classic games available on GOG that may already qualify for the program, but our team has not been able to confirm that yet. We aim to support as many games as possible, but it’s not always entirely up to us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To this end, GOG recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/original-resident-evil-joins-gog-sequels-coming-later-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched the Resident Evil bundle</a>, featuring the first three classic survival horror titles in a single, functional package that allows modern gaming computers to run and play smoothly. But that’s not the end of the road for the preservation program, as the team intends to add hundreds more titles to the program by the end of 2025, but not before thorough quality assurance checks clear each game.</p>

<p>A new datamine leak of the Assassin’s Creed Animus Hub, which will launch alongside Assassin’s Creed Shadows has revealed Season Pass content and more.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-infinty-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initially reported by Insider Gaming</a>, the Animus, originally called the Assassin’s Creed Infinity Hub, will launch alongside Assassin’s Creed Shadows and be the launcher for Assassin’s Creed games moving forward. In the Animus, it will contain things like a Season Pass, and cosmetics and tell the ‘modern-day story’ of the Assassin’s Creed games moving forward.</p>



<p>Datamined and leaked by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Thorites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit user /u/Thorites</a>, the first Battle Pass will be called “Eye in the Dark,” containing 20 different cosmetic tiers. Insider Gaming had also heard of three other Battle Passes previously named “The Hidden Network,” “@The Last Ronin,” and “In The Shadows,” all of which had 20 different tiers, too, but it’s unclear when or if, they’ll release.</p>



<p>The data mine leak also reveals that the Animus Hub will have an in-game store where players can buy cosmetic items for their characters, environments, and even pets. You can look at all the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1grbg48/information_and_assets_of_the_upcoming_animus_hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaked images here</a>.</p>



<p>In September 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft announced that it would delay Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> from its scheduled November release date to February 2025 to improve the game’s polish. </p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is scheduled to release on February 14, 2024.</p>
