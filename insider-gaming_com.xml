            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Todd Howard has been all over the place recently. The visionary developer has been at the forefront of a marketing streak for the new season of the Fallout TV show, the first episode of which drops in mere hours. He has found himself staring down the microphones of many outlets, but he might have gotten a bit mixed up on recent quotes.</p>



<p>In a newly revealed interview with Game Informer, Howard said that ‘the majority of the studio’ is working on The Elder Scrolls 6, but just days ago, he was captured saying that <strong>Fallout </strong>is the franchise that the team is working on the hardest.</p>







<p>To give Howard credit, his interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a> did mention that the majority of his team is working on The Elder Scrolls 6, <strong>but </strong>the company is ‘used to overlapping development.’</p>



<p>However, stressing that most employees are engaged on The Elder Scrolls 6, while also saying that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-chief-todd-howard-says-fallout-is-the-franchise-that-were-doing-the-most-in-right-now-coy-on-potential-return-to-new-vegas-or-a-fallout-3-remaster-while-fans-wait-for-fallout-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fallout is the franchise</a> that Bethesda Game Studios is ‘doing the most in right now’ is a little confusing.</p>



<p>GamesRadar captured <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/bethesdas-todd-howard-says-fallout-76-is-the-game-were-still-doing-the-most-work-in-and-fans-of-the-prime-tv-show-should-give-it-a-try/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another quote</a> where Todd was talking about a similar topic and said that Fallout 76 is specifically ‘the game we’re still doing the most work in.’</p>



<p>Perhaps Todd Howard is jetlagged from flying all over the world to promote the Fallout television show. From what we know, The Elder Scrolls 6 is the next game in the pipeline once Starfield’s development cycle has wrapped (although it might have already), and then Fallout 5 comes next.</p>



<p>In the interim, fans of the post-apocalyptic series are still expectant of a Fallout 3: Remastered or a Fallout: New Vegas 2. Aside from years-old rumors and old documents, there’s little to suggest they’re close to being released.</p>



<p>Would you rather have The Elder Scrolls 6 or Fallout 5 right now? Let us know how you’d decide on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Techland Already Working on ‘New Experience in the Dying Light Franchise’, It Seems]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/techland-new-experience-dying-light-universe/</link>
            <guid>1384918</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Techland released Dying Light: The Beast in September, and it became regarded as one of the gems of the ten-year-old franchise. It reintroduced Kyle Crane to the series, cast players into a gorgeous, dense world, and kick-started more games with something of a cliffhanger ending.</p>



<p>Now, thanks to a new job listing uncovered at the heart of Techland, it seems that the developer is already hard at work on the next Dying Light experience. The team is looking to expand, adding a Lead Online Game Designer to lean into a new ‘online experience in the Dying Light universe.’</p>







<h2 id="h-is-dying-light-3-coming-soon">Is Dying Light 3 Coming Soon?</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast was viewed by Techland as Dying Light 3, even if it didn’t adopt that moniker. The game, which is one of our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-review/">top-rated games of 2025</a>, was incredibly well-received by fans of the zombie-slashing franchise. The closing moments of the game reveal that more is incoming, but there’s no indication of <strong>when </strong>we’ll get another game.</p>



<p>It might not take <strong>that long</strong>, as Techland appears to have entered development on whatever might come next.</p>



<p>Whether that’s a full-fledged game or something of a spin-off, like many thought The Beast was, we just don’t know. From speaking to franchise director, Tymon Smektala, we know that there are stacks of ideas in the pipeline for Dying Light.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light/new-game-techland-job-post" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a> uncovered a job listing at Techland for a Lead Online Game Designer. Amongst other things, the listing said that the successful candidate will ‘define the framework and structure for a new online experience in the Dying Light franchise’.</p>



<p>Technically, every Dying Light game since the first surfaced in 2015 has been an online game, so there’s nothing new there, but the uttering of that very word, ‘new’, is enough to get fans salivating.</p>



<p>For now, we should stress again that nothing is confirmed until it’s confirmed, and this might be for nothing more than a small spin-off game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-cred-cap-between-seasons-embark/</link>
            <guid>1384909</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has deployed an ARC Raiders update that effectively changes the face of the game. It’s the Cold Snap update, and it adds a blanket of snow over the game, introduces the Flickering Flames event, and makes several quality-of-life improvements that players are already thankful for.</p>



<p>It also introduces a soft Cred cap that will prevent players from farming Feats to rack up silly amounts of Cred between seasons. This balancing mechanic means they can’t just insta-unlock an entire Raider Deck when it drops at the beginning of a new season.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-more-hoarding-cred-in-arc-raiders">No More Hoarding Cred in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>The latest bout of changes by Embark Studios in ARC Raiders has been welcomed with open arms. The Cold Snap update addresses some of the most critical issues in ARC Raiders, but it also introduces a wealth of additions, such as a festive-themed event, new map conditions, and more.</p>



<p>On December 26, ARC Raiders will get a new season, and that means an entirely fresh Raider Deck stocked full of exclusive cosmetics and other rewards. However, the majority of the player base has spent the last few weeks grinding Feats and racking up <strong>thousands </strong>of Cred points for their efforts.</p>



<p>This means that when the new Raider Deck drops, they’ll be able to waltz through it, unlocking everything in one sweep.</p>



<p>To combat this, Embark Studios has capped how much Cred you can earn, locking it to 800 maximum. That means that when you hit 800 Cred, you’ll not be able to earn a single coin more until you spend it.</p>



<p>That also means that, ahead of a new season, the maximum Cred you can ‘bank’ will be 800.</p>



<p>The team explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Dev note: We decided to implement a cap so that players won’t be able to fully unlock new Raider Decks by accumulating Cred and added more items to Shani’s store to purchase using Cred. We believe that the Raider Decks offer a rewarding experience to enjoy while players engage with the game, and a large Cred wallet undermines this goal. We will not be removing Cred that has been accumulated before the introduction of the soft cap.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But Embark Studios has been the ultimate nice guy here. When you log into ARC Raiders, you’ll notice that whatever you had before <strong>has not </strong>been reduced to 800 to account for the cap. That will come into effect from the next season, which starts on December 26.</p>
