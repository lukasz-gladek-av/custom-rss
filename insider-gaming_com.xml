<p>Diablo 4’s Lord of Hatred DLC overhauls skill trees, adds talismans, the Horadric Cube, and introduces long-awaited loot filters.</p>



<p>During the 30th-anniversary Diablo presentation on February 11, it was announced that the Warlock class was coming to 3 Diablo games, including Diablo 4.</p>



<p>Additionally, it was announced that major updates would overhaul parts of Diablo 4, with the Lord of Hatred update coming in April. One of those updates is a major change to how skill trees work.</p>



<p>The team even joked about hearing players call skill trees “skill twigs,” but that is coming to an end.</p>



<p>“We’re adding new customization options to every single skill across the entire tree,” they revealed. “It isn’t just a small tweak, it’s a major disruption to the current class system.”</p>

Our team is actively working on a fix, and eligible rewards will automatically unlock once resolved,” the statement reads.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-bumpy-road-for-highguard">The Bumpy Road for Highguard</h2>



<p>Highguard launched on January 26 and received mostly negative reviews on Steam from the outset. They continued to push forward with updates, including new modes and events, but less than a month later, news broke of massive layoffs.</p>



<p>The game was launched with big hype as the final announcement from the 2025 Game Awards ceremony. However, there was virtual radio silence following that event until the game’s launch.</p>







<h2 id="h-layoffs-becoming-more-common-in-the-gaming-space">Layoffs Becoming More Common in the Gaming Space</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, mass layoffs are becoming a trend in the gaming industry. Ubisoft recently underwent a major restructuring, resulting in the cancellation of multiple projects, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" id="171165">the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.</a></p>



<p>Wildgate also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wildgate-developer-moonshot-confirms-layoffs/" id="171549">recently announced</a> layoffs. As did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">Riot Games.</a></p>
