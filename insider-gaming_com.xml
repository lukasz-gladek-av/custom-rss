<p>One of the biggest advertised features for Black Ops 7 multiplayer was open lobbies. For the first time in years, Treyarch was removing the SBMM shackles from Call of Duty players, offering a more open and varied matchmaking experience.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sbmm-cod-creator-debunk-conspiracies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skill-based matchmaking</a> is not supposed to be the main factor considered for Black Ops 7 matchmaking. The game’s open lobbies are supposed to represent this new ideology, but CoD content creator TheXclusiveAce has conducted a small test to check if everything is as transparent as it seems.</p>







<h2 id="h-sbmm-could-be-affecting-black-ops-7-lobbies-more-than-you-think">SBMM Could Be Affecting Black Ops 7 Lobbies More Than You Think</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What’s the truth? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the creator’s ‘XclusiveReloaded’ YouTube channel, they asked an important question in a new video: “Is Skill Really ‘Minimally Considered’ in Black Ops 7?”</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is supposed to favour certain conditions, such as region, proximity, and numerous other factors, before taking into account a player’s skill level—the final parameter being the heartbeat of SBMM. </p>



<p>TheXclusiveAce opened by discussing the ongoing narrative in the community that SBMM is stronger and more prevalent than advertised. Many think it’s been ramped up as of late. This is where the renowned data tracker compared some numbers.</p>







<p>“I do feel my experience has been changing as time has been going on. I have been feeling like my matchmaking times are going up, my connection quality is no longer nearly as consistent as it was early on, and as it was in the open matchmaking in the beta build of the game. On top of that, I’ve been noticing that more often than not, my lobbies are a lot more difficult than they were in the first few days.”</p>



<p>TheXclusiveAce used two accounts to test their theory: Their regular account the play the majority of Black Ops 7 on, and their bot account that’s sole purpose is for offline testing, as they constantly check weapons and attachments to find meta loadouts with it. They played at the same time of day, and kept the variables and controllable factors consistent.</p>



<p>In 10 matches, the creator used traditional Team Deathmatch matchmaking to see the results for each account. The final stats are quite interesting.</p>



<p>The main account’s 10 matches took 34 seconds on average to find a game, compared to 28 seconds on the bot account. 6 seconds isn’t the end of the world, but leans ever-so-slightly in favor of SBMM. However, the average ping was a different story.</p>



<p>The average ping for the main account was 42ms, whereas it was 25ms for the bot account. TheXclusiveAce says the best ping they can get is 20ms, and the bot account was within 5ms of this in eight matches out of 10. The main account achieved this feat <em>once</em>, with several games reaching into the high 40s and low 50s.</p>



<p>SBMM generally takes longer on average, as the system has to find players in your skill bracket, which means it might have to go further around the world to find players, which adds more time to matchmaking, and can influence ping. This data and study aren’t conclusive—due to it being such a small data sample—but the initial numbers are eyebrow-raising and only support the narrative that Black Ops 7’s SBMM might be stronger than first thought.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Latest ARC Raiders Patch Destroys One of the Most Annoying Exploits]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-patch-destroys-annoying-exploits/</link>
            <guid>1366273</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has just pushed out a small but mighty update for ARC Raiders – 1.4.0. This patch addresses some of the game’s most critical bugs and exploits, including one that has been plaguing players for the last couple of weeks.</p>



<p>It’s a graphical and quality-of-life thing more than anything else, and while no <strong>new content </strong>has been added with the 1.4.0 update, the improvements included in the change are being welcomed with open arms by players.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-more-locked-door-exploits-in-arc-raiders">No More Locked Door Exploits in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>The full list of content and bug fixes included in the ARC Raiders 1.4.0 update is being appreciated by fans of the ambitious extraction adventure:</p>



<ul>
<li>Exploit mitigation mechanisms have been added for all locked rooms across all maps.</li>



<li>Fixed the gun exploit that allowed you to shoot quicker than intended by swapping to a quick-use item and back.</li>



<li>The exterior access to Spaceport’s Control Tower locked room has been blocked off.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue that sometimes caused low-resolution textures in the Main Menu.</li>



<li>Fixed players being able to push each other by jumping on each other’s backs.</li>



<li>Fixed lighting artifacts that would sometimes occur upon entering maps.</li>



<li>Raider Voice now correctly respects the selected voice option after restarting the game.</li>
</ul>



<p>The locked door exploits were a huge bugbear for players legitimately using keys (which are often single-use) to enter high-tier areas, only to find that somebody had already scooped loot from the room without needing to bring in the key at all, some of which are drastically rare.</p>



<p>With this update, players attempting to access locked rooms without keys will now be incinerated. That’s right, <em>burned to death</em>.</p>



<p>The other bug (read: exploit) that was disturbing users everywhere was the ‘double pump’ gun exploit that allowed users to swap to a quick-use item and back again, flicking between two shotguns to produce an alarming rate of fire and damage output.</p>



<p>It was seen being used even by the game’s most prominent streamers, and it made close-quarters PvP almost unwinnable.</p>



<p>That has also been addressed by this small patch, which is available to download and install <strong>right now</strong> on all platforms.</p>

<p>Nintendo has announced plans to acquire Bandai Namco’s Studio in Singapore, where they already have an existing relationship due to contributions in developing the likes of Splatoon 3.</p>



<p>Bandai Namco Studio Singapore, which was established in 2013, has worked on the likes of Ace Combat 7 and Splatoon 3, and will now be brought under the Nintendo umbrella.</p>







<h2 id="h-bandai-namco-studios-singapore-to-become-nintendo-studios-singapore">Bandai Namco Studios Singapore to Become Nintendo Studios Singapore</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Partnership. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo announced</a> that, subject to approval, an acquisition of 80% of the studio’s shares will be acquired on April 1, 2026, with the remaining shares being acquired “after a certain period.”</p>



<p>Nintendo will rename the studio Nintendo Studios Singapore, which will become a subsidiary of Nintendo, but the studio will “continue its development operations.”</p>



<p>The Singapore studio is likely to become a support studio for Nintendo, continuing in a similar role that it has operated in for the past decade, with Nintendo stating it has “strong expertise in creating in-game art assets.” Nintendo adds that the acquisition “will have only a minor effect on Nintendo’s results for this fiscal year.”</p>



<p>Nintendo’s ongoing business relationship with the Singapore studio should lead to an easy transition, with the studio already familiar to the working processes given their involvement in the development of Splatoon 3.</p>



<p>The ongoing expansion of Nintendo is already set to bring more of its famous IPs to life in the movie scene, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-movie-franchises-mario-zelda-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo involved in multiple projects</a> set for release after The Legend of Zelda in 2027.</p>

<p>The Holiday season covers the months of November, December, and January. Most of the biggest game releases happen outside of this period, but there’s still plenty of the best games releasing in Holiday 2025.</p>



<p>As 2025 begins to wind down, players are peppered with massive games from August through to October. The season starts again around February and March. Sandwiched in this is the Holiday season, and 2025 still has the odd homerun to knock out of the park first.</p>



<p>Also, for even more holiday shopping guides, check out&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Holiday 2025 hub</a>&nbsp;for the best deals available.</p>

<p>Absence makes the heart grow fonder. It’s incredible to think it’s been two years since the last FM game. But Sports Interactive finally dropped Football Manager 26, and while it’s <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/football-manager-26-is-one-of-the-worst-games-ever-rated-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the worst games ever rated on Steam</a>, it’s selling like hotcakes!</p>







<p>It would make a nice present under the tree, and is sure to eat up any free time you have.</p>

<p>The Dynasty Warrior-like combat and gameplay aesthetics are back in The Legend of Zelda, thanks to Age of Imprisonment. It carries on the spin-offs’ focus on large-scale combat over cave exploration and puzzles, but it makes for one of the most unique Zelda games of all time.</p>







<h3 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h3>



<figure><figcaption>More Call of Duty. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ranked-play-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> is the next Call of Duty game, and it doesn’t matter how it reviews, it’s guaranteed to be under most Christmas trees for Holiday 2025. It doesn’t have to be the best game; it just has to be Call of Duty—which it is. Insider Gaming understands this, which is why you can get money off the heavy-hitter below.</p>







<h3 id="h-kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A nice surprise. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Stand back, Mario Kart World, there’s a new racing game speeding onto the Nintendo Switch 2. Mario Kart World was the guaranteed winner for the Switch 2 in 2025, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/controversial-kirby-air-riders-bikini-skin-has-already-been-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a> whistled through and turned out to be a pleasant competitor. It brings back a fairly niche franchise into the mainstream again.</p>







<h3 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Samus strikes again. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-gameplay-new-unlisted-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> journey has been stressful, but potentially rewarding. Metroid Prime 4 was starting to slip into the void and become another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-evil-2-still-advertising-new-job-roles-after-17-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a>. It finally reappeared, and now it’s set to grace Nintendo Switch 2 consoles for the Holiday 2025 season, and it’s one of the most anticipated games—one you should probably buy if you have the console!</p>







<h3 id="h-code-vein-nbsp-2">Code Vein&nbsp;2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>More pain. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Code Vein was Bandai Namco’s solo attempt to crack the Souls genre market. It didn’t quite reach the levels of a FromSoftware game, but its enchanting art style and sales were enough to captivate Bandai into giving the franchise another chance. Code Vein 2 is one of 2026’s first big games.</p>

<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-announced-at-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the newest entry</a> in the Hyrule Warriors spinoffs for The Legend of Zelda. In it, fans get to see the original Guardians that took a stand against Ganon, which is shown in flashbacks in Tears of the Kingdom. The Musou hack-and-slash combat and colorful visuals are well worth it, especially on Nintendo Switch 2, but now, there’s a lot more to get excited about with Version 1.02.</p>



<p>For Version 1.02 of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, available now, there’s some new content to enjoy. The biggest of all are new battles and quests, which are unlocked after beating the main story. New stylish Sync-Strike Attacks between Zelda and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-new-trailer-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calamo</a> have been added, as well as the Longsword of Light for Rauru. Furthermore, some improvements to split-screen and UI have been addressed and fixed.</p>
