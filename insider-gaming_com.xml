<p>A new Chapter has arrived in Fortnite with the launch of Chapter 7 Season 1, which brings the customary refresh of weapons and equipment found in the loot pool alongside it.</p>



<p>Fortnite Chapter 7 kicked off on the back of the huge Zero Point live event, attended by over 10 million players, which saw stars from the likes of Star Wars, Marvel, DC Comics, The Simpsons, and K-Pop Demon Hunters unite to fend off the Dark Presence.</p>



<p>Spring Break has now arrived in Fortnite as a result, and Insider Gaming has all the details on the new and unvaulted weapons in Chapter 7 Season 1.</p>

<p><strong>There are eight new weapons and pieces of equipment added in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, including a new mobility item—Wingsuits.</strong></p>



<p>The importance of Wingsuits early in the season is vital following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-the-battle-bus-fortnite-chapter-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">destruction of the Battle Bus</a>, as surfing the waves onto the island provide limited landing spots. If you get your hands on a Wingsuit early, traversing the map becomes much easier and you can head to further locations to hunt for loot, where there’s likely to be less competition.</p>



<p>A full list of the new weapons and equipment found in Fortnite this season are below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Iron Pump Shotgun</li>



<li>Twin Hammer Shotguns</li>



<li>Deadeye Assault Rifle</li>

<p>Chapter 7 has kicked off in Fortnite, but an array of popular modes, including Blitz, Reload, and Fortnite OG, are not yet available in Season 1, but the roadmap has been detailed.</p>



<p>Fortnite brought an end to Chapter 6 with the thrilling Zero Point live event, showcasing a wealth of collabs with recognisable faces from K-Pop Demon Hunter, Marvel, DC Comics, Star Wars, The Simpsons, and more, all featuring.</p>



<p>Chapter 7 Season 1 is now underway, and, while not all game modes are available, Insider Gaming has the details on when to expect their return.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-reload-return-to-fortnite">When Does Reload Return to Fortnite?</h2>

<p><strong>Reload returns to Fortnite on December 4, once the Battle Bus is back in commission and available to take players to the new Surf City map.</strong></p>



<p>The Battle Bus was destroyed in the closing moments of the Chapter 7, Season 1 trailer, though Dummy is hard at work repairing the iconic mode of transportation, and <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-seven-pacific-break-v39-00-update-notes?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games shared a Fortnite roadmap</a> for the coming weeks.</p>



<p>When Reload returns, the new map, Surf City, will be available, featuring a smaller version of the main map, with POIs including Sus Studios, Divey Dam, and Battlewood Boulevard.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-blitz-return-to-fortnite">When Does Blitz Return to Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>Blitz returns to Fortnite on December 4, the same day as Reload is back and when Ranked is available again, when the Battle Bus is back in commission.</strong></p>



<p>A new map, Starfall Island, will serve as the environment for Blitz this season, with POIs including Ritzy Redux, Holloway House, and Flowberry Fields.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-fortnite-og-return">When Does Fortnite OG Return?</h2>



<p><strong>Fortnite OG players will need to wait a little while longer for the return of the mode, as it will be out of commission until December 11.</strong></p>



<p>When Fortnite OG is back, Season 7 will kick off in the mode, and the arrival could come alongside the start of the fan-favorite Winterfest event, adding extra content to the game in preparation for the holiday season.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-delulu-return-to-fortnite">When Does Delulu Return to Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>Delulu players face the longest wait of all for the mode to return, as Delulu will not be available until December 12, Epic Games has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>The proximity-chat mode is expected to stay permanently; however, following an introduction in Chapter 6, it adds to the plethora of game modes available in Fortnite.</p>
