<p>The Borderlands 4 collector’s edition looks like something that many fans of the series might be interested in investing in.</p>



<p>However, purchasing games with various editions has become more complicated. Will it come with the game? How will the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content included affect your overall experience</a>? Will the items included actually be worth your money?</p>



<p>You should always know what you are getting into when you purchase something, so here is the answer to whether or not the Borderlands 4 collector’s edition comes with the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-get-a-copy-of-borderlands-4-with-the-collector-s-edition">Do You Get a Copy of Borderlands 4 With the Collector’s Edition?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, no, the Borderlands 4 collector’s edition does not come with a copy of the game. While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/randy-pitchford-borderlands-4-price-game-value/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford</a> has posted on X calling the bundle “pretty rad” and saying it would likely sell out, the answer to our question is answered in his tweet.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Collector’s Edition of Borderlands 4 available for Pre-Order at GameStop. It’s pretty rad and will probably sell out, so grab it if you’re into it:<a href="https://t.co/6eOZ9GYC4g">https://t.co/6eOZ9GYC4g</a></p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1934641019636818196?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The image for the bundle displays everything included with your purchase, but it is accompanied by big wording in the bottom right-hand corner saying the game is not included.</p>



<p>Why would Gearbox make a collector’s edition that doesn’t include the game? Like many other examples, it likely comes down to businesses trying to fool consumers into purchasing more. Not including the game does “technically” make the collector’s edition cheaper. However, if you’re buying the collector’s edition, you’re also likely to buy the game, so Gearbox and GameStop don’t have to advertise the purchase at over $200, but they would still be getting all of that money anyway.</p>

<p>Otherwise known as the ECHO-4 bundle, this GameStop exclusive will set anyone purchasing it back $150 and comes included with the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>8 in tall figure of ECHO-4 with LED lights</li>



<li>Cloth map of Kairos</li>



<li>Four double-sided art prints featuring the game’s vault hunters</li>



<li>Vault symbol necklace</li>



<li>SHiFT code card that rewards five golden keys upon redemption</li>
</ul>



<p>While the Borderlands 4 collector’s edition bundle comes with a pretty cool-looking figure that is definitely the main selling point, it seems that this all seems rather overpriced without the game. You are looking at a minimum of $220 to get the full experience here, and that’s if you don’t end up upgrading your standard copy of the game to the $100 deluxe edition or $130 super deluxe. Both of those come with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various DLCs</a> not included in the ECHO-4 bundle.</p>



<p>We’re not here to tell you what to do with your money, but the Borderlands 4 collector’s edition doesn’t appear worth the money to us. The only in-game benefit you get from the bundle is the five key codes, and with that, you’re guaranteed to be spending over $200 on the game to benefit from weapons that will likely be replaced in your inventory soon. The other items included look like something you could easily find on eBay in a few months for a cheaper price.</p>

<p>The original Backyard Football game is being re-released on Steam and mobile devices.</p>



<p>Playground Games announced on Tuesday that Backyard Football 99 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3170570/Backyard_Football_99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will launch on Tuesday, September 9</a>. Like past re-releases of the original Backyard Sports titles, Backyard Football will include legendary NFL players such as Jerry Rice, Dan Marino, Randall Cunningham, Steve Young, Barry Sanders, John Elway, Drew Bledsoe, and more. In total, there will be 30 NFL legends to pick for your squad.</p>



<p>The game also features a Single Game mode and a 14-game season mode. There are even classic on-field power ups such as “Hocus Pocus”, “Leap Frog”, “Cough Drop”, and “Spring Loaded”.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The re-release of Backyard Football follows past launches of Backyard Baseball ’97, Backyard Baseball ’01, and Backyard Soccer. In addition to the aforementioned four games, Playground Productions and Mega Cat Studios are continuing with work on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-more-backyard-sports-classics-are-coming-to-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other classic Backyard Sports titles</a> like Backyard Basketball and Backyard Hockey. </p>



<p>In addition to the re-release of classic titles, Playground Productions is planning on releasing brand new Backyard Sports titles. When those will come, however, is currently unknown.</p>
