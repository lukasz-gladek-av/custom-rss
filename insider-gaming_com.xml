<p>Battlestate Games has revealed that Escape from Tarkov’s Winter Twitch Drops campaign will start on December 30, all but confirming that the wipe will take place a couple of days before. It’s a tradition at this point – these campaigns always start a day or two after the game has undergone a platform-wide reset known as a ‘wipe’.</p>



<p>This wipe will be accompanied by the 0.16 update, a supersized overhaul that promises to introduce a slew of new weapons, balances, and a rework of Customs, one of the game’s fan-favourite maps.</p>

<p>On the Escape from Tarkov website, it was revealed that the Winter Drops campaign will run from December 30 to January 4, and then the Escape from Tarkov Arena drops campaign from January 4 to January 8.</p>



<p>The developer advised streamers <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/event/wintertwitchdropsevent?utm_source=x_post&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=winter_drops_24-25&amp;utm_term=link_1&amp;utm_content=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to enrol if they want to participate</a> in the campaign, with content creators being assigned time slots based on their availability. It’s easy to envision some of the biggest streamers who’ll get a spot in the Winter Drops campaign – this is the time of the year when they make the most money.</p>



<p>The likes of Landmark, Pestily, WillerZ, Glorious, StankRat, Gingy, and Trey will likely all be doing round-the-clock Tarkov streams in support of the wipe and the Twitch Drops campaign.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed what rewards viewers will receive, but last year, users had to rack up dozens of watch hours to unlock random gift drops in Escape from Tarkov. Some viewers unlocked thousands of rounds of ammunition, while others got packs of noodles or something to that effect.</p>
