<p>Nintendo’s Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is the first new Metroid Prime game in over a decade. No one thought it would happen at one point, and it has. Unfortunately, it’s the lowest-rated game in the Prime series, but it’s still reviewed quite well.</p>



<p>Another game is ready to go under the Christmas tree: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. The legendary franchise sees all of your hopes and dreams curl up into a literal ball as you hunt Space Pirates and Metroids. Its review scores are ultimately not disappointing, but it probably misses GOTY conversations.</p>

<p>The Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review scores have all but settled on Metacritic. As of writing, based on 63 Nintendo Switch 2 reviews, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond has an aggregate score of 80/100!</p>







<p>Before you say anything, this is a very good score. An average game is usually around the 7/10 mark, making an 8/10 verdict excellent. Long-time fans and people who’ve been hyped for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond might be a bit disappointed by this score, compared to previous Metroid Prime games.</p>



<p>According to Metacritic, the original Metroid Prime sits at 97/100, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is on 92/100, and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption drops slightly further to 90/100. This makes Beyond the first mainline ‘Prime’ game to fall below 90, and for a while, it was even under 80.</p>



<p>Everyone is so hyper-critical about reviews and scores nowadays, when the reality is that games should be supported. Will the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review scores stop you from buying it? Or is it a day one?
