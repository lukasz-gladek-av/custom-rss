<h2 id="h-welcome-to-the-jungle">Welcome to the Jungle</h2>



<p>Vietnam was a harrowing war, but it makes for a fantastic theatre for video games. Historically, we’ve seen plenty of games pop up that have used the Vietnam War as a key setting, from Black Ops to Shellshock, and from Conflict to Battlefield.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is the next take on the gruesome war that took the lives of millions of people between the 1960s and 1970s.</p>



<p>In a press release, Team17 and Expression Games revealed what players can expect in Hell Let Loose: Vietnam:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Set during the Vietnam War, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam offers existing and new fans a high caliber gameplay experience of authentic warfare where teamwork is the key to success. Experience 50v50 player battles across stunning, sprawling maps with careful attention aimed at creating an authentic, atmospheric and historically sensitive experience of events that occurred during armed conflict that occurred in Vietnam, between 1965-1973. </p>



<p>Retaining the gameplay base that fans loved from the first title, this is a brand new experience, utilising combined arms, with air, water, armour, infantry and support weapons that encapsulates the theatre of war feeling beloved by fans of the original title.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Players will be using helicopters to deploy troops on the battlefield and deliver fire support to squads pinned down by enemy fire. Patrol boats will strafe the shore, while Vietnam’s NVA forces will use tunnels and jungle warfare tactics to dynamically ambush enemies.#</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is scheduled to launch in 2026.</p>

<p>In true Prince of Persia fashion, The Rogue Prince of Persia is coming out on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S…today! The roguelike platformer, crafted by the team behind Dead Cells’ DLC, Evil Empire, is now available for fans to play. Even more so, Xbox Game Pass subscribers can get the game at no additional cost.</p>



<p>The Prince of Persia series has had a storied history in the gaming scene. From the original 1989 PC version to 2003’s The Sands of Time, the Prince has been around for quite a while. As fans await the remake of The Sands of Time, two new titles, 2023’s The Lost Prince and the then-early-access The Rogue Prince of Persia, have delighted players. Now, more people than ever can experience the title on all platforms (outside of Switch and Switch 2).</p>

<p>The launch trailer, available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdJJbvwrAsI">above</a>, showcases some fun gameplay and its surprise shadow drop release. As mentioned before, The Rogue Prince of Persia is available now for purchase on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S. The Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 version won’t be available until later this year, with no official date given as of writing. The game costs $29.99 on PlayStation 5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S and $24.99 on PC. </p>



<p>In the style of Dead Cells and Hades, The Rogue Prince of Persia is a roguelike that, when you die, you respawn at the beginning. However, each run is different, and new discoveries, like skills and perks, can be added to your Prince. Its 2D artstyle and colorful sceneries feel quite reminiscent of the originals, which longtime fans will appreciate. The game was well-received by players when it hit Early Access last year. If you haven’t played it yet, you now have a few more reasons to, thanks to the shadow drop.</p>
