<p>PlayStation veteran&nbsp;Shuhei Yoshida is leaving PlayStation in January. His retirement comes after more than 30 years with Sony, spending his time with PlayStation since its beginnings in 1993.</p>



<p>Yoshida, who made the announcement on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official PlayStation Blog</a>, is set to leave PlayStation on January 15, 2025.</p>



<p>“I’ve been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation,” he said. “And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on.</p>



<p>“You know, the company’s been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yoshida has spent the last while as Head of Indies Initiative for Sony. Prior to that, he was President of SIE Worldwide Studis from 2008 to 2019.</p>



<p>While he’s been a part of large moments in PlayStation history, one may stand out to fans the most. In 2013, while Sony was unveiling the PlayStation 4 (PS4) at E3 2013, Sony took a jab at Microsoft’s disastrous Xbox One reveal earlier the same day. In short tutorial video, Yoshida and former Vice President of Publisher and Developer Relations Adam Boyes showed fans how they can share used games on the PS4.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>At the time of publishing, Sony hasn’t made any official announcement regarding who will take over for Yoshida as Head of Indies Initiative.</p>



<p>When making his decision to leave, Yoshida said that he believes PlayStation “is in really good hands” moving forward.</p>



<p>“I thought, okay, this is my time,” he said.</p>

<p>Black Ops 6 features classic CoD Zombies, marking a true return to form. The series has seen a litany of iconic Zombies maps down the years, but Tranzit is highly regarded, and much loved, and rumors abound the legendary locale could be ready for another round in BLOPS 6. </p>



<p>It’s been a joy to play both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liberty Falls</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terminus</a> in Black Ops 6 Zombies. They each possess characteristics and sport trademarks of the great Zombies maps of yore. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle des Morts</a> on the way, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> Zombies fans are being spoiled.</p>



<p>With three Zombies maps already confirmed, the internet is already rife with speculation about a potential fourth. If gossip is to be believed, the fourth—or any subsequent maps—may turn back the pages of history and welcome back Tranzit to a new audience.</p>

<figure><figcaption>No time for food. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no confirmation of Tranzit returning in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and nothing has leaked via data mining at this moment.</strong></p>



<p>Anything you read about Tranzit returning in Black Ops 6 is pure speculation and conjecture. There is genuinely nothing to substantiate this rumor, but there is a reason why the Tranzit conversation continues to lurk around every undead corner.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-tranzit-rumored-for-black-ops-6">Why is Tranzit rumored for Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 Tranzit rumor is based on the <strong>“Black Ops 6: ‘The Truth Lies’ – Live Action Reveal Trailer”</strong> launched on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CallofDuty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty’s official YouTube channel</a> back on <strong>May 28</strong>.</p>



<p>Several references pertaining to Tranzit pop up during the 57-second trailer. You can see the footage in its entirety below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Interestingly, one of Call of Duty’s leading social media personalities, where Zombies is concerned—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MrRoflWaffles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MrRoflWaffles</a>—broke down why they think Tranzit is destined for a revisit in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>They found several familiar-looking objects and locations in the trailer, and went as far as to say a “<strong>Tranzit-inspired remake</strong>” could be on the cards, but stressed it’s only a “<strong>theory</strong>.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Again, this is all we have on the Tranzit rumors right now. Trust me, I want to see the map return just as badly as many of you reading this right now do. </p>



<p>If you’re a newer CoD player, Black Ops 2’s Tranzit has a special place for many due to its unique map design—featuring a moving bus taking you to several mini-locations all within the overall confines of the map. You could also customize and upgrade the bus mid-round, and it’s still one of the most original Zombies maps to date.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as you never, we may find official information confirming or shutting down the Tranzit rumor.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Sony launched its 30th Anniversary website for PlayStation. The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/playstation-history/2000-ps2-psp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website goes through</a> the console’s history from the original PlayStation through the current PlayStation 5 (PS5). It also gave confirmation of an updated number on the best-selling video game console of all time, the PlayStation 2 (PS2).</p>



<p>According to Sony, the PS2 has sold over 160 million units  since its launch in 2000. Prior to this update, the last known sales total for the console was 158.3 million units.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>The sales include original versions of the console as well us various models, including the PS2 Slim that launched in 2004.</p>



<p>At 160 million units, the PS2 widens its gap as the best-selling console ever. Behind it in the home console space is the Nintendo Switch, which as sold 146 million units. If we were to add handheld systems to the total, the PS2 sits just just six million ahead of the 154.02 million units the Nintendo DS sold in its life cycle.</p>



<p>What made the system so popular were not only the games, but the console’s ability to play DVDs as well. An all-in-one system during a time when DVDs became the norm for movie and TV show purchases made for an enticing buy for players. Obviously, the move paid off. </p>



<p>As far as the current Sony console, the PS5, Sony says that it has sold over 65 million units in its four years on the market.</p>



<p>Do you think a video game console will ever sell as much as the PlayStation 2 ever again? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
