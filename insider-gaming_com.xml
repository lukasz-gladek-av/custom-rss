            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden went in against the company’s pivot to focusing on live-service games, which has yet to pay off. For several years, PlayStation’s studios have tried to produce a solid live-service game, but have mostly failed in their quest to do so.</p>



<p>Layden, who departed PlayStation in 2019 due to the creative direction the company was taking, recently criticized the live-service market, explaining how, in his eyes, live-service titles <strong>aren’t real games</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-again-and-again-and-again">Again and Again and Again</h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2025/10/24/video-games/sony-playstation-online-multiplayer-live-service-struggles-concord-marathon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Ringer</a>, a variety of indutstry names gave their two cents to answer the question, ‘Why can’t Sony make more multiplayer hits?’</p>



<p>One such name was Shawn Layden, a former PlayStation executive who was at the company for just short of a decade, who has fired shots at the live-service mission on PlayStation’s slate.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A live-service game to me isn’t really a game. It’s a repetitive action engagement device.</p>



<p>For me, a game—because of where I come from—means I need three things. I need a story, I need a character, and I need a world. And&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>,&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>&nbsp;have all three of those things. </p>



<p>If you’re doing a live-service game, you just need a repetitive action that most people can get their head around, an ability to communicate in that world with other like-minded people, and the player’s desire to do it again and again and again.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Layden went on to stress that every developer successful in the live-service space found the winning formula ‘five, six years ago’. There was a boom of sorts that saw games like Fortnite skyrocket in popularity, and since then, everyone with a multiplayer offering seems to have jumped on the seasonal operating model.</p>



<p>These days, it’s very rare to succeed with a new live-service game, Layden insists:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s like a mirage on the top of a sand dune. You pursue it. You can’t quite get there. Or if you do get there, what you brought to the party no one wants to play anyway.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think live-service games should be abandoned by developers in favor of an alternate operating model? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>During the Halo World Championship event, the future of the Halo series was uncovered, including the imminent arrival of Halo: Campaign Evolved on PS5. This marks a milestone moment, as it’s the first time in history that a Halo title has wound up on a PlayStation platform.</p>



<p>Those who have potentially never played a Halo game because of their platform of choice are now preparing to dive into the sci-fi shooter series. That’s all well and good, but when is Halo: Campaign Evolved coming to PS5?</p>



<p>Let’s find out about the release window.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-out">When is Halo: Campaign Evolved Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Halo is a legendary series that has been the face of Xbox for more than two decades. The franchise has been expanded over the years with a live-action television series, books, animated projects, and, of course, a hulking stack of major and minor games.</p>



<p>Next year, Halo will come to PlayStation for the first time. This was addressed by the PS team in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-launches-on-ps5-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent blog post</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For nearly 25 years, Halo has offered players an epic sci-fi universe to explore, unforgettable characters to meet, and exhilarating gameplay to experience together. From large-scale battles to friendships formed over late-night co-op sessions, Halo has always been more than just a game – it’s about the players who’ve made it part of their lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the beginning, we wanted to build a world with stories and experiences that bring people together. And now, for the first time, PS5 players will get to be part of that journey too.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, there isn’t a release date for Halo: Campaign Evolved on PS5, Xbox, or PC</strong>. It can be wishlisted on all these platforms, but aside from a window of ‘2026’, there are no further indications as to when Halo: Campaign Evolved will be released.</p>

<p>The worst level in Halo: Combat Evolved is getting some much-needed changes in Halo: Campaign Evolved.</p>



<p>Announced at the Halo World Championships,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>&nbsp;remakes the 2001 classic Halo: Combat Evolved. The game will tell the original story of Master Chief and Cortana beating the Covenant and saving the universe. As a campaign-only title, the game is set to release in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PC, and, for the first time ever,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>. With excitement about the gameplay alive and well, the team told Xbox Wire about a change to the controversial Library level.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved-is-changing-the-library-level-developers-confirm">Halo: Campaign Evolved is Changing The Library Level, Developers Confirm</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">a blog post from Xbox Wire</a>, members of Halo: Campaign Evolved’s development team spoke on the remake. Max Szlagor, the game’s Creative Director, talked about changes being made to certain levels that weren’t done for the Anniversary Edition. Chief among them was the dreaded Library level. Speaking on it, Szlagor said,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We learned from&nbsp;<em>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</em>&nbsp;that there was still an appetite for things like better wayfinding, navigation, and diversity in enemy encounters,” Szlagor states <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">in the blog</a>. “In The Library specifically, which features several Flood encounters, we wanted to reevaluate the pacing and enhance the environmental storytelling. We’ve added new lines to Guilty Spark, which guide players through the level, and there’s new dialogue that gives more insight into the narrative as it plays out. We’re not changing the stories, it’s about refining and adding context to this moment, and other levels like it, so players can stay on track.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you played Halo: Combat Evolved, you know how annoying The Library level is. Countless droves of The Flood and horrible level design made it a challenging chore. Fortunately, new fans, like those on PlayStation, won’t have to suffer much. Plus, with new dialogue for Guilty Spark, the intriguing lore will get the justice it deserves. From developer comments, a lot of changes are in the works for the game, so returning players will have new content to look forward to.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see The Library getting changes for Halo: Campaign Evolved? What are your feelings about the level? Will you be getting the remake?

<p>PlayStation is finally getting a Halo game, Halo Studios confirms.</p>



<p>The battle between Xbox and PlayStation has gone on for almost two decades. Each company would try to outsell the other in consoles and games. However, despite all that the Sony-backed company had, Microsoft had Halo. The premiere FPS multiplayer series was seemingly undefeatable, even at its lows. Now, as Xbox has brought exclusive franchises like Gears of War to PlayStation 5, its golden goose has been let loose from the cage.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-is-getting-halo-combat-evolved-remake-in-2026">PlayStation is Getting Halo Combat Evolved Remake in 2026</h2>

<p>At the Halo World Championships, Halo Studios confirms that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> will launch on PlayStation 5 alongside Xbox and PC consoles. The news appears at the end of the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efThjRym-ks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, which reveals gameplay of the Combat Evolved remake. Furthermore, all upcoming Halo games will release on PlayStation consoles. However, it’s unknown if other titles, like Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Halo: Infinite, will come to the Sony console. The game, a remake of Combat Evolved, releases in 2026, but there is no release date. In addition, cross-play is now in the game, letting you play with players from other consoles.</p>



<p>Despite the competitive nature of the two companies, having Halo on another console is a good thing. As we’ve seen with games like Final Fantasy XVI, staying exclusive can hurt sales and restrict player bases. With Halo: Campaign Evolved coming to PlayStation, more people can finally experience the series the way many of us had back in the day.</p>
