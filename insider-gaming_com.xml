            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Highguard is being released today after several weeks of near radio silence following a sudden unveiling at The Game Awards. It has proven to be a troublesome period for Wildlight, the game’s developer, owing to <strong>many </strong>doubting the validity of the game itself. It has received almost <strong>zero </strong>marketing beyond the initial trailer drop.</p>



<p>Recently, an invite-only event was held in Los Angeles for creators and industry personalities to get hands-on with the title. Naturally, doubters have pushed the rhetoric that they’re only hyping the game up because they were invited to this all-expenses-paid event and handed a bag of cash.</p>



<p>It seems that wasn’t the case, at least for some.</p>







<h2 id="h-were-creators-paid-to-play-highguard">Were Creators Paid to Play Highguard?</h2>



<p>It might not be the case for <strong>every creator</strong>, but in a post on social media, TheMacroShow revealed that they weren’t paid a dime to attend the Highguard event in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>Further, Macro stated they were <strong>offered money </strong>to make a video on the game, but ‘refused because I wanted my audience to have my real opinion on the game.’</p>



<p>It was then claimed that Wildlight didn’t provide a flight, hotel, or ‘even an Uber’ for the event, and that the only ‘compensation’ received was a ‘sandwich during the lunch break.’</p>



<p>Macro wrapped up his statement by stressing that he ‘genuinely had fun playing this game.’</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Unfortunately, his comment was mostly lost in a gargantuan sea of messages from creators far and wide, all pledging their allegiance to Highguard and declaring it a phenomenal game. It echoes Geoff Keighley, who has been a one-man marketing team for Highguard since he hosted the game’s first trailer at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>Wildlight has chosen to take one of the more controversial, inorganic approaches to marketing Highguard. It’s something that’s fast becoming despised by gamers worldwide, and it’s focused entirely on hosting <strong>creator-backed events </strong>and campaigns to promote a game at launch.</p>



<p>In one comment, user ‘KingdumbHD’ wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>All the random online influencers and game journalists suddenly praising and trying to hype up <strong>Highguard</strong> really does feel like the most unnatural, fake ass marketing Ive seen in a long while. Like why would I trust any of their opinions when you’ve obviously <strong>paid</strong> them to say it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In another, a response to a creator hyping the game, Vurkkz wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>dude is absolutely being <strong>paid</strong> to promote the game. there’s also a few content creators out there that are “super excited for <strong>highguard</strong>” I truly hate how bought modern multiplayer games are. Absolutely no organic growth at all anymore.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Highguard will be released later today, exclusively on PC. It should be coming to Xbox and PlayStation later this year, assuming the game proves successful at launch.</p>

<p>The head of Xbox Games Studio, Craig Duncan, has commented on the current state of development for State of Decay 3.</p>



<p>State of Decay 3 was first announced back in July 2020. The last time any public movement indicating development was in 2024, when a trailer dropped with brief gameplay clips. Now, Craig Duncan is confirming that he’s played the game and that Xbox Games Studio remains optimistic about the franchise.</p>







<h2 id="h-state-of-decay-3-is-coming-on-well">State of Decay 3 is ‘Coming on Well’</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/xbox-game-studios-lead-cant-say-when-state-of-decay-3-will-rear-its-head-again-but-he-will-certainly-see-a-lot-more-of-it-in-the-coming-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">During a recent interview with GamesRadar+ </a>following the Xbox Developer Direct, Duncan was asked whether fans of the open-world zombie series could expect new information or gameplay footage this year. He did not give a straightforward answer, but he noted that he’s visited the studio several times in the past year and remains excited about the potential of the next State of Decay.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Here’s what I’ll say: I have done a number of visits to that studio in the last six to eight months. I have sat and played the game with the team a bunch of times. It’s coming on really well.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following the Xbox Developer Direct, Craig Duncan was much more focused on the Fable reboot and the immediate future of Xbox in 2026. </p>







<p>He stated that he knows they have been inconsistent about which of their games head to other platforms as they continue to move forward with their new marketing strategy that encourages players to play Xbox games on all platforms.

<p>The head of Sonic Team has commented on potentially adding “deep-cut” Sonic characters to the game’s roster in future Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds DLC.</p>



<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds was released in 2025 to critical acclaim. As part of the game’s hook, several crossover characters from other universes were added to the roster and the possibilities. These characters include SpongeBob, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Minecraft characters, and more.</p>



<p>However, there is a catalog of Sonic characters lost to time that could also have their moment in the new racing game.</p>







<h2 id="h-sonic-racing-crossworlds-should-represent-all-eras-of-sonic">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Should Represent All Eras of Sonic</h2>



<p>Takashi Iizuka was recently interviewed by <a href="https://mcvuk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MCV Magazine </a>(<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonic-boss-says-hes-open-to-adding-deep-cut-sonic-characters-as-crossworlds-dlc/">h/t: Video Games Chronicle</a>). In the interview, he was asked about seeing deeper cuts from Sonic lore coming to the game as possible downloadable content, specifically characters from the ’90s animated TV series or the IDW comics.</p>



<p>Takashi Iizuka noted that he sees the passion around the extended universe and wants all eras of Sonic represented, so anything’s possible with the opportunity feels right.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There’s a lot of passion around the extended Sonic universe, and we’re open to including the ‘deep cut’ characters if the opportunity feels right,” Iizuka replied. “We want Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds to represent all eras of Sonic.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While this doesn’t confirm the return of fan-favorite characters like Sally Acorn, it does leave the door open for that level of surprising additions in the future.</p>







<p>Speaking of Sonic’s deep history, the franchise is currently celebrating its 35th anniversary. As part of that celebration, a new audio drama is coming to podcast platforms based around the Chaotix.

<p>Kota Furushima, the game director of Beast of Reincarnation, has commented on Game Freak’s history of criticism for how its 3D open-world games look and run.</p>



<p>Game Freak is best known for its work on the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon, while a beloved IP, does not feature 3D games that fully maximize hardware potential in 2026. Sometimes, recent Pokémon games have struggled to function properly. However, Beast of Reincarnation, the new game from Game Freak, looks to be a game on par with most.</p>







<h2 id="h-game-freak-prioritizes-creating-experiences">Game Freak Prioritizes Creating Experiences</h2>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-game-director-answers-all-our-burning-questions-about-the-pokemon-developers-upcoming-action-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Kota Furushima addressed these criticisms. He noted that, overall, they’re always striving to create a unique experience rather than hyper-fixating on reaching a certain quality Benchmark.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our focus is on that gameplay experience. Part of that, of course, is making sure that it performs really well, but our attention is more on getting the experience over to you and making sure that our vision can get to your hands and your hearts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, he spoke about the game being centered on natural environments and very rooted in Japanese inspiration. He also noted that the video game’s score was rooted in themes of loneliness and isolation, while also emphasizing the importance of learning to rely on others.</p>







<p>Beast of Reincarnation is slated to release this summer.

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero will be receiving some new DLC in the near future.</p>



<p>The Dragon Ball team has announced that the latest console game in the Dragon Ball franchise, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, will receive a major DLC release this summer. The DLC was released as part of the franchise’s 40th anniversary celebration. As part of the celebration, a trailer revealed that Super Android 17 would be coming to the game. </p>



<p>As well as the ‘Great Demon King’ Piccolo, the villainous version of Piccolo from the original Dragon Ball series. Super Saiyan Bardock is also on his way to the franchise. More names are also planned to join the lineup.</p>



<p>Additionally, there will be new cosmetics and other skill customizations. The trailer also teases a new single-player game mode. More is expected to be announced in the coming months.</p>

<h2 id="h-there-s-also-a-new-dragon-ball-game-coming-in-2027">There’s Also A New Dragon Ball Game Coming in 2027</h2>



<p>Additionally, the celebration revealed that a new game project is in the works. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/">Known as “Age 1000,</a>” it was accompanied by a brief trailer. Work on Age 1000 began more than 5 years ago, and Akira Toriyama, the franchise’s creator, worked on the game’s world-building and even on some brand-new characters. Great news for longtime fans of the series who thought that Toriyama’s passing in 2024 might have meant that the last of his work had already been seen.</p>







<p>More information about the forthcoming game will be revealed during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 in April.</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is currently available for purchase on all Xbox consoles, PlayStation 5, Steam, and the Nintendo Switch family of consoles.</p>

<p>The game currently has a mixed reaction on Metacritic with a 70 Metascore. The user rating is a little more unforgiving, currently at 4.8. Some reviews knock the game for being buggy and urge others not to buy. Well, PlayStation Plus users won’t have to buy the game in February if they want to try it out. </p>



<p>Currently, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed and Need for Speed Unbound are available to download for free on PlayStation Plus.</p>
