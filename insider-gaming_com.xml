<p>New leaks suggest that Epic Games and Fortnite are working on a new extraction shooter gamemode.</p>



<p><span>The news comes from Fortnite leaker and data miner&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Loolo_WRLD</a>&nbsp;on X (formerly Twitter), who revealed that despite some rumors suggesting that the gam</span>e mode is canceled, it is, in fact, still in development.</p>



<p>While it’s unclear what the game would entail in the Fortnite universe, it will likely follow almost every other extraction shooter in the market with its game loop. Drop into a map, gather resources, extract, and repeat.<a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD"></a></p>



<p>Loolo_WRLD was careful to point out that “things might change,” as is the case with all leaks, so we’ll have to wait and see if the gamemode comes to fruition.</p>



<p>According to leakers, the game mode is currently under development under the codename “Arnold.” </p>



<p>Last week, new rumors surfaced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-og-has-up-to-90-bots-per-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite OG Has Up to 90% Bots Per Game</a> for lower-skilled players. Epic Games has yet to comment officially on the addition of bots and skill-based matchmaking in Fortnite, but if there is an official announcement, we’ll be sure to update this article.</p>



<p>What do you think of Fortnite trying out the extraction shooter genre? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike is one of the most iconic PC titles in the history of gaming. The definitive first-person tactical shooter is synonymous with PC gaming, and has been since the first game released in 2000. Even now, following the release of Counter-Strike 2 in 2023, the series is still a dominant force on computers.</p>



<p>Many multiplayer shooters find success appealing to player bases outside of PC though. Has Counter-Strike finally done the same?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-counter-strike-only-on-pc">Is Counter-Strike Only on PC?</h2>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 has only been officially released on PC. The lack of an official version for players on Mac is surprising, given that the game’s predecessor Counter-Strike: Global Offensive did in fact have official Mac support. CS2 is “playable” on Mac, but not in an official capacity.</p>



<p>CS2 is not available on any console either, though CS:GO still appears to be playable on the older generation. CS:GO released for Xbox 360 and PS3 when it came out in 2013. CS:GO was replaced by CS2 on PC when the current game launched last year, but the Xbox 360 version <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/csgo-xbox-360/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains online</a>, at least as recently as September 2023.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game is also playable on Steam Deck, but it is not optimized for Valve’s handheld device. The CS2 Steam Deck compatibility rating states that it shows mouse and keyboard icons, as well as small in-game text that may be difficult to read on a smaller screen.</p>



<p>CS2’s launch without a console version indicates that it is probably not a huge priority for Valve at this time. However, Valve’s competitor Riot eventually <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-consoles-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a console version of VALORANT</a> years after its launch, so it wouldn’t be unheard of if Valve did the same.</p>



<p>Do you wish CS2 would come out on something else than PC? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Path of Exile 2, Grinding Games’ latest action RPG, was going to be a free-to-play title. However, you need to pay $30 to play the game in early access right now. So when does Path of Exile 2 actually become free-to-play? The short answer is when the developers decide to remove it from early access.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-path-of-exile-2-early-access-end-nbsp">When Does Path of Exile 2 Early Access End?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Currently, there is no concrete end date for Path of Exile 2’s early access. However, the developers have provided an estimated period in the game’s <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3587981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ section</a>. The answer to how long the early access will run is “As long as needed, we expect at least 6 months.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the developers’ estimated window, Path of Exile 2 will seemingly become free to play by June 2025. However, this is not a confirmed window, and as the developers have stated, “as long as needed,” they could take longer or even finish earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the moment, you must pay a minimum of $30 to play Path of Exile 2’s early access on Steam, Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-can-you-play-path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where to play the game in early access</a> here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Developer Argonaut Games announced that the remaster for Croc Legend of the Gobbos has been delayed into 2025. The game was originally scheduled to be released in December 2024.</p>



<p>In a message <a href="https://x.com/ArgonautGames_/status/1865093859237056975" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted online</a>, Argonaut said that game will now launch in Q1 2025.</p>



<p>“After careful consideration, we have decided to push the launch into Q1 2025,”  they said. “This decision was not made lightly, but we believe that a little more time is needed to add the final touches to ensure the game meets the high standards that we aspire to and which you deserve.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The statement continues by acknowledging that the news is “disappointing” for players to hear. The team wanted to make sure, however, that the game had the “quality and polish” it needs for release.</p>



<p>“[Our] goal has always been to deliver a game with the quality and polish that will truly delight,” they said. “We appreciate your patience and support as we work to bring Croc back in the best possible way.”</p>



<p>Despite the game’s delay, Argonaut seems excited about the return of the franchise. In a reply to a <a href="https://x.com/ArgonautGames_/status/1865976674568880358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fan on Twitter</a> on Sunday, they teased more Croc remasters, including Croc 3, should the first game do well when it launches.</p>



<p>“We’ve already stated that if the Croc remasters do well, we’d like to make Croc 3,” they said.</p>
