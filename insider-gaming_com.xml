<p>Lenovo has announced the Lenovo Legion Go S, the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-announces-steamos-is-available-for-third-party-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-party handheld</a> gaming PC to come with SteamOS installed instead of Windows. The announcement was made on Tuesday at CES 2025.</p>



<p>Launching in May, Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS will cost $499. The <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">handheld features</a> an eight-inch 16:10 touch display at 120Hz. Internal specs include a Lenovo-exclusive AMD Ryzen Z2 Go or AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor,16GB of memory, 512GB of storage, and a 55.5Whr battery. </p>



<p>Other features include Wi-Fi 6e support, two USB 4 ports, and a MicroSD slot for expanded storage. Regarding battery life, Lenovo says that the Legion Go S should have 2.5-3 hours on a full charge, depending on the gaming being done.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As far as what’s gone from the original Legion Go, the new device no longer features a kickstand or detachable controllers akin to the Nintendo Switch. By removing these features and making the device slightly smaller, it brings the weight of the Legion Go S down to 1.61lbs.</p>



<p>The Lenovo Legion Go S will also launch with a version that comes with Windows preinstalled for those that prefer Microsoft’s operating system. The Windows version of the device will release this month for $729.99 and include 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. As with all Windows devices, Steam can be installed as a standalone application.</p>



<p>The Windows version comes in white while the SteamOS version comes in black.</p>

<p>Valve has announced that SteamOS is being made available and launched for third-party devices moving forward. The announcement comes alongside the <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveal of the Lenovo Legion Go S</a> at CES 2025.</p>



<p>It also comes just months after Valve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-is-bringing-steamos-support-to-rival-handhelds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed that it was working</a> on bringing the operating system (OS) to other devices</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/529834914570306831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam’s website</a>, Valve says that the operating system was developed to “provide a seamless user experience optimized for gaming, while retaining access to the power and flexibility of a PC.” The OS isn’t available on other handheld devices yet, but Valve says the work being done for the Lenovo Legion Go S — which comes installed with SteamOS instead of Windows — will improve the operating system’s compatibility with other handheld PCs.</p>



<p>“Ahead of Legion Go S shipping, we will be shipping a beta of SteamOS which should improve the experience on other handhelds, and users can download and test this themselves,” Valve said. “And of course we’ll continue adding support and improving the experience with future releases.”</p>







<p>It’s unclear what other devices will be “powered by SteamOS” in the future, but it appears to be only a matter of time before they are announced. There’s also the recent rumors that Valve is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-pointing-to-a-new-steam-console-from-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working on bringing back Steam Machines</a>, a decade after they were first announced and released to consumers.</p>



<p>What do you think about Valve bringing SteamOS to other handheld PCs? Do you think it impacts the future of the Steam Deck in any way?

<p>Riot has confirmed that the VALORANT 2025 season, the first official “season” now that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-ditches-episodes-for-yearly-season-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the developers are pivoting away from episodes</a>, will be primarily focused on improvement. There will definitely be new content across the six acts planned for 2025, but the priority will be getting the the game into “its best shape ever,” according to the most recent dev diary.</p>



<p>What does this mean for VALORANT in 2025? It means balancing some of the most powerful and weak agents, improving the ranked experience, keeping the map rotation fresh, and saying hello to two new mystery agents.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-valorant-2025-agent-changes">VALORANT 2025 Agent Changes</h2>



<p>Agents continue to be the primary focus for VALORANT in 2025, as the unique cast of characters is what sets the game apart from other tactical shooters. After several balancing changes in 2024, more are set for 2025.</p>



<p>Iso, the recipient of a massive buff to his Double Tap shield in <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-811/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patch 8.11</a>, will receive some “power budget redistribution.” The agent team for VALORANT was hesitant to commit to changes to Neon though. They will revisit her “if they need to” after her drastic but necessary <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-9-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patch 9.11</a> nerfs.</p>

<iframe title="What’s New for Season 2025 // Dev Updates - VALORANT" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YpNsGFd74fk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The team did commit to improving two of the least popular and least powerful agents: Deadlock and Harbor. With Deadlock, the team says they are aiming to make Sound Sensors more valuable, and to give her more aggressive potential. With Harbor, they want to make him “more satisfying” to play as.</p>



<h2 id="h-ranked-and-map-pool-changes">Ranked and Map Pool Changes</h2>



<p>With six acts planned for the VALORANT 2025 season, Riot has committed to changing the active map pool each act. At the start of each act, Riot will rotate in two maps and swap two out, but have said the number “might change” throughout the year.</p>



<p>As for the VALORANT’s competitive mode, which is now the official entry point into the esports ecosystem, two crucial changes should make the climb easier. Players will now be granted a “rank shield” that protects them from dropping <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-valorant-ranks-how-to-get-radiant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">between skill rank divisions</a> right away. This shield gives you one more opportunity to win before falling from Gold I to Silver III, for example. Finally, rank rating rollbacks (or refunds) will be added in 2025. If If a player is banned for cheating, you get refunded the RR you lost playing against them.</p>
