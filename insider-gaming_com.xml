<p>Overwatch developers are asking players not to ban Jetpack Cat, as players get tired of the overpowered character’s abilities. </p>



<p>Overwatch came in guns blazing for their latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-new-content-in-overwatch-season-1-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 update</a>, introducing 5 new Heroes to the title, including Domina, Emre, Mizuki, Anran, and Jetpack Cat. Along with that, new sub-roles for the core roles and a bunch of other content were revealed. Today, we are talking about one of the newly released characters. </p>







<h2 id="h-overwatch-s-jetpack-cat-seems-to-be-too-overpowered">Overwatch’s Jetpack Cat Seems to be Too Overpowered</h2>



<p>Overwatch has just posted on their official <a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/2021774745243726021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), “NO BAN JETPACK CAT PLZ” with a very innocent image of the character. Many players in the comments section don’t agree with the developers, stating they will continue to ban the character, while others request a balance in the character’s skills. Some players seem to agree, chiming in with the ‘don’t ban Jetpack Cat’ chants. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There is a full-fledged Reddit post on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1r1iuj4/jetpack_cat_has_a_massive_issue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Competitiveoverwatch</a>, discussing how the character can be a big problem in competitive games. It seems that Jetpack Cat excels at close and midrange duels and can disengage easily. What’s more, their ultimate attack is considered a guaranteed tank killer, and the Tether ability can be a game-changer as well. Many players have said they want the character permanently banned until changes are made. </p>

<p>A new claim states that Kingdom Hearts is coming to Fortnite in the coming months. </p>



<p>Fortnite has a lot of collaborations in the works for this year, some we have already heard about, and others are still in the leaks and rumours stage. It seems the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-overwatch-crossover-brings-genji-tracer-d-va/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch</a> one is pretty close, since the collaboration’s characters have been revealed. However, the rumoured <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rumored-to-be-working-on-a-minecraft-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft collab</a> has yet to be announced. We have now received information about another game collab. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-kingdom-hearts-arriving-in-the-coming-months">Fortnite x Kingdom Hearts Arriving in the Coming Months</h2>



<p>The leak about Fortnite x Kingdom Hearts comes from Fortnite leaker AdiraFNInfo on <a href="https://x.com/AdiraFNInfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), reposted by reliable <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/2021768076199440527">ShiinaBR</a>. The leak states that the collaboration is already in active development and should arrive in the “next months”. ShiinaBR added that they had recently heard this information from multiple leakers, each with different sources. It is also speculated that it will be 3 more months before an official announcement for this collab.  </p>



<p>Kingdom Hearts is a popular action RPG series developed by Square Enix, and Disney owns the IP. It features a crossover of various Disney and Square Enix properties, with the main narrative centered on Sora and characters from both universes. The series consists of 13 games across multiple platforms, so it will be hard to tell what they might choose for the Fortnite collaboration. </p>







<p>In other news, Embark Studios has confirmed that ARC Raiders won’t get Fortnite-style skin collaborations <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-wont-have-fortnite-skins-protect-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a bid to keep the game grounded</a>. Additionally, Fortnite’s Chapter 7 Season 2 has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-2-delayed-by-over-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed by over two weeks</a>.
