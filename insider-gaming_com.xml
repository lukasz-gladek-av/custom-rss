<p>The SAG-AFTRA strike involving video game performance actors is set to continue after the latest negotiations have failed to result in a new deal. In an <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/member-message-video-game-strike-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update posted</a> on its official website Tuesday night, the union’s chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland for the video game strike says there has been progress in some areas, but it’s not enough to curb the concerns the union has about “A.I. Abuse”.</p>



<p>“Though progress has been made and agreements have been reached on certain provisions since we launched our strike last year, the last proposal the bargaining group made is still filled with alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to A.I. abuse,” the statement reads. “The union recently submitted a counter to this proposal that diligently addresses all of the loopholes and would result in a contract that offers the minimum protections our members need in order to maintain sustainable careers as video game performers.”</p>



<p>The statement continues to say that the “bargaining group” wants to paint a picture than a deal is close. Crabtree-Ireland says that it’s not the case and it’s part of a hope to have union members “turn on each other”.</p>



<p>“They want to use all past performances and any performance they can source from outside the contract&nbsp;without&nbsp;any of the protections being bargained at all,” Crabtree-Ireland wrote. “You could be told nothing about your replica being used, offered nothing in the way of payment, and you could do nothing about it. They want to be able to make your replica continue to work, as you, during a future strike, whether you like it or not. And once you’ve given your specific consent for how your replica can be used, they refuse to tell you what they&nbsp;actually&nbsp;did with it.”</p>



<p>In response to the latest statement from the union, representatives on behalf of the studios provided a statement to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. </p>



<p>“”We have proposed a deal that includes wage increases of over 15 percent for SAG-AFTRA represented performers in video games, as well as enhanced health and safety protections, industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor’s performance in other games,” spokesperson Audrey Cooling said. “We have made meaningful progress and are eager to return to the bargaining table to reach a deal.”</p>



<p>The current video game actor strike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began in July 2024</a>.  Despite it continuing, however, the union says that “more than 160 games” have signed interim and independent agreements to allow them to work wit SAG-AFTRA members.</p>



<p>“Those agreements contain the protections we have been asking the bargaining group for — terms that are clearly feasible and acceptable to a great number of game companies of all sizes, even as the bargaining companies resist,” the union says.</p>

<p>The Show has an interesting history with Microsoft. If you’re on the edge of your seat waiting for news about MLB The Show 25 coming to Xbox Game Pass, the answer is reaching you swifter than a fastball.</p>



<p>2021 was a landmark year for MLB The Show. It signalled the end of PlayStation’s decade-plus long exclusive relationship with the series. Microsoft finally managed to get a bit of the pitcher pie starting with MLB The Show 21. Each new release is a multi-platform extravaganza allowing PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo players to get picked.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mlb-the-show-25-cover-athletes-and-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MLB The Show 25</a> is 2025’s newest rewriting of the rulebook with multiple cover stars, tons of new animations, and much more. It’s all promising, but let’s see if it’s even better for Xbox Game Pass subscribers.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Guess where this one is going. Credit to San Diego Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Despite its history, MLB The Show 25 is not arriving as a day-one launch on Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass service.</strong></p>



<p>The news might come as a shock to Game Pass users—more on this later. As it stands, MLB The Show 25 is not coming to Xbox Game Pass. Given that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-mlb-the-show-25-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a> starts shortly, this is unlikely to change either.</p>



<p>The official <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/p/9NZP0WKX3WJD/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MLB The Show 25 Xbox Store page</a> makes no mention of Game Pass anywhere—nor do any trailers. It’s a cold, hard strike on this one but it’s not time to sit down yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-mlb-the-show-25-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will MLB The Show 25 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>MLB The Show 24 came to Xbox Game Pass on day one in 2024, meaning there is a good chance MLB The Show will follow suit and arrive on Game Pass in the future.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, I’m not sure why MLB The Show 25 has missed out this year. The 2024 edition was a day-one benefit for Game Pass.</p>



<p>However, MLB The Show 25 hasn’t been as lucky. As there is a precedent of The Show games appearing on Game Pass, I’d wager it’s only a matter of time before Microsoft throws a curveball for those unwilling to purchase the game straight away.</p>



<p>We’ll update this article if the move comes to fruition for Xbox and PC users.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-2-player-count-how-many-people-are-playing-cs2-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Despite eternally sitting at the top of the Steam charts, the player count for Counter-Strike 2 is still an important metric to many in the community. From its early CS:GO days to its current day CS2, Counter-Strike continues to grow at an impressive rate, despite periods of fluctuation.</p>



<p>The doomers that predicted that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Counter-Strike would die</a> after the release of CS2 have been proved (so far) to be very wrong.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-counter-strike-2-player-count-march-2025">Counter-Strike 2 Player Count (March 2025)</h2>



<p>On March 1st, 2025, CS2 achieved 1,789,374 concurrent players, its highest ever player peak since releasing. CS2 is also currently averaging over 1 million players since mid February, which is also a first for the newest version of the game. The only time in Counter-Strike’s illustrious history when it was more popular was in May 2023, when CS:GO hit a peak of 1,818,773 and was averaging over 1.1 million players.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As mentioned earlier, CS2 effectively owns the top spot on Steam’s Most Played chart. There are only three games that have ever had higher concurrent player peaks: PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, Black Myth: Wukong, and Palworld. To put into context how popular CS2 is, PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS is currently the second most played game on Steam, and CS2 has almost twice as many players.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-cs2-more-popular-than-cs-go">Why is CS2 More Popular Than CS:GO?</h2>



<p>Despite resounding community resentment towards CS2 after it was first released, the game did reignite many dormant fans and attract several new ones. CS2’s esports scene has also flourished since the COVID-19 online-only era, attracting hundreds of thousands of viewers a day. While the game is certainly not in a perfect state, Valve has released updates addressing major issues, launched a new seasonal competitive model in Premier, and is keeping the map pool fresh.</p>



<p>Is CS2 in a good place? Is it possible that it eclipses 2 million players? Let us know down below or in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shareholder-claims-company-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-ea-and-microsoft-about-ip-acquisition/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>An Ubisoft shareholder is planning a protest outside the company’s Paris offices after it claims the studio failed to disclose meetings regarding a potential acquisition.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-plots-protest-outside-paris-hq-accuses-company-of-failing-to-reveal-discussions-with-microsoft-ea-and-others-allegedly-interested-in-acquiring-ips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, AJ Investments, a firm with less than a 1% stake in Ubisoft, says that studio is “horribly mismanaged by current management”. In addition, the firm’s CEO Juraj Krúpa says that the company failed to disclose reported meetings with EA and Microsoft, among other interested parties, regarding potential acquisition of Ubisoft IPs.</p>



<p>Krúpa says that the company didn’t “appropriately” communicate its plans or talks with shareholders. Because of that, he is calling those “who are frustrated with the prolonged stagnation in Ubisoft’s stock performance and the lack of decisive action from the management team” to join them in protest in May.</p>



<p>Krúpa added that AJ Investments is ready to sue Ubisoft for “misleading investors”. He did add, however, that they are aware of Ubisoft management having a financial review of various strategic options that is being advised by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan</p>



<p>In a statement given to IGN, Ubisoft restated its past messaging that reviews of strategic and capitalistic options is ongoing at the company.</p>



<p>“The Board has established an ad-hoc independent Committee to oversee this formal and competitive process, so as to extract the best value from Ubisoft’s assets and franchises for all stakeholders,” the company said. “Ubisoft will inform the market in accordance with applicable regulations if and once a transaction materialises.”</p>
