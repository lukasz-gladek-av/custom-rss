<p>God of War Ragnarok’s Kratos actor has shared some new details on the upcoming Trilogy Remake. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Sony’s PlayStation State of Play event brought two new announcements for God of War fans: the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmation</a> of the original Trilogy Remake and a shadow drop for the 2D prequel title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sons of Sparta</a>. Now, new information about the trilogy remake has been revealed. </p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-to-include-new-technology-and-fighting-system">God of War Trilogy Remake to Include New Technology and Fighting System </h2>



<p>Spotted in a video posted by RebsGaming on <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024350952476856596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), YouTuber Fuzhpuzy had the opportunity to meet Kratos actor, Christopher Judge, and ask him about the God of War Trilogy Remake. The YouTuber first asks whether Judge will be part of the remake, to which the actor replies, ‘No,’ and adds that it will include TC Carson, the original voice actor for Kratos from the Greek trilogy. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">YouTuber Fuzhpuzy asked God of War voice actor Christopher Judge if he’s in the upcoming GoW Remakes. He said:<br>•Kratos will be voiced by TC Carson in the remakes, Christopher won’t be in it. <br>•Remakes will have new technology, fighting system, and content. <br>•New GoW from Santa… <a href="https://t.co/bCSiIUiJEv">pic.twitter.com/bCSiIUiJEv</a></p>— Rebs Gaming (@Mr_Rebs_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024350952476856596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Judge elaborated that God of War Trilogy Remake is not a reboot and will feature “new technology” and a “new fighting system”. No details were revealed on what this new system would include or how it would change the previous one. Previously, we had only received confirmation that the trilogy remake is in development and were told it would be a long time before we received another update. The announcement also came through TC Carson, who confirmed that he will be voicing Kratos in the remake. </p>







<p>In other news, Christopher Judge has also stated that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-actor-says-new-santa-monica-announcement-will-arrive-late-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Santa Monica announcement</a> is coming late summer. Additionally, God of War: Sons of Sparta has received <span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-recieves-harsh-comments-from-og-creator/" target="_blank">harsh criticism from the OG series’</a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-recieves-harsh-comments-from-og-creator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> creator</a>.

<p>The actor who played Kratos in God of War 2018 has revealed some details about the trilogy remake and the next Santa Monica announcement. </p>



<p>God of War has been in the news a lot recently, and that’s all thanks to PlayStation’s latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play event</a>, which dropped not but two announcements. There were already reports that Santa Monica was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/santa-monica-developing-more-than-just-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing another title</a> alongside the God of War Trilogy Remake, and now we have some more concrete information. </p>











<p>Spotted by RebsGaming on <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024350952476856596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), YouTuber Fuzhpuzy is seen talking to God of War 2018’s Kratos actor, Christopher Judge, at some fan expo. During their conversation, Judge talks about TC Carson playing Kratos in the trilogy remake before talking about what’s next. Judge states, “You’ll be hearing about what we’re doing probably late summer,” which hints at another announcement from Santa Monica. The video is currently unavailable on the YouTuber’s channel. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">YouTuber Fuzhpuzy asked God of War voice actor Christopher Judge if he’s in the upcoming GoW Remakes.

<p>This is not the first time we have heard about Santa Monica’s other game. In addition to the previous report, insider <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2024186170955944085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NateTheHate</a> has also stated that he has heard the Cory Barlog game will be “shown this year and then released in 2027”. However, one thing is unclear: whether this is the God of War Egypt game or some other IP altogether. Players will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure. </p>







<p>In other news, God of War: Sons of Sparta is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-is-the-worst-rated-game-in-the-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worst-rated game in the series</a>. Additionally, the 2018 title and Ragnarok have <span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-2018-and-ragnarok-have-generated-over-1-4-billion-in-combined-sales/" target="_blank">generated over $1 billion in sales combined</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite is seemingly going to collab with one of the most popular live-action series out there, Game of Thrones. </p>



<p>Collabs are something Fortnite is known for, and the developers have been cooking up some really cool ones lately. Some of the biggest ones we have seen lately are with The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Simpsons</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Park</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-to-feature-quentin-tarantinos-dream-kill-bill-chapter-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kill Bill</a>, Back to the Future, and more. Now, it seems that Epic might have even more in store for us. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-game-of-thrones-is-in-development">Fortnite x Game of Thrones is in Development</h2>



<p>The news about the Game of Thrones and Fortnite collab comes from AdiraFNInfo on <a href="https://x.com/AdiraFNInfo/status/2024434171444101235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) and has been corroborated by reliable leaker, <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/2024434380031017202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>. The collaboration is expected to arrive “soon,” but the contents and scope of this crossover were not revealed. </p>



<p>Game of Thrones is a fantasy drama series by HBO, an adaptation of George R. R. Martin’s novel. It received widespread critical acclaim and spawned spinoffs such as House of the Dragon, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, and more. </p>



<p>Some of the most popular characters from the series include Jon Snow (played by Kit Harrington), Arya Stark (played by Maisie Williams), Daenerys Targaryen (played by Emilia Clarke), Tyrion Lannister (played by Peter Dinklage), and more. Players would also love to see the Dragons come to Fortnite as a part of this collaboration. </p>



<p>A lot of rumoured Fortnite collaborations have surfaced recently. We have been informed of crossovers with franchises such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-has-a-kingdom-hearts-collab-in-development-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vampire-diaries-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vampire Diaries</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rumored-to-be-working-on-a-minecraft-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a>, and others; however, none have been officially revealed yet. Some of the leaks that have been accurately revealed recently include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leak-reveals-the-office-collab-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Office</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-x-fortnite-collaboration-dropping-in-months-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem has a long list of trophies and achievements for completionists to churn through, some of which will require careful steps.</strong></p>

<p>The trophies and achievements shown below may include some that are hidden and secret, so this is your warning that spoilers may lie ahead.</p>

<p><strong>This is the final warning before a slew of Resident Evil Requiem spoilers, so this is your last chance to look away!</strong></p>



<p>Alyssa Ashcroft’s fate is cleared up with a full death scene, showing she has been killed by Victor Gideon. As shown in the trailers, he is the main villain of the story, alongside Zeno, who is a clone of Wesker.</p>



<p>The set-up for future games is significant, however, as Spencer makes a return. It’s revealed that Grace is actually Spencer’s daughter. While not officially stated that Alyssa was forced to adopt Grace, it’s implied, and Alyssa was put in charge of Grace’s care after his death.</p>



<p>Despite Spencer’s previous death, it’s made clear he was pulling the strings throughout Requiem, and the release of the cure to the virus was all part of his masterplan.</p>



<p>For completionists, there are two unlockable outfits, one for each character, and 12 unlockable weapons to find.</p>



<p>The majority of the major leaks come from <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-requiem-spoiler-thread.1438951/page-13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dusk Golem on the ResetEra forums</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-9-ending-spoilers-explained">Resident Evil 9 Ending Spoilers, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Resident Evil 9 has two possible endings, based on your approach in-game, with a ‘good’ ending, which is canon, and a non-canon ‘bad’ ending.</strong></p>



<p>In the good ending, Elpis, a cure for the infection, is released, resulting in both Grace and Leon surviving. The bad ending, where Elpis is destroyed, leads to Leon’s death.</p>



<p>Crucially, the good ending that cures Leon of his infection leads to him de-ageing and becoming younger, following in the footsteps of Jill. In this ending, Victor Gideon kills Zeno, preventing him from killing Leon.</p>



<p>In the bad ending, Gideon doesn’t appear at the end, and Zeno explodes Leon’s head. However, he also dies as the platform where they are standing collapses.</p>



<p>As mentioned, the ‘bad’ ending with Leon’s death is not <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630">Capcom</a>‘s ‘canon’ ending, and thus leaves the door open for the character to return in future.</p>

<p>A new post teases a focus on Generation 9 for Pokémon TCG Pocket’s next set. </p>



<p>We learned something about Pokémon TCG Pocket recently, with the devs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-has-no-plans-for-tcg-pocket-to-become-a-major-competitive-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirming to Insider Gaming</a> that there are no immediate plans for it to become a competitive game and that it will remain a side event at tournaments. Sticking to their guns, the developers have now teased the next set for the title. </p>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-s-next-set-may-focus-on-gen-9">Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Next Set May Focus on Gen 9</h2>



<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/2024197224645660880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) of Pokémon TCG Pocket has posted a new video teasing Gen 9 for the next set. The video features people in costumes of the Gen 9 starters, including Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. Towards the end of the video, we are flashed with a date and time, February 19, 14:00 UTC. Many players in the comments section are theorising what this tease could be, while others are asking for other upgrades and features.  </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Gen 9 Pokémon are primarily found in the Paldea Region, which was introduced in Scarlet and Violet. TCG Pocket currently features some Gen 9 Pokémon with a line for Sprigatito. However, we are yet to receive the Fuecoco and Quaxly lines. Players will have to wait for the official announcement to know for sure what this tease means for the game. </p>
