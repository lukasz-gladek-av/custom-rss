<p>The Split Fiction game director has revealed that he has received the first draft of the upcoming adaptation’s script. </p>



<p>The movie adaptation of Split Fiction was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-movie-confirmed-with-sydney-sweeney-taking-a-lead-role/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed in April 2025</a>, less than 2 months after the game’s release. It has some big names attached to it, with Sydney Sweeney taking one of the lead roles and Deadpool &amp; Wolverine screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick writing the script. </p>







<h2 id="h-split-fiction-director-has-met-sydney-sweeney">Split Fiction Director Has Met Sydney Sweeney  </h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/split-fiction-game-director-exciting-update-sydney-sweeney-movie-3311457/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> report, news that the first script for the Split Fiction movie has reached the game’s director comes from an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTw4CbhDZZT/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram post</a> by Moviezine. The post features a video in which Josef Fares states that he has received the “first version of the script.” However, he added that he will believe it when he sees it, due to “so much talk in Hollywood”. Fares also said that he had a conversation with the Euphoria star, and “she seems pretty chill” and “hyped for the movie”. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Split Fiction is a co-op title from the creators of It Takes Two, Hazelight Studios. It features the tale of two writers who are trapped in the adventures of each other’s stories. One of the writers specialises in fantasy stories and the other in sci-fi, and they have been hooked into a machine that steals their ideas. The game features a variety of abilities and several challenges that blend sci-fi and fantasy into a unique perspective. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Esports Nations Cup Reveals Insane $45 Million Commitment to Competitors]]></title>

            <guid>1419715</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Esports World Cup Foundation has today unveiled a monumental $45 million commitment to the players, teams, and organizations participating in the upcoming Esports Nations Cup. The event is set to unravel in Riyadh in November, and it’s in addition to the staggering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-world-cup-2026-prize-pool-75-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$75 million Esports World Cup</a>, which begins in July.</p>



<p>While the Esports World Cup is centered around traditional organizations fielding teams across multiple games, the Esports Nations Cup is a country-based competition circuit that encourages national pride, amongst other things.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-ewcf-has-pledged-120-million-to-esports">The EWCF Has Pledged $120 Million to Esports</h2>



<p>The headline here is that the Esports World Cup Foundation, backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, has pledged an eye-watering $120 million to the esports space this year alone.</p>



<p>From November 2 to November 29, a host of countries will send their squads to Riyadh to compete across a slew of games, fighting for prize pools, recognition, and geographical bragging rights. In a press release, the $45 million pledge was broken down accordingly:</p>



<ul>
<li>$20 million in prize money, spread across 16 titles</li>



<li>$5 million in Club incentives for clubs that release and enable their professional players to participate in the ENC</li>



<li>$20 million through the ENC Development Fund, supporting partners with logistics, travel, marketing, and growth</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s hard to see a downside to this venture, as $20 million being set aside to help organizations get to this global stage is admirable, if nothing else.</p>



<p>In the release, the CEO of the EWCF, Ralf Reichert, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>National teams bring a powerful new layer to esports, one that is accessible, intuitive, and rooted in identity and pride. Clubs are the cultural backbone of esports. Nation-based competition expands the stage, creates new rivalries, and gives more fans a reason to care from day one. </p>



<p>Our prize model is designed to keep competition fair and sustainable, rewarding performance while supporting the long-term development of players, Clubs, and national programs.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thus far, the EWCF has announced only a few titles out of the 16 coming to the Esports Nations Cup:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</li>



<li>Trackmania</li>



<li>Dota 2</li>
</ul>



<p>More games will be announced in the coming days.</p>

<p>Call of Duty’s iconic map has made its way into Hytale thanks to the hardworking modders. </p>



<p>Hytale is still in early access; however, modders have been hard at work to make the experience as enjoyable as possible. Over the past few days, we have seen the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-is-coming-to-hytale-through-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-minecraft-crossplay-mod-has-been-created/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft crossplay</a>, and more make it to the title. Now, Activision’s iconic FPS franchise has joined the fray as well. </p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-now-has-call-of-duty-s-hijacked-and-cod-like-zombies-mod">Hytale Now Has Call of Duty’s Hijacked and Cod-Like Zombies Mod</h2>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/hytale-modders-have-recreated-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WindowsCentral</a>, Call of Duty mods have now been integrated into Hytale. One modder has successfully added maps, including Hijacked from Black Ops 2, among others. Additionally, this mod transforms Hytale into a genuine first-person shooter, allowing players to engage in intense deathmatches with bullets flying from every direction. It also tracks kills and deaths, making the experience as close to a traditional first-person shooter as possible.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is a <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/cod-like-zombies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">COD-like Zombies</a> mod that will add “a simple, configurable Zombies’ waves game mode.” The mod will feature round-based waves, automatic round progression, intermission delay &amp; chat announcements, configurable spawn points, proximity-based zombie spawning, and multiple zombie variants.
