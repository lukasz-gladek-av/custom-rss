<p>The superhero narrative game Dispatch has already sold over a million copies in just ten days. Bolstered by a big cast and impressive production team, the game is already one of 2025’s biggest games.</p>



<p>Released in late October with episodes 1 and 2, Dispatch follows a former superhero working a desk job and dispatching former villains to do good in Los Angeles. AdHoc Studios, composed of former Telltale Games members, keeps the spirit of its pedigree alive with a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-type dialogue choices and consequences. The game became <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1981416301709934652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the best-selling title</a> on Steam last week, though it was unknown just how much it sold. Now, we have an official number and it’s quite impressive.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1985470807804453077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet from AdHoc Studios</a>, the team reveals that Dispatch has sold one million copies in ten days. With only four episodes out, the game technically isn’t fully out yet. Therefore, it’s a pretty impressive feat to sell as much, especially since the studio is new. </p>



<p>It isn’t too surprising to see Dispatch get as popular as it is. With a cast led by Breaking Bad’s Aaron Paul and Telltale’s narrative sense, it struck a lot of notes for fans. Plus, even with four episodes, it’s already a hit with critics and fans. We at Insider Gaming reviewed the title’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-episodes-1-2-spoiler-free-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first two episodes</a> and loved our time with it. With how things have been shaping up for Dispatch, we could see a surprise newcomer to the Game of the Year discussions right at the tail end of 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think of Dispatch’s sales so far? Have you played it yet? If so, what do you think? Where does it rank for you for 2025?
