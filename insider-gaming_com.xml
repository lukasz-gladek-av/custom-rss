<p>Get ready to see what’s lined up for the next season of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/elder-scrolls-online/" id="354">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>. The team announced that the 2026 Season Direct presentation will be held on March 31 at 3:00 p.m. ET on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda-2/" id="3469">Bethesda</a>‘s Twitch channel.</p>



<p>The presentation will lay out the year ahead, providing a roadmap of content for 2026 in The Elder Scrolls Online.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-history-of-the-elder-scrolls-online">History of The Elder Scrolls Online</h2>



<p>The Elder Scrolls Online has been active for over 12 years, first launching on PC in April 2014. It launched on current-generation consoles in 2021. In 2025, the developers discussed enabling cross-play across multiple platforms, noting they were working on technical changes to make it possible. After full comments here.</p>



<p>The game has actually been in development since 2007, nearly 20 years ago. As fans of the franchise continue to await Elder Scrolls 6, TES Online provides a steady experience. Speaking of the sixth Elder Scrolls game, don’t expect it anytime soon. However, we do know the game will be powered by Creation Engine 3, as Todd Howard recently shared.</p>











<p>Even though The Elder Scrolls 6 is a long way away, at least one Elder Scrolls game is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 very soon. </p>



<p>During a Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase earlier in the month, Bethesda confirmed Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered for Nintendo Switch 2 as part of its growing third-party lineup. That game will be coming out in 2026. Learn more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-2026/" id="174499">here</a>.</p>
