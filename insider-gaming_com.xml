<p>Are the starters in Pokémon Legends: Z-A shiny-locked? For those looking to fill out their shiny dex in the new entry, getting a quick start on your first companion would be a nice boon.</p>



<p>The jingle and animation that made its debut in Pokémon Legends: Arceus have returned to help players know for sure when a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-shiny-charm-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shiny Pokémon</a> has appeared, but what about getting the shiny forms of Tepig, Totodile, and Chikorita?</p>



<p>Here is your answer to whether or not starters are shiny-locked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately, no, your starter Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Z-A can not be shiny. All three of the options to start the game are indeed shiny-locked.</strong></p>



<p>However, just because your initial Pokémon selection will not be able to be shiny, that doesn’t mean you’ll never have a chance to get those creatures in a shiny form. Much like in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, there will be opportunities to catch more Tepig, Totodile, and Chickorita out in the wild.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because the usual breeding mechanic you would see in the main games isn’t in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pre-order-bonus-redeem-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, your only option for getting shiny starters is by catching them in the wild or by having a friend trade you their shiny that they caught in the wild, but good luck having that good of a friend.</p>



<p>In many ways, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-character-customization-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is a continuation of the features in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and not connected to the mainline games.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-legendaries-mythics-and-gift-pokemon-shiny-locked-in-pokemon-legends-z-a">Are Legendaries, Mythics, and Gift Pokémon Shiny-Locked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A?</h2>



<p><strong>Like the starters, legendary, mythic, and gift Pokémon are also shiny-locked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</strong></p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22967325315&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAC1RXL2gbv06knnCyBaLlfQOyzPWM&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjL3HBhCgARIsAPUg7a6-J2Pf2xDLAF_SdagMvszXCw9WFdvgiF7BL1yhoYFq_PYwHG7xvWQaAh7sEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, there are several special Pokémon that are encountered through the story and special requests. The legendaries of Pokémon X and Y in Xerneas, Yveltal, Zygarde, and Mewtwo are all shiny-locked, as are the mythicals Diancie, Hoopa, and Volcanion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokémon that you receive as a gift, which include the original Kalos region starters Chespin, Fennekin, and Froakie, will also never be shiny when received through the gifting method, but these Pokémon can also be found in the wild later in the game, similar to the current starters.</p>



<p>Completing the shiny dex in Pokémon Legends: Z-A requires many of the same methods that Arceus had before. The lack of breeding and the various shiny-locked situations will limit your chances somewhat, but you already know going in that shiny hunting is something that is going to take a lot of time regardless.</p>
