<p>Small Indie Company has revealed that We The People will be playable during Steam’s Zombie Fest event, which starts on May 26 and runs to June 2. We The People is a tactical first-person shooter that has been in development for a few years at Small Indie Company. It’s inspired by games like Escape from Tarkov, Fallout, and Rainbow Six, and at first blush, it looks great.</p>



<p>I was fortunate enough to put the team at Small Indie Company to a few questions back in 2023. What I learned about We The People excited me, and in the latest devlog, the squad revealed the innovations and enhancements applied to the developing title over the last few months.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-evolving">Evolving</h2>



<p>We The People will launch on Steam in early access <strong>when it’s ready</strong>. There’s no date for the game to hit the market just yet, but a playable demo will surface on May 26, giving gamers a limited window in which to test out the latest upgrades.</p>



<p>In a devlog posted on March 1, which was the first posted since April 2024, the team revealed what it had been working on for almost a year.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Our Biggest Update Yet | Devlog #5 | We The People" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bw9Gn3k3Sf8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The key upgrades to We The People are centered around immersive in-game elements like recoil, weapon malfunctions, and suppression mechanics. The team has also fine-tuned throwables and the inventory menu, as well as optimised environments and tweaked movement mechanics.</p>



<p>This is all based on feedback secured during the last playtest.</p>



<p>We The People is set in a post-apocalyptic rendition of the United States, and that wasteland, you’re ‘one of the few left amongst the living dead’. I learned how all this would work when I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/we-the-people-game-interview/">caught up with Small Indie Company in 2023</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>In many ways, we acknowledge we’re standing on the shoulders of giants like EFT and DayZ, and want to pay homage to them, show a level of irreverence for the work they’ve done and continue moving the extraction genre forward in a meaningful way.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re looking at We The People as a love letter to the genre, something that people will get to watch grow over time.</em>&nbsp;<em>We know what we want to provide in terms of a&nbsp; minimum viable product leading to our Early Access launch on Steam, as well as long-term plans for the game’s evolution over time</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Back then, I learned that the plan is to host in-game auction houses that operate on a peer-to-peer level, as well as vendors, dedicated questlines, and progression systems. There are desires to build out a safe zone which acts as a ‘hub’ central to the extraction shooter formula.</p>



<p>We The People <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2261560/We_The_People/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can be wishlisted on Steam</a> ahead of the next playable demo going live.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Twisted Metal Reboot Would Have Been a Third-Person Battle Royale, Images Reveal]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twisted-metal-cancelled-battle-royale/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twisted-metal-reboot-would-have-been-a-third-person-battle-royale-images-reveal.1123098/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/twisted-metal-cancelled-battle-royale/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In February 2024, we reported on the cancellation of a new Twisted Metal game. The project was scrapped just a couple of months before the debut of the Twisted Metal live-action adaptation. The news came hand-in-hand with the revelation that a whopping 900 employees would be laid off, almost wiping out the studio making the game. </p>



<p>Not much was known or revealed about Twisted Metal when it was cancelled. It was confirmed that it had been in development ‘for some time’, but that’s as far as we got. Now, thanks to a former developer from Firesprite, the studio that was working on Twisted Metal, we know much more about the ill-fated title.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-battle-royale-of-course">Battle Royale, Of Course</h2>



<p>On the portfolio site of a former UI lead who worked at Firesprite between 2022 and 2023, a few blurred images of the Twisted Metal title, along with a bit of context, were discovered.</p>



<p>Here’s what the UI programmer, Hugo Silva, <a href="https://www.hugoflsilva.com/project/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote about Twisted Metal</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Project Copper was a 3rd person vehicular action combat game, it was based on a classic IP owned by PlayStation developed by Firesprite (PlayStation Studios) it had 3rd person shooter mechanics wrapped with 3rd person vehicle combat with the objective of being the last one standing.</p>



<p>I joined the team as the Lead UI Programmer and had to create the base UI system to be within the company moving forward, after establishing the system I had to start working on the bespoke needs of the project while managing the UI code team and being the bridge with the UX and UI art teams.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The images are branded with the blocker ‘UNDER NDA’, but it’s not exactly difficult to work out what game he’s referring to based on the information provided.</p>



<p>Sadly, the screenshots reveal something that could be stripped clean out of Fortnite, which is hardly impressive. The third-person perspective fused with vehicular combat and boots-on-the-ground fighting mechanics is hardly a fresh concept, and it might not have moved mountains were it ever released to the wider market.</p>



<p>Do you think a Twisted Metal battle royale would have done well? Let us know in the comments what you think.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/activision-verdansk-collection-stores/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-teases-%E2%80%98verdansk-collection%E2%80%99-that%E2%80%99s-set-to-drop-on-march-10.1123095/</guid>

<p>If you head to the Call of Duty merch store, you’ll be met with a pop-up promoting the ‘Verdansk Collection’, which comes with the tagline ‘drop back in’. There’s also a countdown set to expire on March 10, which has many thinking that the return of Verdansk will be formally announced on that day.</p>



<p>It has long been rumoured that Verdansk will make a grand return on March 20, five years after it first appeared when Call of Duty: Warzone debuted worldwide. It was Insider Gaming that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-map-verdansk-return-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusively revealed the plans</a> to bring back Verdansk, the iconic first map in the insanely popular battle royale game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-coming">It’s Coming</h2>



<p>The prompt on the <a href="http://shop.callofduty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty shop</a> bears an iconic throwback to Verdnask – an image of the damn and the crashed plane in the wastelands beneath. It’s a snowy vista that we’ve all seen time and again, and on March 10, the full ‘Verdansk Collection’ will be revealed, whatever it may contain.</p>



<p>Fans have been chomping at the bit to get back to Verdansk since it was removed from the game in 2021. I’ve maintained that we don’t miss Verdansk, but the vibes we experienced playing it with our friends for the first time. The world was a different place back then, struggling under the weight of COVID-19, and Warzone made for a flawless escape from all that.</p>



<p>However, it’s not all sunshine and lollipops, as some prolific creators have stressed that even Verdansk isn’t enough to bring them back, given the state of the game. It’s no big secret that Warzone still has issues with performance, network stability, and cheaters.</p>



<p>Let’s hope all that is resolved (big hope) by March 10 – and even more so by March 20.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[It Looks Like Daily Rewards Are Coming Back to Call of Duty]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/daily-rewards-coming-back-to-call-of-duty/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-looks-like-daily-rewards-are-coming-back-to-call-of-duty.1123023/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/daily-rewards-coming-back-to-call-of-duty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a post published on social media by a Call of Duty dataminer, it was suggested that a daily rewards system could be coming to Black Ops 6 when season three drops in March. The season is expected to bring back Verdansk in Warzone for the first time since 2021, so it makes sense that teams are anticipating ways to retain players to make the comeback much more worthwhile.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-day-new-rewards">Every Day, New Rewards</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 doesn’t feature a daily login bonus system – even the free rewards periodically unlocked in the store have been paltry. Most players report getting endless strings of Double XP tokens and nothing else, whereas in previous games, players could get charms, sprays, calling cards, and emblems, all for free.</p>



<p>According to a recent <a href="https://x.com/realityuk_/status/1895867334948241728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post from realityuk_</a> on Twitter, that might be set to change.</p>



<p>While the dataminer has uncovered nothing more than a menu and a prompt, it’s enough to assume that daily rewards are coming back when season three hits later this month.</p>



<p>In one image, Reality found a ‘Daily Login Reward’ pop-up that read:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To earn all rewards, log in on 7 seperate days before unclaimed rewards expire.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This hasn’t been addressed or even alluded to by the teams working on Black Ops 6, and as it’s a datamined asset, it’s worth taking the imagery with a pinch of salt. These things are always subject to change, unfortunately.</p>



<p>It’s nice if it’s true, though. Despite the state of Warzone right now, the return of Verdansk is guaranteed to bring players flooding back, and nothing makes players happy like free items.</p>



<p>It was suggested recently by a Call of Duty leaker that Verdansk is returning to Warzone as ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-to-warzone-og-march-2020-version/">pretty much the OG version</a>‘ that was released in 2020. That was when Warzone was created, becoming one of the most popular battle royale games in history as tens of millions of players flocked to the title.</p>



<p>Will you be taking advantage of free daily rewards if they come to Black Ops 6? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-replicas/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/raven-forge-and-ubisoft-announce-full-scale-replica%E2%80%99s-of-yasuke%E2%80%99s-wakizashi-naoe%E2%80%99s-tant%C5%8D.1122885/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-replicas/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Raven Forge have announced two brand-new full-scale replica swords from Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Both Yasuke’s Wakizashi &amp; Naoe’s Tantō&nbsp;from Assassin’s Creed Shadows are <a href="https://ravenforge.com/collections/the-raven-forge-legend-collection-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available now for pre-order</a>, with Naoe’s Tantō&nbsp;costing £139.99 and Yasuke’s Wakizashi costing £199.99. </p>



<p>This isn’t the first full-scale replica from Raven Forge on Assassin’s Creed either, as late late year the company announced&nbsp;a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-scale-replica-of-assassins-creeds-altairs-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-scale replica of Assassins Creed’s Altaïr’s Sword</a> from the original game.</p>



<h2 id="h-yasuke-s-wakizashi">Yasuke’s Wakizashi&nbsp;</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The wakizashi, a revered sidearm of the samurai, was traditionally worn alongside a katana—a symbol of status, duty, and skill. This exceptional replica features an intricately wrapped faux rayskin handle and saya (scabbard), custom menuki (handle ornaments), and a tsuba inspired by the crest of the Oda clan. Every detail has been thoughtfully recreated to bring Yasuke’s weapon to life.</p>



<p><strong>Production dimensions:</strong></p>



<div><p>Full Length: 670mm<br>Blade Length: 500mm<br>Grip Length: 170mm<br>Blade Width (base): 30mm<br>Tang: Full<br>Weight: 776g<br>Materials: 3CR13 – Tempered steel<br>Edge: Blunt – Prop replica</p><p><strong>Pre-order ship date: Early August</strong></p></div>



<h2 id="h-naoe-s-tanto">Naoe’s Tantō</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>A weapon of both practicality and prestige, the tantō served as a trusted sidearm of the samurai and was also wielded with remarkable skill by the Onna-musha, the warrior women of feudal Japan. This faithful reproduction features a beautifully wrapped faux rayskin handle, ornate menuki (handle embellishments), and a strikingly detailed saya (scabbard).</p>



<p><strong>Production dimensions:</strong></p>



<div><p>Full Length: 430mm<br>Blade Length: 295mm<br>Grip Length: 128mm<br>Blade Width (base): 26mm<br>Tang: Full<br>Weight: 425g<br>Materials: 3CR13 – Tempered steel&nbsp;<br>Edge: Blunt – Prop replica</p><p><strong><strong>Pre-order ship date: Early August</strong></strong></p></div>



<p>You can <a href="https://ravenforge.com/collections/the-raven-forge-legend-collection-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pre-order both swords at Raven Forge here</a>.</p>
