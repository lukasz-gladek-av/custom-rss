<p>A new list of games leaving PlayStation Plus in November has been revealed, and Battlefield 5 is one of them. </p>



<p>Like all other subscription services, PlayStation Plus is known for introducing a new collection of games to the library each month, with titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-game-catalog-new-games-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn, Silent Hill 2, Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-october-2025-alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>, and more being added in October. However, some games are removed from the library whenever new games are added, and PS Plus will lose out on seven games in November. </p>



<h2 id="h-7-games-are-leaving-playstation-plus-in-november">7 Games Are Leaving PlayStation Plus in November</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/these-7plus-games-will-be-axed-from-ps-plus-extra-in-november-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PushSquare</a>, the PlayStation Store’s ‘Last chance to play’ section has been updated with seven new games that will be leaving PlayStation Plus in November. The highlights of this collection are the previously mentioned Battlefield 5 and Like a Dragon: Ishin. The exact removal date hasn’t been revealed, but these games are expected to be available until November 18. Check out the complete list of games leaving PS Plus in November 2025 below: </p>



<ul>
<li>Battlefield 5 (PS4)</li>



<li>Like a Dragon: Ishin (PS4/PS5)</li>



<li>Digimon Survive (PS4)</li>



<li>Football Manager 2024 Console (PS5)</li>



<li>Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes (PS4)</li>



<li>Alternate Jake Hunter: Daedalys The Awakening of Golden Jazz (PS4)</li>



<li>Synapse (PSVR2)</li>
</ul>



<p>It seems that the release of Battlefield 6 has led to the removal of other Battlefield games from PS Plus. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-1-and-3-other-games-are-leaving-playstation-plus-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 1 </a>was removed this month, and BF5 will be removed next month. Similarly, the addition of Yakuza: Like a Dragon will be followed by removing Like a Dragon: Ishin next month. </p>



<p>In other news, Sony has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-injunction-to-bar-tencent-from-using-any-resemblance-to-horizons-aloy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a preliminary injunction</a> to bar Tencent from using any resemblance to Horizon’s Aloy. Will you play any of the seven games before they leave PlayStation Plus in November?

<p>Palworld developers have confirmed that a new Halloween update will arrive on October 23, 2025; however, details of this update are scarce. </p>



<p>Pocketpair has a lot of content planned for Palworld fans in the coming days. A collaboration with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworlds-next-crossover-is-with-ultrakill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultrakill</a> was announced last month, and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-coming-to-once-human-in-crossover-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Once Human</a> update is set to arrive on October 30. Ahead of that, players can celebrate with some spooky fun through Palworld’s Halloween update, which arrives this week. </p>



<h2 id="h-palworld-s-halloween-2025-update-looks-like-it-s-more-than-just-cosmetics">Palworld’s Halloween 2025 Update Looks Like It’s More Than Just Cosmetics</h2>



<p>A post on Palworld’s official <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1980439049853710677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account confirms the Halloween 2025 update. The description of the upcoming update mentions Zoe being spotted “in a rather unusual new outfit,” but that isn’t the only strange thing. It seems some mysterious figures are roaming the Palpagos Islands, dressed in Depresso costumes. More details about this update will be revealed soon. </p>

<p>It seems that Palworld is taking it up a notch from their Halloween update in 2024. Last year’s update provided players with free cosmetics for their pals, including Halloween Cattiva, Spectacled Katress, Pirate Pengullet, and Halloween Croajiro. It looks like the developers are upping their game in 2025, adding some spooky elements to the game’s world to match the festivals’ vibe. Moreover, this comes after the developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-1-0-release-window-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that “things are going to be a little quiet from us for the rest of the year”, as they work on the 1.0 update. </p>



<p>In other news, a former Capcom designer recently stated that Palworld “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-crossed-a-line-says-former-capcom-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossed a line</a>” and players shouldn’t buy the game. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-is-so-wrong-it-hurts-about-mods-not-counting-as-prior-art-says-patent-expert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a patent expert recently commented</a> on the Nintendo v Palworld lawsuit.

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy director has mentioned the possibility of a DLC or another ‘full title’ after part 3.</p>



<p>There’s still some time left before Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s Part 3 is revealed; however, we do know that development has been progressing well, with the game already having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-has-a-lot-of-playable-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘a lot’ of playable content</a>. Interestingly, the developers are already thinking about their plans after the release of part 3, which could entail a new expansion or a fourth game. </p>



<h2 id="h-there-s-a-possibility-of-a-fourth-game-for-the-final-fantasy-7-remake-series">There’s a Possibility of a Fourth Game for the Final Fantasy 7 Remake Series</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WccfTech</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi was asked whether they had any DLC plans for Rebirth. Hamaguchi stated that there were ideas at some point, but they “revisited this topic” and realised that their priority should be what fans want the most. The dev figured that “what fans want the most is to bring the third installment as soon as possible.” Which meant that the next game took priority over DLC. </p>



<p>However, Hamaguchi revealed that the story doesn’t end there, as “there is the possibility of having a DLC for that third installment” after its launch. Moreover, with that being the conclusion to Final Fantasy 7 Remake Trilogy, “there’s probably going to be a much wider audience for Final Fantasy as a whole”, says the director. Which is why the developers are “actively considering” whether to introduce “another DLC or a full title”. </p>



<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 9 Remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-might-be-on-ice-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be ‘on ice’</a>, according to a new claim.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts has announced that The Sims Mobile will be shut down after more than seven years of operations and updates. The all-mobile product will be closed down from Janaury 20, 2026, and as it’s an online title, it’ll no longer be accessible to any users.</p>



<p>The team revealed a stack of limited-time events coming in the next few weeks to usher in the closure of the game, but today, October 21, The Sims Mobile will be delisted from app stores.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-sims-mobile-is-the-latest-ea-game-to-go">The Sims Mobile is the Latest EA Game to Go</h2>



<p>Electronic Arts has busied itself closing down servers and shutting down games across a range of genres in the last couple of years. The Sims Mobile is the latest title to be hit by that action.</p>



<p>In March 2018, The Sims Mobile was released by Electronic Arts, and by September, it had pulled in almost 50 million users and racked up more than $20 million in revenue.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent blog post</a>, the team at Electronic Arts confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>(On October 20) the final update for The Sims Mobile will be available to download from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. From this date forward, players will no longer be able to purchase packs or spend real money within TSM. Any existing SimCash, Simoleons, or Tickets can still be used until January 20, 2026.</p>



<p>In the final update, releasing on October 20th, 2025, everyone will receive unlimited energy to help them make the most of this time. This should make it easier to complete projects and enjoy the last few months of play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s now a list of special events that will unravel leading up to when the game is taken offline:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Start Time</th><th>End Time</th></tr><tr><td>Eerie Autumn</td><td>Festival Pass</td><td>Oct 20</td><td>Dec 19</td></tr><tr><td>Cozier Home</td><td>Sweet Treat Showdown</td><td>Oct 20</td><td>Nov 2</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #1</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Oct 27</td><td>Nov 3</td></tr><tr><td>Hallways Ready</td><td>Treasure Hunt</td><td>Nov 3</td><td>Nov 16</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #2</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Nov 10</td><td>Nov 17</td></tr><tr><td>Foxbury Institute</td><td>Sweet Treat Showdown</td><td>Nov 17</td><td>Nov 30</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #3</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Nov 24</td><td>Dec 1</td></tr><tr><td>Season’s Greetings</td><td>Treasure Hunt</td><td>Dec 1</td><td>Dec 14</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #4</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Dec 8</td><td>Dec 15</td></tr><tr><td>Sweet Holiday</td><td>Sweet Treat Showdown</td><td>Dec 15</td><td>Dec 28</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #5</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Dec 22</td><td>Dec 29</td></tr><tr><td>New Year’s Dock and Roll</td><td>Treasure Hunt</td><td>Dec 29</td><td>Jan 10</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #6</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Jan 1</td><td>Jan 8</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #7</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Jan 10</td><td>Jan 17</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>In the FAQs section on the above blog post, it was noted that any remaining in-game currencies, purchased or otherwise, will not be made refundable. If you’ve invested any money in The Sims Mobile and have a wallet with any cash in it, now’s the time to spend it.</p>
