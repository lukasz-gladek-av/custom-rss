<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>

<li>Work</li>



<li>Nature</li>



<li>Game</li>



<li>Concept</li>



<li>Idea</li>



<li>Food</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wolfenstein/" id="2953">Wolfenstein 3 </a>could finally be in the works.</p>



<p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-wolfenstein-3-first-story-details-unveiled-as-casting-begins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to a report from MP1st,</a> a casting call has been uncovered tied to the project. This appears to be our first look at the plot details. The project is codenamed “Valkyrie,” and it is attached to two people who previously worked on several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/machinegames/" id="87686">MachineGames </a>titles: performance director Tom Keegan and casting director Emily Schweber. Keegan directed performances for the cast of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-2/" id="97055">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-apparent-wolfenstein-3-plot-details-and-production-schedule">Apparent Wolfenstein 3 Plot Details and Production Schedule</h2>



<p>Reportedly, the story centers around a character named Sofiya. She’s described as a Ukrainian orphan aged 8 to 11 who forms a bond with William Blazkowicz, the franchise’s main protagonist. The young character is also said to be traumatized by War, making her suspicious, but she’s ultimately labeled a strong survivor. </p>



<p>The casting call also notes that performance capture is scheduled to begin in April, with shooting dates planned for later in 2026 and extending into the next year.</p>



<p>MachineGames had previously stated that they always intended to continue the franchise. Jerk Gustafsson, studio director, said earlier this month that while he wouldn’t comment on a timeline for the third game’s release, they were never finished with the franchise. Read his full comments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/machinegames-still-plans-to-finish-the-wolfenstein-trilogy/">here</a>.</p>







<p>There’s still no exact confirmation from the studio, but we may be inching closer to finishing the Wolfenstein Trilogy. Insider Gaming will continue to report on the franchise’s future as more information becomes available.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight/" id="164327">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> is slated for release later this year, and it’s already promising to honor the multiple eras of everyone’s favorite billionaire playboy-turned-vigilante.</p>



<p>That same attention to honoring the bat’s legacy will also be evident in the gameplay of the upcoming title. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tt-games/" id="462">TT Games</a> isn’t afraid to say they’re influenced by Rocksteady’s iconic Batman: Arkham series, but they still want to make sure the story focuses on core characters that let the gameplay shine, while also offering the kind of quirky experience only LEGO can provide.</p>







<h2 id="h-lego-batman-promises-collectibles-honoring-the-bat-s-decades-long-legacy">LEGO Batman Promises Collectibles Honoring the Bat’s Decades-Long Legacy</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-are-not-leaving-anything-behind-how-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-is-balancing-old-and-new-ign-fan-fest-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking to IGN at IGN Fan Fest 2026,</a> Jonathan Smith, Head of Development at TT Games, elaborated on the team’s approach to the game’s story, which centers on core characters and promises multiple collectibles, allowing everyone to enjoy a Bat Cave full of memorabilia.</p>



<p>“We then want to give you lots and lots of options to see the full range of what those characters can be by giving you more than a hundred different suits to collect,” he said. “So you still get that moment in the Bat Cave where you’ve got all the different suits from all the different characters arrayed in front of you, colorful and glorious. You’re still compelled to want to complete that collection.”</p>







<h2 id="h-lego-batman-will-be-a-game-for-all-bat-fans">LEGO Batman Will Be A Game for All Bat Fans</h2>



<p>Furthermore, Smith explains why he’s not worried about a game like this alienating traditional fans looking for something more akin to the Arkham series, believing that the LEGO games offer broad appeal across multiple generations of players.</p>



<p>“On the contrary, what we find with all our LEGO games is that the more we can draw upon different aspects of a character, the wider we can make our gameplay, the more appealing it is to us as players, and to younger players and older players,” he answers. “There’s something about Lego that just translates well for everybody. So the more we can put into that, we don’t find that it misses the mark for anyone at all. It just brings more to the party.”</p>
