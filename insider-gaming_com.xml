<p>Peak has received its first major content update today, The Mesa, which adds a new biome, some new items, new badges and more mysteries. </p>



<p>Aggro Crabs and Landfall’s latest co-op climbing adventure, Peak, has been going strong on Steam ever since its launch, selling more than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-5-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 million copies</a> within its first month. The developers have been <span>working diligently on the updates, too, and have recently </span>added the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-adds-cannibalism-in-its-latest-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cannibalism</a>&nbsp;feature. However, the latest update has a lot more to unravel. </p>



<h2 id="h-peak-s-the-mesa-update-is-live-now">Peak’s ‘The Mesa’ Update is Live Now</h2>



<h4 id="h-new-peak-content">New Peak Content</h4>



<p>Peak’s latest <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1954936000045805590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update</a> adds a new biome called The Mesa. The Mesa will be replacing Alpine and will be present in every run next week. Post that, maps will rotate randomly between The Mesa and Alpine. As this is a new land to explore, there are 10 new badges to collect, with some providing players with fresh cosmetics as rewards. </p>



<p>As players are now visiting a “sandy terrain under the blistering sun” with Peak’s The Mesa update, they will need new items to keep them safe in the undiscovered environment. These items include Balloons, Scout Cannon, Parasol, Sunscreen, Aloe Vera and Dynamite. Players will also find a surprise waiting for them at The Kiln. Moreover, a tornado was also mentioned in the new trailer. </p>

<h4 id="h-new-options-and-balancing-changes">New Options and Balancing Changes</h4>



<p>The update also adds a new ‘Bug Phobia Mode’ which is designed for players that don’t do well with “arachnids and other creepy crawlies” as there will be plenty of those in the Mesa. Players can now navigate through the Settings menu with the controller. The fog will now rise slightly slower in the Tropics. The heat status now decays faster, but takes a bit longer to start. Also, hot rocks in the Caldera inflict more heat on the players. </p>

<h4 id="h-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>



<ul>
<li>Improved performance across the board on the mountain.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where players could teleport after a rusty piton they were hanging onto breaks.</li>



<li>Fixed players sometimes obtaining the Naturalist Badge despite eating packaged food.</li>



<li>Prevented players from interacting with their backpack while passed out.</li>



<li>Adjusted luggage collision to prevent players from getting their legs stuck in it</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the Bugle of Friendship would still play its audio and visual effects when out of juice.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where biome-specific loot could sometimes show up in luggage in the wrong biome.</li>
</ul>



<p>Regarding future updates, the developers have stated that they “aren’t quite sure yet” and don’t want to promise something they can’t deliver. They will update the community as soon as they have something new going on, but for now, it will only be bug fixes and stability patches for Peak. </p>



<p>In other news, Peak developers would rather <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-publishers-prefer-piracy-to-roblox-slop-ripoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players pirate their game</a> than play a Roblox rip-off. What are your thoughts on Peak’s The Mesa update? </p>

<p>The principal game designer at DICE is asking players to share video examples of unexpectedly fast time-to-death (TTD) during the Battlefield 6 open beta. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s first open beta was a resounding success, becoming the franchise’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-biggest-ever-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest open beta</a> yet and also beating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty’s concurrent record</a> on Steam. However, players encountered several bugs during the weekend, but nothing that couldn’t be fixed. The developers have already begun investigating BF6’s unexpectedly fast TTD bug. </p>







<p>Battlefield 6’s open beta is now over, and the developers have started addressing the bugs players encountered over the weekend. Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/as-the-dust-settles-on-battlefield-6s-first-beta-weekend-devs-confirm-theyre-looking-into-unexpectedly-fast-kill-times-in-the-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Florian Le Bihan posted on <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954811982399381685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) earlier today, informing players that the developers are already in the office reviewing BF6’s open beta feedback. Soon after, Le Bihan posts <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954828663825817791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">again</a>, asking players to share video examples of suspected super bullet / unexpectedly fast TTD” they might have experienced during the Battlefield 6 Open Beta. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If some of you have some video examples of suspected super bullet / unexpectedly fast TTD that you've recorded in the Battlefield 6 Open Beta – send my way 🙂</p>— Florian – DRUNKKZ3 (@DRUNKKZ3) <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954828663825817791?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Many players shared video examples, and others shared their experiences in reply. One player <a href="https://x.com/Mokonoise/status/1954848559708221684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> videos of two such instances: one where they were fighting under cover and were shot down instantly, and another where they took delayed damage after downing an enemy. For those unaware, TTD or time-to-death refers to the duration it takes for the player to die after taking damage. </p>
