<p>Post the copyright infringement lawsuit from Sony, Tencent and Polaris Quest has made several changes to the alleged Horizon copy’s Steam page. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Tencent revealed Light of Motiram last year, which bears a striking resemblance to Sony PlayStation’s popular series, Horizon. Last month, Sony Interactive Entertainment filed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-lawsuit-against-tencent-for-allegedly-copying-the-horizon-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawsuit</a> against Tencent for alleged copyright and trademark infringement, citing similarities between their products. </p>



<h2 id="h-horizon-clone-s-steam-page-gets-new-description-key-art-and-more">Horizon Clone’s Steam Page Gets New Description, Key Art and More</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/after-sony-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-dev-store-page/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamePost</a>, Light of Motiram’s Steam page now features a revised description, a new promotional image, different and reduced screenshots, and a release window. </p>



<h4 id="h-new-description">New Description</h4>



<p>The old description spoke about several elements that were known in the Horizon universe, including “colossal machines” and “mechanimals”. The new description has removed these words and mentions of an advanced technology. Now, it mentions “overcoming the challenges of survival” and carving a place for yourself in this “unforgiving land”. </p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Old:</strong> “In a world overrun by colossal machines, explore the vast open world, build your base of operations, advance technology, train Mechanimals, and take on formidable bosses. Starting from the primitive age, forge a new path of development. Defy the machination, survive with mechanimals.“</p>



<p><strong>New:</strong> “Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses, every step is fraught with danger and requires courage. Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land.“</p>
</blockquote>



<h4 id="h-key-art-changed">Key Art Changed</h4>



<p>The previous key art for the Light of Moitram featured a woman who resembled someone that players would know very well from the Horizon series, Aloy. The red-haired girl was seen looking over a world filled with creatures similar to those in the popular PlayStation series. Now, the woman has been replaced by two robotic creatures, one that looks like a penguin and the other like a dog. </p>



<h4 id="h-new-gameplay-screenshots">New Gameplay Screenshots</h4>



<p>Many of the screenshots that made Light of Motiram appear more like a Horizon clone have been removed. Some new screenshots have been added, which feature the game’s open world instead. All imagery of the robots that looked similar to the ones in PlayStation’s Horizon series was removed. </p>

<h4 id="h-release-window-added">Release Window Added</h4>



<p>Light of Motiram now has a release window, the Steam page states that the game is now scheduled to release in Q4 2027. </p>



<p>In the lawsuit, Sony has alleged that Tencent has created a “slavish clone” of Horizon with Light of Motiram, which copies elements such as gameplay, story themes, and artistic elements, among others. Sony also stated that Tencent had approached them to collaborate on a new Horizon game. </p>



<p>In other news, PlayStation’s Horizon franchise <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstations-horizon-franchise-has-sold-38-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 38 million copies</a>. What are your thoughts on the changes Tencent made to Light of Motiram?

<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick “loves” Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford despite some of his recent comments.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Zelnick was asked about Pitchford’s recent comments, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/randy-pitchford-real-fans-would-pay-80-for-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as telling a fan</a> that if they were a “real fan” of Borderlands, they would spend $80 on Borderlands 4 if that was the price.</p>



<p>For Zelnick, that’s just part of Pitchford’s “big personality”</p>



<p><strong>“I love Randy, first of all. Let me just say that on the record,”</strong> Zelnick <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-strauss-zelnick-says-borderlands-chief-randy-pitchford-can-be-controversial-at-times-sometimes-intentionally-sometimes-unintentionally-but-i-still-love-him-to-death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told IGN</a>. <strong>“And I love his big personality. I love his passion and he is one of the all time great game makers. He also can be controversial at times — sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally. I still love him to death.”</strong></p>



<p>For his part, Pitchford addressed the “real fans” comment saying he didn’t mean any harm with his words while acknowledging players being frustrated with price increases.</p>



<p>Circling back to Borderlands 4 itself, the first mainline game in the series since 2019’s Borderlands 3, the base edition price ultimately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-price-has-been-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remained the standard $70</a> that has been common for years. The game is scheduled to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-move-forward-after-randy-pitchford-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release on September 12</a> for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 version</a> will launch just weeks later on October 3.</p>
