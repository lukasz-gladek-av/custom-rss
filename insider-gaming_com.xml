<p>PlayStation is set to release black variants of three premium accessories: the DualSense Edge, the Pulse Elite, and the Pulse Explore, according to reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ces-accessoires-ps5-sortiront-bientot-dans-un-tout-nouveau-coloris-59696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>.</p>



<p>At the moment, these accessories are only available in standard white, with the exception of the DualSense Edge, which has received a 30th anniversary version.</p>



<p>As well as revealing that Sony is working on these new variants, billbil-kun went further, revealing the price of each of the products:</p>



<ul>
<li>DualSense Edge wireless controller – Black: €239.99 / £209.99 / US$199.99.</li>



<li>Pulse Elite wireless headphones – Black: €149.99 / £129.99 / US$149.99.</li>



<li>Pulse Explore wireless headphones – Black: €219.99 / £199.99  / US$199.99.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-when-the-announcement-may-happen">When the announcement may happen?</h2>



<p>PlayStation’s 30th anniversary will be on December 3rd, so there’s no better time to announce these new versions.</p>



<p>If they follow the pattern, the announcement should be made on the PS Blog followed by posts on social media.</p>



<p>Of course, fans aren’t waiting for an announcement of new accessory colors. The community has long been demanding an event with the next PS5 exclusives. With The Game Awards approaching, maybe PlayStation will surprise everyone there.</p>

<p>While the full release of Path of Exile 2 will feature a total of 12 playable classes with 36 Ascendancies to choose from, the Early Access launch on December 6 will not. It will include access to six playable classes—a mere handful of the potential. By the time we’re done with EA, we’ll all have mastered these six classes. Here’s what you can play as!</p>



<h2 id="h-six-path-of-exile-2-early-access-classes">Six Path of Exile 2 Early Access Classes</h2>



<p>On Early Access launch, we’ll receive a nice variety of classes, from your Strength-based Warrior to the Intelligence-favoring Witch, along with the Monk and Mercenary, which should offer unique playstyles. But most players will likely opt for Ranger or Witch on their first playthrough. Both classes are staples of the franchise.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Warrior</strong>
<ul>
<li>Titan</li>



<li>Warbringer</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Sorceress</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stormweaver</li>



<li>Chronomancer</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Ranger</strong>
<ul>
<li>Deadeye</li>



<li>Pathfinder</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Monk</strong>
<ul>
<li>Invoker</li>



<li>Acolute of Chayula</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Mercenary</strong>
<ul>
<li>Witchhunter</li>



<li>Gemling Legionnaire</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Witch</strong>
<ul>
<li>Blood Mage</li>



<li>Infernalist</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>So, six classes, each with two Ascendancies to test out. You can easily spend a few hundred hours playing through the most basic class builds across each playable class. Then, you can turn around and mess about with your very own build, mixing and matching skills and passives to create a workable prototype before full release!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-class-to-play-first-in-path-of-exile-2">What Class to Play First in Path of Exile 2?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, let’s get this out of the way. Path of Exile 2 is a massive ARPG offering countless viable build and playstyle paths, with every class in the game capable of pushing end-game content. As such, you should choose to play whichever class speaks to you, whether you want a high-damage glass cannon or a tank worthy of defeating any of the optional bosses in the game.</p>



<p>But if you’d like a recommendation, then we suggest you play as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Witch</li>



<li>Mercenary</li>



<li>Ranger</li>
</ul>



<p>Witch is always a fan-favorite, Mercenary is new to the sequel and shows a lot of promise, and Ranger, while initially weak, winds up as a powerful and hard-hitting solo class that’s easy to manage from the jump.</p>



<p>Hop into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a> to tell us which class you intend to play! Maybe—just maybe—you’ll find someone to party up with for the game’s six-player co-op!</p>
