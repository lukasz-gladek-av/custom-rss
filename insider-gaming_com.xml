<p>It seems like PlayStation 5 players can look forward to Los Santos once more, as GTA 5 is reportedly coming back to PS Plus in November 2025. This is likely to offset any disappointment over the newest GTA 6 delay.</p>



<p>Rockstar Games is having an interesting time as of late. Take-Two delivered the news we were all dreading on November 6 by declaring that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6 was delayed to November 2026</a>. This led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-second-delay-stock-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two’s stock price dropping by 10%</a>, leaving the community in tatters. PlayStation is allegedly trying to appease the handful of people who haven’t played GTA yet by making GTA 5 a PS Plus game again.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-5-makes-its-triumphant-return-to-ps-plus">GTA 5 Makes Its Triumphant Return To PS Plus</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hi again, Trevor. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>We divert to the ever-reliable billbil-kun over at <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dealabs</a> for their exclusive GTA PS Plus story.</p>



<p>According to billbil-kun:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Based on our recent investigations, we can say that&nbsp;Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;will be one of the new titles that will be added to the PS Plus game catalog. Rockstar Games’ cult classic game is set to be available&nbsp;from November 18, 2025&nbsp;for all PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not the GTA you want to see on PlayStation Plus, we know that (we feel the pain, too), but it’s at least something to keep us ticking over for another agonizing, painful 12 months of waiting and twiddling our thumbs.</p>



<p>Just as a reminder, you must have one of PS Plus’s more expensive tiers to download and play GTA 5. The Essentials tier misses out, and this is vital information for potential GTA 5 players.</p>



<p>Like before, don’t expect Grand Theft Auto 5 to be on PS Plus forever either. This will be for a limited duration—presumably a few months—so make the most of a new playthrough or some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-now-included-with-gta-membership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online</a> shenanigans to kill time.</p>



<p>This is a fairly moot question at this point, but what do you make of the GTA 6 delay? Would you rather Rockstar release it when they are 100% sure it’s ready? Or debut it sooner, and release lots of patches soon after?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The gaming world is reeling from the announcement that Grand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed to November 2026, and the latest GTA 6 delay could have repercussions for a host of other releases.</p>



<p>Rockstar Games announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 would be delayed until November 19</a>, almost six months on from the previously stated May release, extending the long wait for the latest entry in the beloved series.</p>



<p>While gamers around the world are expressing concerns that this still might not be the final release date, developers across the globe will also have to deal with a major reshuffle in the calendar, and it could be Microsoft that is impacted the most.</p>



<h2 id="h-fall-2026-shaping-up-to-be-huge-with-gta-6-delay">Fall 2026 Shaping Up To Be Huge With GTA 6 Delay</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Repercussions. Image via Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://x.com/DMC_Ryan/status/1986543677095960746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN’s Ryan McCaffrey</a>, Microsoft has some major releases that are likely to drop in the Fall 2026 window, including Halo: Campaign Evolved, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brings the franchise to PlayStation</a>, Gears of War: E-Day, Fable, and the 2026 instalment of Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Though the Fall 2026 window is spread out and has several months to release titles, it’s also one of the busiest periods for gaming with a host of regular annual releases deploying in that period, including the likes of EA Sports’ Madden and EA FC.</p>



<p>Adding GTA 6 to the mix could cause problems, as no developer will want to go head-to-head with one of the biggest gaming releases of all time, as it would almost certainly impact sales.</p>



<p>These issues are not exclusive to Microsoft, however, as PlayStation, Nintendo, and developers across the world will also be tussling with the new calendar.</p>



<p>Marvel’s Wolverine, for example, is slated for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-gets-new-trailer-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch in late 2026</a>, while it’s widely expected that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-wind-waves-gen-10-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tenth generation of Pokémon</a> will debut in Q4 2026 as part of the 30th anniversary celebrations.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gaime-review-lightgun-system/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/g%E2%80%99aim%E2%80%99e-review%E2%80%94the-most-accessible-lightgun-system-in-20-years.1346638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>What if I told you that from opening up your G’AIM’E package, you could play an upgraded version of the original Time Crisis and have it set up and ready to go within five minutes? The lost art of lightgun gaming can now be accessed in less time than it takes to wade through a live-service game’s endless oppressive microtransaction screens.</p>



<p>Speaking of screens, did you know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gaime-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G’AIM’E</a> is playable on any modern-day TV (LCD, OLED, etc) up to 150″? You no longer have to squint to make out your nearest pixel on a tiny CRT setup. G’AIM’E is the latest name attempting to bridge the divide between a bygone era and the restoration of lightgun shootouts to the mainstream at an affordable price with much-needed ease of accessibility.</p>



<p>G’AIM’E gets a lot of this right, and I think it’s comfortably the most accessible lightgun system on the market. It does misfire slightly, but not much. Let me explain in our G’AIM’E review.</p>



<h2 id="h-g-aim-e-review">G’AIM’E Review</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Finding the balance is key. Credit to G’AIM’E</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tassei Denki has been producing video-game peripheral devices for years. So leaping to a contemporary lightgun product wasn’t beyond the realms of possibility. But how do you market and make an age-old medium relevant again? By celebrating the 30th anniversary of arguably the famous lightgun shooter ever—<strong>Time Crisis</strong>—and pushing it to the forefront of EVERYTHING.</p>



<p>Each G’AIM’E package is centered around Namco’s 1995 classic, with the logo emblazoned on the consoles, collectibles, and guns. The basic edition includes a custom G’AIM’E lightgun, a mini-console with a redone-from-the-ground-up flashier emulated version of Time Crisis installed, a power cable, a HDMI cable, and a setup guide.</p>



<p>The Premium version has all of this and adds three more games to the console (<strong>Point Blank, Steel Gunner, and Steel Gunner 2</strong>), a pedal, and a Time Crisis Pin badge. Whereas the super-duper Ultimate pack includes everything so far, and throws in a second gun for two-player gaming, an AC Adapter, and a Time Crisis Diorama Stand.</p>



<p>For the purposes of this Insider Gaming G’AIM’E review, <strong>I was fortunate enough to test out the Ultimate edition</strong>. The collectibles do sit lovely with my other memorabilia, but you’re here to know if it’s worth dropping a lot of money on plastic guns, pedals, and piranhas—Where are my Point Blank fans at!</p>



<h2 id="h-we-have-a-time-crisis-on-our-hands">We Have A Time Crisis On Our Hands</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One game spawned a money train. Credit to NAMCO</figcaption></figure>



<p>I removed everything from the box, undid all the packaging, hooked up the mini-console and guns, and I had eyes on Richard Miller within minutes. Calibration was ridiculously easy, and the provided setup instructions are more crystal clear than a Time Crisis “Danger” prompt.</p>



<p>My 65″ OLED TV required me to be at the maximum distance from the TV, and I followed those instructions. After countless hours across all four games, <strong>my experience was extremely enjoyable, but not perfect</strong>. I want to sit here and tell you everything was inch-perfect, every shot felt like it was where I was aiming, there wasn’t a hint of a delay in my bullets, and any mistakes were through human error (which many of them probably were, and I have a lot of improving to do).</p>



<p>As sophisticated as the AI tracker and camera are, I think there are going to be times when you can’t be as accurate as you’d like. Is it a dealbreaker? Not even close. As I said, it was fleeting moments. I was so impressed with the tracker’s ability to refocus under different circumstances. I pointed the gun well away from the screen, I adjusted my distance before returning to the original spot, and I even had someone walk in front of the gun. All mini-experiments to test the AI’s capabilities, and it’s remarkable how consistently it remembers the original position and gauges proximity and the complexities and changes in the environment.</p>



<p>I’d say the main drawback of an AI-based algorithm over infrared is more noticeable during the moments when you need utmost precision: Enemies hiding behind walls and cover with only a few pixels for you to hit, or the trembling-inducing task of needing to shoot a single leaf or apple with one shot in Point Blank. </p>



<p>In fact, any of Point Blank’s one-shot or limited-ammo mini-games can crank up an already pressure-cooker environment!</p>



<p>If you calibrate everything correctly and optimize your setup and surroundings, you’ll have a ball as you start blasting at everything. The guns feel great, and <strong>the pedal is a genius enhancement, enriching an already homely arcade experience</strong>. The guns don’t rocket back and forth with recoil technology. Instead, there’s an optional haptic feedback-based vibration that kicks in with every shot. </p>



<p>I’m absolutely fine with this, and you can still feel the rush of every shot pulsating through your wrist, traveling up and tapping into the brain’s pleasure senses. Again, G’AIM’E is advertised as “plug and play,” and it does everything it says.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-smart-selection">A Smart Selection</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I wonder how many times they’ve been eaten. Credit to NAMCO</figcaption></figure>



<p>G’AIM’E has collaborated with Bandai Namco to deliver a “Custom licensed version of TIME CRISIS™, faithfully recreated from the original arcade ROM to give you a new and unique arcade experience!” per the official <a href="https://www.mygaime.com/product-tcgun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">G’AIM’E</a> site. You have to hand it to the team as <strong>Time Crisis plays and runs beautifully</strong>. It looks and feels crispier than last night’s pizza, air-fried to perfection. Its constant peek and cover gameplay was revolutionary at the time, and you traverse three full acts of escalating, endlessly replayable combat scenarios.</p>



<p>It’s not the case for most people, but the Point Plank addition is what piqued my interest in G’AIM’E. I grew up playing it at home; <strong>it was <em>my </em>Time Crisis</strong>. I’ve shot so many flying meteors, flaming torches, UFOs, and skeletons that I get real-life PTSD at carnival games. It’s a bunch of quickfire, target-based mini-games using (sometimes protecting) the mecurial duo of Dr. Dan and Dr. Don. It’s so addictive, it’s just as much fun as it was in 1994, and it’s still <em>so </em>hard!</p>



<p>Again, Point Blank is for Premium and Ultimate owners, as is Steel Gunner 1 &amp; 2. While I don’t think you’ll log as many hours in these as Time Crisis or Point Blank, they round out a neat little collection, which brings me to my other concern—longevity and price. Taking off my nostalgia glasses and putting on my critical hat, let’s look at this objectively. Time Crisis takes about 20 minutes to complete, Steel Gunner 1 and 2 playthroughs are about the same, and a quick volley of 16 Point Blank mini-games (17 with the firework finale) is over in roughly 10-15 minutes.</p>



<p>Time Crisis and Point Blank aren’t the home console versions, meaning the Special Mode—which I think is cooler than the main story, as it changes your route depending on your speed and accuracy—isn’t available for Time Crisis. On the other hand, Point Blank is missing all the extra Party and Story Mode features. These would’ve added to the overall package and replayability, but I understand this probably wasn’t possible due to licensing issues. Your mileage with the G’AIM’E packages will vary.</p>



<p>The Basic edition is <strong>$99.99/£99.99</strong>, Premium is <strong>$149.99/£149.99</strong>, and Ultimate costs <strong>$199.99/£199.99</strong>. Paying just under $100 for what is a 20-minute game won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. I think Premium and Ultimate are the way to go, and hand on heart, I probably would’ve opted for Ultimate myself because of the extra gun, as you can play Point Blank and the Steel Gunner games with a friend. It’s been confirmed that each mini-console can’t add new games, meaning any further game expansions will likely require another box and another purchase.</p>



<h2 id="h-g-aim-e-review-verdict">G’AIM’E Review Verdict</h2>



<p>To reiterate, other third-party lightguns and configurations exist—as do expensive cabinets—but this is easily the most accessible and sophisticated lightgun setup in the world. Plug, play, and enjoy pew-pew paradise. I recommend a Premium or Ultimate edition, as you get the best of everything this way. Time Crisis is lightgun heritage, and Point Blank is a timeless classic that you can replay over and over. Old school CRT-enthusiasts might raise an eyebrow at the mostly-solid AI tech, and the price point is definitely worth a conversation.</p>



<p>But at the end of the day, G’AIM’E is exactly what I have been crying out for: A quick and convenient way to enjoy legendary lightgun gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Warhorse Studios, the creator of the Kingdom Come franchise, has revealed that the second game in the critically-acclaimed series is <strong>free to play </strong>this weekend, exclusively on Xbox. Earlier this year, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was released to an overwhelmingly positive reception, and many believe it’s lining up for several Game of the Year awards.</p>



<p>It’s the twilight period for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, with the game’s final DLC dropping soon, bringing an end to years of development and evolution. If you’ve never played the ambitious open-world epic, now is the time.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-free-this-weekend">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is Free This Weekend</h2>



<p>If you own an Xbox Series X or an Xbox Series S console, you can play Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 for free this weekend. It’s a no-strings-attached kind of deal, and it’s set to run hand-in-hand with one of the biggest discounts ever applied to the game.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, we published our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review</a>, dubbing the game a ‘monumental medieval masterpiece’. It was years in the making, borne of a Kickstarter campaign that began more than a decade ago.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The free play window for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is set to run from November 6 (yesterday) to November 10, giving you plenty of time to soak up all that the stellar title has to offer.</p>



<p>It won’t be enough, though. That’s why the massive discount has been arranged, so if you want to keep up your adventures with Henry of Skalitz, you can do so by purchasing the game at the lowest price it has ever boasted.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ll be playing Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 this weekend.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, Nikita Buyanov, revealed that extra effort is being applied to take care of cheaters when 1.0 is released later this month. As one of the biggest concerns around, fans are worried that cheaters will negatively impact the game’s launch, which has been building for <strong>a decade</strong>.</p>



<p>Buyanov has explained that years of ‘hatred’ haven’t prevented a ‘huge department’ from working ‘day and night’ to produce new methods to combat cheaters in the spearhead extraction shooter game.</p>



<h2 id="h-cheaters-be-damned-in-escape-from-tarkov">Cheaters Be Damned in Escape from Tarkov</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/escape-from-tarkov/1-0-steam-cheating-measures-battlestate-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent interview</a>, Nikita Buyanov, the prolific leader of Battlestate Games, explained how the company has ‘a few tricks up our sleeve for the release’ of Escape from Tarkov. This is in reference to combating the cheaters that have plagued the game for years, causing one of the most consistent issues around.</p>



<p>It’s one of the reasons why so many players have turned to PvE over the last year and a half, removing other players from their experience and eradicating the concern of cheating.</p>



<p>Buyanov explained how the studio has remained stalwart despite years of criticism:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is truly unfortunate and somewhat upsetting to read all kinds of comments over the years and navigate through waves of hatred, as if we are not doing anything.</p>



<p>We have a huge department working on this, banning players day and night and coming up with new methods. But it’s impossible to change the players’ opinions. And that can be depressing at times. To be honest, to some extent, this emotional background is very discouraging and frustrating. But we’re used to it. It’s a never-ending race, and we’ve never given up and don’t intend to give up.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Recently, the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-rewards-revealed-pre-order/">revealed the rewards</a> coming to all Escape from Tarkov owners when the game goes live on November 15. There’s a pack incoming, including exclusive outfits, dogtag models, hideout customization elements, and more.</p>



<p>Also on November 15, Escape from Tarkov will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-i-need-to-buy-escape-from-tarkov-steam-again/">released on Steam</a>, marking the first time that the game has been available outside Battlestate Games’ proprietary launcher.</p>



<p>Do you believe that cheaters will be taken care of when Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release is here? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>In a post on GTA Forums that was later verified by the site’s admins, a former Rockstar Games employee divulged information about the recent controversy that saw more than 30 employees suddenly dismissed from the company. In the words of Rockstar, they were fired for leaking game information in a Discord server, but that might not be the case.</p>



<p>As the user posted, nobody was leaking anything in the private Discord server that contained only Rockstar Games employees, but instead, they were using it to discuss unionization in a bid to encourage change at Rockstar Games for the better.</p>



<p>It has been alleged that Rockstar Games fired these employees for taking part in this activity.</p>



<h2 id="h-former-rockstar-employees-are-lashing-out">Former Rockstar Employees Are Lashing Out</h2>



<p>The lengthy post on <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1004182-rockstar-games-alleged-union-busting/#comment-1072605777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the GTA Forums</a> reveals a tale of heartbreak and disappointment at the sudden dismissal of more than 30 Rockstar Games employees in the United Kingdom and Canada.</p>



<p>In the post, the user named ‘Organize’, who joined the forums in June, revealed that Rockstar Games broke several UK employment laws when dismissing staff on grounds of gross misconduct. Many have claimed this was a thinly veiled attempt to bust unionization efforts.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Last week, my colleagues who were in the studio were each individually messaged by HR for a short friendly meeting, under the friendly guise of “Hey, are you free for a quick chat?”</p>



<p>Upon attending this meeting they were handed an envelope with a short letter stating that their employment had been terminated for “gross misconduct” regarding posts made in Discord.</p>



<p>They failed to provide any evidence when asked, nor was any stated in the letter. And did not divulge any other information or reasoning – “and no other reason”</p>



<p>They refused their right to Union representation in the disciplinary meeting (which is against UK employment law) and were frogmarched out of the studio with the meeting lasting less than 5 minutes.</p>



<p>For colleagues who were not in the Studio that day, they received a phone call from HR that lasted less than 2 minutes telling them they were fired and that they’d receive the same letter as above. I am aware of one employee who had a panic attack at this moment, and HR hung up on them during this panic attack not caring at all about their wellbeing.</p>



<p>These colleagues of mine were hard workers who have spent many many years at R* in critical roles. With colleagues who have been at R* for more that 18 years and none of them have ever had a disciplinary in that time. They are not easily replaced and will certainly affect us in making our project deadlines.</p>



<p>These are very senior artists, animators, QA testers, designers, programmers and producers. Including Leads. All super talented people who were proud of their work over multiple R* titles, and all they wanted was the best for R* and their fellow colleagues.</p>



<p>Some of these members were off sick, recovering from surgery or on paternity leave. Fired without pay, losing their careers and putting them into hardship in the lead up to Christmas, and even potentially losing their VISAs to work in the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me make this clear! I never saw any discussion/leaking of Rockstar projects in the Union Discord. The only ever discussion was around unionisation efforts and the working conditions at R*. The Discord wasn’t public. It was a private Discord group that only contained R* employees and the IWGB Union officials.</p>



<p>This was Union Busting and nothing else! Everyone fired was a Union Member, they were also predominantly from those who were on the Union Organising Committees of each UK studio.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The user revealed that almost enough members had been reached to ‘seek recognition and begin engaging in collective bargaining.’</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They have fired over 34 of us now. There were over 250 of us in that Union/Employee Discord group. There is the fear that if they get away with this, they’ll have nothing stopping them from doing this again and again.</p>



<p>Those of us who are lucky and remain for now work in fear! Fearful when talking to each other at the tea prep, fearful that we’re next in line and are easily got rid of, too scared to go outside the studio and talk to (or even acknowledge) our colleagues outside protesting in fear of reprisals. Morale in the studio is at rock bottom. When we should be excited about what’s to come over the next year we are now totally deflated and our trust and confidence in others is totally shot.</p>



<p>Which is the truly heartbreaking part, as for us in the Union, all of our ambition was to make R* a happier, fairer, safer and more equitable place. That’s all. What has happened clearly shows that we care more about the wellbeing of our colleagues at Rockstar than the Company does.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This would have allowed the employees to address key issues in the company: ‘worsening crunch, inadequate pay, and inflexible working arrangements.’ To protest the firing of these Rockstar Games employees, the IWGB union and former employees <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-rockstar-workers-protest-take-two/">marched on Take-Two’s London office</a> yesterday.</p>



<p>In recent Rockstar Games news, Grand Theft Auto 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/">was delayed by several months</a> and will now be released on November 19, 2026, rather than May 26, 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new TikTok ad, it was once again teased that Rogue and Gambit are coming to Marvel Rivals. Fans were quick to spot and screenshot the images, but it became tough to replicate it until a Marvel Rivals leaks page uncovered the ad and confirmed it was real.</p>



<p>Rogue and Gambit would join a roster of more than 40 playable heroes from across the Marvel Universe, and they’re expected to arrive on November 14 when the game’s fifth season goes live.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-rogue-and-gambit-coming-to-marvel-rivals">Are Rogue and Gambit Coming to Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p>The imminent arrival of Rogue and Gambit has been teased in recent patch notes, with eagle-eyed players spotting the characters in the background of an image posted by NetEase.</p>



<p>On November 14, the game’s fifth season will drop, and many believe that’s when Rogue and Gambit will surface as the latest new characters.</p>



<p>In a recent TikTok ad, art of the two characters was revealed. It was picked up by Marvel Rivals pages on social media and shared around before <a href="https://xcancel.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1986491569122299996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XOX LEAK confirmed</a> the content’s validity.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans are wondering why NetEase hasn’t dropped the trailer for season five yet, which would undoubtedly reveal the presence of Rogue and Gambit as new playable heroes.</p>



<p>There are rumors that the trailer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">season five</a> will be released on November 11, revealing everything coming in the supersized update.</p>



<p>In recent news related to the game, one of the most prominent esports organisations in the business <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sentinels-announce-marvel-rivals-esports-exit/">left Marvel Rivals</a> and made quips about how NetEase isn’t effectively supporting the ecosystem.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-sales-results-softer-than-expected/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4%E2%80%99s-sales-results-were-%E2%80%98softer%E2%80%99-than-expected-take-two-says.1346581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Take-Two has been in a sticky spot of late. The company faced a protest yesterday in London as former Rockstar employees unfairly dismissed were joined by union members outside Take-Two’s office in the heart of the United Kingdom. Then, an announcement of another GTA 6 delay caused the company’s stock value to plummet by 10%.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, Strauss Zelnick, confirmed that Borderlands 4 also failed to meet expectations, adding another layer of woe to the Take-Two story this year.</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-didn-t-do-as-well-as-everyone-thought">Borderlands 4 Didn’t Do as Well as Everyone Thought</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?r=52dp8y&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick confirmed that, while Borderlands 4 had a great launch, it failed to wow with sales figures, and the numbers were ultimately ‘softer’ than the company would have liked.</p>



<p>Here’s the quote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The critical acclaim for Borderlands 4 was superb, and we’re really happy with the release.</p>



<p>Equally, as you know, there were some challenges with the Steam release. Gearbox has been addressing those challenges and will continue to do so. In terms of units sold out of the gate, the numbers were <strong>a little softer than we would have liked</strong>. In the fullness of time, we think it’s going to do great.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That means that Zelnick expects Borderlands 4 to keep selling as time goes on, even if the game is already slipping far down the charts in favor of other, more recent titles.</p>



<p>In recent Take-Two news, the publisher found itself in hot water over the delay of Grand Theft Auto 6. While many thought it would be the case, it caused Take-Two’s stock value to drop by around 10%, representative of the shaken faith of investors.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-5-878-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-880-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-friday-november-7.1346578/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the end of the week – congratulations on making it this far! I hope your NYT Connections streak is still looking clean and consistent. I’m here today to support that goal, bringing you today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions, allowing you to solve today’s puzzle in the quickest way possible.</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections hints and answers you need for today.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-7">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 7)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #880:</p>



<ul>
<li>HULA HOOP</li>



<li>EGGPLANT</li>



<li>SALSA VERDE</li>



<li>BAGEL</li>



<li>SWING STATE</li>



<li>RELISH</li>



<li>ANIMAL PRINT</li>



<li>POLKA DOT</li>



<li>WASHER</li>



<li>BARNEY THE DINOSAUR</li>



<li>PESTO</li>



<li>HOUNDSTOOTH</li>



<li>INNER TUBE</li>



<li>CHIMICHURRI</li>



<li>HERRINGBONE</li>



<li>PEOPLE EATER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of what you might see on a fashionable coat or a retro couch</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Zesty, herby, and often spooned over grilled meats or sandwiches</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Round and hollow — some edible, some inflatable</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These words are feeling kind of purple</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 7.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-7-880">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 7 (#880)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– ANIMAL PRINT, HERRINGBONE, HOUNDSTOOTH, POLKA DOT</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CHIMICHURRI, PESTO, RELISH, SALSA VERDE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BAGEL, HULA HOOP, INNER TUBE, WASHER</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BARNEY THE DINOSAUR, EGGPLANT, PEOPLE EATER, SWING STATE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
