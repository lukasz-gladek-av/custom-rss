Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/esports/games/call-of-duty/" id="3373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty </a>has <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2026/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-zombies-season-02-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced its season 2 content</a> for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" id="2795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>, including the launch of several new multiplayer maps and a handful of returning ones, with the season’s start on February 5.</p>



<p>Multiplayer content is a central focal point of the second season of Black Ops 7. In addition to several new modes arriving throughout the season, ranked play is returning, along with other multiplayer events. Nine multiplayer maps are included. Included among them are a couple of remastered maps and a couple of returning maps from Black Ops 6.</p>







<h2>Remastered and Returning Maps Are Built for 6v6 Play</h2>



<p>Cliff Town is a remaster of the Yemen map from Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty/" id="32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty </a>team describes this as a tightly packed map with a good blend of narrow alleys and elevated Vantage points. It is a medium-sized map scheduled for release mid-season.</p>



<p>Additionally, Slums is another remastered medium-sized map from the second Black Ops game. This map will be available at launch. It’s dubbed one of the most iconic Maps in the Black Ops series, offering a true test of skill for both casual and competitive players.</p>



<p>There are also a couple of returning maps from Black Ops 6, including Firing Range and Grind. Both are medium-sized and scheduled for mid-season release.</p>







<h2 id="h-five-new-maps-are-on-the-way-to-black-ops-7">Five New Maps Are on the Way to Black Ops 7</h2>



<p>In addition to the returning maps, there’s a handful of new maps on the way. Some of which will even be available at the launch of the second season.</p>



<p>Torment, Sake, and Nexus will be available on launch. Torment and Sake are exclusively built for 6v6 gameplay. Nexus, however, is also compatible with 2v2 matches as it is a small-sized map.</p>



<p>There’s also a new map called Torque. It is a small map built for 6v6 gameplay and recalls the Battle of Los Angeles from Black Ops 2.</p>



<p>Lastly, there’s a brand-new skirmish map built for 20v20 gameplay. Named “Peak,” the map is built for large-scale confrontations. It features narrow medieval streets, High Value Sectors to claim, sniper rooftops, a central snaking road, a waterlogged perimeter with Tactical Rafts, a harbor, fishery warehouses, and intense house-to-house combat.</p>
