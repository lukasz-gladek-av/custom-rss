<p>Maximum Football heads to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691280/Maximum_Football/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Early Access on Steam</a> on November 7, and the game’s director is happy where the gameplay stands as it gets set to launch.</p>



<p>In an exclusive upcoming interview with Insider Gaming, Maximum Games Game Director Micah Brown says that the gameplay is even further along than what he expected at this point.</p>



<p>“I’m feeling really good,” Brown said about the state of things as the game heads to early access. “The gameplay is where we want it to be. It’s further along than I thought it would be.</p>



<p>“Honestly, it plays very, very well. It’s very, very smooth.”</p>



<p>Brown did say that there are still some animations that are being smoothed out, with some coming after launch. However, as a whole, the game is playing exactly how they want it to be at this point in development.</p>



<p>“The multiplayer we’ve been testing is working well,” he continued. “The customization is absolutely amazing and the gameplay is running very well. So I’m really excited. I can’t wait till we launch and see what everybody says.</p>



<p>“It’s going to be wild.”</p>



<p>Brown’s comments on gameplay come as part of a nearly 30-minute sit down talking Maximum Football. Other topics in the upcoming interview include the game’s pricing structure, plans surrounding future updates, encouraging players to try the game, and much more.</p>



<p>When it releases in early access, the base game of Maximum Football will be free for all players. Those who wish access to more modes and options can upgrade to either the Dynasty Edition for $19.99 or the Legend Edition for $39.99.</p>
