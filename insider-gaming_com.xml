<p>The Outer Worlds 2 release is nearly here, bringing many people who loved the original game back into this universe where business executives overrule everyone.</p>



<p>With the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-outer-worlds-2-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embargo date set to reveal review scores</a> for the upcoming game, you will want to have a good understanding of when the game is actually released so you can play it.</p>



<p>Here is everything we know about The Outer Worlds 2 release date and a possible start time.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-outer-worlds-2-release">When Does The Outer Worlds 2 Release?</h2>

<p><strong>The Outer Worlds 2 full release date is on October 29, but anyone who </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-outer-worlds-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>pre-orders the Premium Edition</strong></a><strong> will be able to play the game five days early on October 24.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-outer-worlds-2-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers</a> will be able to download and play the game on that later date, but if they desire to play early and get all the rest of the content included in the Premium Edition, they can buy the $30 upgrade pack on the Xbox Store.</p>



<p>It might not be the perfect festive game for Halloween, but fans of the first game will hardly complain about being able to run around and mess with the various corporations and NPCs just before the holiday.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-exact-release-time-for-the-outer-worlds-2">Do We Know the Exact Release Time for The Outer Worlds 2?</h2>



<p><strong>According to the </strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6312-PPSA24588_00-0872768154966924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>PlayStation Store</strong></a><strong>, the standard edition of The Outer Worlds 2 will go live at 1 PM ET on October 29, so this version of the game will not have a midnight release. That is not the same for the early access players, who will be able to play starting at 12 AM ET on October 24.</strong></p>



<p>Here is a chart that will break down the starting times for the standard version of The Outer Worlds 2.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">The Outer Worlds 2 Standard Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM—October 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">12 PM—October 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM—October 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM—October 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT)</td><td data-align="center">4 AM—October 30</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The standard edition of The Outer Worlds 2 releasing at midday in the United States is definitely an odd time for the full game to release. Usually, even with games that have an early access period, they will become playable at either midnight Eastern Time or sometime in the morning. Having it set for the afternoon is definitely not the norm with big releases like this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The head of Assassin’s Creed has reportedly left Ubisoft after the launch of the company’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-company-officially-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new subsidiary with Tencent</a>.</p>



<p>According to reports, franchise vice president and executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté is no longer with the company. The news was broken to the company via an internal email. </p>



<p>Per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the memo sent</a> to staff and first reported by IGN, Vantage Studios’ co-CEOs Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot said that Côté was offered a leadership role within the company, but he declined the opportunity. It was a decision that the studio leads say they were “disappointed” by. They added that Côté had “<strong>his own expectations and priorities related to Vantage Studios’ creation and future.”</strong></p>



<p>In a statement provided to Insider Gaming, an Ubisoft spokesperson said,<strong> “Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025,&nbsp;Marc-Alexis Côté&nbsp;has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft. While we are saddened to see him go, we’re confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin’s Creed brand into what it is today. His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors.”</strong></p>



<p>Côté&nbsp;first <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcalexis/details/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">joined Ubisoft in 2005</a> as a software engineer. Over the last 20 years, he had moved up through the company as a lead programmer, level designer, game director, and executive producer. Games produced under his watch include Assassin’s Creed III, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate, and Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, among others. </p>



<p>Since 2022, Côté&nbsp;has been responsible for the “overall strategy for the Assassin’s Creed franchise”. </p>
