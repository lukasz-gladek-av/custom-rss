<p>What’s Marvel Rivals Esports going to look like is a question that every player has been asking, and the game director of the hero shooter has just revealed their approach towards the competitive aspect of the title. &nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a>, Marvel Rivals game director Guangyun Chen was asked about Netease’s esports aspirations for the game. Chen responded that Marvel Rivals esports is something they have been thinking about “on a broader scale, looking at the picture as a whole.” Their approach aims to cater to both competitive and casual players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chen added that the team hopes their competitive modes or tournaments can “coexist” with their quick-play mode. The developers have observed several games managing healthy competitive and quick-play environments simultaneously. They will use references from these titles to help “both player pools thrive.” The director didn’t reveal any upcoming esports tournaments for Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>Apart from their competitive plans for Marvel Rivals, the director also spoke about new additions to the roster during this interview. Players can expect new heroes to be added every three months; <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-heroes-every-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here are more details</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals have figured out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-bots-are-being-sniffed-out-by-invisible-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to locate bots</a> with the help of Invisible Woman’s ability. Also, five more heroes are reportedly arriving for the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-professor-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including X-Men’s Professor X</a>. What are your thoughts on the game director’s approach towards Marvel Rivals esports?

<p>Marvel Rivals fans won’t have to wait too long to see the game’s roster of heroes expand moving forward. In a new interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a>, game director Guangyun Chen gave an update on developer NetEase’s plans for new characters in the game.</p>



<p>Chen says that everything will revolve around the game’s seasons. A season in Marvel Rivals will last three months, but will be broken into two halves. During that time, players will get a new hero every half season. That means one hero every month-and-a-half for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>“We just eventually want to continue to enhance the experience, and, you know, keep everyone excited in our community,” Chen said while adding that, in addition to new heroes, each season will include seasonal stories and new maps.</p>



<p>As far as which heroes will be added and when, Chen says that it’ll be “guided by the overall gameplay experience or theme that we want to create for each season.”</p>







<p>“So it’ll revolve around the season and right now, at post-launch, we have eight Vanguards and seven Strategists at launch,” he said. “The team believes that it gives the players a solid variety for tactical match-ups or team composition. Having more Duelists at the moment will definitely enhance the Duelist experience, letting players dive a little bit deeper into that aspect.”</p>



<p>Lastly, Chen thanked the community for feedback on heroes and say that the feedback will be used in making decisions on when to release certain heroes as well.</p>



<p>“[We] want to make sure that everyone feels heard and excited,” he said.</p>

<p>Balatro has a ton of content to unlock, challenges to beat, and fiery points totals to earn. Our Balatro Trophy Guide and the full list of achievements delve deeper into the game’s more challenging tasks—and your patience and free time are bound to be tested.</p>



<p>I’ve lost count of my Balatro runs at this point. I’m not sure I’d even want to know to be honest, as my losses would outweigh my wins. Yet, I love it, and it’s easy to see why it was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-of-2024-best-new-indie-games-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie Game of 2024</a>. If I want to be the ultimate Balatro master, I need to get every Trophy and Achievement, and the evidence suggests this might not <em>ever </em>happen.</p>



<p>All the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-plasma-deck-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plasma Decks</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-brainstorm-joker-in-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brainstorm Jokers</a> in the world can’t make this endeavor easier—and I wish the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-balatro-seeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Balatro Seeds</a> counted toward progress!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-balatro-trophies-amp-achievements-are-there">How Many Balatro Trophies &amp; Achievements Are There?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A beautiful sight. Credit to LocalThunk</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Balatro has 32 PlayStation Trophies and 31 Xbox Achievements to unlock to complete the list.</strong></p>



<p>The shiny Platinum Trophy is the big difference between Xbox and PlayStation. Getting all Achievements is necessary for all Gamerscore, whereas getting every Trophy rewards you with a Platinum on PS4 and PS5. Achieving full completion earns bragging rights on either platform over friends who are trying to best Balatro too—something I’m desperately working toward.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-balatro-trophy-amp-achievement">Every Balatro Trophy &amp; Achievement</h2>



<p>Balatro’s Achievements and Trophies range from achieving scores with a ridiculous number of digits to completing Balatro—and I do mean <em>completing </em>Balatro.</p>



<p>Here’s every Trophy, Achievement, and what they’re worth.</p>

<h2 id="h-balatro-trophies-amp-achievements-difficulty-rating">Balatro Trophies &amp; Achievements Difficulty Rating</h2>



<p><strong>Balatro’s Trophies and Achievements are an easy 9 out of 10 on the difficulty scale.</strong></p>



<p>It achieves this rating based on the toughness of its Completionist++ objective, as well as how many hours it takes. Earning a Gold Sticker on every Joker is a stupidly difficult ask, and all it takes is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-beat-plant-boss-blind-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Plant Boss Blind</a> to mess everything up, or another unforeseen factor to have a good run end up in smoke in seconds.</p>

<p>A new teaser for the upcoming Until Dawn movie has been released by Sony Pictures. The teaser sets the stage for the movie ahead the reveal of the first trailer.</p>



<p>“As a huge fan of the Until Dawn game and how cinematic it was, I thought a lot about how we can continue the story without just giving the audience the same experience that they got when they were playing,” Writer and Producer Gary Dauberman said.</p>



<p>Director David F. Sandberg says that the movie “has sort of the same tone and same vibe” as the original game. However, he says, it “expands upon the universe”. Sandberg then touched on what he viewed as one of the more creative aspects of the game which is players making different choices and dying in different ways. </p>



<p>“The movie has this mechanic where things start over and they get to try again,” he said. “Every time they come back to life, it’s like their in a new horror genre. To survive, they have to make it until dawn.”</p>



<p>You can check out the first look teaser for the film below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="UNTIL DAWN – Film First Look" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7mf5T1YYOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The movie’s description reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One year after her sister Melanie mysteriously disappeared, Clover and her friends head into the remote valley where she vanished in search of answers. Exploring an abandoned visitor center, they find themselves stalked by a masked killer and horrifically murdered one by one…only to wake up and find themselves back at the beginning of the same evening. Trapped in the valley, they’re forced to relive the nightmare again and again – only each time the killer threat is different, each more terrifying than the last. Hope dwindling, the group soon realizes they have a limited number of deaths left, and the only way to escape is to survive until dawn.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Until Dawn is scheduled to release in theaters on April 25. </p>
