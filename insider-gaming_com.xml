<p>Recently, Mojang revealed the Vibrant Visuals update for Minecraft. It’s an evolution of the game’s 15-year-old visual palette, and it’s set to change how reflections, sunlight, water, draw distances, and more all behave in Minecraft. It’s set to alter the game’s overall appearance without changing too much, but when is Vibrant Visuals coming to Minecraft?</p>



<p>The Vibrant Visuals update is already exciting fans worldwide. It’s one of the most major updates to hit Minecraft for a while, and it’ll be added alongside various changes – such as the introduction of a <strong>happy ghast</strong>. Amazing.</p>



<p>Read on to learn when Vibrant Visuals is coming to Minecraft.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-minecraft-vibrant-visuals-release-date-status">Minecraft Vibrant Visuals Release Date Status</h2>



<p><strong>At the time of writing, the release date for Vibrant Visuals in Minecraft was pending, with Mojang having mentioned that it’s coming ‘in the future’.</strong> However, players on select Minecraft: Bedrock Edition devices using a beta or preview system will be able to test Vibrant Visuals sooner than that.</p>



<p>Minecraft Live 2025 had some solid reveals, but the Vibrant Visuals announcement was by far the best received. It’ll follow the Minecraft Spring to Life update, which is set to drop soon. Later this year, players will also get their first look at the dried ghast, which can be claimed and turned into a ghastling, and then into a <strong>happy ghast</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-vibrant-visuals">What is Vibrant Visuals?</h2>



<p>The Vibrant Visuals update was perfectly broken down in the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-vibrant-visuals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Minecraft Live recap</a>, but I’ll paste the most important details about the update here.</p>



<p>Vibrant Visuals will change and introduce various key features in Minecraft:</p>



<ul>
<li>Shadows interacting with sunlight more accurately</li>



<li>Volumetric fog</li>



<li>Directional lighting upgrades</li>



<li>Infinite clouds across the draw</li>



<li>‘Thousands of individually crafted elements’</li>



<li>Accurate light rays through trees, windows, water, etc</li>



<li>Glow upgrades and evolved reflections</li>



<li>More accurate water visuals</li>
</ul>



<p>The team at Mojang was quick to point out that the Vibrant Visuals update in Minecraft won’t destroy the ‘creative principles’ of the game – it’s almost entirely a visual update.</p>



<p>If you’re eager to know, ‘When is Vibrant Visuals coming to Minecraft,’ you’ve got a little longer to wait, I’m afraid. It won’t be long, though – Mojang has announced it will be speeding up these ‘Game Drops’ in future, so you’ll know more very soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-major-ii-sweep-city-central-four-teams/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty League Major II tournament in Texas is unfolding as we speak, and it has been one of the fastest-paced events we’ve seen in years. Out of every match played, only <strong>four fixtures </strong>have gone beyond a 3-0 scoreline as the most dominant teams in the business steamroll the competition.</p>



<p>Only four teams are left in the running – Surge, FaZe, Ultra, and LAT. Fans are expecting a repeat of Major I with an LAT v. FaZe grand final, but Toronto Ultra is in the midst of a phenomenal lower-bracket run that could subvert those expectations. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-take-everything">Take Everything</h2>



<p>Toronto Ultra was thrown into the lower bracket by Cloud9 at the earliest opportunity before kickstarting an epic run that has seen the squad eliminate three teams back to back. In those three series, not a single map was given up by Toronto Ultra, the squad that hosted Major I and that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-championship-2025-kitchener-june/">will host COD Champs in June</a>.</p>



<p>LAT is in a similar spot, having eliminated Heretics, Royal Ravens, and Cloud9 after being forced into the loser’s bracket by Boston Breach in a shock loss early in the tournament. </p>



<p>Recently, LAT won the CDL Minor II event – the team is now looking to make it big in Major II to redeem a close loss against Atlanta FaZe in Madrid in February.</p>



<p>In an interview after the win against Cloud9, LAT’s Scrappy said about that series and this one:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I feel like we’re a complete team, I feel like at Major I our SnD wasn’t great, our map pool wasn’t great, but I think coming into this Major we put a lot of grind into it and we’re looking good.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The other dark horse in the bracket is Vancouver Surge. The squad has been on point since picking up Neptune, and the upper bracket has been their’s to control, with the team already decimating the Royal Ravens and Boston Breach. They’ll need to push past FaZe to get into the GF, but that might be light work for the Surge.</p>



<p>At Minor II, Surge eliminated Atlanta FaZe, and before that, the team scored a 3-1 win over the tournament favourites in the Major II qualifiers. FaZe hasn’t beaten Surge since June 2024, but they haven’t had many opportunities until recently. </p>



<p>It’s anyone’s game right now, and I can easily see any of the four teams left taking everything, but I love an underdog story, so I’d hope that Surge has a fair crack at picking up the trophy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stay-forever-home-hands-on-pushing-the-boundaries-of-pet-simulation-in-vr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I’d be the first to admit that my time with VR and AR is fairly limited, but at this years GDC in San Francisco, it was impossible not to be drawn in by the awesome tech and games that developers are working on in the space. In fact, one of my biggest takeaways from GDC is that I’ve walked away eager to try out virtual reality again after briefly giving it a go a few years back.</p>



<p>One game that stuck out as particularly impressive to me was Stay: Forever Home, a soon-to-be-released XR game that pushes the boundaries of VR and AR technology to create a fully immersive pet simulator. Its developers, Windup Minds, are a small fully-remote team consisting of veteran developers behind the likes of Meta’s Bogo and First Steps.</p>



<p>Stay: Forever Home evolves around your pet named Ember, a magical canine that lives by your side and is fully responsive to your actions to how you also interact with the world. Ember is powered by unscripted AI-powered behaviour that creates a familiar feeling that everyone with a real-life dog knows. From mischievous antics to being needy because she wants to be petted, it creates a genuine feeling of immersion that no pet simulator on the market has been able to pull off. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The developers say that the game designs to “love you back” and during my 25-30 minute demo, I got to see exactly what they meant first-hand. Despite being initially weirded out by feeling somewhat unnatural wearing a VR headset and watched by the developers (again, I’m not super into VR), it didn’t take long to realise that the developers were onto something special.</p>



<p>To start, I was introduced to Ember who appeared in a floating portal in her own world and at first she was a little nervous and skittish of who I was – just like how a real-world pet would be. To gain her trust, I was instructed to feed her a few berries, where she progressively became more trusting of me and soon, she trusted me enough to jump from her world into mine. From here, the game was designed for me to get familiar with the controls and what you can do with Ember, from petting and brushing her down to making her fetch a ball. It was all very reminiscent of being at home with my own dogs, where I could sit down and pet her for as long as I wanted at my own leisure and mess with her floppy ears as I would do with my Labrador (sorry Max). </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Moving on from the mixed-reality environment, I was then prompted to take Ember into a fully-fledged VR world via a magical door. This is where you can take Ember for those all important ‘walkies’ that every dog needs. But this is where you’ll also be able to complete challenges, do trades for treats and other items, and more. The developers tell me that these challenges and activities will be updated regularly, but for those with a more relaxed approach, you can just go for a stroll and see what antics she gets up to if preferred. Again, referring back to that unscripted AI behaviour, you’re never quite sure what she’ll do. For example, in my play time, I was harvesting some berries and Ember decided to run off, only to return to be covered in mud – something I presumably would have had to deal with later if I had longer time playing.</p>



<p>The developers told me that this is just the beginning for the VR-world and that they do have plans to update the world in the future, but that it was still early days to announce anything. Hopefully, such updates to reflect the seasons is something that’s being considered to add another layer of immersion to the world, and I think seeing Ember react to the likes of crunchy leaves in Autumn or reacting to snow on the floor for the first would be particularly fun to watch.</p>



<p>In the demo, I was also introduced to the first voice command of “come” or “come here”, where after shouting, Ember would obey the command and return to you. Other voices commands like “sit” where also said to be coming to the game on launch, adding another layer of immersion to a game that stands out from the rest of the pet simulators on the market.</p>



<p>Overall, Stay: Forever Home breaks new ground on pet simulation, not only because of the use of the technology, but because of the caring nature of its developers that has created an experience that I don’t think can be replicated.</p>



<p>Stay: Forever Home launches on the Meta Quest 3S, Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest Pro, and Meta Quest 2 on April 3, 2025 where you can <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/stay-forever-home/8870151916378062/?srsltid=AfmBOoog3Z7zc5XUfg64IgVnaPPX2lIr8fr2VmzYYUUMPQdgl7iszzS8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">add it to your wishlist here</a>.</p>
