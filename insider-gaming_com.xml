<p>When Counter-Strike 2 came out, it fully replaced Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and introduced a wave of new improvements and changes. While not all the changes have been widely approved by the game’s huge playerbase, CS2 remains the most popular game played on Steam, with no signs of slowing down soon.</p>



<p>But when exactly did the Counter-Strike 2 era begin?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-did-counter-strike-2-come-out">When Did Counter-Strike 2 Come Out?</h2>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 officially came out on September 27, 2023, though the game was playable for some players earlier than that.</p>



<p>CS2 was originally announced back on March 22, 2023, via <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2">a series of posts from Val</a><a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">v</a><a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2">e</a> highlighting some of the new changes. These changes included the new volumetric and reactive smokes, sub-tick servers, and overhauled or visually updated maps. The game itself also came over to the Source 2 engine.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Fresh off the new game announcement, Valve opened a limited test that would offer select players a chance to try out CS2. Less than two months later, in May, Counter-Strike would hit its all-time player peak at 1.8 million players. This can be attributed to the rise in players trying to get CS2 limited test access as well as the release of the Major pass for the final CS:GO Major, BLAST Paris.</p>



<p>Finally, on September 27, 2023, CS:GO was officially taken over by Counter-Strike 2. Response to the release was mixed, as gameplay modes like Arms Race and Danger Zone didn’t come over to CS2. Arms Race eventually was released in CS2 in the next year. Valve continues to roll out new updates addressing bugs and major issues while introducing new content.</p>



<p>How do you feel about CS2 since it came out? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It took just two days before the first layoffs of 2025 took place in the gaming industry. Netmarble F&amp;C is laying off about 20 people — roughly 25% — at the company.</p>



<p>The news was first reported by Korean news outlet <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20250102076600017?section=industry/game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YNA</a>.</p>



<p>Netmarble F&amp;C is a subsidiary of the mobile games company Netmarble. The studio is currently working on its new game Demis Reborn, which is scheduled to release sometime in 2025. According to YNA, the game’s “art style and overall atmosphere were significantly revised” in order to better suite adult taste.</p>







<p>It’s also reported that the game’s release date is “likely” to be altered a bit due to the staffing changes.</p>



<p>The last two years have been the worst the games industry has seen when it comes to layoffs. After over 10,000 layoffs in 2023, 2024 <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">saw an estimated 16,000+</a> jobs lost. </p>
