<p>An unfortunate but important update has been shared from the team behind MOUSE: P.I. For Hire.</p>



<p>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire is an upcoming narrative-driven first-person shooter. One of the game’s main elements is its black-and-white art style, inspired by the rubber-hose animation style. MOUSE is one of many projects that entered development once the Steamboat Willie version of Mickey Mouse entered the public domain.</p>



<p>A mini behind-the-scenes documentary was released in October 2025, covering the development of MOUSE. It was shared during the ID@Xbox Fall showcase.</p>

<h2 id="h-mouse-p-i-for-hire-release-date-pushed-back">MOUSE: P.I. For Hire Release Date Pushed Back</h2>



<p>The game was slated for a March 19 release date. However, developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fumi-games/" id="3438">Fumi Games</a> and publisher PlaySide have issued a joint statement saying that the game will now be released on April 16. The reason given for the delay is simply a request for extra time to ensure the game’s quality.</p>



<p>“As we approached the final stages of development, we want to ensure that we are taking the extra time and care needed to make MOUSE: P.I. For Hire an experience to remember,” the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2416450?emclan=103582791473604212&amp;emgid=490465653219656390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement read. </a>“We remain unwavering in our goal to deliver you the best game we can, and that will just take an extra few weeks.”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/esports/games/call-of-duty/" id="3373">Call of Duty</a> team recently shut down a rumor regarding an upcoming game project.</p>



<p>Recently, a “leak” from TheGhostofHope on Twitter claimed that the Call of Duty team was planning to release a standalone Zombies title alongside the standard Call of Duty release. The post also noted that Microsoft hoped Activision would be less attached to annual releases going forward.</p>



<p>However, it appears none of that is true.</p>







<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-team-denies-rumor">Call of Duty Team Denies Rumor</h2>



<p>The Call of Duty Twitter account actively shut down the rumor. Replying to a Dexerto post, they would say that the “rumor factory is working overtime” and that “this ain’t it.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>EXCLUSIVE: Sources indicate to me that the delay on the next Xbox has “hurt” a lot of CODs marketing plans as they wanted Modern Warfare 4 to be a launch title and draw a lot of hype to compete with peoples attention alongside GTA VI.

Because of this delay, the idea of two Call</span></p></article></div>



<p>There you have it. If you were looking forward to a standalone Zombies Call of Duty game, you may have to wait a little longer. This ain’t it, chief.</p>











<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-selling-very-well">Call of Duty Black Ops 7 Is Selling Very Well</h2>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was recently listed as the best-selling game of January 2026. That was the second month in a row, as it also claimed the same spot in December 2025. Therefore, things are looking alright for the CoD brand.</p>



<p>They did recently shut down one of their mobile games, however. It was noted that Warzone Mobile will shut down in April. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-to-go-offline-in-two-months/" id="177181">here</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to report the latest gaming news as it breaks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>King of Meat has announced it will shut down in April. The game was released less than 6 months ago.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/amazon-games/" id="52194">Amazon Games</a> release, the dungeon-crawler x action-brawler hybrid <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/king-of-meat/" id="3030">King of Meat</a>, launched in October 2025. It was a rough launch, described as “disastrous.” Two months after the game’s launch, several developers at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/glowmade/" id="3031">Glowmade</a>, the game’s development studio, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/king-of-meat-glowmade-layoffs/" id="162870">were laid off</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming exclusively reported that leadership hoped the game would reach a concurrent player count of at least 100,000. As of this writing, there are 11 concurrent players on Steam, and the game’s all-time concurrent player peak was 320 on November 15. </p>



<p>They’d even put up a multi-million-dollar video from Mr. Beast’s gaming YouTube channel, featuring a custom set and several content creators. They also had custom-wrapped buses in London to market the game, and were even looking at an animated TV pilot.</p>



<p>The game has announced it will be shutting down, and players will receive a full refund.</p>







<h2 id="h-king-of-meat-plans-to-shut-servers-down-in-early-april">King of Meat Plans to Shut Servers Down in Early April</h2>



<p>King of Meat’s servers will shut down on April 9, meaning the game will be offline just a few days past the 6-month mark.</p>



<p>The development studio thanked players who gave the game a chance, but ultimately admitted the game did not find the audience it was looking for. </p>



<p>“King of Meat, the game has unfortunately not found the audience we hoped for. As a result, we have made the difficult decision to conclude our investment in the game, and King of Meat’s servers will close on April 9, 2026,” <a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the statement</a> reads.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Co-Creator Thinks New CEO Is There To Sunset Xbox Brand]]></title>

<p>Seamus Blackley believes the recent changes at Microsoft Gaming are intended to sunset the Xbox brand.</p>



<p>Seamus Blackley was a game developer who helped create the original Xbox, which launched 25 years ago. In the last quarter-century, the Xbox brand has reached the heights and fallen quite far from that perch.</p>







<h2 id="h-seamus-blackley-thinks-xbox-s-end-is-near">Seamus Blackley Thinks Xbox’s End Is Near</h2>



<p>Recently, Microsoft Gaming underwent a massive restructuring,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-sarah-bond-resigns/" id="178338"> with Phil Spencer retiring</a> and Asha Sharma becoming the new CEO. Now, Blackley is speaking out about why he believes this move will ultimately spell the end for the Xbox brand.</p>



<p><a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with GamesBeat</a>, Blackley explained that he believes many Microsoft businesses that aren’t related to the CoreAI business, the department that Sharma worked at previously, are being sunsetted. As such, he believes that Sharma’s role is to move the Xbox brand out of the picture.</p>



<p>“Xbox, like a lot of businesses that aren’t the core AI business, is being sunsetted,” he said. “They don’t say that, but that’s what’s happening. I expect that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, her job is going to be as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night. It just seems really true.”</p>







<h2 id="h-asha-sharma-s-public-stance-has-been-polar-opposite">Asha Sharma’s Public Stance Has Been Polar Opposite</h2>



<p>Publicly, Asha Sharma, who officially assumed her duties today after the announcement on Friday, February 20, has touted a rebirth of the Xbox brand. She claims that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asha-sharmas-full-memo-following-promotion-to-ceo-of-microsoft-gaming/" id="178373">she’s focused on revitalizing the brand</a> and recommitting to core Xbox players. A social media account tied to her has even been hearing out fans’ suggestions, including<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-xbox-ceo-responds-to-fans-desire-for-console-exclusives/" id="178442"> a return to console-exclusive games.</a></p>



<p>Everything is still fresh regarding the changes at Microsoft, but time will tell whether this is a reset or the sunset for the Xbox brand. Another thing that’s fresh is Asha Sharma’s gamer profile. Learn more about that, and why it’s set off some alarms for players, at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-ceo-profile-one-month-old-suspicious/" id="178467">this link.</a></p>
