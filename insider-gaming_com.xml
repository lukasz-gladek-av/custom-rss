<h4>Weapons</h4>



<blockquote>
<p>We have another adjustment to the Akita ScorchLink Akimbo that partially adds back its original damage penalty. While we prefer not to take such an aggressive approach to tuning content, especially so frequently and so quickly after it becomes available, the release timing and general nature of the dual Akitas presented an unusual case, so we decided an accelerated set of changes was the best course of action heading into the holidays.</p>
