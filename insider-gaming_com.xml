<p>Among all the other guns in the SMG category, the Tanto .22 stands out with a slow rate of fire but hard-hitting capabilities in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>. To get the best out of the gun, you must use the ideal attachments, perks, and equipment to support your gameplay.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-tanto-22-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-equipment-for-tanto-22">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-tanto-22-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best Tanto .22 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Compensator</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Short Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Under Barrel</strong>: Ranger Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: CQB Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Balanced Stock</li>
</ul>



<p>The mentioned attachments will give you the best mobility while using the Tanto .22 in multiplayer lobbies. The <strong>Compensator</strong> will reduce the vertical recoil to improve accuracy while the <strong>Short Barrel</strong> will enhance in-air handling by improving Jumping Aim Down Sight and Jumping Sprint to Fire speeds.</p>



<p><strong>Ranger Foregrip</strong> will greatly improve Horizontal Recoil Control and slightly improve Sprinting Movement Speed. Use the <strong>CQB Grip</strong> to dominate in close-range combat as it significantly boosts Dive To Fire, Slide to Fire, and Sprint to Fire Speeds, making it a perfect attachment to use Omnimovement in the best way possible.</p>



<p>Lastly, use the <strong>Balanced Stock</strong> for maximum mobility as it will improve Aim Walking, Hipfire, and Strafing Movement speeds.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-tanto-22">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for Tanto .22</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Enforcer</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>Use <strong>Dexterity</strong> to reduce weapon motion while jumping, sliding, and diving while taking less fall damage. The <strong>Assassin</strong> perk will mark enemies with kill streaks on the minimap.</p>



<p><strong>Double Time</strong> significantly increases the Tactical Sprint, which is essential when multiple enemies are nearby. These three perks will activate the <strong>Enforcer</strong> specialty which grants a temporary buff to your movement speed and health regeneration rate upon killing enemies.</p>



<p>Coming to the Wildcard, during the initial levels you can use Tactical Expert (it gives you two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/#h-all-equipment-in-black-ops-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tactical equi</a>pment) but once you level up, get the <strong>Perk Greed</strong> to equip an extra Perk.</p>



<p><strong>Semtex</strong> and <strong>Stim Shots</strong> are a must when you’re running the Tanto .22 for quick damage and heal-up. I’d say the Field Upgrade is a personal choice. For me, I find the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> useful as it grants me free kills from time to time.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-tanto-22">Best Secondary for Tanto .22</h2>



<p>The <strong>Stryder .22</strong> is one of the best secondary weapons for the submachine gun. Want to finish off enemies when they are at one HP, use the Stryder to get the job done.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-tanto-22-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock Tanto .22 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Reach <strong>player level 16</strong> to unlock the Tanto .22 SMG in Black Ops 6. This is easy to achieve – all you need to do is play the game. You can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">level up fast</a> by playing some multiplayer matches and fulfilling all the objectives.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-tanto-22-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the Tanto .22 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, despite being an SMG with a slow rate of fire, it’s an excellent choice for close and medium-range combat. You don’t have empty half of its magazine on a single enemy and is easy to control as well.</p>



<p>With the attachments mentioned above, you can achieve great mobility with the Tanto .22, making it hard for the enemies to knock you down.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-tanto-22-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the Tanto .22 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If the slow fire rate bothers you, go with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-jackal-pdw-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jackal PDW</a> SMG. It dominated lobbies during the beta and is equally impressive after the full release of the game.</p>



<p>And if you want to ditch the SMG route and choose hard-hitting Assault Rifles instead, then the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AK-74</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/">XMR</a> are two of the best guns to use.</p>

<p>Microsoft is a powerhouse of the gaming industry, and that much is certain. Most of that value has come from lucrative acquisitions that the company has made over the years, such as the snapping up of ZeniMax Media and, more recently, Activision Blizzard King. In a recent financial report, it was stressed that the tech titan now owns 20 franchises that have each exceeded <strong>$1 BILLION </strong>in revenue.</p>



<p>The ‘Annual Report 2024’ that was published by the firm recently outlines just how staggering Microsoft’s gaming portfolio has been – and continues to be. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-over-time">Over Time</h2>



<p>It’s worth stressing that many of the franchises Microsoft is referring to are decades old and have pieced together their lifetime revenue over <strong>many years</strong>. For instance, Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, Gears of War, Diablo, and Halo. Microsoft has little in the way of new IP under that umbrella, and even the gem of the collection – Call of Duty – was acquired after being on the market for more than 20 years.</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://microsoft.gcs-web.com/static-files/2e135de7-7104-4bca-b2c4-e584199eabeb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">snippet from the financial update</a> that was dug up <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/101314/xbox-has-20-video-game-franchises-that-have-earned-1-billion/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by TweakTown</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are bringing great games to more people on more devices. With our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, which closed October 2023, we’ve added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem. </p>



<p>We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1 billion in lifetime revenue—from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love—where, when, and how they want.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The financial update gassed up the Xbox Game Pass subscription service to no end, singing the praises of the paid-for platform that boasts ‘over 400 first- and third-party console and PC titles’. It’s not the be-all and end-all, though – the ecosystem’s cloud gaming platform was also spotlighted, even if competition is running rampant.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a dog-eat-dog world, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>This year, Microsoft’s gaming revenue increased by 39% – $6 billion – thanks to growth in Xbox content and services, it was revealed. Microsoft is putting a lot of faith in the recent ABK acquisition to further bolster growth going forward: <em>‘The acquisition will accelerate the growth in our gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud gaming.’</em></p>



<p>What’s your favourite Microsoft-backed franchise that has made more than $1 billion in its lifetime? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Undisputed, the first boxing game to be a smash hit in more than a decade, has just passed one million sales. It entered early access last year but was released in full on October 11, being scooped up and praised by boxing fans worldwide. In a recent interview, one of the founders of the developer, Steel City Interactive, spoke about this milestone and what’s coming next.</p>



<p>Esports has always been on the table for Undisputed, and it’s about time to realise that vision.;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-opportunities">New Opportunities</h2>



<p>The esports industry is dominated by shooters, MOBA games, and the FGC. Typically, sports-based titles aren’t all that popular where esports are concerned, and that’s mostly because the real-world examples of these sports are there and readily available. It’s not possible to watch <strong>real-world shootouts </strong>unfold on a competitive level now, is it?</p>



<p>Despite that, Steel City Interactive is ready and willing to make Undisputed one of the next best esports games.</p>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/undisputed-hit-an-indie-made-boxing-game-featuring-real-fighters-has-just-sold-1m-copies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Ash Habib, one of Steel City’s founders, spoke about the competitive future of Undisputed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Esports was part of the original vision for the game. </p>



<p>I didn’t want the esport element to feel like a bolt-on or something that needed doing separately. With that in mind, we partnered with the WBC, where there will be an esport element where you can actually win a physical WBC belt, given by Mauricio Sulaimán, who is the president himself. So esports is in our plans, and will form a big part of Undisputed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Recently, we sat down with Ash Habib to learn about the ins and outs of this marvellous new boxing game that has been turning heads for years.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>One million sales are just the start for Undisputed. If the game can generate a popular enough esports ecosystem, it’ll be in a league of its own, as there’s nothing else to compete with it at present.</p>
