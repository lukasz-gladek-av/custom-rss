<p>We never thought it would return. But get ready, because Verdansk is coming to Warzone 2. Long-time fans are worried it won‚Äôt feature Superstore or other famous POIs, so we‚Äôre here today to answer any questions regarding its hotspots.</p>



<p>Call of Duty Warzone 2 is the successor to Warzone Caldera. It‚Äôs kept the CoD battle royale boat afloat for a couple of years now, but it‚Äôs taken some damage in recent times. Some have even labeled it as a sinking ship. Warzone‚Äôs lessening impact is getting so concerning that a potential <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone 3 is in danger</a>, as is the potential future of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-warzone-being-shut-down-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone shutting down</a> altogether.</p>



<p>Warzone was once arguably the battle royale powerhouse of the world. It needs a serious injection of players to kickstart the excitement again, and a fully-loaded Verdansk armed with classic POIs could be what it needs.</p>

<p><strong>Warzone 2‚Äôs Verdansk map will feature most POIs from the original including Atlas Superstore, Storage Town, Prison, and many more.</strong></p>



<p>We learned a little while back we‚Äôre getting ‚Äú<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-to-warzone-og-march-2020-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pretty Much the OG March 2020 Version</a>‚Äù of Verdansk. I couldn‚Äôt imagine Activision dropping a version of Verdansk no one wants, or even Verdansk ‚Äô84. So, get ready for what appears to be the complete, classic Verdansk experience.</p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/WZStatsGG/status/1895902878293692854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warzone Meta</a>, here‚Äôs every POI leaked so far, with more presumably to come:</p>



<ul>
<li>Atlas Superstore</li>



<li>Block 17</li>



<li>Block 23</li>



<li>Boneyard</li>



<li>Coast</li>



<li>Gora Bridge</li>



<li>Gora Tunnel</li>



<li>Gora Village</li>



<li>Grazna Bridge</li>



<li>Great Bridge</li>



<li>Jarvdinsk Spomenik</li>



<li>Karst Bridge</li>



<li>Krovnik Farmland</li>



<li>Lozoff Pass</li>



<li>Novi Grazna Hills</li>



<li>Prison</li>



<li>Storage Town</li>



<li>Styor Memorial</li>



<li>Zhokov Boneyard</li>
</ul>



<p>Some notable favorites are missing for the time being. Dam is absent, as is Airport and many others, but Verdansk is gigantic, so this is likely an incomplete inventory. We expect more details to leak ahead of its much-hyped return to Call of Duty and Warzone.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-verdansk-returning-to-warzone">When is Verdansk Returning to Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>Verdansk returns to Call of Duty courtesy of Warzone 2 Season 3 on April 3.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-officially-returning-to-call-of-duty-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk is returning to Call of Duty Warzone next month</a>. The official Call of Duty X account had a message for everyone on March 10: ‚ÄúAs we celebrate Call of Duty: Warzone‚Äôs 5 Year Anniversary, it‚Äôs time to revisit a place of unforgettable memories. Verdansk returns to Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3.‚Äù</p>

<p>Whatever your thoughts on Verdansk or how it will be received, this is no doubt a special time for CoD Warzone users. Expect a huge influx of players looking to lap up the initial nostalgia.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-people-are-playing-warzone-right-now-player-count-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Warzone player count</a> drops off as the days and weeks pass.</p>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege X‚Äôs changes to UI, map reworks, and new skins have appeared online due to a new leak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-leak-first-look-seasons-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, new details about Rainbow Six Seige X have leaked ahead of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showcase planned for March 13</a>. The leaks arrived from the Rainbow Six Leaks Discord server, giving players an idea of how the upcoming game could look. Moreover, these leaked images appear to be from an early game build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding UI, Siege X has added a new label for ‚ÄòOperation Prep Phase‚Äô at the right-hand corner of the screen. Players will also find additions of a ‚Äòbattle pass progression tracker‚Äô and a ‚Äòchallenge system‚Äô. Players should know that all these elements are subject to change with the game‚Äôs final build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following leaked image for Siege X provides players with a look at the type of skins we might see. The skin showcased is Valkyrie‚Äôs Paragon Elite skin, which also has a matching Black Eye camera skin. Lastly, Chalet and Border Maps appear revamped, and the leaked images show enhancements towards the lighting in these environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that none of the information revealed through the leaks has been confirmed officially by Ubisoft and is subject to change with the final game build. Players will receive more concrete information during the dedicated Siege X showcase on March 13.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Siege X might feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-will-feature-a-6v6-mode-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 6v6 mode</a>. Also, Rainbow Six Siege remains <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-rainbow-six-siege-top-esports-game-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a top esports title</a> after being in the market for a decade.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-officially-extraction-shooter-evolving/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare-is-officially-an-extraction-shooter-and-it%E2%80%99s-evolving-in-2025.1130835/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-officially-extraction-shooter-evolving/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When Gray Zone Warfare was released in April 2024, it was penned as being ‚Äòan intense tactical FPS‚Äô with some extraction elements mixed in. In the months that followed, changes were deployed, and updates were rolled out, evolving the game immeasurably in its first year on the market.</p>



<p>I‚Äôve caught up with the developers at MADFINGER Games on multiple occasions, and during my most recent chat with the team, I learned that they‚Äôre now perfectly happy to call Gray Zone Warfare an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>But it‚Äôs more than that ‚Äì it‚Äôs the <strong>world‚Äôs first open-world extraction shooter</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-evolutionary-year">An Evolutionary Year</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare has <strong>stacks </strong>planned for the year ahead. The developers have worked tirelessly with the community to introduce a long line of changes and upgrades to improve the senses of immersion, challenge, and engagement in the fictional world of Lamang.</p>



<p>It might have blown by the average fan, but Gray Zone Warfare‚Äôs core description on Steam was updated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-whats-next/">at the end of 2024</a> to reflect the new attitude towards the game. It went from being described as an intense tactical FPS to being dubbed an open-world extraction shooter emphasising realism.</p>



<p>That was the first indication of MADFINGER‚Äôs pivot, but my recent chat with Rick Lagnese, the PR and Communications Director at the firm, set the story straight. The developer is now on board with being branded an extraction shooter, and it‚Äôs now striving to redefine what that tag means.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs something that I learned first-hand <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when I spoke to Marek Rabas</a>, MADFINGER‚Äôs CEO, at Gamescom 2024. </p>



<p>In recent years, we‚Äôve seen plenty of extraction shooters emerge and then fall flat. Some have been extinguished after mere weeks on the market, but Gray Zone Warfare has continued to innovate and exceed expectations after almost a year. There‚Äôs a dedicated community supporting the ongoing evolution of the game, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-roadmap-revealed/">the roadmap</a> is looking <strong>tasty</strong>.</p>



<p>If you‚Äôve not played Gray Zone Warfare and you‚Äôre a fan of extraction shooters, now is the time to get on board. There are major changes lined up that are set to challenge the existing paradigm and alter the gameplay loop.</p>



<p>I‚Äôll have all the latest for you in the coming days.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-current-player-count/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-finals-current-player-count%E2%80%94how-many-people-are-playing-the-finals-in-2025.1130817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-current-player-count/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Finals burst onto the scene with its unique blend of map destruction, arcade-like gameplay, and blaring sounds and visuals, but let‚Äôs look at The Finals‚Äô player count in 2025.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs so hard for new shooters in the live-service online multiplayer sphere to stand out. Call of Duty rules the roost, and the likes of Marvel Rivals, Fortnite, and Overwatch own large market share segments. So it was quite the feat for The Finals when it arrived in 2023 to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge acclaim and hefty player numbers</a>. This was despite reservations and emerging details of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-use-of-ai-isnt-going-away-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI use in The Finals</a>.</p>



<p>The first few weeks of a hyped multiplayer title are usually the best. Everyone checks in to see what it‚Äôs about, how it plays, and numbers eventually dwindle. So we‚Äôre here to analyze The Finals‚Äô player count numbers to see how it‚Äôs faring.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-finals-player-count-in-2025">The Finals Player Count in 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a scene. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Using Steam Charts, we can see February 2025 had an average of 11,760 players in The Finals‚Äîreaching a peak of 19,499 users.</strong></p>



<p>The first thing to note about The Finals player count numbers is <strong>this doesn‚Äôt factor in PlayStation or Xbox users</strong>. There‚Äôs no reliable piece of software capable of telling us this data, and it‚Äôs been this way for years. It‚Äôs baffling‚Äîgiven this age of technology‚Äîbut this is the reality.</p>



<p>Any official figures come from <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/2073850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Finals‚Äô Steam Charts page</a>, and this has the game‚Äôs monthly figures going back to its December 2023 launch. The Finals achieved its <strong>all-time peak of 242,399 players</strong> during its debut month. Compared to its most recent month (as of writing), its <strong>recent monthly peaks are nearly 90% down since launch</strong>.</p>



<p>It took just two months for The Finals player count numbers to see a huge drop-off. From December 2023 to February 2024, the shooter went from <strong>120,211 players on averag</strong>e to <strong>24,848</strong>. </p>



<p>March 2024 saw an average of <strong>21,712</strong> in-game users, and the monthly average has <strong>never gotten back over 20K</strong>.</p>



<p>This makes it all sound negative, but for a relatively new shooter in a feisty market, it‚Äôs doing well. The last few months have seen a <strong>peak</strong> of nearly 20,00 players or more, and it continues to tick along. Remember, this doesn‚Äôt include PlayStation or Xbox figures, meaning there‚Äôs still a fair few thousands logging in each month.</p>



<p>The start of 2025 has been slightly worrying though. <strong>The Finals has dipped below 12K</strong>, and continues to dwindle month by month. With more seasons and content on the way, these figures should receive a new boost every so often.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-finals-worth-playing-in-2025">Is The Finals Worth Playing in 2025?</h2>



<p><strong>The Finals‚Äô gameplay and nuances make it worth playing in 2025, but it could depend on Battlefield 6‚Äôs success.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a> showed no matter how tight your game is, if there‚Äôs not enough content, players don‚Äôt like it, or other games are doing it better, people won‚Äôt play. I think The Finals has a terrific niche in its <strong>level destructibility</strong>‚Äîa unique selling point mastered only by the Battlefield series.</p>



<p>EA‚Äôs Battlefield has been absent and fairly anonymous for several years, due to the failings of Battlefield 2042. But Battlefield 6 AKA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2025</a> is currently testing the waters with its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-first-playtest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> program. Pre-release footage has already shown destruction is the name of the game, and EA and DICE want their crown back.</p>



<p>The Finals is free-to-play, which always makes it a great bargain. However, with more games coming out, and Battlefield on the way, Embark might have to do something special if The Finals‚Äô player count monthly numbers continue to diminish, and Battlefield 6 makes a huge splash. </p>



<p><strong>I recommend playing The Finals while you can, because it might not be around forever given today‚Äôs toxic and volatile climate.</strong></p>



<hr>



<p>We have the 2025 player count figures for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-people-are-playing-warzone-right-now-player-count-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Warzone</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-player-count-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite‚Äôs numbers</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-player-count-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> players this year too.</p>



<p>I‚Äôve been quite surprised by The Finals‚Äô success and longevity so far. Do you think it has the potential to reach the next level? Or is it solid enough to maintain The Finals player count enough to help it stay in a crowded online scene? Drop a comment and share your thoughts.</p>
