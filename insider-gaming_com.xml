<p>It has been claimed that Riot Games is preparing to make a major change to its sponsorship policies as we head into 2025. It was recently rumoured that the company will allow a limited number of gambling companies to sponsor esports teams in League of Legends and VALORANT, after spending many years standing firm against that very concept.</p>



<p>Most recently, in 2023, the gaming titan issued a statement confirming that there were no plans to change these policies <strong>but </strong>it would continue to ‘evaluate all opportunities’ in the sponsorship space. </p>



<p>Is a cultural shift on the horizon?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-the-money-is">Where The Money Is</h2>



<p>Esports betting makes up around half of the industry’s total revenue, while the other half is comprised of ticket sales, sponsorship deals, broadcast rights, merchandise sales, and other investments. It’s a money maker of a business, and that’s why so many esports organisations partner with gambling and betting brands.</p>



<p>On social media, the user ‘MonteCristo’ posted a claim that Riot will alter long-standing policies to allow betting sponsors to align with League of Legends and VALORANT teams going into 2025:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Riot will be allowing esports teams to have betting sponsors in League of Legends and VALORANT in 2025.

Gambling companies interested in sponsoring teams will have to be approved by Riot and will not be allowed to place logos on team uniforms.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Historically, some of the most prolific brands in esports betting have partnered with or sponsored organisations. The likes of GG.BET, Pinnacle, Betway, Parimatch, and 1xBet have all secured visible positions in the esports industry alongside some of the most valuable tournaments in the business.</p>



<p>It’s not too far-fetched to imagine that Riot Games wants in on that action, but it would come at the cost of some morality points.</p>



<p>For now, this is a rumour and should be treated accordingly, but I have reached out to representatives of Riot Games to try and grab a more concrete statement on the matter.</p>



<p>What do you think of this rumour? Can you see it materialising? Let us know in the comments.</p>
