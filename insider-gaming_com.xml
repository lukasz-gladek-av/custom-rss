<p>Jake Paul is joining the Undisputed boxing roster. Developer Steel City Interactive announced on Thursday that Paul will be joining the game as part of The Problem Child DLC pack on December 12.</p>



<p>“Jake’s influence on modern boxing is undeniable. His meteoric rise has introduced a whole new generation to the sport, especially those who have followed him from a YouTube phenomenon to a legitimate boxing contender,” Founder and CEO of Steel City Interactive Ash Habib said via release.</p>







<p>“I’ve been breaking barriers and making history in real life, so it’s only fitting that I bring the same energy to Undisputed. This isn’t just about being in a video game; it’s about inspiring a new generation of fans to step into the ring—virtually and in real life,” Paul said.</p>



<p>To get Paul into Undisputed, the developers at Steel City Interactive did full motion capture at their UK-based studio. </p>



<p>“The Steel City team nailed every detail, from my moves to my swag, and I can’t wait for players to test their skills,” Paul said.</p>



<p>In addition to Paul, The Problem Child DLC pack will feature six more fighters, including: Zhilei Zhang, James ‘Buster’ Douglas, Otto Wallin, Erik Morales, Marco Antonio Barrera, &amp; Juan Manuel Marquez.</p>



<p>As of writing, no price for the DLC pack has been announced. As far as future additions go, Insider Gaming has heard of a few names the studio has had talks with that were either close to a deal or have signed a deal that hasn’t been announced yet. Paul was one of those names, and there are others that, while can’t be said yet, are pretty obvious fighters to be added in future DLC.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is just an Overwatch clone. That’s what former Blizzard President Mike Ybarra seemed to suggest in a post on social media on Wednesday (December 4).</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1864450732054675950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his post</a>, Ybarra called the game “Overwatch Marvel Rivals” while making comparisons to a recently announced game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looks similar to Horizon Zero Dawn</a>.</p>



<p>“Looks like Overwatch Marvel Rivals ships tomorrow,” Ybarra said. “Much like Light of Motiram (a clear copy of HZD) out of China. I mean even the character name – Widowmaker in OW vs. Black Widow in Marvel Rivals lol. NetEase/TenCent – all the same.”</p>







<p>Of course, one part of his comment that stood out was comparing Overwatch’s Widowmaker to Marvel’s Black Widow. It’s unclear to tell through text whether that was a legitimate criticism, but users on Twitter were quick to use the community note feature on the post.</p>



<p>Black Widow, for those that don’t know, first debuted in 1964. That puts the character 52 years older than Widowmaker. Again, however, it’s hard to tell if that comparison was serious or made in jest. That said, he has made other posts in relation to the game without addressing the comparison.</p>
