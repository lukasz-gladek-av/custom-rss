<p>Verdansk is reportedly returning to Warzone during Season 3, which will be around mid-April 2025.</p>



<p>That’s according to TheGhostofHope, who has accurately leaked Call of Duty details in the past.</p>



<p>Taking to X (formerly Twitter), <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1878501659413754048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hope replied</a> to someone asking him to “leak Verdansk to wake them [Activision] up,” to which Hope replied, “S3,” referring to Season 3.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming first heard that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-map-verdansk-return-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk would return in December 2023</a>, which was said to be a move directly following the success of OG Fortnite, where Epic Games brought back the game’s original map with tremendous success. Originally slated for a December 2024 release, the map would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-verdansk-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed to Spring 2025</a>. </p>



<p>Activision confirmed the leaks in August 2024 during CODNEXT, where it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-warzone-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk would return in 2025</a>. Hope’s tweet suggests that we will not be getting it during Season 2, and instead in Season 3, meaning that we’re still a few months away from release. </p>



<p>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 1 lasted 70 days, suggesting that we’ll get the return of Verdansk around mid-April, unless the map is released during a mid-Season update, which would come around late May.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdansk-took-call-of-duty-to-new-heights">Verdansk Took Call of Duty to New Heights</h2>



<p>First released in 2020, Verdansk and Call of Duty Warzone took the Call of Duty franchise to new heights. The game, which was the first free-to-play Call of Duty ever was a tremendous success with Call of Duty players and saw the game reach its highest concrruent player numbers in history.Revenue also followed, making Activision billions of dollars in revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Following the successful release of OG Fortnite, which saw Fortnite’s player base revived, Activision are seemingly hoping that Verdansk will have similar results. </p>



<p>But as of the time of writing, Call of Duty has had serious issues with bugs and hackers, making the game unplayable to most. So here’s hoping that those issues will be squashed before the release of Verdansk.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk’s return</a>?

<p>The heavily rumored Hatsune Miku Fortnite skin has leaked online and players are not happy with the design.</p>



<p>Hatsune Miku’s Fortnite skin came courtesy of Fortnite leaker and dataminer <a href="https://x.com/Wensoing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@Wensoing</a>, who posted the images over on their X (formerly Twitter) account. You can see the skin below: </p>



<div><article><p><span>dread it. run from it. destiny arrives all the same. and now it’s here.</span></p></article></div>



<p>According to the dataminer, Miku will also have a Fortnite Lego skin, but images are yet to be posted online.</p>



<p>Despite the rumored skin having fans wondering when it will come for months, fans of Hatsune Miku seem to be somewhat disappointed by how the skin looks, with many criticizing how her face looks in-game. </p>



<p>“That face is so wrong lol. The rest is very solid but it’s incredibly distracting at how off the face is,” said Reddit user suika_melon. “looks nothing like her official models,” said LolcatP. </p>



<p>Fortnite Festival launches on January 14, 2026, and brings local multiplayer for the first time.</p>



<p>“Get the band back together on January 14! The launch of Festival Season 7 comes with a new local multiplayer feature on Xbox and PlayStation! In a local play session of Festival Main Stage, up to four players can play together on the same console,” the official gamer description of Fortnite Festival Season 7 reads.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Fortnite Festival on Jan 14th? What do you think of the new Hatsune Miku skin? Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Pokemon GO developers have revealed that support for 32-bit Android devices will be discontinued in 2025. The list of affected devices is below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/32-bit-android-discontinued-support-2025?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Pokemon GO devs revealed that support for 32-bit Android devices will be stopped to “streamline” their development process and shift resources to support “newer operating systems and technologies.” After the upcoming update, only 32-bit Android devices will be affected; 64-bit and iOS users don’t have to do anything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From March 2025, Pokemon GO will no longer be accessible for 32-bit users who downloaded the game from the Samsung Galaxy Store. Support for players who downloaded the game from the Google Play Store will end in June 2025. After this date, players will not be able to access their Pokemon GO accounts, items, or PokéCoins once the update is live. They must log in with the same credentials on a new 64-bit device to continue playing the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is a list of 32-bit Android devices that you won’t be able to play Pokemon GO on in the near future:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Samsung Galaxy S4, S5, Note 3, J3</li>



<li>Sony Xperia Z2, Z3</li>



<li>Motorola Moto G (1st generation)</li>



<li>LG Fortune, Tribute</li>



<li>OnePlus One</li>



<li>HTC One (M8)</li>



<li>ZTE Overture 3</li>



<li>Certain Android devices released before 2015</li>
</ul>

<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 developers Larian Studios have shifted the team’s entire focus to their next game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While speaking to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/baldurs-gate-3-devs-shift-full-attention-to-their-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Video Gamer</a>, Baldur’s Gate 3 devs stated, “Swen and the team[‘s]… full attention is focused on crafting their next title”. The report also reveals that the development studio will be entering a “media blackout” until further notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, Swen Vincke, the CEO of Larian, spoke about the studio’s journey in a new post on <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1877608305452892504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, stating that there’s much more to come from them in the future. While reposting the “Larian Studios: From Bankruptcy To Baldur’s Gate 3” YouTube video, Vincke stated that it has been “an incredible journey so far. But the story isn’t over yet. Stay Tuned.”</p>



<p>Back in March 2024, Baldur’s Gate 3 devs revealed that they <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-baldurs-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would not be working on a DLC or sequel</a> for the series but on something “new.” Since then, it has been revealed that Larian Studios is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-is-working-on-two-new-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently working on two new projects</a> while continuing to provide support to 2023’s game of the year.</p>



<p>If you are worried about the next Baldur’s Gate title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-4-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hasbro has expressed interest in creating it</a>. However, they are in the process of finding the right partners to develop the franchise’s next entry. Baldur’s Gate 3 actors have also shown interest in working <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-actors-interested-in-new-dd-game-or-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a new Dungeons and Dragons game or movie</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Helldivers 2’s creative director has revealed how involved Arrowhead Game Studios will be with the upcoming movie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-movie-arrowhead-wont-have-final-say" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VG247</a>, Johan Pilestedt recently posted a photo of the Helldivers 2 team having a meal together on <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1877764599409221678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). In the comment section of this post, the creative director was asked whether Arrowhead would be involved in the upcoming Helldivers movie’s production. Pilestedt responded, “The short answer is yes. The long answer is that we’ll see.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pilestedt added that Arrowhead Studios are game developers and not “Hollywood people,” so they are unaware of “what it takes to make a movie.” The director concluded by stating, “Therefore, we don’t, and shouldn’t, have the final say” in the production of the upcoming Helldivers movie.&nbsp;</p>
