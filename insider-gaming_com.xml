            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The BLAST R6 Munich Major concluded in dramatic fashion in Germany, with M80 devastating Team Falcons with a 3-1 finish during the Grand Final. The victory secured M80 a massive $250,000 cut of the prize pool <strong>and </strong>direct qualification for next year’s Six Invitational tournament, the biggest event in Rainbow Six esports.</p>



<p>M80 commanded control of the final fixture, with Team Falcons firing back on just one map, and even that was a close finish that went down to the final round as a decider.</p>



<h2 id="h-m80-secures-top-spot-in-munich">M80 Secures Top Spot in Munich</h2>



<p>This is a monumental moment for North America as M80 stands up and collects a Major trophy in the Rainbow Six Siege esports scene. Team Falcons put up one hell of a fight and had a stellar run, but M80 proved to be the rock that broke open the hull of Falcons.</p>



<p>M80 has ticked a major box and qualified for the Six Invitational, which is the most important event in the Rainbow Six space. The Six Invitational will be held in Paris, France, and it will feature a multi-million-dollar prize pool.</p>



<p>This is now an even more insane record for M80’s Fabian ‘<strong>Fabian</strong>‘ Hällsten, a 31-year-old competitor-turned-coach who has achieved a stunning number of accolades in his many years in the Rainbow Six space:</p>



<ul>
<li>Six Invitational 2018</li>



<li>Six Invitational 2019</li>



<li>Six Invitational 2023</li>



<li>Dreamhack Winter 2018</li>



<li>Pro League Year 2 Season 1</li>



<li>Pro League Year 2 Season 2</li>



<li>Six Major Paris 2018</li>



<li>South Korean League 2024</li>



<li>North American League 2025</li>



<li><strong>Munich Major 2025</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>In 2023, Fabian also coached G2 Esports to success at the Six Invitational, but in 2025, a drastically poor finish left the veteran so far down the leaderboard, he might as well have not bothered attending the tournament.</p>



<p>Will 2026 bring about a redemption tale for Fabian? It also has the potential for M80 to give it a solid run and end up higher than ever before, a seventh-place finish.</p>



<p>I had the pleasure of attending the BLAST R6 Manchester Major in 2024, when the M80 crew, then playing under the beastcoast banner, beat BTS in a dramatic grand final that blew the roof off the venue. This event told a similar story.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-all-time-high/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-just-hit-another-all-time-high-even-as-black-ops-7-and-tarkov-launch.1355245/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders, the exhilarating extraction shooter from Embark Studios, is still going from strength to strength. Today, the title hit a new all-time high player count on Steam, pushing ever higher and continuing to hold a solid bar for the genre. As time goes on, ARC Raiders is only getting stronger, even with the arrival of Black Ops 7 <strong>and </strong>Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Not only that, but ARC Raiders maintains a phenomenal track record in terms of user ratings, boasting a score of 88% on Steam from more than 100,000 reviews.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-won-t-slow-down">ARC Raiders Won’t Slow Down</h2>



<p>There’s no stopping ARC Raiders. It was thought that the 1.0 launch of Escape from Tarkov might halt ARC Raiders where it stands, but even that wasn’t enough to pull hundreds of thousands of players out of Embark’s all-new extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the game recorded a peak player count of 481,966 users, a new high and a stunning figure for any extraction shooter. By numbers, ARC Raiders is the most popular and successful extraction shooter ever made, and it’s <strong>dominating </strong>the genre.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>As this article was written, ARC Raiders was the third-most popular game on Steam, beaten only by Valve’s titans, Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2. It has topped Call of Duty, Battlefield 6, Marvel Rivals, PUBG, and Where Winds Meet this weekend with ease. </p>







<p>There’s plenty in the pipeline for ARC Raiders. Embark Studios has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-2025-roadmap/">promised a hefty roadmap</a> for the title, which already covers November and December. Next month, we’ll get the Cold Snap update, which brings new map conditions, a new legendary weapon, a fresh Raider Deck, and <strong>much more</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-metacritic-user-rating/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-%E2%80%98series-low%E2%80%99-metacritic-user-rating.1355170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>While it does have an 84 critic score on Metacritic, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is not faring well with its user rating. The reviews, while not all serious, do touch on several notes like the reported usage of AI and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-reddit-reactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a disappointing campaign</a>.</p>







<p>Black Ops 7,&nbsp;which released last week, hasn’t had the best launch. While praise is there to the multiplayer and zombies, the game is in some hot water. First off, fans called out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-accused-of-using-generative-ai-art-for-black-ops-7-calling-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the usage of AI</a> for player calling cards and assets, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision has responded to</a>. Second, the campaign, fully co-op, has gotten a lot of flak for being absurd and far from the supposed series standard. With this, it’s not surprising that the game is not faring well with users on Metacritic, which is a series low.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/user-reviews/?platform=pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a>, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 currently has an 84 critic score with 16 reviews. However, the user rating, which has more than 540 reviews, is not as great. As of writing, its score is 1.6 out of 10. 2023’s Modern Warfare 3, which is one of the lowest-scoring Call of Dutys with a 56 critic score, still has a higher user rating with a 2.3.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that this number is likely to change as some reviews may be spam and as more longtime players get to it. Still, it’s not a great look for the franchise. Unfortunately, it looks like the damage has already been done, as Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hasn’t even reached 100k players</a> on Steam, while competitors like Battlefield and ARC Raiders consistently get over 200k. Whether Activision and the teams will address some of the problems is unknown. Hopefully, the next games will do a better job of satisfying fans and critics.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Partner Showcase Announcement Soon, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-partner-showcase-announcement-claim-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-partner-showcase-announcement-soon-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1355161/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a credible source, an Xbox Partner Showcase announcement is coming soon. A presentation was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-reportedly-has-a-partner-preview-event-scheduled-for-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored a while ago</a> to happen in November, but it seems it may actually be true.</p>







<p>Also known as Xbox Partner Preview, the events are short but substantial presentations on games going to Xbox consoles. However, compared to Game Showcases, they consist of third-party titles from various companies. For example, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-partner-preview-october-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the last one</a>, which premiered in October 2024 had games like Cronos: The New Dawn, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and FBC: Firebreak. Last month, it was reported that Microsoft and Xbox were planning a new showcase, though details were thin. Now, it seems a prominent leaker has added some fuel to the fire.</p>



<h2 id="h-announcement-coming-very-soon-for-xbox-partner-showcase-claims-natethehate2">Announcement Coming ‘Very Soon’ for Xbox Partner Showcase, Claims NateTheHate2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The claim comes from notable leaker <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1989885666679718304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NateTheHate2</a>, whose track record has been quite good. From multiple <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-direct-will-take-place-in-september-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Directs</a> to full games, the leaker does have a solid track record. Nevertheless, in response to a question regarding a future Partner Showcase, NateTheHate2 said that an announcement is coming ‘very soon’. As for when exactly that may be, we still don’t know. </p>



<p>The most likely date is early this week, as one of the games supposedly there, Silent Hill 2 Remake, is releasing this week, and no official announcement of the game’s port has been revealed yet. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-store-leaks-silent-hill-2-xbox-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An Xbox Store listing</a> for the PS5 title popped up earlier this month with a release date of November 21st, 2025. If true, we could get an announcement tomorrow with a Wednesday date or Tuesday with a Thursday date. Either way, it seems all signs are pointing to a Partner Showcase sooner rather than later.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-split-screen/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/can-you-play-black-ops-7-campaign-in-split-screen-all-blops-7-campaign-split-screen-co-op-options-explained.1355068/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Black Ops 7 brings back Call of Duty campaign co-op for the first time in a long time. You can experience Treyarch’s newest story offering with other players, but there’s some uncertainty surrounding Black Ops 7 and split-screen multiplayer for the campaign.</p>



<p>You might have heard one or two interesting things about the Black Ops 7 campaign. It’s true that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/you-cant-pause-the-black-ops-7-campaign-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can’t pause the Black Ops 7 campaign, ever</a>. There is also the odd suggestion of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-skibidi-toilet-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">giant Skibidi Toilet Boss</a>—don’t adjust your glasses or wipe your phone, you read that right.</p>



<p>But let’s see if any of this matters due to a potential lack of local split-screen multiplayer in Black Ops 7.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-7-campaign-split-screen">Is Black Ops 7 Campaign Split-Screen?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A unit, to an extent. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Despite the Black Ops 7 campaign being capable of co-op, this feature is restricted to online only, meaning you can’t play the campaign in local co-op split-screen.</strong></p>



<p>You can enjoy the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 campaign with friends, but you have to do it through online multiplayer. BLOPS 7’s campaign is an online-only experience for the first time, which might prove finicky where local co-op is concerned.</p>



<p>If you want to tackle the story’s main missions and reach the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-skip-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Endgame</a>, you’ll either have to do so by yourself or online with other players.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-players-can-play-black-ops-7-campaign">How Many Players Can Play Black Ops 7 Campaign?</h2>



<p><strong>Up to 4 players can team up in Black Ops 7 campaign multiplayer, which is made easier because you all have your own screen to see.</strong></p>



<p>4-player local split-screen is seldom seen in modern gaming. It’s difficult to do, and presumably easier to code and develop with online multiplayer in mind. On the plus side, if you have three friends you want to spill blood, banter, and bullets with, the Black Ops 7 campaign allows you to.</p>



<p>If one or more of you need the game, we recommend you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/">use this link to buy Black Ops 7 for cheap!</a></p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-black-ops-7-campaign-co-op">How To Play Black Ops 7 Campaign Co-Op</h2>



<p><strong>You must invite one or more users to your party in Black Ops 7 to play the campaign in online co-op</strong>.</p>



<p>Like you would with a normal Call of Duty party, invite your friends to a private party, and once you have a squad of between 2-4 players, head into the Black Ops 7 campaign.</p>



<p>Whoever is the party leader will determine what you play: It could be main missions, or it could be Avalon!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-skibidi-toilet-boss/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-skibidi-toilet-boss%E2%80%94giant-boss-battle-meme-explained.1355053/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Skibidi Toilet meme is a sign of the times, and the popular meme has now spread to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. If you keep seeing Skibidi Toilet mentioned in the same breath as Black Ops 7, we’ll, unfortunately, explain why.</p>



<p>Like ourselves, I’m sure many of you could’ve gone your whole life without knowing what Skibidi Toilet was. With meme culture being as big as it is, evolving on a day-to-day basis, new memes and trends can sometimes pass in the blink of an eye. One that is fervently sticking around is Skibidi Toilet—yay.</p>







<p>The meme has piqued more interest than usual because of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ai-controversy-catches-attention-of-us-congressman-we-need-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>. A certain viral section of gameplay from the game has caused this.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-skibidi-toilet-boss-in-black-ops-7">What Is The Skibidi Toilet Boss In Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What were they thinking? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Skibidi Toilet Boss in Black Ops 7 refers to the Harper Boss Fight, where Mike Harper—part of the main protagonist team throughout the campaign—has a breakdown, due to a story revelation, and you end up briefly fighting your ally who has morphed into a giant, somewhat resembling the Skibidi Toilet meme.</strong></p>



<p>That’s a lot to take in, I know. But here are the basics:</p>



<ul>
<li>Harper learns the truth about something big that happened in the past. (<strong>Keeping it spoiler-free</strong>)</li>



<li>He drags the team into a weird vision/memory/hallucination.</li>



<li>The unstable Harper suddenly turns into a giant boss, where you can only see the top half of him.</li>



<li>To many on the internet, Harper looks like the Skibidi Toilet meme because it looks like his torso could be sticking out of a toilet.</li>
</ul>







<p>That’s it, that’s the meme. It’s unclear if this was intentional on Treyarch’s part or a complete accident. Either way, the encounter has gone down in infamy as the ‘Skibidi Toilet’ boss fight in Black Ops 7.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-where-does-skibidi-toilet-meme-come-from">Where Does Skibidi Toilet Meme Come From?</h2>



<p><strong>YouTuber DaFuq!?Boom! is the creator of the meme, which has since been replicated across all corners of the internet.</strong></p>



<p>As a boomer, I might not be down with the kids enough to explain this very well, so here’s an explanation courtesy of <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/skibidi-toilet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">KnowYourMeme</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Skibidi Toilet&nbsp;is a series of&nbsp;Source Filmmaker&nbsp;videos by YouTuber DaFuq!?Boom! featuring a remix of “Give It To Me” by Timbaland and&nbsp;“Dom Dom Yes Yes”&nbsp;by Biser King in which an army of toilets with men’s heads coming out of them are shown singing the song in various settings. The series follows a plot about the Skibidi Toilets taking over the world and men with cameras for heads known as CameraHeads fighting against them.”</p>
</blockquote>
