            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bethesda Game Studios recently unveiled an awesome new ‘Mojave Bundle’ to eager Fallout 76 players, especially those neck-deep in the second season of the television show, which comes to an end in under a week. The Mojave Bundle contains a kick-ass new power armor skin that replicates the recent one revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-more-than-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the TV series</a>, but there’s a huge catch.</p>



<p>Despite the Mojave Bundle boasting a few more cosmetics, some fans are outraged that it costs a whopping $30 – or £26.99, if you’re on the other side of the pond.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-vegas-ranger-power-armor-locked-behind-pay-barrier">New Vegas Ranger Power Armor Locked Behind Pay Barrier</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 players are contending with the revelation that one of the coolest suits of power armor ever added to the Fallout universe (let’s not get into <em>that </em>debate) is locked behind a hefty paywall.</p>



<p>If you want to acquire Fallout 76’s Mojave Bundle, you’ll need to part ways with $30 of your hard-earned cash. It’s not available to purchase using in-game currency (Atoms), nor do you get any kind of a discount for having a Fallout 1st <em>premium </em>subscription.</p>



<p>As a side note, check out why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-1st-removed-from-player-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 76 fans in Japan</a> are especially annoyed at Fallout 1st…</p>



<p>The Mojave Bundle comes with:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ranger Power Armor Paint</li>



<li>NCR Flag</li>



<li>New Vegas Neon Sign</li>



<li>Ad Victoriam (Super Sledge)</li>



<li>Legion Legate Outfit</li>



<li>Player Title Prefix</li>



<li>Player Title Prefix &amp; Suffix</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s not a tiny bundle by any means, but it’s 100% cosmetic and has a high price point, which is the core problem here. To put this into perspective, the base game currently costs under $10, so the cosmetic pack is more than three times the cost of the game (when it’s not on sale).</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Most people would be playing Fallout 76 via a paid-for subscription, like Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, so they’re even more unlikely to invest cash in the ecosystem to acquire a $30 cosmetic bundle.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, Bethesda <strong>pledged </strong><span>there would be no paid DLC for Fallout 76, then later unveiled Fallout 1st, which caused a bit of outrage by paywalling items many thought they should all&nbsp;</span>get, like the treasured stash box and survival tent mechanics.</p>



<p>Admittedly, every expansion to hit Fallout 76 thus far, including the recent Burning Springs expansion, has been <strong>completely free</strong>, so it could be argued that a $30 cosmetics bundle isn’t rocking the boat too much and should be eaten up nicely by the die-hard fans of the post-apocalyptic world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new claim states that PlayStation is developing an OLED version of the Portal, following the success of the original. </p>



<p>We have heard about several leaks about the upcoming PlayStation 6 handheld over the last year, with reports that it will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-handheld-console-will-be-dockable-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dockable</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not as powerful</a> as the PlayStation 5, and more surfacing online. Now, new information has surfaced online on the existing PlayStation handheld, the Portal. </p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-portal-oled-model-is-reportedly-in-development">PlayStation Portal OLED Model is Reportedly in Development</h2>



<p>The claim about the PlayStation Portal OLED model comes from KeplerL2 on <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/intels-panther-lake-igpu-is-really-worth-considering-for-a-handheld-amd-fell-asleep-at-the-wheel.1692741/page-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Neogaf</a>. In the thread, Kepler first mentioned that the PS Handheld will be RDNA5 before discussing the Portal. They then stated that the original Portal model “seems to be a success,” with PlayStation working on “another version this year.” When asked which version they were referring to, Kepler responded, “OLED version.” </p>



<p>The PlayStation Portal received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-portal-gets-cloud-streaming-in-surprise-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprise cloud-streaming update</a> last year, adding the ability to stream select PS5 games directly to their devices with PS Plus Premium. The library includes some big names like Astro Bot, Borderlands 4, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Fortnite, Ghost of Yōtei, Grand Theft Auto V, Resident Evil 4, Cyberpunk 2077, God of War Ragnarök, Hogwarts Legacy, Sword of the Sea, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, and more.</p>



<p>With the new update, the PlayStation Portal OLED Model would be more attractive to new customers; however, we have yet to receive official confirmation, so readers should take this information with a grain of salt for now. </p>







<p>In other news, a recent claim states that Xbox’s dedicated handheld was cancelled as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-handheld-amd-10-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMD required 10 million units</a>. Additionally, layStation Store seems to have inadvertently confirmed an incoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-ps5-upgrade-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance PS5 upgrade</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new announcement reveals that the original Final Fantasy 7 is re-releasing on Steam, replacing the 2013 version. </p>



<p>Nowadays, all we hear about Final Fantasy 7 is the remake instalments, Intergrade has already been released for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Switch 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-series/" id="3453">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-part-3-confirmed-for-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebirth and Part 3 </a>have been confirmed for both platforms as well. However, today we aren’t talking about any of the remakes; instead, we are talking about the original Final Fantasy 7 title. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-re-releasing-to-replace-2013-version-on-steam">Final Fantasy 7 Re-Releasing to Replace 2013 Version on Steam </h2>



<p>According to a recent post on <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/2016920806258069772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/square-enix/" id="149">Square Enix</a> has posted a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/39140/view/514107648813039662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> on Steam regarding Final Fantasy 7’s re-release. The new version will rename the current version to FINAL FANTASY VII – 2013 Edition, and this version will no longer be available for purchase once the new version is released. </p>



<p>Existing owners of the 2013 version of Final Fantasy 7 don’t need to worry, as they will both retain access to the previous version and gain access to the new version at no additional cost. This means players can have both versions in their library, but there is no save data compatibility between them. Players with FF7 2013 save data can only use it for the 2013 edition, and the same for the new release. </p>



<p>Moreover, Square Enix has yet to provide a release date or an explanation for re-releasing Final Fantasy 7 on Steam. From what I can see, there are no noticeable upgrades in this version. </p>







<p>In other news, a new claim states that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth could release for Xbox and Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-could-arrive-for-switch-2-this-summer-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this summer</a>. Additionally, Final Fantasy 7 Remake part 3 will bring back the iconic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-bring-back-the-snowboarding-mini-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snowboarding mini game</a>.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> features a much older Leon Kennedy. As such, the ninth mainline entry into the long-running horror video game series is set to explore how his past adventures have changed him, and in this case, made him cold and angry towards the world.</p>



<p>The game’s director, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom’s </a>Koshi Nakanishi, was recently interviewed by <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/260127r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DenNicoFamiGamer</a>. In the interview, Nakanishi notes that Leon’s years fighting the undead have made him more cynical about the world, saying he exudes a “ruthless anger.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Leon is making a reappearance in this game, and this is the result of us digging deep into the idea of ‘what type of person would Leon grow into? What would he be thinking?” Nakanishi says (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/resident-evil-requiem-director-wants-you-to-think-whats-wrong-with-you-leon-when-you-see-the-hot-uncle-swinging-his-bloody-ax/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">h/t: Games Radar+</a>).</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-leon-has-an-ax-to-grind-in-resident-evil-requiem">Leon Has An Ax to Grind in Resident Evil Requiem</h2>



<p>Furthermore, it’s noted that one key way Leon’s personality change is on display is in how he attacks the zombies. In the upcoming game, his main weapon will be an ax, which is said to symbolize how he has changed over the years.</p>



<p>Nakanishi says he wants players to question why Leon made this choice and why he is acting with such aggression and anger. He wants players to ponder what is wrong with the character they’ve known for over two decades.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This game’s Leon fights by swinging his bloody ax in a way where you might start thinking, ‘What’s wrong with you, Leon?’ while playing. That is what we’re aiming for.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Resident Evil Requiem will release on February 27 for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/pc/" id="4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/xbox-series-x/" id="28">Xbox Series</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ted Timmins, the design director of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, has commented on players’ desires for new content, changes to the development team for the longstanding Battle Royale pillar, and teased some major updates to come in the next couple of months.</p>



<p>When a game reaches the level of success Fortnite has, listening to your audience is key. In the first season of its 7th chapter, Fortnite continues to draw interest through collaborations with popular IPs such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leak-reveals-the-office-collab-skins/" id="171628" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Office</a>. However, core gameplay will always be a focal point.</p>



<p>In a tweet, Ted Timmins, responding to a video from SypherPK, noted that he understands the community is seeking new content. He also stated that there was always an understood risk when focusing on battle Royale mode and going back to basics with the first season of Chapter 7.</p>



<p>He then teased a fun update coming in February, possibly hinting at the inclusion of Self-Revives lives and Shockwaves, before noting that March would see the launch of season 2 for chapter 7.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey folks!</p><p>So, we need to talk 🙂 Seeing some of the responses from <a href="https://twitter.com/SypherPK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SypherPK</a>’s video (thank you for sharing your constructive feedback!), thought I'd jump in to join the conversation. </p><p>Totally hear the comments that the community is eager for new content.

<h2 id="h-fortnite-s-stability-was-also-addressed">Fortnite’s Stability Was Also Addressed</h2>



<p>After teasing fun updates, Timmins also revealed the creation of a “multi-discipline live-ops strike team.” This is a new addition to the development team, whose focus is on improving the player experience and general quality-of-life updates. He notes that this is a permanent addition to the development team.</p>



<p>The message concludes with a reminder to players that they can get a guaranteed Stick of Truth if they join this weekend’s Power Hour.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he explained that the game launched in Early Access at $40 because he did not feel it was right to charge early supporters full price before it was properly ready. </p>



<p>He compared his strategy to that of Baldur’s Gate 3, which launched into Early Access at full price, explaining that he was never a fan of that approach.</p>



<p>“BG3 launched into Early Access at full price, and personally, I never loved that approach. If you support a game early, you should get some extra love,” he’d add.</p>



<p>Those interested can currently pick up the game on <a href="https://t.co/QiT6by7r2R" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam </a>for $23.99.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3">Nintendo </a>issues a statement on image-sharing features in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream/" id="3535">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo/" id="22">Nintendo </a>recently held a dedicated Nintendo Direct for the upcoming Tomodachi Life sequel headed to the Nintendo Switch family of consoles. In addition to announcing the game’s April 16 release, the presentation showcased how players could customize their Miis and the island they inhabit.</p>



<p>However, Nintendo has issued a statement regarding limitations to image sharing in the upcoming game.</p>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-is-committed-to-creating-experiences-that-are-welcoming-for-everyone">Nintendo Is Committed to Creating Experiences That Are Welcoming for Everyone</h2>



<p>Following the Nintendo Direct, the official <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo blog</a> issued a statement saying that restrictions have been placed on certain image-sharing features to create a safe environment for all players.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While these moments are often fun for players, we recognize that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nintendo did, however, decide to expand players’ ability to express their gender and sexuality through their Tomodachi Life Mii characters. Players can now choose to make characters non-binary and date anyone of any gender. This follows a 2014 statement promising that future efforts would aim to design a more inclusive gameplay experience after players questioned the omission of same-sex relationships in the original Tomodachi Life.</p>



<p>The trailer released on January 29 showed that certain characters will experience heartbreak multiple times in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, while others may find marriage after bonding over monster trucks. Truly different strokes for different folks.</p>
