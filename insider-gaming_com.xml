<p>Games Workshop announces plans to bring Warhammer World to the United States by 2027</p>



<p>For those enthralled by the Warhammer universe, a Warhammer World could be coming to the United States within the next two years. Games Workshop announced on their website that they have begun working on the second Warhammer World just outside of Washington, DC.</p>







<h2 id="h-warhammer-world-in-the-u-s-won-t-be-a-full-blown-recreation-of-nottingham-location">Warhammer World In The U.S. Won’t Be A Full-Blown Recreation Of Nottingham Location</h2>



<p>The original Warhammer World first opened in Nottingham, England, in 1999. It is currently the ultimate destination for Warhammer fans, featuring a dedicated shop, dioramas on display in the Warhammer Museum, and more. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/u6jqjmvz/a-warhammer-world-in-the-usa-get-the-details-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On their website, Games Workshop</a> notes that the future American Warhammer World won’t be a brick-by-brick recreation of the original. However, they hope to create something special for Americans passionate about the Warhammer hobby.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Based just outside Washington DC, this new Warhammer World will be a flagship venue that celebrates Warhammer in all its forms: gaming, painting, modelling, storytelling, events, and community.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>As for the video game side of Warhammer 40,000, Space Marine 3 is<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-is-in-development"> currently in development</a>, but there are still free updates planned for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 later this year.

<p>Masahiro Sakurai is one of the most well-known game developers in the industry. Best known for his work in the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. franchises, he remains a pillar of Nintendo.</p>



<p>Now, he’s discussing the changes the game development process has undergone over the years and why he’s not a fan of massive teams.</p>







<h2 id="h-masahiro-sakurai-dislikes-how-game-development-teams-continue-to-increase-in-size">Masahiro Sakurai Dislikes How Game Development Teams Continue To Increase In Size</h2>



<p>Recently, he was interviewed by Japan’s <a href="https://www.47news.jp/13701368.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">47NEWS</a> and discussed how much more satisfying it is to see the results of your work when you work solo, rather than constantly checking in with others. To him, the strength of an individual’s work runs the risk of getting lost in the shuffle when part of a larger team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Talking specifically about game development, it’s very satisfying to see the results of your hard work,” Sakurai said<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-says-it-can-be-really-frustrating-working-on-massive-games-with-hundreds-of-devs-there-is-work-that-clearly-shows-your-results-and-work-that-doesnt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> (via GamesRadar+)</a>. “You don’t get this when working in a team, and it can be really frustrating. For example, when a pixel artist draws a picture by themselves then they of course finished it. But when managing a team, it’s often difficult because you have to keep talking about what kind of pixel art is suitable.</p>
</blockquote>







<blockquote>
<p>“I feel like this is getting more difficult with large-scale games. Staff size is rapidly increasing into the hundreds. The sense of fulfillment gained from making something by yourself is different to something made as part of a group. What you are meant to do is also changing.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sakurai recently helmed the development of Kirby Air Riders, released exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2. Check out our coverage of the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=kirby+air+riders">here</a>.</p>

<p>The first Nintendo GameCube game to hit the Nintendo Switch Online service in 2026 is a pillar of one of Nintendo’s top franchises, one with a new game releasing later this year.</p>



<p>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is now playable for subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online as part of the Nintendo GameCube – Nintendo Classics service, which is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>







<h2 id="h-fire-emblem-takes-center-stage-in-2026">Fire Emblem Takes Center Stage in 2026</h2>



<p>Released in 2005, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is the sole game in the series released on the Nintendo GameCube. It’s also the first console game in the series to be released in the U.S. At the time, the game was received well critically. Since then, five more games have been released in the series. The game features Ike as the main character. He would go on to be a playable character in multiple Super Smash Bros. games.</p>



<p>Path of Radiance is the eighth Nintendo GameCube game to be made available on the Nintendo Switch Online service. However, unlike other releases such as F-Zero GX and Wario World, players know when the next game in the franchise will be coming to Nintendo Switch 2. Later this year, Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave will launch as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. That game was announced during the September 2025 Nintendo Direct. As of this writing, there is no official release date for the game.</p>

Featuring 38 characters, the game will have the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-unveils-new-features-and-characters-in-mario-tennis-fever-gameplay-overview-trailer/">largest roster in series history.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Sims fans have spent many a year wondering what the next major release in the series would look like. For the most part, it’s assumed that it’ll just be ‘The Sims 5’, but it’s what that game will look like that has the community deep in discussion. There’s also ‘Project Rene’, which has been thrown around by Maxis and Electronic Arts for some time.</p>



<p>At least one of those things has a more solid identity now, and it’s all thanks to those very same fans. In a new blog post, the team at Maxis revealed that Project Rene has ‘evolved’ into a ‘social, collaborative, mobile-first life-sim game.’</p>



<p>It’s not the next big Sims title, but what <strong>is it</strong>?</p>







<h2 id="h-project-rene-is-not-the-sims-5">Project Rene is NOT The Sims 5</h2>



<p>In a recent blog post, Maxis and Electronic Arts took a deep dive into all things The Sims. The post started with a reaffirmation that things aren’t set to run cold with The Sims 4, which will continue to receive updates and new content going forward.</p>



<p>It was believed that the game’s new expansion pack, Royalty &amp; Legacy, would be <strong>the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sims-4-royalty-and-legacy-final-expansion-pack/">final Sims 4 expansion</a></strong>. It seems that might not be the case, based on the new blog post.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/future-of-the-sims" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> in question details everything you’d want to immediately know about Project Rene, including how the project has pivoted to focus on mobile-based multiplayer mechanics:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to ongoing player feedback, Project Rene has evolved to focus on social multiplayer play, offering a more direct way for friends to share creativity together. </p>



<p>It is not the successor to&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4</em>&nbsp;and is a separate experience from any future deep, single player life simulation experience.&nbsp; It introduces a new way to explore and play together within the growing Sims family of games, welcoming Simmers who want to connect directly with other players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team is adamant that the core of the Sims franchise is rooted – and <strong>forever will be</strong> – in <strong>single-player experiences</strong>. That has been the bread and butter of The Sims since the first game debuted almost 26 years ago.</p>



<p>And again, those updates won’t stop flowing right into The Sims 4:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At its core,&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>&nbsp;was built on a deep, single-player life simulation, chock full of rich systems, meaningful storytelling, and player agency that puts you in control.

<p>There’s still no indication of when the next numbered Sims title might surface, but as the live-service, free-to-play model of The Sims 4 is doing so well, it might be a <strong>long time </strong>before it does.</p>

<p>If you’ve been waiting for the chance to play Baldur’s Gate 3 on the go on your Nintendo Switch 2 console, you’re going to want to sit down for this. It’s not happening.</p>



<p>Taking part in an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit on Friday, Larian Studios’ Swen Vincke was asked about the game possibly being ported to Nintendo’s latest system. His answer, immediately shut the door on it. </p>







<p><strong>“We would have loved to, but it wasn’t our decision to make,”</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vincke wrote</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-won-t-it-come-to-switch-2">Why Won’t It Come To Switch 2?</h2>



<p>As a follow up to Vincke’s confirmation, known leaker NateTheHate, who had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-could-potentially-come-to-the-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed in the past</a> there was a possibility to bring the game to Nintendo, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2009691766191165501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gave a bit more insight</a> into why it’s not coming.</p>



<p><strong>“While Larian would love to bring Baldur’s Gate 3 to the Switch 2… their relationship with Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast is not healthy,”</strong> he said. <strong>“Late last year, I heard [Baldur’s Gate 3] for [Switch 2] was no happening….”</strong></p>







<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 first launched in Early Access in August 2020. The full release of the game came in August 2023 on PC. The game would then come to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later that year. It would also receive regular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-major-baldurs-gate-3-update-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updates until April 2025</a>, when the last major patch was released.</p>



<p>While Baldur’s Gate 3 coming to Switch 2 may not be happening, that doesn’t mean Larian isn’t working on what’s next. The studio is in-development of the next game in the Divinity franchise, which, as part of the same AMA, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-devs-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-for-concept-art/">won’t feature any sort of generative AI</a> artwork.</p>
