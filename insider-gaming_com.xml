<p>Marvel Rivals’ November 27 patch introduced the 18v18 Annihilation game mode. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 5 is now live, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-roadmap-reveals-date-for-rogue-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> tells us when all the new characters, maps, events, and more are arriving in the game.

<p>Unveiled through a new trailer, Marvel Rivals 18v18 Annihilation game mode will take place on a new map called Grand Garden, where players will participate in a Domination Showdown. The trailer reveals how chaotic this mode can get, with swarms of heroes piling up on both sides. At the same time, it also provides opportunities for players to take down waves of other players when timing their ultimates correctly. Check out the new trailer below: </p>

<p>Battlefield 6 developers have stated that in-game audio issues will receive a “full pass” to solve them. </p>



<p>EA’s Battlefield 6 has been out for close to two months now, and the game has already received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-drops-to-half-price-for-black-friday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive discount</a> due to a Black Friday mega sale on one platform. However, as sales and marketing for the title progress, the developers are also constantly working to resolve issues, and now they have set their sights on BF6’s in-game audio problems. </p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-in-game-audio-issues-will-receive-a-full-pass-for-fixes">Battlefield 6 In-Game Audio Issues Will Receive a ‘Full Pass’ for Fixes</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/some-battlefield-6-players-still-cant-hear-enemies-creeping-up-on-them-so-devs-are-doing-a-full-pass-to-fix-niggling-sound-issues-for-good-hoping-we-can-share-more-details-on-that-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Florian Le Bihan, principal game designer, recently responded to a comment on <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1993685559462527420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) about fixing footstep audio issues in Battlefield 6. Le Bihan stated that “the entire in-game audio is receiving a full pass to solve those issues, including fixing some issues that caused some sounds to completely cut.” The principal designer added that they are still working on the problems and verifying the changes, and they hope to share more details soon. </p>



<p>Florian Le Bihan also spoke about Battlefield 6’s mouse-and-keyboard issues in the same thread. He first confirmed that fine-tuning mouse sensitivity “broke with the last update” and will be fixed in the upcoming patch. For keyboards, he was asked whether Class-related keybinds can be removed, and Le Bihan confirmed that those buttons will be removed from the keyboard after the next patch. </p>



<p>Here’s how Battlefield 6 player count <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-player-count-black-ops-7-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compares to Black Ops 7’s</a>.
