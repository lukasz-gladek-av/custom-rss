<p>ARC Raiders isn’t safe from cheaters or hackers, and most games aren’t. There’s a chance you could have some of your inventory stolen or taken through nefarious or illegal means at any point. If this happens, Embark Studios has your back with lost items in ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>Finding and losing items is part of the extraction shooter formula. You win some, you lose some—that’s how it goes. But there’s an ick when you lose hard-earned goods to cheaters. It can happen, and people are more than happy to extort your efforts for their own gain. </p>



<p>However, if it does happen in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, you should automatically get your stuff back.</p>

<figure><figcaption>The chicken, well, Embark, has spoken. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>As shown by <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersNews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Radar</a> (via u/Jfourmes), if you’re targeted by a hacker, your items will be returned.</p>



<p>“Your items were lost due to unfair play, but we managed to get them back for you! They’re now available for you to claim and take with you on your next journey Topside. We’re committed to building an environment where gameplay is about skill, teamwork, and fun, not unfair advantages. Thank you for being part of this mission! Together, we’re building ARC Raiders into a fair and fun experience for everyone,” says the official in-game message.</p>



<p>We did some digging into the original <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olbx4i/i_didnt_know_we_get_refunded_is_someone_cheats_o/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> post, and it seems the original user didn’t report the cheater or submit a report; it was an automatic message from the devs informing them of what had happened.</p>



<p>It’s also unclear what constitutes “unfair play.” Still, we imagine anything pertaining to cheating, hacking, or items being stolen that shouldn’t ordinarily be allowed to be taken falls under this umbrella.</p>



<figure></figure>

You can let everyone know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-sidekicks-customization-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sidekicks are finally coming to Fortnite after months of speculation, giving players pets to accompany them across all game modes, but there are some specific customization choices that are permanent.</p>



<p>The first Sidekick is coming in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons Battle Pass</a>, with additional Sidekicks being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-announces-return-of-companions-with-new-sidekicks-arriving-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added to the Item Shop from November 7</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-sidekick-leak-shows-prices-will-be-the-same-as-collab-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked prices indicate they will cost around the same as a Collab Skin</a>.</p>



<p>With a high price and restrictions to some customizations, Sidekicks have caused a stir in the community, and we have all the details on the customization rules.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-fortnite-sidekick-customizations-are-permanent">What Fortnite Sidekick Customizations Are Permanent?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big additions. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Each Fortnite Sidekick has a one-time customization changes to their appearance that are applied before you can equip the item.</strong></p>



<p>These are the major customization choices with each Sidekick, impacting the base colours, any color accents, or major features, like the style of ears, body size, and similar. The final permanent choice is the name for a Sidekick.</p>



<p>Once locked in, these choices are permanent and cannot be adjusted. However, you can purchase the same Sidekick again and make a fresh style, though this, of course, incurs the cost of splashing out on the same item.</p>



<p>This is a big difference to The Mandalorian Warrior outfit, for example, which allows for constant cosmetic changes and the ability to save different appearances in your loadout. </p>



<p>Understandably, there has been some backlash to the permanence of some of the big customization choices for Sidekicks, and it remains to be seen whether Epic Games change their approach, or add a purchaseable item that allows you to edit a Sidekick again. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-fortnite-sidekick-customizations-are-repeatable">What Fortnite Sidekick Customizations Are Repeatable?</h2>



<p><strong>Not all customization choices for your Sidekick in Fortnite are permanent, with additional accessories and some cosmetics being freely available to change.</strong></p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N0m9H13pGM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer for Fortnite Sidekicks</a>, a screen showing editable Styles offers a tease of what will be freely interchangeable with Sidekicks, with the example being clothing for a dog. In the video, two styles are shown, each with a different color and look.</p>



<p>Based on this, it’s expected that style choices for accessories like clothing, collars, and similar attire will all be able to be changed as many times as you want. What isn’t clear, however, is how you will gain access to these items, and whether there will be a deep supply of them.</p>



<p>As the amount of Sidekicks in Fortnite grows though, expect more customization options for attire to be added.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite fanatics with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership had the blow of price increases to the service softened with the announcement Fortnite Crew was being added as a perk, and we’ve got all the details of when that comes into effect.</p>



<p>Price rises for Xbox Game Pass subscriptions caused a stir last month, rising <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as much as 50% in some cases</a>, though it was also announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-battle-passes-will-now-be-included-in-xbox-game-pass-ultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Crew would be included</a> in some memberships.</p>



<p>The wait for that perk to come into effect continues, however, and if you’re wondering exactly when Fortnite Crew is added to a subscription, particularly with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons-themed Battle Pass</a> landing, we can tell you the exact release date for the bonus perk.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-fortnite-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">When Is Fortnite Coming to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New bonus. Image via Microsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite Crew will be included in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate memberships from November 18, 2025, Epic Games has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>Announced as part of the pricing structure changes to the Game Pass service in October, Fortnite Crew is being added as an additional perk for subscribers to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>.</p>



<p>The inclusion was not immediate, however, and players are still waiting for this bonus to be unlocked—but it’s on the horizon, with the perk adding to memberships from November 18, as stated by an <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-battle-royale-c-202300000001636/billing-and-payment-c-202300000001723/fortnite-crew-availability-with-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-a202300000020476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games blog post</a>.</p>



<p>No additional cost will be added to the monthly Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription price, though the previously announced price rises are in effect, but the bonus will soften the blow for Fortnite players.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-included-in-fortnite-crew">What’s Included in Fortnite Crew?</h2>



<p><strong>Fortnite Crew membership includes full access to all the Battle Passes added in Fortnite across all modes, with a total of four passes in Fortnite.</strong></p>



<p>The main Battle Pass, OG Battle Pass, Festival Pass, and LEGO Pass are all included in the membership, along with the Rocket Pass Premium in Rocket League.</p>



<p>Additional bonuses include 1,000 V-Bucks every month, available to spend on cosmetics in the Item Shop, and an exclusive monthly Crew Pack that provides a new Outfit alongside a matching accessory—a Glider, Pickaxe, or Emote.</p>

<p>Chapter 6 in Fortnite is rapidly approaching a conclusion but, before the big jump into Chapter 7, a mini-season themed around The Simpsons is taking center stage, with a new Battle Pass to enjoy.</p>



<p>Kicking off with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live event on November 1</a>, The Simpsons takeover of Fortnite will see a smaller map brought onto the scene, representing Springfield, with lobby sizes in battle royale reduced from 100 to 80 as a result.</p>



<p>There’s also the long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-announces-return-of-companions-with-new-sidekicks-arriving-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduction of Sidekicks</a>, Fortnite’s new pets feature, and the Battle Pass is stacked full of Simpsons goodies.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-battle-pass">How Much is The Fortnite x The Simpsons Battle Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to enjoy. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Simpsons Battle Pass in Fortnite costs 1,000 V-Bucks to unlock, though it’s also available as part of a Fortnite Crew subscription.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a cheaper price than usual Battle Passes in Fortnite, due to the shorter duration of the season and fewer rewards, but there’s still plenty to sink your teeth into. 1,000 V-Bucks are purchasable for a base price of $8.99, though you may be able to find cheaper codes and better value for money if you purchase a larger amount.</p>



<p>Remember, Fortnite Crew will also be included with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription starting from November 18, so don’t splash out twice if you have a membership!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-the-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-battle-pass">All Rewards in The Fortnite x The Simpsons Battle Pass</h2>



<p><strong>There are seven pages of rewards in The Simpsons Battle Pass in Fortnite, not including the bonus rewards that become available once the basic pass is completed.</strong></p>



<p>As usual, all of the bonus rewards are yet to be revealed, but we do know there will be an Evil Homer skin style available, alongside a Springfield Peely.</p>



<p>The full list of rewards in The Simpsons Battle Pass is shown in the table below.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-the-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-battle-pass-worth-it">Is The Fortnite x The Simpsons Battle Pass Worth It?</h2>



<p><strong>For fans of The Simpsons, the Fortnite Battle Pass is certainly one of the best in a long while and highlights just how great Epic Games’ creativity is.</strong></p>



<p>With appearances of fan-favorite characters Ned Flanders, Marge Simpson, and Homer Simpson, alongside an abundance of fun easter eggs and references with Emotes, Pickaxes, and Back Blings, The Simpsons Battle Pass is worth every dollar.</p>



<p>On top of that, the Battle Pass includes a return of 900 V-Bucks, plus potentially more when the bonus rewards are revealed later this month, so you’ll pretty much get your money back in V-Bucks that can be spent on other Simpsons items in the shop.</p>

<p>A Rare Fortnite skin has returned to the Item Shop for the first time in half a decade, making its first appearance since 2020.</p>



<p>Fortnite has an abundance of skins players can use across all modes, and, with hundreds to choose from, some of those introduced take a long while to be brought back into the Item Shop.</p>



<p>These skins with limited appearances have been dubbed ‘rare’ by the community, with those owning them being able to flex on rival players—but the door has opened for players to finally get their hands on one of the rarest skins.</p>



<h2 id="h-dante-returns-to-fortnite">Dante Returns To Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Returning. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>As leaked by <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1984395460040126887">ShiinaBR</a>, Dante returned to the Item Shop for the first time in five years on November, marking the first appearance of the skin since the same date five years ago.</p>



<p>Initially released on November 2, 2018, the Dante skin had featured just eight times in the Item Shop prior to its return today, with yearly reappearances in the Item Shop around Halloween.</p>



<p>That trend came to an end in 2020, however, with Dante not appearing for five consecutive years until the streak was broken with today’s appearance.</p>



<p>Priced at 1,500 V-Bucks, the Dante skin is available to pick up until November 4, and has the added bonus of being reactive and glowing in the dark.</p>



<p>Though the wait for Dante has been a lengthy one, it pales in comparison to some of the other rarest skins in Fortnite, with the likes of Reflex and Summit Striker not appearing in the shop for over 2,400 days.</p>

<p>If you’re taking part in a little esports betting or want to watch the BLAST R6 Major Munich with some knowledge in your back pocket, here are the latest predictions for the tournament.</p>



<p><strong>FaZe Clan </strong>comes into the running in Munich with the tightest momentum and best esports betting odds.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-review%E2%80%94the-most-refreshing-extraction-shooter-ever-made.1341034/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has finally hit the market after years of development at Embark Studios. It comes from the creative minds that brought us The Finals and, once upon a time, games like Battlefield. It’s a retro-futuristic, post-apocalyptic, extraction shooter epic that has been turning heads for months, and now it’s finally here, it’s <strong>screaming up the charts</strong>.</p>



<p>Being a fan of the extraction genre, I was all too eager to leap head over heels into ARC Raiders. I’d waited until the full release of the game to experience it, as I wanted the most polished version possible, and what I’ve been treated to is nothing short of sumptuous.</p>



<p>This is the most refreshing, entertaining extraction shooter I think we’ve ever had. Read on for my full ARC Raiders review.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-is-accessible-but-remains-challenging">ARC Raiders is Accessible but Remains Challenging</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-steams-most-popular-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a> is perhaps the most accessible game to land in the genre, which is typically tougher and less welcoming than almost every other genre out there (except perhaps Soulslike). It takes the extraction shooter concept and makes it more ‘arcadey’ and inviting, while retaining a solid sense of challenge that keeps the more talented players engaged.</p>



<p>That balance is flawless, in my eyes. I generally hate games that are challenging for the sake of it, but ARC Raiders manages to keep you entertained even <strong>while you’re losing</strong>, and there are mechanics built into the game to make sure you can keep playing even when you’re on your last buck.</p>



<p>Given that ARC Raiders is available on PlayStation, Xbox, <strong>and </strong>PC, it already has a step up on the competition, which is almost exclusively refined to PC platforms. For instance, Escape from Tarkov, arguably the spearhead of the extraction genre, has spent almost a decade confined to a proprietary launcher on PC, and is only just coming to Steam later this month.</p>



<p>If you choose to invest the $30 or so to secure a copy of ARC Raiders, you’ll be getting what might be one of the best introductions to the extraction shooter genre imaginable.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Team up, betray, or just gun down? The choice is yours in ARC Raiders</figcaption></figure>







<p>ARC Raiders takes players and throws them into a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by an invasion of robotic enemies called ARC. The human race has been driven underground into a settlement called Speranza, and ‘going topside’ is a risky and ambitious concept reserved only for foolhardy Raiders, scavengers who want to claim the riches still left above ground.</p>



<p>It’s a third-person action-based shooter with some light RPG and survival mechanics, large-ish environments to explore, and intense combat systems that make fighting both human enemies and AI-driven robots a satisfying romp.</p>



<p>I’ve said it’s effectively Fortnite crossed with Fallout, and fused with Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>You’ve got the third-person perspective, rapid movement model, and elements like skin packs and emotes, combined with the post-apocalyptic, war-torn setting, and extraction-based gameplay loop.</p>



<p>What’s different about ARC Raiders is that it holds your hand quite nicely without being too forgiving. You can get free loadouts at any point if you’re down on your luck, you have a companion named Scrappy (he’s a chicken) who collects crafting items for you to use, and the early-game missions are tutorials that help you understand the core facets of the title.</p>



<p>I think the earliest quests had me fully understand every angle of the game, including trading, crafting, extraction, healing, and more, within an hour flat. You don’t get that in a game like Escape from Tarkov!</p>



<p>But with that being said, ARC Raiders can quickly ramp up the difficulty, depending on your circumstances. The ARC enemies are notoriously tough, and fighting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-boss-kill-58-times/">something like a <strong>Queen</strong></a><strong> </strong>is absolutely impossible without a dedicated effort by a well-armed team with a key strategy to follow.</p>



<p>As you could imagine, resources are scarce, the post-apocalyptic arsenal is reminiscent of Fallout’s ‘pipe weapon’ range, and there are no armor items to find and upgrade, just energy shields and the warm flesh of your Raider.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Don’t even hope to tackle an ARC Queen</figcaption></figure>







<p>Bungie stressed that Marathon, an upcoming extraction shooter that was plagued by bad press earlier this year, would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-wants-marathon-to-be-a-social-extraction-experience/">the first ‘social’ extraction shooter</a>. It was said it would hit the market with elements of accessibility and would promote teamwork and collaboration over mindless slaughter.</p>



<p>That’s what ARC Raiders is doing. In the raids that I’ve played, I’ve had more positive interactions than in any other extraction shooter or battle royale title. I’ve teamed up with other players, helped them into the extraction sites (elevators that take you back to Speranza), and even earned apologies from players before they brutally knocked me out and sent me to the abyss.</p>



<p>Even when I do get into a fight, I feel like it’s pretty balanced, even if the RPG-style skill-based pathways lend themselves to the whole ‘unemployed gamers are more powerful’ vibe. As you rank up your character, you unlock multiple benefits that might make a brand-new player feel a bit hard done by, but that’s the nature of the game, and you just need to deal with it.</p>



<p>If you grind, you’ll get there yourself at some point. There are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-arc-raiders-have-a-wipe/">no wipes in ARC Raiders</a>, except for the optional ‘Expedition Projects’ that crop up after you’ve hit level 20, so you can chug along at your own pace, have fun meeting people and enjoying the world around you, and not worry about losing all your progress once every six months.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-i-wanted">Everything I Wanted</h2>



<figure><figcaption>ARC Raiders’ maps encourage multiple playstyles, which is superb</figcaption></figure>







<p>I was holding fire on ARC Raiders for the longest time, but I need to admit that it’s everything I’m looking for in an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>There are plenty of places to loot and explore, the resource pool is diverse, and the core concept of the game is intriguing and engaging. I’m a huge fan of the combat, which invites you to try out a range of fighting styles and approaches, and I love how accessible the game is, catering perfectly for casual players just as much as die-hard veterans of the genre.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has done a phenomenal job with ARC Raiders. It looks brilliant on-screen, runs quite nicely, and has a diverse collection of maps, enemies to fight, and quests to complete. There are 63 quests to contend with right now, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-add-10-years-worth-of-content/">ARC Raiders roadmap</a> for the path ahead has been revealed, and plenty more content is coming.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release</a> on November 15 and the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> on November 14 might disrupt ARC Raider somewhat, but I’m confident that this shooter has plenty of meat on the bones and fuel in the tank, more than enough to retain a core community that will keep the game up on their shoulders.</p>



<p>If there is <strong>one thing </strong>I would ask for, it’s a PvE mode that takes out the extra challenge of PvP battles. I’d be perfectly happy playing only with friends or running solo in a world populated by ARC, but I imagine that’s already set for development…</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-4-5-great">Verdict: 4/5 – Great</h2>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-actor-gta-6-100-price-tag/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-actor-thinks-grand-theft-auto-6-%E2%80%98warrants%E2%80%99-a-100-price-tag.1341028/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is mere months away from hitting the market (we hope), and fans are still busy theorizing over how much the game will cost. The price is yet to be set, and many feel that it could be the first standard game to hit the market with a $100 price tag.</p>



<p>The nature of that price tag has been widely debated by many, including the folks here at Insider Gaming. It’s believed that if any game can carry that price tag, it’s Grand Theft Auto 6. That’s a sentiment that was shared by a Grand Theft Auto actor during a recent interview with The Escapist.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-grand-theft-auto-6-cost-100">Should Grand Theft Auto 6 Cost $100?</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/jay-klaitz-exclusive-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Escapist</a>, Jay Klaitz, the actor behind the notorious Lester Crest in Grand Theft Auto 5, sat down to talk about all things GTA. He touched on his experiences acting the character and performing alongside the trio of leads in the game that debuted a whopping 12 years ago.</p>



<p>Talk naturally turned to Grand Theft Auto 6 and Klaitz’s expectations of the game, including the long-rumored price point.</p>



<p>He’s in the camp suggesting that, owing to the investment poured into creating a Grand Theft Auto game, it’s more than worth a $100 label.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yeah dude. I mean, GTA V was so heavy on the mocap. I assume that GTA VI will be the same way, and these games take so long to make. Years and years and years. It’s not like they’ve just been hanging out, chilling and then just started doing the work last year. They finished GTA V and then started on GTA VI more or less immediately thereafter.</p>



<p>This shit takes forever and as we saw with GTA V the game will come out and there will be other versions, there will be downloadable content, it will be online. You’re almost buying multiple games when you buy the one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would also like to see it made more accessible to more fans so I get that side of the argument too to make it affordable for folks. That’s cool too. Maybe there’s like a way to split the difference, but I share the sentiment that this game warrants that price tag. Yeah, I get that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Klaitz was talking about the post-launch window of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is set to drop in May 2026. He addressed hopes that Rockstar Games would ‘bring back old Lester’ in some kind of expansion that revisits the character.</p>



<p>It would work, given how we see heist footage in the newest GTA 6 trailers, and that fits nicely into Lester Crest’s wheelhouse.</p>



<p>Do you think Klaitz is right and that Grand Theft Auto 6 should cost $100? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-1-874/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-874-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-saturday-november-1.1341019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s November! That came around <strong>very fast</strong> this year, didn’t it? Halloween is now over and done with, and we can start looking to the festive season, and after that… 2026! Today, though, we’re looking a little smaller on the scale of time and considering today’s NYT Connections hints and answers.</p>



<p>I’ve got the best solutions you need to wrap up today’s NYT Connections puzzle and get on with your day. Read on to get all the hints you need to smash today’s challenge.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-1">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 1)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #874:</p>



<ul>
<li>RAVEN</li>



<li>PINKY</li>



<li>CHIP</li>



<li>JET</li>



<li>INKY</li>



<li>ROCKY</li>



<li>FILE</li>



<li>CLYDE</li>



<li>HARDY</li>



<li>SUE</li>



<li>TELLER</li>



<li>CHARGE</li>



<li>INDICT</li>



<li>ITCHY</li>



<li>PITCH</li>



<li>CHER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These are all legal actions that initiate or escalate a case.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each of these words is commonly used to describe a deep, rich black color — poetic and evocative.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>A fun twist — these are the “second” names in iconic duos.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>All animated rodents who take top billing in their respective pairs.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 1.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-1-874">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 1 (#874)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CHARGE, FILE, INDICT, SUE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – INKY, JET, PITCH, RAVEN</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CHER, CLYDE, HARDY, TELLER</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CHIP, ITCHY, PINKY, ROCKY</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘GTA 6 Workers’ Fired To Prevent Union Forming, It’s Alleged]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-workers-fired-prevent-union/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98gta-6-workers%E2%80%99-fired-to-prevent-union-forming-it%E2%80%99s-alleged.1340902/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new report, it has been claimed that ‘dozens of’ Rockstar Games employees have been fired for misconduct in a wave that might have been a twisted form of union busting. </p>



<p>The report originally published by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier claims that between 30 and 40 Rockstar Games employees in the UK and Canada were terminated, and they were allegedly <strong>all </strong>part of a ‘private trade union chat’ on Discord.</p>



<h2 id="h-blatant-and-ruthless-layoffs-at-rockstar-games">‘Blatant and Ruthless’ Layoffs at Rockstar Games</h2>



<p>Rockstar Games is preparing to launch Grand Theft Auto 6 in just a few months, all being well. The studio has been piecing together the open-world crime epic for years, and fans are eagerly awaiting the delivery of what will arguably be the largest game launch in history.</p>



<p>But the most recent bit of news involving Rockstar Games isn’t all that positive.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTkzOTg3MSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyNTQ0NjcxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNTBISEpHUFFRNkMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.9NYooKXrBMU_quRYMOSw6uACDogcIuS-E27t4GD8f2g&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> recently reported that Rockstar Games laid off 30 to 40 employees, labelling their dismissal terms as ‘misconduct’. However, a spokesperson of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) claimed that it’s an attempt at preventing unionization amongst the team members:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry. This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Take-Two refuted the claims, suggesting that all the firings took place because of ‘gross misconduct,’ but all the employees were dismissed at the same time, per reports, and all of them were found to be in a private chat on Discord related to unionization.</p>



<p>Rockstar Games has mostly avoided the waves of layoffs that have hit the industry over the last couple of years. Take-Two, the company’s parent firm, hasn’t fared as well.
