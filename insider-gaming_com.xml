<p>The modding strategy for Hytale has been outlined by Hypixel Studios, and it will be easier for everyone to access servers with mods enabled.</p>



<p>Hytale is back on the agenda after being scrapped by Riot Games earlier this year, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hypixel Studios’ original founders re-purchasing the rights to the game</a> and all development, and a playable experience is right around the corner, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announcement-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date for early access set to be shared next week</a>.</p>



<p>Modding will be core to the Hytale experience, unsurprisingly given that Hypixel began as a Minecraft mod, and details have been shared that will make it easy for players to enjoy modded content.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-modding-will-be-server-side">Hytale Modding Will Be Server-Side</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-modding-strategy-and-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">detailed blog post</a> about modding in Hytale, it was announced that all modding in the game is “based on the host of the server or host of the game,” and that players should be able to join any modded server “without downloading external mods or juggling client packs.”</p>



<p>Players will be able to download mods directly for customisation in single-player servers, and, crucially, Hytale is not planning to support any client mods, restricting the need for additional downloads further.</p>



<p>The modding ambitions for Hytale are huge and will be open access, with Blocks, Items, NPCs, World Generation, UIs, systems, and behaviors “all driven by data and code that you can influence.”</p>



<p>However, it’s also detailed that modders will experience limitations when early access goes live due to the current stage of development, and Hypixel Studios has made no secret of the fact it will be a long process for full release, and early access players and modders will encounter issues.</p>



<p>Modders have been told there will be “limitations due to missing editing capabilities,” that “certain aspects of client behaviour are not yet exposed,” and “moddering maturity is wildly uneven.” Additionally, some tools and systems are described as “rough, inconsistent, or painful to work with.”</p>



<p>Hypixel Studios will not hide valuable features from modders, however, and, “if something is useful,” they will “try to make it available and iterate it.” Modders and players throughout early access are urged to hold Hypixel Studios “responsible,” with a commitment to “being transparent and telling you the truth.”</p>

<p>The early access release date for Hytale will be announced by the end of next week, Hypixel Studios has revealed, with anticipation for the title continuing to rise.</p>



<p>Hytale was scrapped by Riot Games but has been revived by the original founders of the title, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchase announced earlier this month</a>, and it’s unlikely to be long until players get their hands on the game.</p>



<p>While the official 1.0 release is likely to be a ways off, early access could be right around the corner, and an official announcement on the release date is coming next week.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-early-access-announcement-next-week">Hytale Early Access Announcement Next Week</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big news imminent. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Hypixel Studios founder Simon Collins-Laflamme continued a slew of news updates regarding Hytale by confirming that plans for the early access release date will be revealed before the end of next week.</p>



<p>It’s set to be a week full of info, as the post states that Hytale will be tested across different hardware “to determine the minimum specs,” with major crashes being fixed, launcher tests, and finishing up the legal work to prepare the game for early access.</p>



<p>The post states that a “precise release date” will be announced next week, with a follow up post confirming this is for the early access release, and not for the full version.</p>



<p>Anticipation for Hytale is high, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-coming-soonand-shows-off-16-minutes-of-minecraft-like-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">16-minute gameplay video</a> attracting over one million views in a matter of days, and the long wait for a playable version of the game to be available is coming to an end.</p>



<p>Development for Hytale began in 2015, with Riot Games purchasing Hypixel Studios five years later in 2020. However, Riot cancelled the title in June this year, but the game has been saved by the original developer, and players are set to be a major part of ongoing development.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-ranked-season-3/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-season-3-ranked%E2%80%94release-date-start-time-rewards.1360507/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is rapidly approaching a new season in Ranked, with Season 3 offering a fresh batch of rewards, including the long-awaited addition of another Mega Pokémon.</p>



<p>Ranked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A has proven to be a controversial mechanic, with some Mega Pokémon being locked behind reaching designated ranks in the mode, but tweaks have been made to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-to-lower-requirements-for-exclusive-mega-evolutions-in-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lower the requirements</a> and allow for more players to gain the exclusive rewards.</p>



<p>Season 3 is now right around the corner and Insider Gaming has all the details on when the season kicks off, along with the rewards available to earn.</p>











<figure><figcaption>More rewards. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Season 3 of Ranked in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A begins on November 27, following the conclusion of Season 2 Ranked.</strong></p>



<p>The end date has also been revealed, with Season 3 drawing to a close on December 18. Due to the dates covering the release period for the Mega Dimension DLC, it’s expected there will be some restrictions on useable Pokémon and any Pokémon caught in the DLC are unlikely to be able to be used.</p>



<p>However, Zygarde will be useable in Season 3 of Ranked for the first time.</p>







<p><strong>Start times for Season 3 have not been officially announced, but it’s expected to kick off at 6 AM UTC on November 27—the same time that previous seasons have begun.</strong></p>



<p>The table below shows a breakdown of exactly when you can expect Season 3 of Ranked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A to begin in your time zone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Season 3 Ranked Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Nov. 26</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Nov. 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Nov. 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Nov. 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Nov. 27</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>











<p><strong>The biggest reward available in Season 3 Ranked in Legends: Z-A is Chesnaughtite, the item required to unlock Mega Chesnaught in the game.</strong></p>



<p>Chesnaughtite is the final Mega Stone locked behind ranked participation in the base game of Legends: Z-A, following Greninjite and Delphoxite, but we already know Mega Baxcalibur from the Mega Dimension DLC will be locked behind Ranked participation in a future season.</p>



<p>Additional rewards available during Season 3 of Ranked are expected to include Rare Candies, EXP. Candies, and Held Items for Pokémon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has published the H1 FY26 report that was delayed a few days back, revealing that the company is in a pretty good place after ‘better than expected’ results over the last few months. In the data, growth was recorded year-over-year in every category, from ‘player investment’ to back catalog sales.</p>



<p>The results detailed an exceeding of expectations, which isn’t what critics were holding out for following the recent closing down of trading around the time that the financial update was postponed.</p>



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-is-actually-doing-really-well">Ubisoft is Actually Doing Really Well</h2>



<p>The financial report was pretty glowing for Ubisoft, and it was laced with positivity.</p>



<p>Year-over-year, Ubisoft’s net bookings in H1 FY increased 20%, soaring to €772 million. Digital revenues made up a huge chunk of that, with the vertical also seeing a +30% increase. The shining gem was ‘player recurring investment’, which soared by +52% in H1 FY26.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a statement, Ubisoft confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Outperformance driven by stronger-than-expected partnerships, demonstrating the power and attractiveness of the Group’s portfolio as well as meaningful contribution from live TV and animated series.</p>



<p>Excluding partnerships, back-catalog was robust and in line with expectations, but marked by contrasted dynamics.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was noted that Assassin’s Creed ‘overperformed’ this year, confirming ‘positive momentum’. This was likely because Assassin’s Creed Shadows was one of the best AC games the company had produced in a good few years, not counting Assassin’s Creed: Mirage.</p>



<p>Ubisoft also maintained 34 million Monthly Active Users across the portfolio, and in H1, 88 million Unique Active Users were logged.</p>



<p>There were nice things to be said about Tencent’s recent investment in Vantage Studios, and it was noted that ‘all conditions precedent have been satisfied’, which means nothing is stopping the closure of that deal ‘in the coming days.’</p>



<p>Is this level of positivity what you expected from Ubisoft’s financial update? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>The Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake is one of the most talked-about games within the Ubisoft machine, but until now, it hasn’t been formally acknowledged by the company. However, Insider Gaming has covered the game extensively over the past 18 months and has now learned that it’s set to launch <strong>before March 31, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>This exclusive news comes as Ubisoft publishes the delayed financial update deck that was pushed back and went hand-in-hand with a halt on trading, fuelling speculation about the company’s future.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-flag-remake-coming-very-soon">Black Flag Remake Coming Very Soon</h2>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that the yet-unannounced Assassin’s Creed Remake is set to launch before March 31st, 2026.</p>



<p>The first official sign of the announcement came during today’s delayed Ubisoft earnings, where one ‘unannounced game’ is set to be released before the end of the company’s fiscal year, which ends March 31st. It’s the only game on the slate <strong>not </strong>uncovered and is flanked by the likes of Rainbow Six Mobile, The Division: Resurgence, and Anno 117: Pax Romana.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Insider Gaming understands that this blanked-out game is the yet-to-be announced Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake, which is scheduled to release the week of March 23rd. </p>



<p>There’s plenty of hype surrounding the Black Flag remake, which is often considered one of the best Assassin’s Creed games ever made.</p>



<p>As of yet, Ubisoft has yet to officially announce the Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag Remake, but Insider Gaming has covered the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-release-date/">with a few exclusive reports</a> over the last year and a half. In the most recent Black Flag news, one leaker claimed that the Black Flag remake would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-new-details-claim/">more ‘RPG heavy</a>‘.</p>
