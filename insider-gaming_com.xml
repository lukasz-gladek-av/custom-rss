<p>Battlefield 6 has launched, and its all-time player peak on Steam keeps rising by the second, with the number sitting at over 700k at the time of writing, surpassing Call of Duty’s record. </p>



<p>The anticipation for Battlefield 6’s launch has been at an all-time high since the open-beta weekends, where players flocked in huge numbers. However, the beta has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-betas-smaller-maps-were-intentional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smaller maps</a> and fewer features to try out. The full version of BF6 has been released right now, and players are pouring in by the thousands. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-all-time-steam-peak-surpasses-700k-within-the-first-hour">Battlefield 6 All-Time Steam Peak Surpasses 700k Within the First Hour</h2>



<p>As spotted on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, Battlefield 6’s all-time Steam peak concurrent number sits at 704,005 at the time of writing, and the number keeps going higher every time you refresh the page. That’s not all, Battlefield 6’s launch numbers on Steam have also beaten Call of Duty’s all-time peak, which stands at 491,670. </p>



<p>The game has additionally beaten its all-time peak from the open beta weekends, which sat at 521,000. Moreover, it is just Friday; a whole weekend remains, so the number could go even higher as the days go on. </p>



<p>For those who haven’t checked out the title, Battlefield 6 brings back iconic all-out warfare, where players can wage war with infantry and vehicle combat, including fighter jets, tanks, and more. The game features tactical destruction, where players destroy their surroundings to gain a tactical advantage over their opponents. The title also introduces the new Kinesthetic Combat System, a global-scale campaign, several multiplayer modes, the massive sandbox mode, Portal, and an upcoming battle royale mode. </p>



<p>In other news, the developers of Battlefield 6 have confirmed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wont-use-anything-made-by-generative-ai-devs-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not use generative AI</a>. Also, players are already making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-community-is-already-making-star-wars-ships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars ships</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty maps</a> in the game’s Portal mode.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-can%E2%80%99t-i-play-battlefield-6-right-now-server-status-explained.1321984/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 has officially launched worldwide. Even though it has a shiny new campaign, everyone wants to play online multiplayer. Unfortunately, the EA servers are biting back, so let’s check why you can’t play Battlefield 6 right now, and what’s happening with the server queues.</p>



<p>It was claimed by a Battlefield 6 dev that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-should-be-ready-for-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">servers ‘Should be’ ready for launch day</a>. This was not the case as players were left queuing for the brand-new game. Messages don’t always spread very quickly or widely. Meaning, many of you Battlefield 6 owners have been left in the dark over the game’s servers and long queues.</p>



<p>This quick explainer should help you if you’re one of the many having trouble with BF 6 servers.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-can-t-i-get-into-battlefield-6-servers-right-now-are-they-down">Why Can’t I Get Into Battlefield 6 Servers Right Now? Are They Down?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a war, in more ways than one. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 launch day queues are excessive because so many people are trying to play the game at once. The player base is so big that it’s overloading the EA servers, meaning players have to wait for other players to quit the game before being able to play.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re being met with a “Game Servers Full” screen when trying to play <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, this is because the game’s maximum occupancy has been reached. The servers physically can’t handle any more players. It’s not because they’re down, they’re just full.</p>



<p>Again, EA was confident the servers would be ready, but it hasn’t worked out like that.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-the-battlefield-6-server-queue">How Long is The Battlefield 6 Server Queue?</h2>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 launch day queue is several hundred thousand players deep at times, meaning you could potentially be waiting a long time to play Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>Consider these queues like a random ballot: Some people got in right away, and some of you could potentially have to wait 10 minutes, all the way up to an hour or more, if you’re unlucky. The server queues will likely never be this bad again, and it’s up to EA to add more servers and allow more people into the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-battlefield-6-right-now">How To Play Battlefield 6 Right Now</h2>



<p><strong>The only way to play Battlefield 6 online multiplayer right now is to wait in the queue until it’s your turn to get in.</strong></p>



<p>We absolutely understand this isn’t the answer you want—<em>believe us</em>. But it’s the simple reality of the situation. Battlefield 6 is one of the hottest game launches of 2025. The beta broke record numbers, and this launch was always going to be fierce.</p>



<p>Battlefield Studios did issue a warning ahead of launch, but it hasn’t spread as quickly as the company probably would’ve liked.</p>

<p>A new announcement by ARC Raiders reveals the Expedition Project, a new way to incorporate optional progression wipes. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders is all set to release on October 30, 2025, and the developers recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-delay-explained-embark-game-not-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> why things went silent at the studio: they had dipped into the PvP pot for the game’s future. Now, they have provided players with new details about the progression wipe system, and that it isn’t mandatory. </p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-expedition-project-makes-wipes-optional">ARC Raiders Expedition Project Makes Wipes Optional </h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy blog post</a> by ARC Raiders design director Virgil, it was revealed how the game will handle progression wipes. The developers had already stated that they do not intend to do mandatory wipes and have stuck to their words. They understand the benefits of global wipes, as they provide experienced players with a fresh game; however, it doesn’t cater to players who don’t have much time to play. </p>



<p>The game features a ‘Projects’ feature that players can access at level 20. The first major project in this section is the Expedition Project, and once players complete it, they can reset their character. After completing a reset, players can do it again by completing another one of these projects. Expedition Project will operate on a roughly 8-week cycle, during which players can make progress towards their project. </p>



<p>Once the 8 weeks are complete, players will have the option to finalize the project for an additional week. If they have fulfilled all the project’s requirements, they can finalise it. If the player’s project isn’t ready during this window, their progress will be retained, and they can continue working on it until the next finalisation window. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-will-be-kept-and-removed-in-arc-raiders-progression-wipes">What Will Be Kept and Removed in ARC Raiders Progression Wipes</h2>



<p>Anything that is related to the character’s progress will be wiped, including levels, skills, items/inventory, workshop, crafting capabilities, etc. Any cosmetics earned or purchased, achievements, rankings, etc., will be retained. “Anything rooted solely in the metagame or involving real money will be preserved.” After completing their Expedition Project, players will be able to skip most of the onboarding and tutorial steps, which include unlocking certain features, maps, etc. </p>



<h2 id="h-benefits-of-completing-expedition-projects">Benefits of Completing Expedition Projects</h2>



<p>Players who complete Expedition Projects in ARC Raiders will receive some benefits and rewards; these are yet to be finalised, but these are the type of rewards players can expect: Permanent account unlocks for each completed Expedition, unique cosmetic rewards for completed Expeditions, account “buffs” that are applied for the duration of the following Expedition cycle, And sequential completions of the Expedition Project increase the magnitude of these buffs, up to a limit.</p>



<p>In other news, here’s why ARC Raiders was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-ban-arc-raiders-black-ops-7-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">censored in Black Ops 7.</a> What are your thoughts on ARC Raiders featuring optional progression wipes?
