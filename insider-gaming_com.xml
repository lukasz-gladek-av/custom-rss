<p>A pattern of stickers spelling out the N-word on a Desert Eagle skin caught the attention of several viewers during a professional Counter-Strike 2 match broadcast. The CS2 player using the skin has addressed it, claiming that they didn’t realize what was being displayed.</p>



<p>While the player may not have noticed during the match, the CS2 community certainly did, and so did the tournament organizer.</p>



<hr>



<p>During an online match in the ESL Challenger League in Europe, 9Pandas player Vladislav “Krad” Kravchenko was spotted using a Desert Eagle with a pattern of stickers spelling out the N-word. The stickers are mirrored because Krad plays left-handed, but it’s still very clear what the original sticker placement was trying to do.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The sticker spelling resulted in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1i6zt5e/9_pandas_krad_had_a_deagle_with_the_n_word_in_an/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post</a> on the primary Counter-Strike subreddit, where many speculated that Krad received the skin recently in a trade, and wouldn’t know what was on it until getting into a game. On X, Krad <a href="https://x.com/Kradcs/status/1882033348199297031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided</a> his explanation, claiming he had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-buy-counter-strike-skins-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought the skin</a> less than a week ago and didn’t notice the word spelled out because he plays left-handed.</p>



<p>When someone buys a skin through Steam or another market, the listing itself doesn’t include the sticker pattern. However, Steam and most markets offer players the option of inspecting the weapon in-game before buying. Additionally, the in-menu weapon inspection screen is always right-handed, even if the player’s settings are left-preferred, so an inspection would clearly show the inappropriate pattern.</p>



<p>The ability for players to have custom control over where they apply stickers was added almost a year ago. Immediately, players used the new feature to <a href="https://dotesports.com/counter-strike/news/cs2-devs-arent-mad-theyre-just-disappointed-in-nsfw-player-sticker-crafts">apply various NSFW words and designs</a>. On January 22, 2025, Krad <a href="https://t.me/kradcsgo/1531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> via his Telegram account that he has received a two week ban from ESL because of the Deagle.</p>

<p>Developer Don’t Nod has announced that Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2 has been delayed by a month. The announcement came on Wednesday via the <a href="https://dont-nod.com/en/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio’s website</a>. </p>



<p>Tape 1, titled “Bloom”, is scheduled release on February 18th while Tape 2, “Rage”, is now set to launch on April 15 rather than March.</p>



<p>“We want to give the team the necessary time to refine the experience, address more bugs, and enhance the storytelling for a truly immersive continuation of the journey,” the studio said.</p>



<p>“We feel that this extra time is necessary to ensure we deliver the experience players and fans deserve. We are confident that this delay will allow us to provide you with a richer experience and we can’t wait for you to live the full journey of Swann, Nora, Autumn, and Kat.”</p>



<p>Despite the delay, Don’t Nod says that they have “surprises” up their sleeves in between the release of Tape 1 and Tape 2. What those surprises are, however, wasn’t hinted at in the announcement. </p>



<p>Upon release, Tape 2 will be a free downloadable update for Lost Records.</p>



<p>Last October, Don’t Nod announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod-likely-facing-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“reorganization project”</a>  in order to “safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem”. This project would would result in layoffs at the studio, though it’s unknown if that was part of the reason for the game’s delay.</p>



<p>When it does release, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-launch-to-be-worst-when-it-comes-to-availability/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you are looking to get a brand new Nvidia RTX 5090 or RTX 5080 at launch, it may be tougher than you expected. According to multiple rumors circulating, the release of the next-generation of graphics cards from Nvidia is gearing up to be the “worst when it comes to availability” in the company’s history.</p>



<p>One board partner, Zotac, confirmed supply issues in an <a href="https://tagtag.co.kr/article/notice/1/18681/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message online</a>. The AIC says that their card won’t be available on January 30 as expected, instead it will be coming in early February. Still, Zotac says that “due to external factors” there’s the chance the card may not come until mid-February.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://benchlife.info/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-rx-9070-launch-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Benchlife</a>, they state that “communication issues” between Nvidia and its various AIC partners have resulted into limited supply for consumers.</p>



<p>Said gaming PC builder <a href="https://x.com/PowerGPU/status/1881758554836877675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerGPU</a>, “Warning you all now. The launch of the RTX 5090 will be the worst when it comes to availability. Already being told to expect it to be that way for the first 3 months.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nvidia for comment on these claims. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>



<p>The Nvidia RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-announces-geforce-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were revealed during CES</a> in early January. In addition to the two high-end graphics cards, Nvidia is set to release the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 sometime in February. An exact date, however, has yet to be announced by the company.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/5-highly-recommended-strategy-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-highly-recommended-strategy-games-armchair-generals-shouldn%E2%80%99t-miss.1089006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/5-highly-recommended-strategy-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With the ongoing Steam festival focusing on real-time strategy games, now’s the perfect opportunity to score a few titles you could potentially spend hundreds of hours playing. There’s a fair number of discounted RTS games I have personally spent up to 1,000 hours playing, and some are just too good of deals to pass up. Here’s a look at five highly recommended games on Steam’s Real-Time Strategy Fest!</p>



<h2 id="h-best-games-worth-buying-on-steam-s-rts-fest">Best Games Worth Buying on Steam’s RTS Fest</h2>



<p>If you’re a fan of the strategy genre, you’re in luck because there are countless releases annually, many of which shine. Despite the new releases and innovative indie studios taking a chance at refreshing the genre, a few old standbys tend to keep most players’ attention. With the current Steam Fest, now’s a good time to jump in for yourself!</p>



<h3 id="h-hearts-of-iron-iv">Hearts of Iron IV</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Have you ever watched a documentary or read a history book about WW2 and thought, “I could do it differently?” If so, then <strong>Hearts of Iron IV</strong> is your game, as it allows you to take economic, political, and military command of an entire nation, prepare for the upcoming war by building weapons and cementing alliances, and then fight in a global conflict. It’s challenging, rewarding, and expansive!</p>



<h3 id="h-stellaris">Stellaris</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Like Hearts of Iron IV, but in space, with more operatic moments and interesting setpieces. I mean, look at the screenshot above as a science vessel scans a planet with a red sun in the background. <strong>Stellaris </strong>is beautiful and one of the most straightforward Paradox titles for new players. It allows you to tell a grand story of a space-faring empire, which speaks to many!</p>



<h3 id="h-warno">Warno</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If taking command of an entire nation or galactic empire isn’t quite your speed, <strong>Warno</strong> offers a more grounded approach to real-time strategy by placing you in charge of a fighting force full of tanks, armored vehicles, infantry, helicopters, and even fighter jets. You’ll conquer territory on the map, fighting small-unit skirmishes and endure large-scale bombardments alike, for a bombastic and entertaining RTS experience!</p>







<h3 id="h-they-are-billions">They Are Billions</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>They Are Billions</strong> proves to be a highly challenging yet rewarding strategy game that took me by surprise. I didn’t think I’d spend hundreds of hours trying to survive the zombie apocalypse in a city-building survival and real-time strategy game, but this one kept me playing. You are the last bastion of humanity, surviving seemingly endless waves of the undead as they attempt to wipe humanity from the planet.</p>



<h3 id="h-total-war-rome-2">Total War: Rome 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>While there are certainly newer entries in the long-running Total War franchise, I will always retain a soft spot for <strong>Rome 2</strong> as one of my favorite historical strategy games in the series. It’s expansive, grand, and memorable, allowing players to restore the glory of Rome by conquering the Gauls to the north or moving into Greece to the east. The world is your oyster, so long as you have the coin and men to take it yourself!</p>
