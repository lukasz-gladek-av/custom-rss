<p>Call of Duty’s Double XP Weekends are the best. For a limited time, you can earn twice as much XP in CoD, and if you’re looking to quickly level up in Black Ops 6, the next Double XP Weekend is the dream ticket—so let’s look at all the information we have so far.</p>



<p>I love a Double XP Weekend in CoD. If you’ve not been able to play as much Call of Duty as you’d like, or you’ve had some time off, a Double XP Weekend allows you to catch up, make up lost ground, and get back into the leveling-up fray. It applies to all game modes too, so you don’t need to feel restricted in your methods or change your gameplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> is likely to continue the trend of the last few CoD games by having regular Double XP Weekends. With talk of Black Ops 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season One</a>, and even its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a>, let’s address another key topic right now.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-the-next-double-xp-weekend-event-date-is-in-black-ops-6">Do we Know When the Next Double XP Weekend Event Date is in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s off to work we go. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Right now, we don’t currently know when the first Black Ops 6 Double XP Weekend is expected to be. If we use 2023’s Modern Warfare 3 as a marker though, we should expect to see the first 2XP Weekend in the <strong>third or fourth week of November</strong>.</p>



<p>Modern Warfare 3’s first all-Double XP Weekend debuted on Nov. 22, last year, and the first instance of these special occasions usually drop around the end of November / start of December—expect Black Ops 6 to be the same.</p>



<p>For now, this is pure conjecture on our part, so take this speculation with a grain of salt. However, keep checking back to this guide as we are going to update it as we learn more about the first Double XP Weekend.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-double-xp-weekend-in-black-ops-6">What is Double XP Weekend in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Double XP Weekend is a period—usually <strong>lasting from Friday until Monday</strong>—in which players can <strong>earn twice as much XP for one or more of CoD’s leveling-up systems</strong>—and this is expected to be the same for Black Ops 6 too.</p>



<p>There are many ways to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-double-xp-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earn Double XP in Black Ops 6</a>, but this is one of the best. It depends on Treyarch, but Double Weekends can include one of the following: <strong>Double Player Level XP, Double Weapon Level XP, or Double Battle Pass XP</strong>. If you’re lucky, the developer may decide to be generous and allow you to have Double XP for all three!</p>

<p>Call of Duty has so many teams involved in its creation that it’s difficult to keep up with who’s involved and who the main company is behind its creation. Black Ops 6 introduces many new features and changes, and contrary to popular opinion, it isn’t being helmed by one company. </p>



<p>Infinity Ward officially got the CoD ball rolling with 2003’s Call of Duty and 2005’s Call of Duty 2. IW took a backseat to Treyarch in 2006 as the newbie more than adequately led Call of Duty 3. More teams have entered the conversation since, leading to players wondering who makes which games.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> is a continuation of the espionage side of Call of Duty—with a hint of round-based Zombies thrown in for good measure. The first-person shooter was been well-recieved, and we know who’s responsible for its success.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-made-black-ops-6">Who Made Black Ops 6?</h2>

<p><strong>Treyarch and Raven Software</strong> are behind the development and continued support of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Seeing Treyarch behind the wheel is no surprise as Black Ops is Treyarch’s baby. However, 2020’s Black Ops Cold War was the first title in the BLOPS portion of CoD to bring another team on board—Raven Software. History has repeated itself as Black Ops 6 is officially co-developed by Treyarch and Raven Software.</p>



<p>With a deep Campaign, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/">Liberty</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/">Falls</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terminus</a> Zombies maps (with more to come), and online multiplayer, there are a lot of plates to spin—but we do know both teams aren’t spinning every plate though.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-made-the-black-ops-6-campaign">Who Made the Black Ops 6 Campaign?</h2>



<p><strong>Raven Software</strong> is actually the developer behind the dramatic, single-player Campaign. The news was confirmed by <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/24107491/black-ops-6-reveal-campaign-multiplayer-and-zombies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision Blizzard</a> on June 9, for the Black Ops 6 Campaign reveal, “Development on the&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>&nbsp;Campaign is led by Raven Software.”</p>



<p>It might surprise you to know this was also the case for Black Ops Cold War. Raven handled the Campaign, whereas Treyarch focused its efforts on the Zombies and seasonal multiplayer content. The companies decided if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Everything you feel and experience in Black Ops 6’s Campaign is the direct result of Raven Software’s tireless efforts and creativity—and I’m not complaining as we got the unbelievable Emergence mission!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-made-black-ops-6-zombies">Who Made Black Ops 6 Zombies?</h2>



<p><strong>Black Ops 6 Zombies is being handled by Treyarch</strong>—and this includes the two current maps, as well as subsequent maps arriving in the future.</p>



<p>Treyarch’s Zombies portion of Vanguard was notoriously shallow, but this is only because of a stunted development time which forced the company to strip back the popular game mode. Now, in Black Ops 6, proper round-based Zombies is back. Powerful <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wonder-weapons-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Weapons</a>—including the monstrously powerful <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-ray-gun-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ray Gun</a>—and fun <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-super-hero-easter-egg-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Easter Eggs</a> all feature prominently.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-made-black-ops-6-multiplayer">Who Made Black Ops 6 Multiplayer?</h2>



<p><strong>Treyarch is also handling the Black Ops 6 online multiplayer component</strong>, meaning they handle everything from gameplay balancing to new content to the maintenance of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/are-black-ops-6-servers-down-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">servers</a>.</p>



<p>It’s a double-barrel effort from Treyarch, but as 20-plus-year veterans, it should have no problem balancing Zombies and multiplayer. It had no problem doing this with Black Ops Cold War, so we should have a bright year ahead of us.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> brings back the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-system-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traditional Call of Duty Prestige system</a>, which sees players progress through the ranks without a seasonal level restriction, unlocking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/">new weapons</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Equipment</a> as they edge towards rank 55. You no longer have to wait around before progressing your level, and entering Prestige has some pretty awesome bonuses on top of resetting your rank so you can do it all again. </p>



<p>Treyarch have implemented some cosmetic rewards alongside the Permanent Unlock token and new Icon you’ll receive as you make your way to Prestige Master. So, here’s every reward you’ll earn as you grind through all 10 Prestiges in Black Ops 6.</p>
