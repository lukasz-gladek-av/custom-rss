<p>For all of the completionists out there, here is everything you need to know about getting every trophy and achievement in Madden 26.</p>



<p>Earning achievements and trophies in sports games is much different than single-player narrative titles. Usually, they spoil story elements or give away secret easter eggs. But with&nbsp;Madden 26, for example, all you need to do is progress in different game modes and pull off miraculous performances on the field.</p>



<p>So without any further ado, let’s jump right into what you should expect.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-every-madden-26-achievement-amp-trophy">How to Get Every Madden 26 Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Playing as Josh Allen will make achievements easier. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although there aren’t many trophies in Madden 26, it will still be a challenge for players looking to complete 100% of the game. Regardless of what game mode you prefer, getting every achievement and trophy requires you to master every phase of the game.</p>



<p>With that in mind, here is everything you need to know about earning every achievement and trophy—credit to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/game/Madden-NFL-26/trophies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TrueTrophies</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-secret-trophies">All Secret Trophies </h2>



<p>There is only one secret achievement in Madden 26, and it is earned by forcing a fumble using the strip ball mechanic. </p>



<p>To use the strip button defense, it is R1 on PlayStation and RB on Xbox. For the best results, you should use this button when you are near the ball carrier and have an opportunity to knock the ball out of their hands. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-amp-trophies-in-madden-26">How Many Achievements &amp; Trophies in Madden 26?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 28 regular trophies and achievements in Madden 26 and one secret achievement. </strong></p>



<p>Most of the achievements should be easy to complete because there aren’t any restrictions on what difficulty you have to earn the trophy on, meaning you can adjust the settings to the easiest options and breeze through some of the challenges, such as finishing a game with at least 300 yards passing and no interceptions.</p>



<p>That being said, reaching max level with every Superstar position will take time and dedication. Additionally, it will be challenging to break the single-season passing and rushing records, regardless of how good you are at Madden. </p>

<p>Madden 25 supported crossplay, but let’s see if EA decided to bring the feature back for Madden 26.</p>



<p>Several game modes were overhauled for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-launches-on-august-14-first-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a>. In&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-franchise-deep-dive-shows-new-coaching-updates-gameplan-changes-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Franchise</a>, some of the significant new changes include coach archetypes, weekly playsheet updates, a new weekly highlights show, and more. Superstar added Game Day Beats, Sphere of Influence, and Career Chapters, which challenge you to complete specific objectives and build relationships off the field. </p>



<p>As for Ultimate Team, EA promised more content than before post-launch, and the solo experience has been overhauled. Let’s take a look at if these game modes support crossplay. </p>



<h2 id="h-does-madden-26-have-crossplay">Does Madden 26 Have Crossplay?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Crossplay returns in Madden 26. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Madden supports&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-26/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossplay</a>&nbsp;between PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>and PC</strong>, <strong>meaning it is not a feature for the Nintendo Switch 2. </strong></p>



<p>In addition, this is the first year that Madden 26 will not be available on last-gen consoles, so that means crossplay is not necessary. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-crossplay-in-madden-26">How to Use Crossplay in Madden 26 </h2>



<p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use crossplay.</p>



<ol>
<li>Open the&nbsp;<strong>EA Connect menu</strong>&nbsp;in Madden 26. </li>



<li>Navigate to the&nbsp;<strong>Player Search</strong>&nbsp;tab.</li>



<li>Search for a player using their&nbsp;<strong>EA Identification number</strong>&nbsp;or by using their&nbsp;<strong>platform identifier</strong>&nbsp;(Xbox Series X|S gamertag or PSN ID).</li>



<li>Invite them to a game or Dynasty save.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-which-madden-26-modes-support-crossplay">Which Madden 26 Modes Support Crossplay?</h2>



<p><strong>In Madden 26, you can play cross-platform in online Head-to-Head, Franchise, Ultimate Team, Superstar KO, and Superstar Showdown.</strong></p>



<p>In Ultimate Team, the Auction House does not support crossplay. As a result, PlayStation 5 players can only purchase cards from listings on the same console and vice versa. This might make cards more expensive, as there will be less supply and more demand because it doesn’t account for the entire player base.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-turn-crossplay-off-in-madden-26">Can You Turn Crossplay Off in Madden 26?</h2>



<p><strong>Crossplay is enabled by default, but you can opt out, regardless of which platform you are on.</strong></p>



<p>For players who opt in to cross-play, any leaderboard in any mode that supports cross-play will be a global leaderboard that includes players from all supported platforms. Players who opt out of cross-play will only see leaderboards for players on their own platform.</p>



<p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to turn off crossplay.</p>



<h3 id="h-xbox-series-x-s">Xbox Series X|S</h3>



<ol>
<li>Go to your&nbsp;<strong>Xbox</strong>&nbsp;<strong>settings</strong>.</li>



<li>Scroll to&nbsp;<strong>Account&nbsp;</strong>and click on&nbsp;<strong>Privacy and Online Safety</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Xbox Live Privacy</strong>.</li>



<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>View Details</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Customise</strong>.</li>



<li>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Communications</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Multiplayer</strong>.</li>



<li>Change “You can play with people outside of Xbox Live” to&nbsp;<strong>block</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-playstation-5">PlayStation 5</h3>



<ol>
<li>Go to the In-game&nbsp;<strong>Settings tab</strong>.</li>



<li>Select<strong>&nbsp;Gameplay Settings</strong>.</li>



<li>Toggle the crossplay option to off.</li>
</ol>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-easiest-shooter-to-get-good-former-pro-says/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-is-the-easiest-shooter-to-get-good-at-says-former-counter-strike-pro.1263885/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first-person shooter world is a diverse one populated by so many games, many of which boast a competitive scene that feeds into the wider esports ecosystem. From VALORANT to Counter-Strike, Apex Legends to Rainbow Six, and Call of Duty to Overwatch, first-person shooters are ten a penny these days.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, a former Counter-Strike pro player took a dive into the spread of games on the market, ranking them by how tough they are to master, from the perspective of a successful esports athlete.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-pretty-easy">‘It’s Pretty Easy’</h2>



<p>Fredrik ‘roeJ’ Jorgensen sat down for a lengthy interview ahead of the <a href="https://thunderpick.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Thunderpick</a> World Championship to review his career and sum up the state of the industry. Jorgensen started competing professionally in 2017 and retired earlier this year, but not before claiming more than $300,000 in winnings.</p>



<p>He revealed in his interview that he was earning around $8,000 a month at ‘his peak’, even though his team wasn’t qualifying for many major tournaments or sizeable events.</p>



<p>When the conversation turned to which games are the hardest to master, Jorgensen offered a breakdown of the top seven titles put to him, with <strong>only one </strong>being something other than a first-person shooter: Fortnite.</p>



<p>According to Jorgensen, the toughest first-person shooter to master is Apex Legends:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apex Legends is pretty hard to be honest. I think it’s like one of those battle royale games if you’re not good at the game or you don’t really understand what’s going on, I think you’re just gonna get killed instantly and you just spend your time flying down.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the other end of Jorgensen’s scale sat Call of Duty, one of the oldest and most popular first-person shooter franchises in the world:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When I think about Call of Duty, I think about Modern Warfare 2, where you just go in and you just play a team deathmatch and you just basically have to kill and you respawn and repeat.&nbsp; I think that’s one of the easiest games you can play.</p>



<p>Obviously, actually killing people is probably a bit harder, but just, you know, the sheer mechanics of the game is pretty straightforward. So, I say Call of Duty on that one. <strong>It’s pretty easy.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Counter-Strike, which was the game that put Jorgensen on the map, came in just two spots beneath Call of Duty on the scale, beaten in the toughness stakes by Rainbow Six Siege.</p>



<p>Do you agree with roeJ that Call of Duty is the easiest shooter to get good at? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kadokawa Corporation has recently registered a web domain for Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Anime. </p>



<p>Talks about a Sekiro anime have been circulating for a very long time; however, the latest development almost seals the deal. The only thing left now is an official announcement, which will also confirm who is involved in the upcoming project. Read more about the Sekiro anime web domain registration below. </p>



<h2 id="h-sekiro-anime-announcement-could-arrive-soon">Sekiro Anime Announcement Could Arrive Soon?</h2>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-web-domain-for-the-long-rumored-sekiro-shadows-die-twice-anime-has-been-registered.1263348/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1953100767453220870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>), Vestan has posted about the Sekiro Anime web domain registration on the forum. The domain has been registered by Kadokawa Corporation, which is the parent company of FromSoftware, the developers of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. The domain was registered on July 31, 2025, in Japan, and the name has been set as ‘SEKIRO-ANIME.JP’. It will expire on July 31, 2026. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leaker has also provided more information about the upcoming Sekiro anime. It appears that a studio called Qzil.la, the creators of Hell’s Paradise, is bringing the Sekiro anime to life. As it is a relatively new studio, the anime adaptation is expected to have a low episode count. Moreover, as the domain has been registered, a reveal could arrive “soonish”. However, as this information doesn’t come from an official source, players should take it with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>In other news, FromSoftware is reportedly in “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advanced development</a>” of an unannounced game that is expected to arrive next year. Additionally, Elden Ring’s movie director is likely more skilled at the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-movie-director-better-than-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">than most players</a>. What are your thoughts on a Sekiro anime web domain being registered? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>
