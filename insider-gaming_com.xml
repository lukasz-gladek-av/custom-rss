<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will make the jump to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026, it was revealed during Gamescom Opening Night Live in Cologne.</p>



<p>First released on Xbox Series X|S and PC in December 2024, Indiana Jones then released on PlayStation 5 back in April as Microsoft’s cross-platform support continued, and it’s now been confirmed that a Nintendo Switch 2 launch is planned.</p>



<p>Confirmation came during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live showcase, where a detailed look at the upcoming DLC, The Order of Giants, was shown, with the big Switch 2 reveal then following.</p>

<p>Fallout, the award-winning Amazon Prime television series, has received an all-new trailer for the upcoming second season during the Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom. </p>



<p>Fans have been patiently waiting for the second series to land since the first dropped in April 2024, and this new trailer has stoked that hype even further.</p>

<p>The second season of Fallout will unravel across the Mojave as we return to New Vegas for the first time since the 2010 Fallout game of the same name. This fan-favorite location has made for an exciting build-up to the second season, as for many, Fallout: New Vegas represents the best of the post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TsP09cZA7o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new trailer</a> that was showcased by Amazon Prime Video during Gamescom:</p>

<p>It was claimed earlier this year that ‘multiple Fallout projects’ are in development outside of the television show, but it hasn’t yet been made clear what they are. The assumption is that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-techland-dying-light-3/">Fallout 3 remaster is incoming</a>, but some fans have theorized that some kind of Fallout 76 current-gen overhaul is almost on the way.</p>



<p>The newest trailer for the Fallout television series shows how nicely it’s shaping up. It’s bigger, bolder, and more ambitious than the first season, and we’ll see the stories of our core trio of characters (Maximus, The Ghoul, and Lucy) unfold in a much more impressive way this time around. That’s for sure.</p>
