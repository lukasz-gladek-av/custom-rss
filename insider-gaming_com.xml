<p>Casual Mode is another headline-making addition to Call of Duty in Season 3. Warzone players can benefit from this helpful new battle royale variation designed to help you and improve your Warzone skills.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-season-03-patch-notes-warzone-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 and Warzone 3</a> is a surreal content launch aiming to bring back players who loved the game years ago when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-verdansk-is-back-calling-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> was first around. Season 3 is also trying to rekindle weary Black Ops 6 players’ love for CoD. On top of this are brand-new players who never had the chance to play Verdansk when it was around.</p>



<p>Activision infamously took the game out of circulation once Warzone Caldera launched. The decision has been reversed in 2025 with Warzone Season 3, and Verdansk isn’t the only thing that’s landed—say hello to Casual Mode.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-warzone-casual-mode">What is Warzone Casual Mode?</h2>

<p><strong>Warzone’s Casual Mode is a semi-tutorial mode featuring Bots and real players designed to bridge the gap between the battle royale’s Bot-only Bootcamp game mode and the PvE nature of real-time battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>The are four Warzone levels for players to choose: <strong>Bootcamp, Casual, Normal, and Ranked</strong>.</p>



<p>Bootcamp was first introduced for Urzikstan and features 20 real-life players in teams of four (yourself and three friends or randomly assigned teammates) against 24 Bots—also in teams of four. You drop into a small circle on the map and get to experience a bite-sized game of battle royale.</p>



<p>After this, players need to step up to a real lobby full of human players. This can be overwhelming, which is why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-launching-battle-royale-casual-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Mode</a> has been introduced.</p>



<h2 id="h-casual-mode-differences-compared-to-normal-warzone">Casual Mode Differences Compared to Normal Warzone</h2>



<p><strong>You get to experience a full-length game of Warzone featuring the entire map of Verdansk in Casual Mode, and the lobby consists of 28 Players and 120 Bots.</strong></p>



<p>This is a far greater number of opponents; you use the entire map, but the game is still largely Bots for the hand-holding experience. Many players might feel intimidated going into a proper game with human operators, so this is the perfect middle ground.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD Blog</a> introducing Casual Mode said: “This is designed as a stepping stone for players to go from the Warzone Bootcamp tutorial mode to an experience closer to our traditional, player-only, experience. Players can learn the game and hone their skills in a lower-stress environment while still embracing the core survival challenge of being the last squad standing among 148 players.”</p>



<h2 id="h-is-warzone-casual-worth-playing">Is Warzone Casual Worth Playing?</h2>



<p><strong>Warzone Casual offers a slightly more stress-free way to play and enjoy CoD’s battle royale, but it still features players who can destroy you very easily.</strong></p>



<p>With a ratio of 28 players to 120 Bots, chances are the majority of your combat is against AI until you reach the final few circles. This gives you a chance to grind Camos, earn XP, and soak in the atmosphere of Verdansk.</p>



<p><strong>But be warned</strong>: The community has complained that <em>Ranked Warzone players with high skill levels</em> are hopping into Warzone Casual. This might be because they’re grinding Camos or putting together gameplay compilations. </p>



<p>I stress that even though Warzone Casual hits the nail on the head, don’t be surprised to see a sliding demon come out of nowhere and melt you before you even get a chance to aim your weapon!</p>

<p>A reliable insider has claimed that Marathon might receive some sort of reveal next week.</p>



<p>Bungie recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-news-being-teased-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> Marathon on its social media accounts, hinting at a potential reveal in the coming days. Interestingly, Jeff Grubb also spoke about this topic during the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_7BU-Y6wdI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Mess Decides</a> (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-to-reveal-more-about-marathon-late-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamePost</a>). Grubb has stated that “late next week”, players will be able to finally learn “a lot more about Marathon”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not Grubb’s first mention of an April reveal for Marathon. A few months ago, he stated that Marathon wasn’t a part of PlayStation’s State of Play event as it probably has its own thing because that’s how Bungie operates for Destiny, too. Grubb <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a>, “I think April [is] when we will probably hear from them about Marathon. And it would be its own thing separate from the State of Play.”</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon has been under wraps since its reveal at the PlayStation Showcase event. Since then, the only update we have received was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dev talk</a> from the game director. However, we only heard about what was in the works in the game, along with some concept art for upcoming heroes. No actual gameplay was shown. If Marathon is revealed late next week, players will hope that the developers show up with a bunch of gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Bungie’s Marathon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-marathon-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order bonuses</a> were recently spotted on Steam. Also, according to claims, the dev’s upcoming ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-upcoming-gummy-bears-moba-is-inspired-by-smash-bros-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gummy Bears’ MOBA</a> is inspired by Smash Bros. What are your thoughts on the Marathon being revealed later this month?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/titanfall-3-2026-rumor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-titanfall-3-in-development-new-rumors-suggest-a-2026-release-date.1155204/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/titanfall-3-2026-rumor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New rumors have surfaced that Titanfall 3 is in development and could be revealed in later this year with a 2026 release date.</p>



<p>It’s almost tradition at this point that a new Titanfall 3 rumor needs to surface annually, and this time, it suggests that the game is in development and could be revealed at this year’s The Game Awards, with a release date of 2026.</p>



<p>The recent rumours originate from two different Titanfall leakers, who, at face value, have got decent track records when it comes to reporting Apex Legends and Titanfall news.</p>



<p>Leaker,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/YOROTSUKI_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YOROTSUKI_</a>, was the first to make the claim and that back in December 2024, they teased in some discord servers that Respawn was working on a new game. Another Apex Legends leaker by the name of <a href="https://x.com/Osvaldatore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Osvaldatore</a> then went on to corroborate the rumor with a tweet of a Titanfall 3 logo and had apparently spoken to YOROTSUKI being the scenes to verify that the game is indeed in development.</p>



<p>As for if the rumors are true or not remains to be seen (as always, take with a pinch of salt), but in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming podcast</a> (released later today), we discuss the possibilities of the information being real and what we’ve heard. </p>



<p>According to our sources, Titanfall 3 has already been cancelled and shut down at least twice, with one of the reasons being given is because the game was “too similar to Titanfall 2”. That being said, Respawn Entertainment has had several unannounced projects cancelled in the past year, and probably needs another huge title other than Star Wars Jedi as the Apex Legends playerbase continues to dwindle. </p>



<p>As far as we know, at least three unannounced projects have been cancelled at Respawn in the past year, one was a single-player first-person shooter set in the Apex Legends universe, a second was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-mandalorian-game-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single-player Mandalorian game</a>, and a third was an unannounced incubation project.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to EA for comment and have contacted sources to see if the rumor has any legs.</p>

<p>Krafton has announced that inZOI has passed 1 million units sold in its first week of launch in early access on Steam.</p>



<p>In a press release, it was also said that “Canvas,”&nbsp;inZOI’s in-game UGC (User-generated Content) sharing platform, showed strong levels of community engagement as it garnered more than 1.2 million players on the day of launch with over 470,000 pieces of uploaded content.</p>



<p>CEO CH Kim stated, “We are grateful and excited to present&nbsp;inZOI&nbsp;to players around the world through Early Access,” adding, “We will continue to actively communicate with players and foster&nbsp;inZOI&nbsp;as KRAFTON’s long-term franchise IP.”</p>



<p>The press release concluded by reiterating that the game’s future updates will introduce new content, including mod support and new cities, with all updates and DLC provided for free until full release.</p>

<p>inZOI’s success hasn’t been without controversy, though. On launch, clips started going viral showing players being able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-lets-you-run-over-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">run over children within the game</a>, an issue that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-developers-say-ability-to-run-over-children-was-a-bug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Krafton quickly addressed and called a bug</a>.</p>



<p>inZOI currently sits at around 25,000 concurrent players in the past 24 hours, with 87,000 being the peak concurrent player count.</p>
