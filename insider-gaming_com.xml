<p>Forza Horizon 6 could be set in Japan, following a fresh leak that seemingly confirms the location for the title, which has yet to be officially confirmed.</p>



<p>With Forza Horizon 5 now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on PlayStation 5</a>, and Forza Motorsport studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-motorsport-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turn 10 suffering huge layoffs</a>, all eyes are cast towards Horizon 6 as the next entry in the beloved franchise, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-forza-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phil Spencer confirmed would release in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Since first releasing in 2012, Playground Games has brought the Horizon Festival to Colorado, Southern France, Northern Italy, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. Now, it appears the franchise is heading to Japan.</p>

<p>In a now-deleted post, which was shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mvq1t0/australian_car_import_company_cult_classic_may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, Australian car import company Cult &amp; Classic posted an image of someone, said to be from the Forza Horizon team, down under, scanning Kei cars to feature in the series.</p>



<p>Kei cars are the smallest approved in Japan to drive on expressways and are rarely seen outside of the Far East, hence why someone from the Horizon development team would need to fly out to scan them.</p>



<p>If the setting is indeed in Japan, having an accurate representation of Kei cars would be needed for accuracy, as it would be weird to drive on the roads without seeing them, and it could tease that they will be purchasable in the game.</p>



<p>Of course, take this all with a significant pinch of salt as it is far from an official confirmation, but Japan has long been requested by the Horizon community, so it would be a perfect choice for Forza Horizon 6.</p>



<p>Japan is iconic in the street-racing scene, having been the location for The Fast &amp; Furious: Tokyo Drift movie.</p>



<p>Is Japan top of your wishlist as a location to play host to the Forza Horizon series? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3356/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is edging ever closer to release, and now the game has received an ESRB rating ahead of launch.</p>



<p>The ESRB rating follows on from receiving a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-rated-for-switch-2-by-south-korea-classification-board/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rating from the South Korean Rating Board</a> last month, with the game ticking yet another box ahead of a 2025 release window, which has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-reconfirms-2025-release-window-for-metroid-prime-4-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reconfirmed by Nintendo</a>.</p>



<p>While a precise release window has not been shared, the news must surely be on the horizon, given that ratings from two separate regions have now been confirmed.</p>



<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond-rated-t-by-esrb">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Rated T by ESRB</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s coming. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo store</a> has revealed the rating for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond issued by the ESRB is T for Teen, with the game featuring animated blood, violence, and in-game purchases.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is currently playable at Gamescom with a demo, further indication that a release is edging closer, and Nintendo could now be diverting attention toward the release following the recent Nintendo Direct focused on Kirby Air Riders.</p>



<p>Since the launch of the Switch 2, Nintendo has adopted an approach of handing big releases their own Direct show, having done so for Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Kirby Air Riders—the latter of which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases November 20</a>.</p>



<p>While Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, unlike the other three titles, is not a Switch 2 exclusive, it is still one of the biggest Nintendo releases set for this year, alongside the likes of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releasing October 16</a>.</p>



<p>Release date details for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond should now be on the horizon, given the ESRB rating, with only a few more boxes left to be ticked.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview-the-game-you%E2%80%99ve-been-waiting-for-is-worth-the-wait.1276527/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Like you, I’ve been waiting what feels like years for Hollow Knight: Silksong. I take that back, it HAS been years waiting for Silksong. The Metroidvania sequel was first announced in 2019, and we barely had a sniff of the game for years. Trailers and talk intensified this year, and it culminated with my special hands-on preview of Hollow Knight: Silksong, in the flesh at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-website-receives-big-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight</a> was utterly captivating. Yes, it was <em>another </em>Metroidvania title, focusing on backtracking and acquiring new abilities to further progression. But its sweet and innocent art style, its cutesy main character, and punishing combat are juxtaposed wonderfully. It was celebrated on launch and continues to be heralded all these years later.</p>



<p>Its legacy can only last so long before people want more—cue Silksong.</p>



<h2 id="h-sing-me-a-sweet-silksong">Sing me a Sweet Silksong</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s real, I saw it. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Don’t adjust your TV set, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-demo-confirmed-by-xbox-for-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was indeed playable at <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamescom 2025</a>. I endured a savage queue of over 2 hours to get a sniff of Silksong. As I’ve said, I love Hollow Knight, but you won’t see such fevered hype and excessive waiting for an ‘indie’ game like this for a while.</p>



<p>The demo build offers two entry points, with one being the beginning of the game and one much further in. As a Metroidvania master (I wish) and someone well-versed in the genre, I did what I didn’t see many other people do, and that’s jump straight into the deep end—was it ego or stupidity, I’ll let you be the judge.</p>



<p>Within seconds, it felt like Hollow Knight. Ori is possibly the only other game that rivals Hollow Knight in terms of presentation. It’s just breathtaking with stuff happening off-screen, and each mini-scene boasts a rich palette of shades and colors. I’ve played mechanically functional titles that looked dull and washed out, whereas Silksong’s verdict is in its name: Silky.</p>



<h2 id="h-crushing-combat-will-question-your-ability">Crushing Combat Will Question Your Ability</h2>



<p>There’s nothing fundamentally different from a movement standpoint. Hornet handles as smoothly as our predecessor, and within minutes, I was slashing away at rocks, piling up my currency, and finding secrets, shortcuts, and nearly drowning in lava-adjacent substances.</p>



<p>It’s not long until I’m thrust into a mini-boss encounter. I’ve had no time to prepare, I’ve quickly familiarized myself with the controls, and I’m met with a gradually building enemy rush of increasing difficulty. Miraculously, I prevail and feel smug—this is likely an encounter you’re not supposed to face until a handful of hours in. I land precise attacks with Hornet and quickly work out the enemy’s attack patterns. Doubt turns to confidence, and I’m ready to take on whatever boss this side of the demo possesses.</p>



<p>The gameplay loop is back. The slick dashes, jumps, and swipes are a key part of Hornet’s arsenal. Tactical jabs and prods, using Hornet’s agility and nimble frame to evade attacks; these are hallmarks of what made the original so special and accessible. I feel unbeatable, and after finding a key and unlocking the path ahead, I come to the boss—Lace.</p>



<p>I’ll cut to the chase: I die multiple times, and my demo session ends abruptly. I could not match the pace of Lace, and like many Hollow Knight bosses, her attack patterns aren’t ludicrously difficult and staggered like in various <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-non-fromsoftware-soulslike-games-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulslikes</a>, but you’ll spam buttons and flail more than a medieval weapon.</p>



<p>Each death brought me closer to a winning effort, and with a few more goes, I think I would’ve overcome the character’s might. But that’s the hook, right? Hollow Knight bosses don’t drag on for 5-10 minutes, but you still feel satiated in your hunger for victory, and you keep going. Ultimately, I walked away from my Silksong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025</a> preview with a smile. </p>



<p>If you’re a Hollow Knight fan, chances are, you’re going to love Silksong. Team Cherry, a release date, please?</p>



<hr>



<p>On a scale of 1-10, how much are you looking forward to Hollow Knight: Silksong? Do you think Hollow Knight is an all-time indie great? Can Silksong better it?
