<p>Electronic Arts and all associated studios are preparing to deploy Battlefield 6’s 1.1.1.0 update, which will introduce Season 1, the RedSec battle royale mode, and new maps and weapons. It’s also set to bring a whole host of bug fixes, tweaks, and quality-of-life improvements to the stellar shooter that was released on October 10.</p>



<p>Below, we’ve got the full Battlefield 6 1.1.1.0 patch notes for you to peruse, including the critical updates around movement and animations, weapon control tweaks, and fixes to hundreds of in-game bugs and glitches.</p>

<p>For years, the Halo Insider Program has enabled loyal fans to hear about the latest Halo playtests. It’s been discovered that PlayStation owners on PS4 and PS5 will be able to take part in future test sessions.</p>



<p>The Halo news keeps coming thick and fast—especially if you’re on PlayStation! First, the bombshell announcement that we knew was coming—but still hit hard all the same—was that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo Remake is coming to PlayStation 5</a>. It’s the latest ground to be broken between Xbox and PlayStation. We’ve now seen for ourselves that PS4 and PS5 gamers can even test Halo before new games launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-4-amp-playstation-5-owners-can-playtest-future-halo-games">PlayStation 4 &amp; PlayStation 5 Owners Can Playtest Future Halo Games</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This gives us new energy. Credit to 343</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s likely many of you have been part of the Halo Insider Program for a while. One of the biggest perks is the ability to “Participate in public ‘flights’ (hands-on playtests) of in-progress Halo game releases and provide feedback to our development teams.”</p>



<p>Ordinarily, this benefit has been reserved for Xbox and PC owners. This is no longer the case as the Halo Insider Console Flighting settings on your personal account now have new options.</p>



<p>We’ve tested this out ourselves, logged in, and can confirm you’ll now see some new PlayStation options for Halo Insider:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PlayStation 4</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 4 Pro</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5 Pro</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Even last-gen users won’t miss out! Check out <a href="https://x.com/gruntdotapi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">grunt.api</a>‘s post to see it for yourself.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Alongside <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, rumors are swirling that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-live-service-rumor-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a live-service Halo game is possibly in the works</a>. There could be even more stuff happening behind the scenes that we’re not aware of yet. All this means is there’s a good chance new Halo content is on the way that needs testing, and PlayStation gamers will get to help.</p>



<p>Is this the best time to be a PlayStation fan? Will you pick up Halo: Combat Evolved remake or test out new Halo titles on PS4 or PS5? Let us know, and share your thoughts on how bizarre this all is via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

<p>Sharkmob has announced the imminent end of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt, a free battle royale title with a vampiric twist. The game launched in 2021 but was sunsetted in a way in 2023 when the team announced it would no longer be providing updates to the game.</p>



<p>Now, the squad at Sharkmob is preparing for a complete shutdown, taking the servers offline and jamming a stake into the heart of Bloodhunt for good on April 28, 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-bloodhunt-laid-to-rest">Bloodhunt, Laid to Rest</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://bloodhunt.com/en-us/news/bloodhunt-servers-will-close-on-april-28-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent release</a>, the team at Sharkmob revealed the incoming shutdown of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>During these past four years, we have been thrilled to see your passion and dedication to&nbsp;<em>Bloodhunt</em>. Your feedback, creativity, and enthusiasm for our game has meant the world to us. However, despite you, our amazing community, the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable.</p>



<p>This has led us to make the difficult decision to take&nbsp;<em>Bloodhunt</em>&nbsp;offline.</p>



<p>The sun is now going to rise over Prague. We will be taking down the&nbsp;<em>Bloodhunt</em>&nbsp;servers on April 28, 2026, after which the game will no longer be available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The release mentioned that the game will remain <strong>fully playable </strong>until that date, but when it comes around, the game will no longer be available to download or play. To prepare for the shutdown, Sharkmob has delisted tokens, but the in-game store will remain open if you want to spend any residual credits you might have.</p>



<p>In the closing words of the release, Sharkmob wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for being with us on this journey. We hope your memories from the rooftops and back alleys of Prague will stay with you as they have with us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In 2022, Bloodhunt launched on Steam, moving out of early access and pulling in quite a few players for a niche, indie battle royale game. It peaked at 29,475 players on Valve’s flagship platform, but checking the numbers now, just 603 concurrent users were logged on in the last 24 hours.</p>



<p>Bloodhunt hasn’t broken 1,000 concurrent players on Steam since October 2024.</p>

<p>Fortnite’s regular slew of updates continues, and fresh off the back of another Fortnitemares event, the final part of Chapter 6 will begin after a special live event to mark the start of The Simpsons mini-season.</p>



<p>Following on from the Star Wars-themed mini-season earlier this year, The Simpsons will drop with a special Springfield map to explore, including various POIs, alongside a new Battle Pass, weapons, and more content.</p>



<p>A special live event is planned in Fortnite to mark the start of The Simpsons mini-season, and we’ve got all the details on what time you need to be in the game to catch it.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-fortnite-live-event">When is The Fortnite Live Event?</h2>

<p><strong>Epic Games has confirmed the live event for Fortnite ahead of The Simpsons mini-season will take place on Saturday, November 1.</strong></p>



<p>The long-awaited, and heavily rumoured, Simpsons-themed season will bring down the curtain on Chapter 6, with one month of themed content before the jump into Chapter 7 in December.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1982818597702713829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games’ tweet</a> confirming the live event announced that the alien duo Kang and Kodos will have a “special announcement” for players to watch in-game, which will likely be followed by a period of downtime before The Simpsons mini-season kicks off properly.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-is-the-fortnite-live-event">What Time is The Fortnite Live Event?</h2>



<p><strong>The live event ahead of The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite will begin at 11 AM ET, Epic Games has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>Expect the servers to be extremely busy, as they always are for the live events, and enter the game in advance of that time to secure your spot. At this stage, it’s unclear whether PvP will be turned off for the duration of the event to allow players to tune into the action without the threat of elimination.</p>



<p>In the table below, we’ve highlighted the start time of the Fortnite live event in major time zones across the world.</p>
