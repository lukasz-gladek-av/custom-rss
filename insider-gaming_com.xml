<p>The developers of Steal A Brainrot, a popular game within Roblox, are suing the developer of a copycat game in Fortnite called “Steal The Brainrot”.</p>



<p>According to the complaint, which was first reported on by <a href="https://aftermath.site/brainrot-roblox-court" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicole Carpenter at Aftermath</a>, Spyder Games and Speedy Simulator Gaming are suing Thomas Van Der Voort for copyright infringement. They say that Van Der Voort’s game, which was released two months after theres, within the Fortnite Island Creator Program <strong>“copies the Game’s [Steal A Brainrot] protectable expressions, including user interface elements, in-game objects, artwork, level design, animations, design aesthetics, game pieces, and the selection and coordination of game elements, colors, and shapes.”</strong></p>



<p>They <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/937410050/Brainrot-Goes-To-Court#content=query:defendant,pageNum:2,indexOnPage:0,bestMatch:false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">continue to say</a> that similarities in Van Der Voort’s game are “not merely the result of the games existing in the same genre or dictated by function”. It’s alleged that he “made conscious decisions” to copy the choices of Steal A Brainrot, which, within the Fortnite Creator Program, can earn the developers money. Carptenter says that Steal The Brainrot has reached peaks of over 531,000 players.</p>



<p>In a statement given to Aftermath, attorney Adam Starr, who represents Spyder Games and Speedy Simulator Gaming, says that his parties are doing this to protect their work, which they acquired a copyright for in August.</p>



<p>“We always prefer to resolve these matters cooperatively, but when necessary we will take appropriate legal steps to safeguard our IP,” he said.</p>



<p>The suing parties are requesting a jury trial for the claims presented. They are looking to see the infringing game taken down while also receiving damages and profits that can be attributed to the game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-have-early-access.1334086/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re getting toward the end of the year, which means it’s time for a new Call of Duty game. Black Ops 7 follows BLOPS 6, and if you want to get your boots off the ground quicker than most, early access is the perfect fuel to do so—we’re checking if Black Ops 7 has it for you.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was having a fairly tumultuous build-up toward launch. Battlefield 6 was the shooter on everyone’s lips, and Black Ops 7 possibly felt too similar to its predecessor for some. It all changed in the blink of an eye when Activision declared <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-will-have-non-disbanding-lobbies-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 was getting rid of skill-based matchmaking</a>.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is now back on the menu for many, so let’s check if there’s any possibility of early access.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-black-ops-7-early-access">Can You Play Black Ops 7 Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Judgment day is near. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no Black Ops 7 early access, meaning it doesn’t matter which edition you buy, all of them will give you access to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 at the same time—release day.</strong></p>



<p>One thing we can definitely say is the same as Black Ops 6 is the decision not to give Black Ops 7 players early access. You have to be patient and pass the time until launch. As usual, there is a super-duper edition (Vault Edition) offering a Season Pass, as well as the usual benefits, such as packs and items for CoD Zombies.</p>



<p>The good thing is that no one can gain an advantage before November 14. Once Black Ops 7 is out, everyone is near-enough on a level playing field and can upgrade weapons, earn attachments, and do everything in between at the same starting point.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-way-to-play-black-ops-7-early">Is There Any Way To Play Black Ops 7 Early?</h2>



<p><strong>No, the only way you could’ve played Black Ops 7 slightly earlier than anyone else was by pre-ordering the game to give yourself an exclusive early access beta window.</strong></p>



<p>If you didn’t know, Black Ops 7’s beta has come and passed. If you pre-ordered BLOPS 7, you were guaranteed a code to play the early access Black Ops 7 beta. That’s it, though, just the beta.</p>



<p>The beta window has closed, as has any chance to play Black Ops 7 before launch. We’ve seen other titles spontaneously announced impromptu betas—like ARC Raifers did—so we can’t theoretically rule out one more chance to play early. If this doesn’t happen, we’ll see you in a persistent Black Ops 7 lobby!</p>



<p>If you did play the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 beta, let us know if you enjoyed it. Can the removal of disbanding lobbies and a lack of SBMM make this one of the best CoDs ever?

<p>After receiving feedback on the Deluxe Pack: ex special booster pack, Pokémon TCG Pocket developers are working on a new Card Dex Registration update for next year. </p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket recently celebrated its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-year-one-anniversary-update-includes-huge-wonder-pick-buff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first anniversary</a>, and with that, we got some decent improvements, including a new share feature, an upgrade to trading, and a Wonder Pick Buff. Now, the developers are updating how the card players collect are registered in the Card Dex. </p>



<h2 id="h-cards-that-appear-in-multiple-booster-packs-will-be-registered-in-the-tcg-pocket-card-dex-for-all-corresponding-packs">Cards that Appear in Multiple Booster Packs Will be Registered in the TCG Pocket Card Dex for All Corresponding Packs</h2>



<p>According to a recent post on Pokémon TCG Pocket’s official <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1981707338969956720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the Card Dex Registration update will be released after summer 2026, and many players aren’t happy about the developers taking so long to implement this change. The new “changes are intended to provide players with a more enjoyable card collecting experience.” Check out how Pokémon TCG Pocket Card Dex will change in 2026 below: </p>



<ul>
<li>Firstly, whenever a player procures a card that appears in multiple booster packs, that card will be registered in the card dex for all corresponding booster backs. Which means if you receive a Mewtwo ex from a Genetic Apex booster pack, the card dex will register it for both Genetic Apex and Deluxe Pack: ex. </li>



<li>Secondly, the cards that players have already obtained, which include any cards collected from the Deluxe Pack, will automatically be registered in every applicable card dex retroactively. </li>



<li>Lastly, these changes, along with related UI improvements, will arrive after summer 2026. </li>
</ul>
