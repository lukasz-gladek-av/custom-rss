<p>MultiVersus is making major changes to how players can unlock fighters in the game. </p>



<p>Developer Player First Games <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-fighter-road" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has announced</a> the new “Fighter Road”. Starting November 12, this is the new way for players to unlock fighters in a more straightforward way than in the past.</p>



<p>“At its core,&nbsp;Fighter Road&nbsp;is a streamlined way to earn characters through an easy-to-follow progression track that players can tackle at their own pace,” the studio said. “This is a great way for&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>&nbsp;players to get their hands on the game’s robust and diverse cast of characters.”</p>



<h6 id="h-related-warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/">Warner Bros. Games Focusing on Batman, Mortal Kombat, And Hogwarts Legacy Moving Forward</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-how-multiversus-fighter-road-works">How MultiVersus Fighter Road Works</h2>



<p>Fighter road has players earning progress towards unlocking one new fighter at a time. The progress is earned through Fighter Road XP that gets awarded via matches, events, and the battle pass. </p>



<p>Of course, if you don’t want to work to unlock a specific fighter in MultiVersus, you can always just buy them outright with Fighter currency or Gleamium. However, Fighter currency will no longer be available starting with Season 4 on November 12, so what you spend comes from what you’ve earned to that point.</p>



<p>As far as tracking the progress towards fighter unlocks, Player First Games says that characters will be broken down into tiers based on “a number of factors”.</p>



<p>“The first tier, for example, consists of Shaggy, Banana Guard, Wonder Woman, and Batman,” the said. “While characters are unlocked in a specific order in Fighter Road, some tiers allow for players to choose which character they want to work toward unlocking next. </p>



<p>“Characters that are already owned by the player, will be omitted from the Road and, if the player wants to unlock any characters within a tier using their existing character tokens, they can still do so. As players progress on the Fighter Road, their progress will be displayed on a post-match screen that highlights their progress on the reward track.”</p>



<p>Should you complete the Fighter Road and unlock all of the fighters, any additional earned Fighter Road XP will be converted to Battle Pass XP at a 40% rate.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 starts on November 14, and with it comes plenty of additions for players. From weapons to modes to general content, there’s no shortage of new things coming to the game. One area that many fans were excited to learn more about after their tease were the new multiplayer maps for Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>As part of its blog detailing everything for Season 1, Activision gave full details on the new maps coming to the game. In total, there will be four new maps, one remastered map, and one variation coming during Black Ops 6 Season 1. </p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-weapons-black-ops-6-coming/">Every New Weapon in Black Ops 6 Season One (and How to Get Them)</a></h6>



<p>The four new maps are Hideout, Heirloom, Extraction, Racket. Hacienda&nbsp;returns from Black Ops 4, and Nuketown gets a Holiday season variant. Three of the maps will be available at launch while the other three come mid-season.</p>



<p>You can get full details on the new maps below <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Maps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Activision</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-maps">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 Maps</h2>



<h3 id="h-hideout-launch-6v6-medium-sized">Hideout (Launch) – 6v6, Medium-sized</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Sharpen your combat skills in this mid-sized Multiplayer map featuring an extensive training site including target practice, an obstacle course, and a lifelike recreation of a vault and security room to help plan for the next mission to hit the Luttazzi crime family.</em></p>



<p><em>The vault and blueprints buildings offer intense, multi-level indoor combat while the armory and open bus set the stage to ambush passing enemies.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h3 id="h-heirloom-launch-2v2-6v6-medium-sized">Heirloom (Launch) – 2v2, 6v6, Medium-sized</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Crash a private showing of Luttazzi family art to create a diversion for the other Rogue Black Ops team as they execute the real job. Navigate in and around a huge sculptural centerpiece in the main exhibit or branch out into the lobby or a side exhibit for a closer fight.</em></p>







<figure></figure>



<p><em>All hell has broken loose in the aftermath of a Crimson One ambush when the attack on the Luttazzis goes sideways. The burning rubble of a downed helicopter and a dead pilot signal an attack on the Avalon Heliport, a typically peaceful tourist destination where clients can book sky high views of Avalon’s breathtaking landscape.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-racket-mid-season-2v2-6v6-small-sized">Racket (Mid-Season) – 2v2, 6v6, Small-sized</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Time to crack open the heart of the Luttazzi money laundering operation and hit them where it really hurts. Breach the premises in this small-sized underground bank vault, a line of broken tiles marking the path of the center bulldozer placed before the vault of golden bars. Defaced pieces of art and the crossed-out emblem of the Luttazzi family indicate not just greed but malicious intent.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-hacienda-mid-season-6v6-medium-sized">Hacienda&nbsp;(Mid-Season) – 6v6, Medium-sized</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Last seen in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 4</em>, the iconic competitive map returns, sending Operators back to the infamous vineyard estate. Battle within the open-air, two-story mansion with surrounding views of the pristine courtyard below. From the grand foyer past the lion statue, head toward the showroom garage or move out to the garden to keep the fight outside. On the other end of the estate, marvel at the built-in aquarium above the vault.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-nuketown-holiday-mid-season-6v6-small-sized">Nuketown Holiday (Mid-Season) – 6v6, Small-sized</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>A Holiday-themed version of Nuketown with snow, decorations, and more.</em></p>
