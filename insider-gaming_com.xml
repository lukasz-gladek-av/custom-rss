<p>LEGO has announced that a new Legend of Zelda set is coming in 2026, though details on what exactly it entails are scarce.</p>



<p>The partnership between LEGO and Nintendo has seen a host of epic sets released, including the Legend of Zelda Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set and a host of Super Mario sets, and the catalogue is being expanded upon next year.</p>

<p>A short video on the LEGO website shows a minifigure of Link, with Zelda blurred in the background, standing still as an ominous shadow approaches.</p>



<p>The video ends with a message for builders across the world, telling them to ‘Build the Legend’ and confirming a new set is coming in 2026. However, that’s all the details that are available for now.</p>



<p>LEGO and Nintendo are set for a big year in 2026, as it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed back in March</a> that Pokémon sets are coming next year—coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the franchise.</p>
