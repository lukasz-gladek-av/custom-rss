<p>After a 14-year-long wait, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games</a> has finally released their 2010 hit title, Red Dead Redemption, on PC. So, if you’re looking for a fresh start to John Marston’s story, don’t forget to implement these best PC graphics settings during your playthrough.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-graphics-settings-for-red-dead-redemption-on-pc">Best Graphics Settings for Red Dead Redemption on PC</h2>

<p>Considering Red Dead Redemption is over a decade-old game, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">system requirements</a> are more on the demanding side. However, even if you have somewhat dated hardware, you can still enjoy the game at higher frames without losing quality. Just use the settings mentioned above.</p>



<p>Unlike Red Dead Redemption 2, where the graphics options are much more robust, you don’t get that in this game. But to get the optimal performance, you can tweak it a little bit as per your liking.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-0-15-5-patch-brings-fall-weather-%E2%80%98matching-inventory%E2%80%99-and-more.1023906/</guid>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s latest patch – 0.15.5.0 – is being implemented today, October 31. It’s bursting with features and changes, but it’ll take the game offline for several hours while it’s being deployed and tested. One of the standout tweaks to the game coming with 0.15.5 is the introduction of fall weather – which means we’re one step away from winter and that damned snow.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-tarkov-s-0-15-5-patch">What’s in Tarkov’s 0.15.5 Patch?</h2>



<p>Tarkov’s 0.15.5 update has plenty packed into it.</p>



<p>First, there’s the switch to fall weather, marked by orange and brown leaves and foliage, crispy terrain underfoot, and low-sitting sunscapes that blind you at the wrong moment every time. In a few weeks, we’ll get <strong>late </strong>fall, which is a different thing entirely. It’s the preface to winter, so it’s not long until we get snow back in Tarkov.</p>



<p>One of the best features being added with the 0.15.5 patch is the ability to interact with your stash, profile, and even the Flea Market while matching. It’s limited to the earliest phase of matching, which means you’ll need to move quickly, but it’s expected it’ll be expanded later as a feature.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, you’ll now get in-game rewards for unlocking certain achievements. These rewards won’t disappear when you undergo a wipe – once you’ve got them, you’ve unlocked them for life. For instance, if you completed the full Tarkov Mystery event, you’ll unlock the ‘Mr Kerman’s Cat Hologram’ item.</p>



<p>Players will also be able to pin items in the stash following the rollout of the 0.15.5 patch. You’ll also be able to lock items, preventing you from accidentally using or selling them. </p>



<p>Battlestate Games has also adjusted transition points, introduced new shotguns and attachments for a string of assault rifles, and fixed various bugs and issues in the game.</p>

<p>Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, has gone on record stating that Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty launch <strong>ever</strong>. This news came amid Microsoft’s first-quarter earnings call, held just days after Black Ops 6 hit the market.</p>



<p>This was the first Call of Duty game to be released on Game Pass on day one, which was a huge win for Xbox. It was mentioned by Nadella that the launch of Black Ops 6 set a record for the number of new Game Pass subscriber adds.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>Speaking during the Microsoft call, Satya Nadella said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Last week’s launch of Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty release ever, setting a record for day one players as well as Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day. </p>



<p>And unit sales on&nbsp;PlayStation&nbsp;and Steam were also up over 60% year-over-year. This speaks to our strategy of meeting gamers where they are by enabling them to play more games across the screens they spend their time on.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since dropping worldwide, Black Ops 6 has gone from strength to strength. We reviewed it at launch and awarded it a lofty score, recommending that Call of Duty fans everywhere invest in this wondrous game. From the campaign to the Zombies, and from the multiplayer to everything that’s coming next, it’s well worth the time and effort you’ll pour into it.</p>



<p>On November 14, the game’s first season will go live, introducing the first content drop, amongst other things. Also, on November 1, Nuketown returns to Call of Duty, with Treyarch having assembled a remaster of the original map that appeared in 2010’s Black Ops.</p>



<p>Have you played Black Ops 6 yet? Do you think it’s one of the best games in the series? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
