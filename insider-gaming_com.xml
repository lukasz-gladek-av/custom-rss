<p>During a new interview, Gearbox CEO revealed how Borderlands’ iconic comic-book-inspired art style came to be. </p>



<p>With only 10 days left until Borderlands 4’s release, players have started learning new tidbits of information. Most recently, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-trophies-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete list of trophies and achievements</a> for the game surfaced online. Now, the developers have revealed how they zeroed in on the game’s beloved art style. </p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-devs-started-working-on-a-new-art-style-right-before-the-alpha-milestone">Borderlands Devs Started Working on a New Art Style Right Before the Alpha Milestone</h2>



<p>In a conversation with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/01/the-behind-the-scenes-story-of-the-art-style-swap-that-saved-borderlands-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameInformer</a>, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford discussed how Borderlands’ art style was developed and the numerous hurdles they had to overcome to achieve it. When development began for the original game in 2005, the devs were working on six different art styles, which varied from safe to over-the-top.</p>



<p>At the start, they felt that “it’s kind of got to be realism or there’s just no market opportunity.” However, it “just wasn’t exactly right for what the look and feel and vibe of what Borderlands was supposed to be – it didn’t match the gameplay.” Adam May, the art director for Borderlands 4 and a character modeler for the original game, revealed that when Fallout 3 was released, the developers realised that they were in the “same visual place” as Bethesda’s title.</p>



<h2 id="h-random-doodles-led-to-the-creation-of-borderlands-beloved-art-style">Random Doodles Led to the Creation of Borderlands’ Beloved Art Style</h2>



<p>At that time, May was sitting next to a concept artist for the original game, Scott Kester, who used to doodle “illustrated graffiti” during their free time. One of the characters created in these doodles eventually evolved into Captain Flynt, marking the birth of the iconic Borderlands art style that players know and love. With the help of Kester and executive producer Brian Martel, May transformed these 2D sketches into 3D game art and then pitched to Pitchford. </p>



<p>It was a sticky time for them as the game was on tight deadlines and was about to reach its alpha milestone. At that time, they pitched the idea of working on a brand new art style for Borderlands, and Pitchford miraculously agreed to give them two weeks to work on it. The CEO immediately regretted the decision, as he felt that the idea these guys were working on would have to be rejected, given the time constraints. </p>



<p>After the two weeks had passed, Pitchford entered the room, afraid of the inevitability, but to his surprise, the art team had worked wonders. As soon as he laid eyes on the new art style, he felt “it’s f—ing right; It’s right”. “It feels right. And it’s like everything we knew about what was wrong was confirmed when we felt it was right.”</p>



<h2 id="h-going-back-to-the-drawing-board">Going Back to the Drawing Board</h2>



<p>As soon as the new style was finalized, Pitchford knew it would take considerable effort to get it approved by 2K. Surprisingly, after the bit of back and forth, they agreed, and then most of the stuff had to be redone from scratch. The game was in development for several years at that point, and changing the art style meant leaving almost all the levels and characters behind. Only Trash Coast and one other level remained, and the rest was rebuilt. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-borderlands-4-have-crossplay-split-screen-status-explained/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-borderlands-4-have-crossplay-split-screen-status-explained.1286409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Borderlands franchise has always prided itself on its multiplayer and inclusivity. The games are still wild rides if you play them by yourself, but let’s see if Borderlands 4 maintains its co-op, split-screen, and crossplay focus for the newest sequel.</p>



<p>I think Gearbox is very excited about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>. Not only did Randy Pitchford bring the game’s release date forward (an unheard-of move), but we raved about it on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive preview</a>, and Randy thinks it can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">break 100 million units</a>!</p>



<p>If you’re excited about Borderlands 4 and want to know if you can play with friends across different platforms, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-crossplay-in-borderlands-4">Is There Crossplay in Borderlands 4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Borderlands 4 team, assemble. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Borderlands 4 has complete crossplay functionality across every platform the game is launching on.</strong></p>



<p>You can buy Borderlands 4 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2. Pretty much every major multi-platform market box is ticked off for this one. It’s great to see the Nintendo Switch 2 getting involved in third-party conversations, and if you are buying Gearbox’s newest title on Switch 2, you can play it with people on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and vice versa!</p>



<p>As Handsome Jack would say: “Butt Stallion says ‘Hello.” It’s not a relevant quote, but I love it.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-borderlands-4-in-split-screen">Can You Play Borderlands 4 In Split-Screen?</h2>



<p><strong>Gearbox has confirmed that Borderlands 4 also has split-screen multiplayer, but it’s more limited compared to general crossplay.</strong></p>



<p>All this information is via the Borderlands 4 <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/en-GB/borderlands-4/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ</a>. Under a section discussing the shooter’s co-op options, here’s what it says: “Borderlands 4 supports up to 4-player co-op online across all platforms, as well as <strong>2-player splitscreen couch co-op on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S</strong>.</p>



<p>To reiterate, split-screen gameplay is only available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. </p>



<p>You’re out of luck if you want to do this on the Nintendo Switch 2 or PC. The FAQ doesn’t explain why this is; the only thing we need to know is that this is the case. End of story. We can lock that answer up in the vault and move on.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-if-borderlands-4-has-cross-progression">Do We Know If Borderlands 4 Has Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p><strong>We unfortunately can’t say for certain if Borderlands 4 has cross-progression.</strong></p>



<p>The FAQ covers a variety of topics in great detail. However, one aspect not covered is cross-progression: The ability to transfer your save file across different platforms. Free-to-play live-service games commonly have cross-progression, but for now, we’ll have to put a question mark next to this one until we get clarification.</p>
