            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An analyst has claimed that Embark Studios made ARC Raiders on a $75 million budget, including marketing.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is easily one of the most popular titles from 2025, with Embark Studios hitting it out of the park with their new extraction adventure. The title also received a massive update recently, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-significantly-impacts-looting-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke some systems</a> but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-update-1-13-0-patch-notes-solo-vs-squads-bird-city-open-parties-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added a lot of new content</a>. However, today we aren’t talking about that; instead, we are talking about how much it costs to make the game. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-budget-reportedly-revealed">ARC Raiders Budget Reportedly Revealed</h2>



<p>In the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58P5sZJ3Vho" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SIFTD Games</a> video, industry analyst Michael Pachter revealed the budget for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a>. The new video explores whether Ubisoft will survive after the recent restructuring announcement, with Patcher sharing his insights on several topics. Towards the end of the video, Patcher discusses different game budgets and timelines, where the cost of making ARC Raiders was revealed. </p>



<p>Patcher states that Ubisoft taking 5 years to develop a game and selling only 5 million units is not sustainable; “3 years is plenty.” He then talks about people bringing Rockstar into comparison, which might be $1.5-2 billion on GTA 6, but don’t understand that “they are going to make that $2 billion back in the first week.” </p>



<p>The analyst adds that everybody shouldn’t be comparing themselves to “GTA, FIFA, or the former glory of Call of Duty,” instead, they should compare themselves to ARC Raiders. Patcher then drops a secret, stating, “ARC Raiders cost $75 million to make.” It was developed over 3 years, had a team of 70 developers, and included marketing in the budget. Patcher added that the game has already made $500 million from 12 million-plus units sold and will “probably” make close to a billion. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#967)—Clues and Answers for Monday, February 2]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-february-2-967/</link>
            <guid>1422430</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Monday, and while it’s time for a new week in your world, it’s also time for a new NYT Connections puzzle. I know you love them! But I also know you sometimes want to get the best NYT Connections hints squared away as soon as possible to start your day. That’s why I’ve outlined the answers and solutions below, just for you!</p>



<p>Read on to quickly resolve today’s NYT Connections puzzle.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-2">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 2)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #967:</p>



<ul>
<li>POPULAR</li>



<li>PERIOD</li>



<li>CROSS</li>



<li>STAMP</li>



<li>SPAN</li>



<li>PSALM</li>



<li>PASS</li>



<li>RYAN</li>



<li>LANYARD</li>



<li>STRETCH</li>



<li>REACHER</li>



<li>MARPLE</li>



<li>FAIR</li>



<li>INTERVAL</li>



<li>WRISTBAND</li>



<li>BOSCH</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Words you’d use to describe how long something lasts.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Items that let you <em>prove you belong</em> somewhere — concerts, events, secure areas.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> Last names of lead characters from popular thriller/crime novels and TV adaptations.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word becomes a type of tree when you add or remove a single letter.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 2:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-2-967">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 2 (#967)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– INTERVAL, PERIOD, SPAN, STRETCH</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – LANYARD, PASS, STAMP, WRISTBAND</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BOSCH, CROSS, REACHER, RYAN</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – FAIR, MARPLE, POPULAR, PSALM</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov Anti-Cheat Plea Gaining Community Traction]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-anti-cheat-community-playsafe-id/</link>
            <guid>1422418</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov has long had an issue with cheaters, and the developer in Battlestate Games has always professed how much of a full-time job it is to constantly combat them. For every head you eviscerate, two more pop up – it’s that adage linked to the concept of the hydra, but in this case, the mythical monster is very real, and it concerns <strong>malicious gamers</strong>.</p>



<p>Recently, a new community-backed initiative (or plea) has started gaining traction within the Escape from Tarkov space. Long-term fans of the hardcore extraction title are requesting that Battlestate Games implement <strong>PlaySafe ID</strong> verification, echoing a successful move made recently by SCUM’s developer.</p>







<h2 id="h-could-playsafe-id-change-the-game-in-escape-from-tarkov">Could PlaySafe ID Change the Game in Escape from Tarkov?</h2>



<p><a href="https://playsafeid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlaySafe ID</a> is all about anti-cheat mechanics and player protection, encouraging the facilitation of verified matchmaking features that link <strong>legitimate players </strong>with <strong>other </strong>legitimate players. The technical infrastructure behind it is much more complex than that, but the long and short of it is that it <strong>works </strong>as an anti-cheat solution and is <strong>not </strong>disruptive.</p>



<p>In a trending suggestion on the Tarkov Community site, which regularly hosts player-backed initiatives ranked by user votes, it has been requested that Battlestate Games ‘finally beat cheaters with PlaySafe ID’.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://tarkov.community/posts/10017/finally-beat-cheaters-with-playsafeid-just-like-scum-did" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the suggestion had pulled in</a> 153 total votes, of which 93% are in favor of the recommendation. In the comments, users spoke positively of PlaySafe ID and the potential protection gains the company could provide if it were to join forces with Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>The suggestion reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This isn’t about punishing legit players — it’s about finally protecting them. At this point, a system like PlaySafe ID feels like the only solution that can actually work long-term.</p>



<p>So, after the successful rollout of PlaySafeID in SCUM, it’s time to seriously talk about bringing it to Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Let’s finally get rid of cheaters, that have plagued us since the alpha of this game</p>
</blockquote>



<p>PlaySafe ID started probing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/anti-cheat-firm-plans-rid-tarkov-hackers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Escape from Tarkov space</a> back in June 2025, revealing an interest in working with the developers to improve the state of play in the world’s biggest extraction shooter title.</p>



<p>In August 2025, the company backed an investigative report and survey that revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/report-gamers-encounter-cheaters-online-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more than 80% of gamers</a> had encountered cheating in an online game. It’s no big secret that Escape from Tarkov is one of the most troubled games in that respect.</p>
