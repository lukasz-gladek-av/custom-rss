<p>MADFINGER Games has revealed the Winds of War update (0.3), coming soon to Gray Zone Warfare, an open-ended tactical extraction shooter released in April 2024. It’s a massive, community-led update that is positively packed with new features and changes, and as a fan of the game, I’m here for all of it.</p>



<p>At the heart of the update are changes to the game’s PvP mechanics, which will encourage players to actively engage in fights with one another. But beyond that, there are <strong>many </strong>features that will improve the game’s realism, quality of life, and accessibility.</p>



<p>Let’s dive into what we know about Winds of War, the next update for Gray Zone Warfare.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-paradigm-shift">Paradigm Shift</h2>



<p>I’ve already covered the PvP changes coming to Gray Zone Warfare in another walkthrough, so feel free to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-gameplay-loop-pvp/">check that one out here on Insider Gaming</a>.</p>



<p>I can’t stress how much the Winds of War update is filling me with anticipation for the future of Gray Zone Warfare. I recently sat down with MADFINGER Games’ Rick Lagnese to go through everything that’s coming to this stunning open-world tactical shooter, which has sold 1.5 million units since being released in April 2024.</p>



<p>The immersion and realism in Gray Zone Warfare is being bolstered in Winds of War.</p>



<p>For instance, the dynamic weather system is being introduced and fully fleshed out, and some of the effects, such as rain, are nothing short of jaw-dropping. Having seen them first-hand before the update was revealed, I can attest to the depth these mechanics will add to the open world of Lamang.</p>



<p>This weather system includes storms, fog, wind, and sun, and every setting has an impact on the game’s world. There’s even a forecast system that’ll allow you to plan your raids more effectively. </p>



<p>The team at MADFINGER has also updated the game’s health system and changed how you’ll fight and stay alive. The new mechanic that allows you to drag downed teammates into cover is something I’m very interested in.</p>



<p>On that note, playing as a squad will now offer an enhanced experience, with dynamic, real-time tasks popping up as you explore the game’s open world. These tasks will be much more challenging and will <strong>actively require </strong>a dedicated team for them to be completed, but similar events will also be up for grabs for solo operators.</p>



<p>In terms of accessibility, localisation has been expanded, with more translated content being available. The team has made sure that <strong>eleven </strong>languages are represented in the Winds of War update. </p>



<p>The quality-of-life change I’m most looking forward to is the ability to radio back to base when you’ve completed a task, rather than needing to call in a chopper and go back just to seek confirmation of completion. That’s a game-changer, and in the massive open-world environment of Lamang, it’s a sorely needed upgrade.</p>



<p>Oh, and MADFINGER is working to eradicate LZ camping in the Winds of War update, so look forward to that!</p>



<p>What change are you most looking forward to as part of the Winds of War update? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft has unveiled Xbox Copilot for Gaming, a new tool aimed towards being a the “ultimate gaming sidekick” for players. </p>



<p>In an appearance on the official Xbox Podcast, Xbox Corporate Vice President of Gaming AI Fatima Kardar unveiled the AI-powered tool to the world. The announcement also included a detailed post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/13/new-copilot-for-gaming-save-time-help-get-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>



<p>“This AI-driven sidekick is designed to be your personalized gaming companion, helping you get to your favorite games faster, coaching you to improve your skills, and connecting you better with your friends and communities,” Jeff Rubenstein, director of Xbox editorial, said. “Copilot for Gaming will be there when you need it but out of the way if you don’t.”</p>



<p>During the podcast, an concept example of how the new tool could work was shown using Minecraft.  In the game a player picked up wood and entered a prompt asking “Okay, I’ve got some wood. What do I do with that?” Copilot for Gaming answered by explaining how to turn the gathered oak logs into wooden planks.</p>



<p>Another example shown involved Overwatch. A player asks the tool for help on who to pick after the hero they wanted, Echo, was already selected.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Copilot Is Coming To Gaming, Xbox Play Anywhere Updates, And More | Official Xbox Podcast" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZoUDVNjDUSw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“Echo’s taken, but Cassidy would be a solid pick with this team,” Copilot says. “His mid-range hit scan and Mercy’s damage boost will work great on Ilios Ruins. Plus you’ve done great with him on this map before.” </p>



<p>After the player dies during the game, Copilot explains that it happened because they stayed in the fight for too long and suggested to regroup with their team the next time they are in a similar situation.</p>



<p>The tool will even let you pull up situation-specific advice for the game and moment you are in, according to Microsoft.</p>



<p>Everything shown during the podcast were proof of concepts and not actual gameplay uses. As far as a release date, Copilot for Gaming will start in a slow rollout on mobile devices for members of the Xbox Insider Program “soon”. A release on other devices and then to the general public will happen “gradually”.</p>
