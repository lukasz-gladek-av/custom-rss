            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new interview, Ubisoft Co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed that two new Far Cry projects and multiple Assassin’s Creed games are in development.</p>



<p>Of course, for those in the loop with Insider Gaming, you’d know that we’ve been reporting on these games for the last two years, so Guillemot’s announcement shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p>







<p><span>The two Far Cry games are <span>codenamed ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-story-details/" target="_blank">Blackbird</a>‘ and ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" target="_blank">Maverick</a>‘, with Blackbird being the next mainline Far Cry game and Maverick a</span> kind of extraction shooter.</span> We say “a kind” here because Maverick has been rescoped and iterated multiple times during development, with the last major change coming late last year.</p>



<p>Blackbird has also had problems of its own and has seen the game internally delayed multiple times, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-has-delayed-its-significant-ips-to-improve-game-quality/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-has-delayed-its-significant-ips-to-improve-game-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest delay coming earlier this year</a> as a part of Ubisoft’s announced restructuring. </p>



<p>In the <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/" type="link" id="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>, Yves also confirms that multiple Assassin’s Creed games are currently in development, with both single-player and multiplayer experiences.</p>



<p>Three games are understood to be fully “locked in” according to Insider Gaming sources, with Invictus, a multiplayer title, and Obsidian, the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake, scheduled to release later this year. The third game, codenamed Neo (publicly known as Hexe), is now scheduled to release in 2027.</p>



<p>As a part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft’s recent restructuring</a>, two Assassin’s Creed games were internally cancelled. One being the already released mobile game Assassin’s Creed Rebellion, and a second game called Assassin’s Creed Singularity.</p>







<p>Assassin’s Creed Singularity was in development for a couple of years, said sources, and was intended to be a virtual trading card game with Web3 and blockchain integration. The game was scheduled to release on both PC and mobile platforms.</p>

<p>New US video game sales data is live, revealing that PlayStation 5 was the leading console in January 2026 and more. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-was-uss-best-selling-hardware-in-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November</a> 2025, PlayStation 5 was the US’s best-selling hardware; in December 2025, the Nintendo Switch 2 took the lead; and now the PS5 is back in first place at the start of the new year. The US video game sales data also revealed more details, such as the best-selling game, a dip in accessories spending, and more. </p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-5-overtakes-nintendo-switch-2-in-hardware-sales-for-january-2026">PlayStation 5 Overtakes Nintendo Switch 2 in Hardware Sales for January 2026</h2>



<p>The latest US video game stats come from Mat Piscatella’s post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfcbfovqnc2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BlueSky</a>. The analyst first noted that hardware spending increased year-on-year by 16% to $248 million. Switch 2 offset declines, whereas PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and Switch saw declines of 17%, 27%, and 79%, respectively. Despite the decline, PlayStation 5 was the best-selling hardware in January 2026, in both unit and dollar sales. The Nintendo Switch 2 came second. </p>



<p>Accessories spending fell 5% year on year to $185 million, the lowest since January 2020 ($143 million). In January, projected spending on video game hardware, content, and accessories increased by 3% year over year to $4.7 billion. This growth was driven by a 23% rise in subscription spending and a 16% increase in hardware sales. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-january-2026-best-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game</a> of this month was Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </p>







<p>In other news, Sony PlayStation has decided to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-playstation-is-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down Bluepoint Games</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was the best-selling game in the United States (US) for January 2026. </p>



<p>The latest US sales data was released on Friday, and that came with the news that the latest in the long-running series continues to sit at the top of the sales charts. What makes it just as impressive is that it’s a game included for members with Xbox Game Pass PC or Ultimate.</p>







<p>Moving away from Call of Duty, looking at the Top 5 sees sports games fall right behind with Call of Duty’s main competitor, Battlefield 6, coming in at No. 5. The top five, in order, are: Black Ops 7, NBA 2K26, Madden NFL 26, Minecraft, and Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the Top 20, Final Fantasy 7: Remake jumps from 225 last month to the ninth spot thanks to its release on the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S in January. Other games from outside the Top 20 in December that found themselves on the list include Helldivers 2, Split Fiction, Elden Ring, and Fallout 4. </p>



<p>Lastly, one new release entered the Top 20 as Code Vein 2 finds itself at No. 11.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil Requiem offers different difficulty options, which are slightly different from what you’d expect from the difficulty settings in recent Resi games. If you’re having a hard time deciding between the two concerning your playthrough, this guide has everything you need to know.</p>



<p>You know how difficulty settings usually go in these games: Easy, Normal, Hard, and then a harder variant once you complete the game. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> borrows one of its most iconic game mechanics to present a headache.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-the-difference-between-classic-amp-modern-difficulty-settings-in-resident-evil-requiem">What’s The Difference Between Classic &amp; Modern Difficulty Settings in Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An age-old classic. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The main difference between Normal and Classic difficulty in Resident Evil Requiem is that you need to find and use Ink Ribbons to save in Classic Mode when using Grace, with limited autosaves, whereas Normal will use a traditional save system.</strong></p>



<p>Ah, Ink Ribbons…the suspenseful and unusual resource that makes you question whether you <em>really </em>need to save in Resident Evil games.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Resident Evil Requiem On Xbox Game Pass?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>They first appeared in the debut Resident Evil game and became a staple of the gameplay for a few years. They have largely been neglected now in favor of modern save systems, but Requiem is bringing them back, to an extent.</p>



<p>Capcom’s RESIDENT EVIL Showcase revealed that multiple difficulties were available, with Normal and Classic being the focal point of your first playthrough options—along with a Casual mode for those seeking an easier challenge.</p>



<p>Here’s the description for each. Expect there to be another one or two harder settings once you finish the main game.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Resident Evil Requiem Difficulty Setting</th><th data-align="center">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Casual</td><td data-align="center">“Relax while enjoying the story and puzzles.”</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Standard (Modern)</td><td data-align="center">“A balanced experience of suspense and accomplishment at the standard difficulty found among modern Resident Evil games.<p>This game mode can be changed to Casual on the game over screen.”</p></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Standard (Classic)</td><td data-align="center">“A traditional experience with a difficulty similar to classic Resident Evil games. Recommended for long-term fans of the series.<p>Autosaves during Grace’s gameplay are limited and ink ribbons are required to save.”</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<h2 id="h-should-you-choose-classic-or-modern-in-resident-evil-requiem">Should You Choose Classic or Modern in Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Choices. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As Capcom suggests, the difficulty depends on three factors: If you just want to and enjoy the game and story with few to no deaths, if you like a normal challenge, or if you enjoy the suspense of archaic Resi gameplay with limited resources.</strong></p>



<p>Personally, we are long-time Resident Evil fans, so the Standard (Classic) is the obvious choice.</p>

</ul>



<p>If you’re a newcomer, then Standard (Classic) might be better, and Casual is for those new to horror games, or like the genre but are threatened by them, or if you want to blitz through and lap up the story beats.</p>



<p>Now for the big question: Which difficulty setting will you be playing Resident Evil Requiem on? Reveal your true answer via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

<p>Nostalgia for Pokémon fans is through the roof ahead of Pokémon Day 2026, with a slew of news set to be announced, and the re-release of Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green on Nintendo Switch platforms is on the horizon.</p>



<p>22 years after an initial release, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green are coming to both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> as re-releases.

<p>If you’re already counting down the hours until you can explore the Kanto region again, Insider Gaming has all the details on the release date and launch times.</p>

<p><strong>Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green will be released on Nintendo Switch systems on Friday, February 27, landing as part of the Pokémon</strong> <strong>Day celebrations.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-release-for-switch-next-week/" id="178067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of the re-release</a> of the titles originally released on Game Boy Advance two decades ago came a week ahead of their release. It was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-return-teased-by-leaker/" id="175794" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously leaked</a> that the titles would be made available again.</p>

<p>Full Pokémon Home connectivity will be added to the titles at a later date, increasing the number of available Pokémon in the game. In the original release, players could transfer Pokémon from other titles like Gold, Silver, Emerald, Ruby, and Sapphire.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear when Pokémon Home functionality will be available, and whether previous events in the game will be made available.</p>

<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green will be released on Nintendo Switch platforms following the conclusion of the Pokémon Presents showcase on February 27.</strong></p>



<p>No precise time for the drop has been shared, and it’s not clear if the titles will be immediately available after the conclusion of the showcase. However, if they’re not available as soon as the show ends, it’s likely to only be a short wait until they’re in the store.</p>

<p>Styx: Blades of Greed dropped <strong>yesterday</strong>, presenting players with a stealth-driven, goblin-backed adventure packed with brutal kills, open environments, and quips from a protagonist accurately described as ‘caustic’.</p>



<p>In the reviews surfacing online, Styx has been doing very well for itself, earning decent scores from critics. It’s the third game in the series, which emerged in 2014 with Styx: Master of Shadows. In a recent post on social media, the developers took the opportunity to throw shade at competing franchises based on the positivity surrounding the launch of Blades of Greed.</p>







<h2 id="h-pay-attention-assassin-s-creed">Pay Attention, Assassin’s Creed</h2>



<p>Styx: Blades of Greed was given a positive review by Eurogamer, and the social team at Cyanide Studio took it upon themselves to go on the offensive against other developers. Of course, it’s all in the character of Styx himself, a volatile goblin prone to self-deprecation, harsh humor, and sarcastic one-liners.</p>



<p>When news of the positive reviews hit the airwaves, Cyanide went straight to social media, calling out Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed brand:</p>

<p>It didn’t end there. One user asked what Styx would do when faced with the ‘GOAT Sam Fisher’, the frontman of the legendary Splinter Cell series, arguably the most iconic stealth shooter ever made.</p>



<p>In response, the team at Cyanide simply wrote, ‘Sam Fisher stays in the shadows.’</p>



<p>It got a bit close to the wire when someone asked them to comment in French, so Ubisoft could ‘understand properly,’ and the social team wrote:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Styx has also openly challenged the likes of Agent 47 and Big Boss, which is ambitious.</p>







<p>Have you played Styx: Blades of Greed? Is the game good enough to warrant the arrogance from the developer’s social media team? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
