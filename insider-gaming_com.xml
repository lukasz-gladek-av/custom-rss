<p>Naughty Dog has announced its next game, Intergalactic The Heretic Prophet, at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>The game description reads, “The Heretic Prophet is the newest franchise in development for the PlayStation 5 console from Naughty Dog, the studio behind acclaimed series like The Last of Us and UNCHARTED. Set thousands of years in the future, Intergalactic puts players into the role of Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit.”</p>



<p>Last month, Naughty Dog head honcho Neil Druckmann confirmed that Troy Baker will have a leading role in the upcoming game. Baker, who is best known for playing Joel in Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us has also played the likes of Indiana Jones in Machine Games’ latest hit Indiana Jones and The Great Circle.</p>

<p>“Crimson Desert is an upcoming open-world action-adventure which will make a global release on both console and PC,” the game’s description reads. “An epic of survival with a focus on immersive storytelling and intense action, Crimson Desert follows a group of struggling mercenaries and the many characters who cross their paths in the vast continent of Pywel. This is a world where heroes are made, but not without incredible hardship, pain and perseverance.”</p>



<p>Recently, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-wanted-crimson-desert-as-ps5-exclusive-but-pearl-abyss-declined/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed that Sony had wanted</a> Crimson Desert as a PlayStation 5 exclusive. However, Pearl Abyss turned the company down after it was decided internally that self-publishing the game “would be highly profitable”.</p>
