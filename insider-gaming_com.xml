<p>WWE has filed three new video game trademarks.</p>



<p>On February 18, WWE filed to trademark the terms “WWE Domination,” “WWE Generations,” and “WWE Eras Collide.” All three trademarks have the same description, noting that they’re used for video games.</p>



<p>“Trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of video and computer game software; video games software for use with wireless devices; downloadable video games software for use via a global computer network and wireless devices; interactive video game programs and computer game cartridges; interactive multimedia computer games on all platforms comprised of computer hardware and computer game software; electronic games software that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device,” the official trademark description reads.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-games-in-the-past-have-focused-on-the-clash-of-eras">WWE Games in the Past Have Focused on the Clash of Eras</h2>



<p>In 2011, WWE released WWE All Stars. Published by THQ, the game focused on pairing the stars of yesteryear against the then-modern stars of WWE. The game was an arcade-style break from the usual simulation releases the sports entertainment juggernaut puts out annually.</p>



<p>No game has since been directly focused on the collision of different eras in WWE history. However, every year, several generations are represented in the WWE 2K video game series. </p>







<p>It is not certain whether these trademarks will lead to a new video game release, and if that game will be released on mobile or console devices. Still, it’s been several years since WWE has tried something new in the gaming realm, and any sign of a fresh idea could be fun for that fan base.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2/" id="3528">Slay the Spire 2</a> will feature co-op play for up to 4 players.</p>



<p>Slay the Spire 2, the follow-up to the game that built the modern roguelike deckbuilder genre, is slated to enter Early Access in March 2026 on Steam. The new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2868840/Slay_the_Spire_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game description</a> not only teases expanded lore and new characters but also confirms that the game will allow four players to play together with new multiplayer-specific cards, team synergies, and more.</p>



<p>“Brave the ascent on your own, or play with up to 4 players and face the Spire together in the all-new co-op mode. Discover multiplayer-specific cards, powerful team synergies, and carry your friends (or get carried) to victory!”</p>







<h2 id="h-slay-the-spire-2-was-prevously-delayed">Slay the Spire 2 Was Prevously Delayed</h2>



<p>Slay the Spire 2 was initially set to release in Early Access in late 2025. However, in September of last year, Mega Crit Studios announced they would delay the start of Early Access. The delay was attributed to adding more content and to the importance of emphasizing quality in development.</p>



<p>“Compared to Slay the Spire 1’s early access launch (and for that matter, its final 2.0 form), this new sequel has a lot more content that we can’t wait to share with you. In addition, we want to make sure we’re upholding the quality bar that both we and the gaming community have come to expect for Early Access titles,” the studio stated.</p>







<p>They also joked that the delay had nothing to do with the release of Hollow Knight: Silksong. While that may be true, the delayed release of Slay the Spire 2 caused brief concerns for the development team behind Omelet You Cook. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/omelet-you-cook-devs-fear-slay-the-spire-2-will-steal-spotlight/" id="172827">The team previously joked</a> that they were nervous about competing against the game that defined the genre, but that game currently has overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/visual-concepts/" id="1887">Visual Concepts</a> is spotlighting some of the major changes coming to MyRise in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26.</a></p>



<p>The latest <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/myrise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report</a> feature on WWE 2K26 showcased the storyline and changes coming to the MyRise campaign mode. This year’s theme is “The Comeback.” In the story, you take your created wrestler, male or female, on a journey that begins with them returning to WWE, only to lose to Paul Heyman’s current client and top champion, either Bron Breakker or Jordynne Grace.</p>



<p>Then it becomes a story about a real comeback, and players get to choose between a righteous path and a villainous one.</p>







<h2 id="h-paul-heyman-pulls-the-strings-in-myrise-in-wwe-2k26">Paul Heyman Pulls the Strings in MyRise in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>Paul Heyman narrated a brief video spotlighting MyRise, while the written feature discusses the important changes coming to the mode.</p>



<p>For starters, this year’s game expands on the Live Event Match system with a new structure called RISE Matches. Rather than functioning as bonus content, RISE Matches are now fully integrated into the main progression path. Completing these matches advances your wrestler’s journey and provides rewards.</p>



<p>Also, the story does not end after you capture the main title; there is a new-game-plus mode where you can continue defending the gold.</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-a-rewarding-journey-with-replay-value">A Rewarding Journey with Replay Value</h2>



<p>As for the aforementioned rewards, there are specific rewards for completing both journeys, including playable characters, MyFACTION content, new weapons, arenas, and more. Some of the rewards shown off include a special golden Bron Breakker, a new attire for “The Fiend” Bray Wyatt, a playable Dusty Rhodes, and 2003 CM Punk.</p>



<p>It was previously reported that the 2003 CM Punk would feature his independent wrestling theme song, AFI’s “Miseria Cantare: The Beginning.” Learn more about that at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-includes-classic-afi-song-for-roh-era-cm-punk/" id="177687">this link.</a></p>
