<p>Don’t Nod, the studio behind Life is Strange, is working with Netflix on a new narrative-driven game. Furthermore, the title is said to be of a ‘major existing IP’.</p>



<p>If you’ve played any big narrative games this past decade, chances are a Don’t Nod title was one of them. From the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-20-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the iconic Life is Strang</a>e series, the French developer/publisher has quickly become one to watch. Now, in its half-year sales report, the company has a new collaboration: Netflix.</p>

<p>Don’t Nod announced its half-year results for 2025 in <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new press release</a>. The company reported that it more than tripled revenue, releasing games like Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage. While the title didn’t meet sales expectations, upcoming projects like The Lonesome Guild and Aphelion hope to turn the tide. However, the biggest news comes with the announcement of a collaboration with Netflix. The company stated that the narrative-driven project is in development at its Montreal studio. It will be published by Netflix and be based on a ‘major IP’. </p>



<p>As to what that IP may be, there are certainly a few possibilities. Personally, with the style of Lost Records, Stranger Things is a no-brainer for Don’t Nod. Given how it fits the mystery/sci-fi genre it mastered with Life is Strange, it’ll feel right at home. However, Netflix is home to many major franchises like Bridgerton, Outer Banks, Bird Box, and Wednesday, so there are plenty of options. It’ll be exciting to see how it turns out, as I’m both a fan of Don’t Nod’s work and Netflix’s catalog. </p>



<p>What franchise do you want Don’t Nod to adapt for Netflix? Do you have a favorite title of the company? Enjoy Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage?
