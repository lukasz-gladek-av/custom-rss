<p>Fortnite players around the world have been locked out of the game on February 5 as Epic Games deploys the latest update to the title, with players impatiently waiting for the Fortnite servers to be back up.</p>



<p>After a huge South Park collab in January, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> behemoth is entering a new month with a fresh drop of content, keeping the game alive until the next major seasonal change early in March.</p>



<p>For all the details on the Fortnite downtime and everything coming in the February 5 update, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-servers-be-back-up">When Will Fortnite Servers Be Back Up?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New content. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite Servers are down for several hours for the update on February 5, and there is no confirmed time of their return. However, previous updates indicate how long players need to wait.</strong></p>



<p>Server downtime in mid-season updates typically lasts for three to four hours, which means that the Fortnite servers should be back up after the v39.40 update somewhere between 2 AM PT and 2 AM ET.</p>



<p>However, downtime can be longer if issues are discovered or if there is a larger patch to deploy, and social media is the best place to keep track of the server status.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-fortnite-february-5-update">What’s In The Fortnite February 5 Update?</h2>



<p><strong>The biggest addition in the February 5 update in Fortnite is the start of a new Fortnite Festival season, with Chappell Roan as the headline act.</strong></p>



<p>After plenty of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festivals-next-major-collab-may-have-been-found/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks and rumors</a>, her inclusion as the star of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-season-13-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Festival Season 13</a> was revealed by Epic Games, and the new season, of course, means a new Festival Pass to progress through.</p>



<p>In the Battle Royale scene, the South Park collab has now completed, with the Born in Chaos Mini Pass expiring. Unfortunately, if you didn’t complete the pass, those free rewards are now unavailable, though they could return to the Item Shop for purchase in the future.</p>



<p>The Valentine’s Day event is also set to be added, though the dates for its duration are not yet confirmed, and there’s a slew of big collabs coming to the Item Shop, including the second wave of KPop Demon Hunters and two character skins from Marvel Rivals; Magik and Luna Snow.</p>

<p>The Sony PlayStation 5 can officially claim victory over the Nintendo Switch 2 during the 2025 holiday season.</p>



<p>Sony recently released its <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q3_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q3 FY2025 earnings.</a> The data show that 8 million <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38">PlayStation 5 </a>units were sold in the quarter ending September 30, 2025. In the same quarter, Nintendo sold 7.01 million Switch 2 units. Of note, this was the first full quarter with the Nintendo Switch successor on the market.</p>



<p>The Sony PS5 has been on the market since 2020 and has sold<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-passes-90-million-units-sold/" id="174295"> over 90 million units </a>to date. The<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908"> Nintendo Switch 2 </a>was released in June 2025 and had <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sold 17.37 million units </a>as of New Year’s Eve 2025.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-battle-between-sony-and-nintendo-rages-on">The Battle Between Sony and Nintendo Rages on</h2>



<p>Although Sony had a stronger quarter, the Switch 2 outsold the PS5 in the United States in 2025. Nintendo’s original Switch is currently the second-best-selling console of all time, with 155.37 million units sold. However, Sony’s PS2 remains the best-selling console a quarter of a century after its release, with 160 million units sold worldwide.</p>







<p>Sony’s PlayStation 6 may not be released until 2027, giving Nintendo a head start in this generation.

<p>Sony has reached another milestone in PlayStation 5 sales.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/archive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to its latest financial report,</a> Sony sold 8 million <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38">PlayStation 5 </a>consoles in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2025. As of September 30, Sony was boasting more than 84.1 million sales. This means that, based on the new data, more than 90 million PS5 consoles have been sold.</p>



<p>Despite this milestone, PS5 sales remain down 1.5 million year over year, with 9.5 million consoles sold in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2024.</p>











<p>New data also reveal that combined PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 software sales totaled 97.2 million units. According to Sony, this total covers all PS4 and PS5 titles, including those bundled with PlayStation consoles and PlayStation VR.</p>



<p>Additionally, there are 132 million active users on the PlayStation Network as of the end of the third quarter of the fiscal year 2025. This number is slightly up from 129 million in the same quarter of the previous year.</p>







<p>While Sony had a strong 2025, Nintendo still led the United States in hardware sales for the year with its Nintendo Switch 2 console.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valve-revisiting-steam-machine-pricing-due-to-ram-market-volatility/</link>
            <guid>1426057</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/valve/" id="172462">Valve </a>provides an update on the release of its Steam Machine and additional hardware slated for 2026.</p>



<p>Valve is once again entering the console market with its PC-console hybrid, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/steam-machine/" id="3197">Steam Machine</a>. Announced in November 2025, the new console is slated for release in the first half of 2026. Now, Valve has provided an update on its Hardware releases, some of the challenges they’re facing, and what that means for customers.</p>



<h2 id="h-pricing-and-launch-date-remain-uncertain-for-steam-machine">Pricing and Launch Date Remain Uncertain for Steam Machine</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post </a>on Wednesday, February 4, Valve revealed that industry-wide memory and storage shortages and rising memory prices have forced it to revisit its shipping schedule and pricing, particularly for the Steam Machine and the Steam Frame VR headset.</p>



<p>They still plan to ship all three products in the first half of the year, but they are currently working to finalize pricing and a specific launch date. They promise to keep customers updated as best they can.</p>



<p>“Our goal of shipping all three products in the first half of the year has not changed. But we have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce,” they say.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-steam-machine-s-ssd-and-memory-will-be-upgradable">The Steam Machine’s SSD and Memory Will Be Upgradable</h2>



<p>Later in the blog, there’s an FAQ. There, Valve reveals the components of the Steam Machine and notes that both the SSD (NVMe 2230 or 2280) and memory (DDR5 SODIMMs) will be upgradable. They also claim that during test runs, most Steam titles run at 4K 60FPS with FSR on the Steam Machine.</p>



<p>However, they note that some titles will require more upscaling than others, and it may be preferable to play at a lower frame rate. They’re also working on HDMI VRR and investigating how to improve upscaling and optimize ray tracing performance.</p>







<p>While it’s not fair to say these devices are being delayed, as no concrete release date was ever given, the uncertainties players hoped would be resolved by now will continue due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-reportedly-raising-graphics-card-prices/">volatility of the RAM market</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3">Nintendo </a>explains its belief that updates to Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Splatoon 3 help maintain player loyalty during the Switch-to-Switch 2 transition.</p>



<p>In January 2026, Nintendo launched a significant update for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/animal-crossing-new-horizons/" id="3155">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. This update not only introduced additional in-game content but also quality-of-life improvements for those who pick up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Nintendo Switch 2</a> edition of the game. Splatoon 3 also received a major update, extending its lifecycle. Splatoon also received specific updates to support the next Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Now, Nintendo is admitting that it is trying to balance releasing new titles for its latest console with easing players into the transition from the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-president-discusses-transition-philosophy">Nintendo President Discusses Transition Philosophy</h2>



<p>During its latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">investor presentation</a>, Shuntaro Furukawa, president of Nintendo Co., Ltd., explained that major updates to existing titles are a key part of Nintendo’s philosophy because they help maintain connections with existing customers.</p>



<p>The belief is that it allows players to feel they are still getting value from their original Nintendo Switch while creating a pathway to adopt the next-generation console.</p>



<p>“As we move forward with the multi-year transition from Switch to Switch 2, we believe it is also very important to maintain contact with our customers who are currently using Nintendo consoles.</p>



<p>“In that sense, we thot it would be a good idea to update titles that have been big sellers on the Switch, such as ‘Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ and ‘Splatoon 3,’ at this time,” he said (via Google Translate).</p>







<p>Nintendo is continuing to march into its next generation. However, they are not fully finished with the original Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, scheduled for February 5, will feature games coming to both consoles. Insider Gaming will have coverage of the presentation.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-breaks-1-million-in-combined-sales-nintendo-says/</link>
            <guid>1426015</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For those concerned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" id="155026">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> failed to sell 1 million copies, there is some good news.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3">Nintendo </a>released its financial results for the end of 2025, many noted that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was not among the games reported to have sold over a million copies. The game was released in December for both the original Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2, leading to some being concerned that a major Nintendo release failed to meet these benchmarks. </p>



<p>However, Nintendo has confirmed that the game has surpassed 1 million sales across both the original and successor Nintendo Switch consoles.</p>







<p>Stephen Totilo on Bluesky said a Nintendo representative told him the combined sales surpassed the metric.</p>







<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-was-the-final-game-for-nintendo-dev">Metroid Prime 4 Was the Final Game for Nintendo Dev</h2>



<p>In the wake of the release of Metroid Prime 4, Kensuke Tanabe, a legendary producer at Nintendo known for his work on the franchise,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-will-be-kensuke-tanabes-final-nintendo-project/" id="171810"> confirmed</a> that this would be the final game that he would work on at Nintendo.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4 was announced in 2017 and took nearly a decade to release, after the project switched development Studios from Bandai Namco to Retro Studios. Ultimately, the game received favorable reviews, but many admitted it failed to live up to the legacy of earlier games in the franchise.</p>







<p>Nintendo continues to march into the future with a Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase on February 5, announcing more games coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 and some that will release on the original Nintendo Switch. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the presentation on February 5.</p>

<p>Ahead of the Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase on February 5, a reliable leaker has shared news about a potential massive 2024 title coming to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Nate the Hate claimed on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8B7axb3JMY&amp;list=TLPQMDQwMjIwMjb__a7baZGy0Q&amp;index=2&amp;pp=iAQB0gcJCZEKAYcqIYzvsAgC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">podcast</a> discussing the forthcoming Direct that he has heard <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-myth-wukong/" id="868">Black Myth: Wukong</a> will be coming to the Nintendo Switch 2. He could not confirm whether the game would be showcased in the February Nintendo Direct, but he remains confident it will arrive on Nintendo’s latest home console.</p>



<p>The game sold tens of millions of copies early in its lifecycle and was named best action game at the 2024 Game Awards.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch </a>may be dropping the “2” from its name, but it’s trading it in for the Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Switch 2.</a></p>



<p>Details remain scarce, but the development team announced that Overwatch is heading to the Nintendo Switch 2 in Spring 2026. The announcement was made during the Overwatch Spotlight on Thursday, February 4, 2026. The game was released on the original Nintendo Switch. As such, it is playable on the successor console. However, a dedicated Switch 2 release would mean some likely upgrades and optimization for the new hardware.</p>



<p>As of yet, there is no specific release date attached to the release of Overwatch: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.</p>
