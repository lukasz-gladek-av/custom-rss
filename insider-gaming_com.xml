            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/a-minecraft-movie-runtime-explained-does-it-have-a-post-credits-scene/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been a long time coming, but A Minecraft Movie has finally creeped up on 2025 and delivered the goods. It’s raking in hundreds of millions of dollars, and if you’re looking to see it yourself, we can tell you how long it is and if you need to stick around for a post-credits scene.</p>



<p>Video game movies and TV are as popular as they’ve ever been. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-2-viewership-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a> has captivated TV audiences, whereas animated blockbusters like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-super-mario-bros-movie-will-release-in-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Mario. Bros Movie</a> has lit up the silver screen. It’s the turn of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-minecraft-movies-cast-in-the-game-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Minecraft Movie</a>, and the big-screen adaptation of the block-building bonanza.</p>



<p>Depending on what you read and who you trust, Minecraft is the <strong>first or second-best-selling game in history</strong>—putting a lot of pressure on the movie’s shoulders. It’s doing well, and despite people <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">throwing popcorn at every screening</a>, it bodes well for a sequel. Here are the crucial details if you need to see A Minecraft Movie first.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-minecraft-movie">How Long is A Minecraft Movie?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t say it… Credit to Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A Minecraft Movie has an official runtime of 101 minutes.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve ever been to the theater yourself, you know you won’t be in your seat for 101 minutes. This means the official runtime of <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/a-minecraft-movie-out-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Minecraft Movie</a> from the opening stills to the final frame of the credits is approximately 101 minutes (or 6,060 seconds).</p>



<p>However, factor in eating your popcorn before the film starts, a few minutes waiting for the lights to go down, sitting through adverts and a few helpings of new movie trailers, and the overall experience is probably closer to <strong>120 minutes / 2 hours</strong> or a bit longer.</p>



<p>Let’s see if a post-credits scene accounts for the movie’s minutes.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-a-minecraft-movie-have-a-post-credits-cutscene-no-spoilers">Does A Minecraft Movie Have a Post-Credits Cutscene? (No spoilers)</h2>



<p><strong>There is a post-credits scene in A Minecraft Movie, meaning you should stick around until the very end.</strong></p>



<p>Now, I’m not going to disclose the nature of the scene. It’s a nice bit of fan service for Minecraft lovers. But I will say the scene lasts <strong>roughly 25 seconds</strong>, so you don’t need to hang around for too long once it begins.</p>



<p>It could have potential implications for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-sequel-already-being-discussed-says-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored sequel</a>, so I’d say it’s worth watching. Plus, it doesn’t hurt to give everyone involved in the production the credit they deserve!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-the-pawn-shop-not-working-in-schedule-1-pawn-shop-guy-missing-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Pawn Shop’s doors were opened in Schedule 1 in April 2025. It offers a new way to manage your inventory, make money, and cause chaos. This guide runs through everything you need to know, including overcoming the missing pawn guy scenario.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-april-7-update-adds-pawn-shop-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 7 update</a> was a big one for Schedule 1. The developer added a lot more content to the drug-dealing game, such as the Bleuballs Boutique, wall-mounting features, and the Pawn Shop. The latter allows you to sell goods for money and not have to waste goods by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-drops-items-in-schedule-1-discard-items-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropping them on the floor</a>.</p>



<p>However, we first need to find the Pawn Shop, work out why the owner is sometimes not there, and how to use it.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-the-pawn-shop-in-schedule-1">Where is The Pawn Shop in Schedule 1?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Follow the circle. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pawn Shop is directly south of the Motel Room location—and is one building across the road from it.</strong></p>



<p>Again, worst case, you can consult our <strong>map screenshot above</strong> for the precise location of the Pawn Shop. <a href="https://www.scheduleonegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schedule 1</a> doesn’t signpost everything like in other RPGs. But we like this as it’s quite liberating and encourages you to explore. </p>



<p>But if you want the Pawn Shop, follow these instructions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Motel Room in Northtown</strong> (which you unlock for $75).</li>



<li>Exit the room and walk forward.</li>



<li>Turn right at the<strong> ATM</strong>.</li>



<li>Walk in a straight line past the bus stop.</li>



<li>Cross the road.</li>



<li>You’re at the Pawn Shop!</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-why-is-the-pawn-shop-guy-not-there-in-schedule-1">Why is the Pawn Shop Guy Not There in Schedule 1? </h2>



<p><strong>If the Pawn Shop guy isn’t there when you go in, the game has glitched, and you need to save and reload the game to make him appear.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-pawn-shop-guy-is-missing">Pawn Shop Guy is Missing</h3>



<p>It’s well-known that the development team for Schedule 1 is very small. Glitches and bugs will get into the system from time to time. The Pawn Shop guy going AWOL is a common occurrence for Schedule 1 players.</p>



<p>If this happens, do the following:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the Pawn Shop, and if it’s open, check if the guy is behind the counter.</li>



<li>If he’s not, you need to save your game.</li>



<li>You do this by <strong>sleeping or using the Intercom device</strong>.</li>



<li>Once it’s done, close down Schedule 1.</li>



<li>Boot it up again.</li>



<li>When you’re back into the action, head to the Pawn Shop again.</li>



<li>Hopefully, the Pawn Shop person should be there.</li>



<li>If he’s not, <strong>rinse and repeat these instructions until it works</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>This bug surely has a fix in development by TVGS. For now, this is a simple workaround.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-the-pawn-shop-in-schedule-1">How to Unlock The Pawn Shop in Schedule 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I see you’re here today. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pawn Shop is automatically unlocked in Schedule 1, but you need to make sure you arrive between 6 AM and 6 PM.</strong></p>



<p>Pawn Shop guy gives you a generous 12-hour window to visit the establishment. If you arrive out of hours, the shop is closed, leaving you unable to benefit from its services. Come back at the right time to trade in your trinkets.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Last of Us Season 2 Already Has Season 1 Beat]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-2-viewership-increase/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-last-of-us-season-2-already-has-season-1-beat.1164378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-2-viewership-increase/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been revealed that the first episode of the second season of HBO’s The Last of Us saw a viewership boost of 10% over the first season. In a report, it was mentioned that 5.3 million same-day US cross-platform viewers were recorded, which is up 10% from the 4.7 million viewers who tuned into the first episode in 2023.</p>



<p>The first season went on to be the largest audience for an HBO debut season <strong>ever</strong>, so the running expectation is that the second season of The Last of Us will go even further.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-return-of-the-apocalypse">Return of the Apocalypse</h2>



<p>The Last of Us is one of the most iconic post-apocalyptic franchises in gaming history. It emerged in 2013 as a single-player, narrative-driven title from Naughty Dog, the creators of Uncharted. It turned heads back then on the PlayStation 3, and it continues to do so today.</p>



<p>In 2020, Naughty Dog released The Last of Us Part II, which is the game that season two of the HBO live-action adaptation is centered on. The first season covered the events of the first game, but the second game is heftier and will take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-two-first-half/">multiple seasons to cover in full</a>.</p>



<p>In a recent report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-last-of-us-season-2-premiere-viewership-hbo-1236368374/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, more viewers have tuned into the second season than the first – 10% more, in fact.</p>



<p>It’s indicative of the growing popularity of the series, which has an uncertain future at Naughty Dog. It was suggested by Neil Druckmann, the franchise’s creator, that there won’t be another game, but he later backtracked on those comments.</p>



<p>The television series has drawn unfortunate criticism, mostly aimed at Bella Ramsay, who plays the lead role of Ellie Williams. It has long been said that they’re not the best representation of the character, and their <strong>youthful appearance </strong>isn’t accurate compared to the game character that they’re based on.</p>



<p>It’s a sticking point, but viewership is up, and that’s all HBO really cares about.</p>



<p>Taking advantage of the popularity of the show, Naughty Dog recently released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-complete-ps-store-ps5/">The Last of Us Complete</a>, a special edition that is comprised of <strong>both </strong>The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II, exclusively on PS5.</p>

<p>You would be hard-pressed to find a bigger video game success story in 2025 than Schedule 1. The drug-dealing simulator has taken over the industry, but can you play Schedule 1 on Steam Deck? </p>



<p>Schedule 1 puts you in the shoes of a drug dealer as you work your way up in the world and build an empire. The breakout title is a hit, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/#:~:text=Schedule%201%20is%20a%20Sleeper,Million%20Concurrent%20Players%20%2D%20Insider%20Gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassing 412,000 </a>players at its peak just 10 days after launch. The momentum shows no signs of slowing down, as there is a steady stream of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updates</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new content</a>.</p>



<p>Despite being so popular, Schedule 1 isn’t available on all platforms. Here is everything you need to know about Steam Deck compatibility. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-schedule-1-playable-on-steam-deck">Is Schedule 1 Playable on Steam Deck?</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>No,</strong> <strong>Schedule 1 is not playable on Steam Deck. </strong></p>



<p>Despite Schedule 1 being on Steam, the game isn’t compatible with the Steam Deck. </p>



<p>Steam Deck users aren’t the only ones left behind. Clones of Schedule 1 have appeared on the PlayStation Store, but the real game isn’t available on consoles.</p>



<p> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyler1</a>, the leading developer at TVGS, cleared up any confusion and said, “As you may be aware, there have been some games on the PlayStation store appearing over the past few weeks with the name ‘Schedule I’ in them. Just confirming these are not affiliated with me in any way.” </p>



<p>He continued, “I’d love to port Schedule I to console when the game is at the right stage for that, but I will announce it to the Schedule I community well before it happens.” </p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-schedule-1-coming-to-steam-deck">When is Schedule 1 Coming to Steam Deck?</h2>



<p><strong>Schedule 1 has no official Steam Deck release date but is in development. </strong></p>



<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/503947989263319048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">April 10 update</a>, Tyler1 revealed, “I’m also looking into improving optimization. I’d like to get Steam Deck officially supported as soon as possible, so that’ll act as my performance benchmark.” </p>



<p>Tyler1 did not provide a timeline for improving optimization, but ‘soon as possible’ means fans won’t have to wait too long. </p>



<p>We will provide an update when Steam Deck users can finally join in on the fun. </p>



<hr>



<p>It’s not the best time to be a fan of handheld gaming. Leaks suggest that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">portable version of the PlayStation 6</a> won’t be as powerful as the PS5. In addition, the Nintendo Switch 2s from China could face a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2s-manufactured-in-china-reportedly-subject-to-145-us-tariff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">145% US tariff</a>, which could raise the price, and games are believed to cost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-and-its-dlc-is-90-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upwards of $90</a>. </p>

<p>Raven Software revealed a plan to prevent players from ruining the experience for others in Warzone Casual. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-warzone-black-ops-6-april-11-update-patch-notes-dragon-breath-shotguns-removed-shattered-veil-boss-adjustments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a> Season 3 marks the long-awaited return of the battle royale’s original map, Verdansk. So, For many who have flocked back, this is the first time they have played the battle royale in months, if not years. To help ease players back in, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-out-of-warzone-bootcamp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone Bootcamp</a> is a refresher and shows you the ropes. </p>



<p>Once players are ready for real action but aren’t quite prepared for a standard battle royale match, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-warzone-casual-in-call-of-duty-battle-royale-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone Casual</a> is a new game mode with <strong>28 real players</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>120 bots</strong>.

<p>“The whole spirit of the Casual mode was to give people that were scared about getting into a time commitment or a game commitment or a skill commitment with Warzone, but do it on their terms,” Actipis said. “So if we see sweats come in there wrecking the whole server, then we will have to come up with plans against that.” </p>



<p>Actipis did not reveal how the team plans to prevent it from becoming an issue, but Casual mode fans can rest easy knowing that Raven Software is aware of it. </p>

<p>Warzone Casual isn’t the only feature that helps casual players.
