<p>EA is bringing one of the biggest changes to EA FC in history with the open-world game mode. A ton of leaks dropped following the feature’s worldwide playtest, and we’ve seen many of the new inclusions first-hand, so let’s pick apart crucial leaks.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-26-announces-12-new-icons-including-francesco-totti-andres-iniesta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC</a> (formerly FIFA) is the biggest sports game year in, year out. It’s an unstoppable juggernaut that, no matter how badly it’s received, how poorly it reviews, etc, it will still sell millions of copies. Despite this, EA knows that remaining stagnant isn’t good for the series. This is why plans for an open-world EA FC mode were unveiled a couple of years ago. With the first playtest well underway, here are our handpicked key takeaways.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-ea-fc-open-world-game-mode-leaks">Best EA FC Open-World Game Mode Leaks</h2>

<h3 id="h-ea-fc-open-world-release-period-likely-revealed">EA FC Open World Release Period Likely Revealed</h3>



<p>One of the most shocking and eye-opening revelations from the EA FC open-world leaks is the mode’s potential release window already. Playtesting will take a while, and there’s presumably already been internal testing. But we learned from <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FootballGamingZone</a> that an internal EA presentation featured countless references to one thing in particular—<strong>EA FC 27</strong>.</p>



<p>This could easily change between now and EA giving the mode the full green light to be added. However, until we hear otherwise, one of the biggest EA FC open-world leaks is its potential <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fcs-new-open-world-mode-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release window</a>, and that it could arrive in 2026 alongside EA FC 27.</p>



<h3 id="h-lots-of-game-modes-amp-mini-games">Lots Of Game Modes &amp; Mini-Games</h3>

<p>Initial leaks suggest there are quite a few <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/every-game-mode-in-ea-fcs-open-world-playtest-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game modes</a> to try out already: Six, to be precise.</p>



<ul>
<li>Balloon Ball</li>



<li>Closest To The Pin</li>



<li>Draw The Line</li>



<li>Foot Tennis</li>



<li>Kickabouts</li>



<li>Rush</li>
</ul>



<p>Most of them are fairly self-explanatory. <strong>Rush</strong> is Rush, but with even fewer rules. You need to move the ball around in <strong>Draw The Line</strong> in a way that resembles shapes to score points, and <strong>Closest To The Pin</strong> plays into its Golf theme by requiring you to get your ball as close to the target as possible.</p>



<p><strong>Foot Tennis</strong> is just like real-life Foot Tennis, <strong>Kickabouts</strong> is similar to Volta, and <strong>Balloon Ball</strong> is easily the most diverse mode, requiring you to go full dodgeball by popping balloons and using power-ups to raise the stakes!</p>



<h3 id="h-we-re-going-continent-hopping">We’re Going Continent Hopping</h3>



<p>Another <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FGZ</a> exclusive: The open world mode has <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/exclusive-ea-fcs-open-world-will-have-several-maps-to-explore-based-on-major-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several maps to explore based on major countries</a>.</p>



<p>The leaked presentation suggests we can jump from Europe to South America, as <strong>England</strong>, <strong>France</strong>, and <strong>Argentina</strong> are the early maps that players can explore. It’s expected that each of these districts (apart from looking culturally accurate) will have subtle nuances to make them significant. Whether this is unique mini-games or specific items remains to be seen.</p>



<h3 id="h-it-will-have-another-battle-pass">It Will Have Another Battle Pass</h3>



<p>What, you didn’t want another EA FC Battle Pass to pay for? It’s EA, so another way to make money from this mode was never going to be out of the question. Don’t be surprised to see a unique shop just for the open world, but a <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/exclusive-ea-fcs-open-world-mode-has-battle-pass-stacked-with-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass stacked with cosmetics</a> is also part of the experience.</p>



<p>According to FGZ, it will feature: “Shoes, jackets, tops, trousers, and hats distributed, along with Club Points.”</p>



<p>Speaking of which.</p>



<h3 id="h-ea-fc-open-world-amp-ea-fc-will-work-alongside-each-other">EA FC Open World &amp; EA FC Will Work Alongside Each Other</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A big move. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Battle Pass’ contents underlines that the <strong>open world will be integrated into the core EA FC experience</strong>.</p>



<p>Playtesters and leaked information have revealed that it uses the same progression system that Pro Clubs uses in EA FC 26 and other recent FC games. You choose an Archetype, level up stats, earn XP, and make use of typical Clubs features.</p>



<p>It’s up to you to decide if this is lazy or not. But if you can switch your Pro from Clubs to Open-World mode, it gives you different avenues to level up your character and do it outside of a competitive environment at least.</p>



<p>What do you make of the EA FC Open-World leaks? Does the mode sound fun? Could it revolutionize the FC franchise forever?
