<p>Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard hasn’t helped it grow Xbox Game Pass or the gaming business in general. According to a new report from The Information, the growth from the acquisition has yet to hit what Microsoft was hoping for when it made the $69 billion purchase.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-gaming-business-falls-short-despite-activision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Information claims</a> that Microsoft was hoping that the purchase would help convince more players to sign up to the service as well as push more studios to releasing their games on the subscription-based platform. Instead, their sources say say that “several leading game studios have resisted Microsoft’s pitch that they should put their titles on Game Pass in exchange for fees that Microsoft offers to pay to the gaming studios.”</p>



<p>Denny Fish, a portfolio manager who oversees funds including a reported $800 million of Microsoft stock, told the outlet, “[Activision] has been disappointing.”</p>



<p>Microsoft had targeted reaching 100 million subscribers by 2030. As of February 2024, there were 34 million subscribers, including those who became subscribers after Microsoft converted Xbox Live to Xbox Game Pass Core. Microsoft has failed to hit Game Pass growth targets in each of the last two years. That led to Game Pass’s growth being dropped as a metric that determined CEO Satya Nadella’s pay at Microsoft.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-game-pass-prices-by-as-much-as-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raised its prices</a> while introducing a new tier—Game Pass Standard—that took away Day One releases from console subscribers unless they upgrade to Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<p>In addition, Microsoft expected more studios and publishers to rent Azure cloud servers for their games. It’s said that Activision is still using Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services for its server rentals along with “primarily relying on its own servers for development”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft regarding the report. Should a response of any kind be received, it will be added to this story. Microsoft is scheduled to announce its Q2 earnings for FY2025 on January 29.</p>

<p>The next game led by former Blizzard Chief Creative Officer (CCO) Rob Pardo has officially been revealed. Pardo’s Bonfire Studios has announced Arkheron, a team-based PvP game “set in a dark and foreboding world”.</p>



<p>According to the studio, Arkheron will feature familiar “ideas and concepts”, but the game is “about creating something entirely new”. That being a dynamic, fast-paced PvP gameplay experience.</p>



<p>“There’s a simple truth at the heart of our development philosophy,” Pardo said via release. “If we don’t love our game, our players won’t either. We believe the best games are born from a genuine love of playing them, which is why we’ve poured years of passion into developing&nbsp;Arkheron, constantly iterating and refining it to deliver something truly unique and exciting. </p>



<p>“We’ve played the game daily as a team for years, and while we haven’t figured out yet exactly how to describe it, we often say ‘you have to play it to get it’. We’re eager to start sharing the fun we’ve found in&nbsp;Arkheron&nbsp;with a wider community soon, and we hope players will love it as much as we do.”</p>



<p>The game has been holding private playtests and will be opening it up to more players in the coming months. Signups <a href="https://bonfirestudios.com/playtest/index.html?rafid=FYK-22192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">are currently open</a> for those in North America with more regions opening later this year.</p>

<p>Nikola “NiKo” Kovač has finally played <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/falcons-sign-niko/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his first official match with Team Falcons</a>, and the organization has to pleased with the first result of this new CS2 lineup. Despite a substantial financial backing, Falcons has struggled to break into the top of the Counter-Strike hierarchy in recent years, but the result today is a step in the right direction.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>

<h2 id="h-niko-and-former-heroic-trio-shine-against-ence-at-blast-bounty">NiKo and Former Heroic Trio Shine against ENCE at BLAST Bounty</h2>



<p>Utilizing the <a href="https://blast.tv/article/blast-premier-2025-bounty-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLAST event’s bounty system</a>, the lower seeded ENCE opted to challenge Falcons. The ENCE core, led by four-time Major winner Lukas “gla1ve” Rossander, sought to take advantage of Falcons’ short time spent practicing together. ENCE gambled on a Train pick, hoping that Falcons would be even less prepared on the newest CS2 map.</p>



<p>Train was a highly entertaining affair, as the unfamiliar map produced a messy but fun match of Counter-Strike. But the big match experience of NiKo and the entirety of the Falcons roster prevailed over ENCE. ENCE came up short in several rounds where they had a man advantage, and was unable to hold onto a late 12-9 lead. It wasn’t NiKo who led the way for Falcons, but former Heroic member René “TeSeS” Madsen, who produced four multi-kill rounds in the final six rounds of regulation and overtime. Falcons claimed four straight rounds in OT to steal away Train, 16-12.</p>







<p>The series turned to Dust2, a strong map historically for several of Falcons’ individual players. Falcons started out strong with five straight T-side rounds, though ENCE managed to fight their way back. NiKo stepped up the most in Falcons’ second half CT-side, but the team couldn’t stop ENCE from sending the second map to OT as well. However, TeSeS delivered for Falcons in the clutch again in OT, closing out a close series win for Falcons.</p>
