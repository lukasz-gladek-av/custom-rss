<p>Ubisoft has announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows has passed 3 million players in its first 7 days since launch.</p>



<p>The news was shared on the official Assassin’s Creed X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1905268079958904991" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account</a>, where it was officially confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the 2nd highest day 1 sales</a> (in revenue) in Assassin’s Creed’s franchise history.</p>



<p>It was also announced that the game is the biggest day 1 release on the PlayStation Store, with over 40 million hours of the game already being played.</p>



<p>In addition to the games commercial success, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is one of Ubisoft’s highest-rated Metacritic games in recent history, which currently sits at 82/100.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Grant-Taylor Hill gave Shadow’s a “Buy” verdict, praising the game’s visuals and cinematics but said that the game had “too many niggling flaws for me to consider this a perfect title.”</p>
