<p>If you’ve ever fancied adding a games cabinet to your house or a workplace as an attraction, chances are you’ve come across Arcade1Up. The company is quite possibly the biggest when it comes to gaming cabinet creations, but recent developments mean the end could be nigh.</p>



<p>A high-end PC or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ps5-games-holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5</a> Pro is all well and good, but an authentic, old-school gaming experience comes from a games cabinet you’d find in an arcade. This is where Arcade1Up has excelled since 2018, when it was started by CEO Scott Bachrach. The company has been doing well, but new evidence suggests it’s not enough.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-seems-like-the-end-for-arcade1up">It Seems Like The End For Arcade1Up</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So many classics. Credit to Arcade1up</figcaption></figure>



<p>A post on the Arcade1Up subreddit has come to light, showing an alleged internal email exchange between Arcade1Up employees.</p>







<p>In the email, the sender is contacting the company’s Beta Team with an unfortunate message: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Beta Team, I come to you with news I wish I didn’t have to share. Arcade1Up is closing operations. For the majority of us, our last day is this coming Friday. I cannot speak to the future of the brand, it is not my place to share what might be next and and whom will be in charge of it. I do not know the plans for the arcade systems or the Infinity Tables. I believe they will continue to operate as they currently do, but I do not know for certain.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There will be many implications regarding online play used by certain machines, firmware updates, and much more if this is the end of Arcade1Up.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The names and emails have been redacted, and until we hear an official statement from the company, we have to take this with a pinch of salt for now.</p>



<p>If you’ve heard anything more about this development, contact anyone from the Insider Gaming team. Also, if this is the end, we encourage you to do your part and share your favorite memories of Arcade1Up via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>TheBurntPeanut, one of the most popular content creators in the world right now, has received an exclusive ‘streamer item’ from Battlestate Games for use in Escape from Tarkov. In the last couple of years, the Escape from Tarkov community and platform have been a foundation for TheBurntPeanut on his rise to fame, so this is a very appropriate move by Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>Fans of the energetic, hilarious streamer have been lobbying Battlestate Games for the longest time for an exclusive streamer item, and now it’s here. Check it out below.</p>



<h2 id="h-theburntpeanut-s-tarkov-streamer-item-is-exactly-what-you-d-expect">TheBurntPeanut’s Tarkov Streamer Item is Exactly What You’d Expect</h2>



<p>This isn’t the first new streamer item unveiled by Battlestate Games in recent days. Earlier this week, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-player-escape-tarkov-streamer-item/">a streamer item for Tigz</a>, the first person in the world to complete the Tarkov campaign in full. He received a special ‘splint’ item just days ago.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut has now received the Escape from Tarkov streamer item treatment.</p>



<p>He joins a long line of popular creators who have used Escape from Tarkov to propel their content forward. At this point, there are a couple of dozen streamer items in the game, and they even feed into one of the game’s most aspirational tasks. To unlock the legendary ‘Kappa’ case, players must collect <strong>every streamer item</strong>, amongst other things.</p>



<p>There’s even a special ‘streamer item case’ that users can unlock to store these items in.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut’s item is at least practical, surfacing as a balaclava that perfectly resembles TheBurntPeanut’s own visage.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dmitri Ogorodnikov, the head of PR at Battlestate Games, followed up with a post dubbing the streamer item ‘well deserved’, a sentiment that was echoed by fans of the streamer, who are affectionately named ‘Bungulators’.</p>



<p>Do you think TheBurntPeanut’s streamer item is appropriate? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re thinking.</p>

<p>Lords of the Fallen debuted in 2023, emerging as a reboot of sorts of the 2014 game of the same name. It was a considerable success, surfacing as a solid entry into the ever-growing lineup of Soulslike games that have dominated the market in recent years.</p>



<p>At Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony, CI Games unveiled Lords of the Fallen II, slated for a 2026 release window. However, the team isn’t <strong>quite finished </strong>with Lords of the Fallen (2023), as a surprise, final update was revealed for the game, featuring stacks of extra content.</p>







<h2 id="h-lords-of-the-fallen-is-still-standing">Lords of the Fallen is Still Standing</h2>



<p>In an unexpected reveal, CI Games uncovered a final update for 2023’s Lords of the Fallen, a world-bending Soulslike title with some incredible combat sequences.</p>



<p>It was back in April 2024 that Lords of the Fallen’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-final-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘final update’</a> was released, dubbed ‘Master of Fate’, and the team thereafter pivoted to work on Lords of the Fallen II, which was then revealed a year and a half later.</p>



<p><strong>But then</strong>, in April 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-update-friend-pass-co-op-improvements-explained/">‘Lords of the Fallen 2.0’</a> went live, with CI Games introducing several game-changing features such as a ‘Friend Pass’ system, new co-op challenges, and better multiplayer mechanics. It seems that, once again, final didn’t mean final, as <strong>yet another </strong>update has been lined up for Lords of the Fallen.</p>



<p>Now, the team at CI Games has confirmed that Lords of the Fallen ‘2.5’ is being released, including all of the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Deadlier boss battles</li>



<li>Faster, smarter enemies</li>



<li>All-new Veteran Mode</li>



<li>New boss weapon animations</li>



<li>Veteran of the Veil Armour Set</li>



<li>And more…</li>
</ul>
