<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is a tough proposition, no matter how experienced you are. The February 11, 2026, Quordle has four new words for you to find, and this guide has hints and a helping hand to have you be four for four.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="block-44882c9d-d6a6-4e4f-9b1a-8312ae0b3036">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone and region, meaning the next game will start on February 12.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Relooted Launches To Double-Digit User Count on Steam but Positive Reviews]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/relooted-launches-double-digits-steam-reviews/</link>
            <guid>1432030</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On social media, discussions have surfaced surrounding the recent launch of Relooted, an Africanfuturist heist game that sees players assume control of characters stealing African artifacts from Western museums. Those discussions aren’t entirely positive, as Relooted has managed to secure a peak player count of just 57 users on Steam on launch day.</p>



<p>While the bulk of users will be playing Relooted via Xbox Game Pass, on which the game dropped on day one, it’s not a strong look for just the second game from Nyamakop. It is worth stressing that the game has a review rating of ‘Mostly Positive’ on Steam, so perhaps it’s much better than the player count suggests and is just struggling with adoption.</p>







<h2 id="h-relooted-regarded-as-genuinely-bad-by-some">Relooted Regarded as ‘Genuinely Bad’ by Some</h2>



<p>If you hold any stock in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255890/Relooted/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">user reviews on Steam</a>, you might baulk at the most recent recollections. One gamer wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This game sucks. I’m not saying that because it’s “woke”; the game is genuinely bad. The art style is ugly, the mechanics are terrible, and it has a multitude of other issues. Avoid this game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Of course, the almost immediate mention of ‘woke’ does something to invalidate their opinion a little, as it’s a phrase too easily lobbied around these days by those not happy with their evaluation of a game.</p>



<p>By comparison, another user explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a fun and vibrant little platformer with a lot of interesting history driving it. Sadly, Americans struggle to think anything can be made without centering around their politics.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s <strong>extremely tough </strong>not to take a political approach to judging Relooted, and that might be what’s slowing adoption. It’s not possible to see how many people are playing the game on PC or Xbox via the Game Pass subscription service, but at the time of writing, just 15 people were playing it on Steam.</p>



<p>In June 2025, our Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-nyamakop-ceo-ben-myers-relooted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sat down with Ben Myres</a>, CEO at Nyamakop, who said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We struggled with the design for quite a while – how to make an interesting mechanical adaption of heist movies was tricky (most heist games are shooters, and don’t always feel accurate to the vibe and sensibilities of say an Ocean’s 11). It was only when Teardown came out that something clicked.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team also stressed that the Metroidvania-style game wasn’t influenced by games like Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown or Tales of Kenzera: ZAU, despite bearing similarities to both.</p>



<p>Time will tell how Relooted pans out, but the critics’ impressions <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2026/02/relooted-is-available-today-with-xbox-game-pass-and-some-early-reviews-are-now-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are mostly positive</a>. One outlet described the game as ‘unique and rewarding’, while another dubbed it ‘a fantastic premise’.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Overwatch is Back’: Claims Surface Online as Game Hits New All-Time High Player Count]]></title>

            <guid>1432015</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Overwatch has been ‘relaunched’, the game’s previous ‘2’ has been removed from the title, and a new season of content has brought players flooding back to the hero shooter in droves. In recent hours, Overwatch managed to hit a new all-time high peak player count on Steam, soaring and prompting many to declare that <strong>Overwatch is back!</strong></p>



<p>Of course, it’s not all good news. In the last couple of days, the community was wrestling with the voice actor for one of the newest characters, Anran, who used her position to ‘push an agenda’ regarding unrealistic beauty standards in games. She <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-anran-actor-bags-on-ozempic-chic-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dubbed them ‘Ozempic chic’</a> and drew immense flak from one half of the community.</p>



<p>So, is Overwatch back?</p>







<h2 id="h-overwatch-skyrockets-on-steam">Overwatch Skyrockets on Steam</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch</a> has hit a new all-time peak player count of 165,651 users <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2357570/charts/#max" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> in the hours before writing this article. That’s not just a slight climb over the previous high; it’s a <strong>120% </strong>boost. Previously, Overwatch had secured a high of around 75,000, back in 2023. Since then, it had slowly been working its way down the leaderboard.</p>



<p>Despite the arrival of a rebrand and a fresh season of content, plus the huge leap in players, Overwatch has managed to drop in review standings. It has a rating of ‘Mixed’ in recent reviews and ‘Mostly Negative’ overall, so it might be a case of users dipping back in, seeing what’s what, not being impressed, and leaving again.</p>



<p>Regardless, fans of the franchise have taken to social media platforms worldwide to declare the almighty and unstoppable return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/blizzard/" id="1092">Blizzard’s</a> hero shooter, which has fallen in and out of good graces over the last few years.</p>



<p>Even Zedd, a popular music producer and DJ with millions of followers, declared Overwatch <strong>back </strong>on socials:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Whether this resurgence is a flash in the pan remains to be seen. The five new characters (which include a cat with a jetpack), the new meta event, and the countless tweaks might not pay off for long enough for Overwatch to be considered entirely renewed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[CDL Teams Opt to GA Snipers Going Into Major II Qualifiers]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-teams-ga-snipers-major-ii-qualifiers/</link>
            <guid>1432009</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the latest sweeping change to hit the Call of Duty League, the scene’s pro teams have decided to eradicate snipers from the competitive circuit, pushing for a GA that moves them firmly out of the meta pool.</p>



<p>As we go into the Major II qualifying stage, which leads up to the first CDL Major to land in the United Kingdom in <strong>many years</strong>, very few changes are being made. The map pool is expected to remain the same, rosters haven’t shifted too much (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloud9-new-york-failing-to-build-new-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aside from Cloud9</a>…), but yes, snipers are now out of the picture.</p>







<h2 id="h-too-many-changes-could-harm-the-cdl-s-image">Too Many Changes Could Harm the CDL’s Image</h2>



<p>Snipers have been pulled in and out of the meta for the longest time. It seems that they’re a point of contention every single season, and we rarely go an entire year without them being kicked out of the pool. All it takes is for them to dominate for a few games and for some players to get sharper with them, and the consensus boots them from the meta.</p>



<p>That’s what’s happened this time around, with a reported <strong>nine teams </strong>agreeing to GA (Gentlemen’s Agreement) snipers and eviscerate them from the weapon pool.</p>



<p>The ever-shrinking weapon pool, we might add.</p>



<p>Many have their concerns about Call of Duty’s approach to the competitive meta, and it almost always results in the game becoming a two-gun esports title. It’s a theme not replicated in any other game, including the likes of Counter-Strike, Rainbow Six, Apex Legends, and VALORANT, all of which are much more diverse.</p>



<p>It’s now almost exclusively down to the Dravec and the M15 to determine the outcome of each match, with a few Jäger 45 clips thrown in for good measure. It’s already tough for Call of Duty to be seen as a ‘serious esport’ without this issue surfacing every season.</p>



<p>Major II welcomes the first UK-based Call of Duty esports major in more than six years, with the NEC at Birmingham welcoming both CDL Major II <strong>and </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dreamhack-coming-to-the-uk-in-2025-call-of-duty-dota/">a wider DreamHack event</a>.</p>

<p>Finding Juliet might be at the heart of Romeo Is A Dead Man, but that doesn’t stop Romeo from getting married along the way. That being said, it’s not an easy process, though love rarely ever is simple.</p>



<p>Romeo’s potential wife, WorstPink, is the doctor aboard the Space-Time Ship, and she can put you up for examination. What happens is more akin to a dating simulator, where you are given a host of questions—99 of them, to be exact—and you must answer each one correctly to see the true ending. </p>







<p>The caveat is that they’re exceedingly ludicrous, and the correct answer isn’t always obvious. Luckily for you, Insider Gaming has sat through all of WorstPink’s questions in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/" id="170918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a>, and every correct answer is listed for your convenience down below.</p>

<p><strong>There are 99 questions to answer during the WorstPink encounter, and you must answer them all correctly in one sitting to reach the true ending.</strong></p>



<p>The questions are as random and disjointed as you could expect from a Suda51 game, and it can be incredibly frustrating to figure out the answers organically. Luckily for you, they’re all listed below:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders is Too Far Gone for a PvE Event to Work Properly]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-too-far-gone-for-pve-to-work/</link>
            <guid>1431943</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, ARC Raiders received a sizeable update that introduced a new PvE-focused event named <strong>Shared Watch</strong>. The point of Shared Watch is to work together with other raiders to take down ARC threats, and by doing so, you unlock a string of rewards, including a new skin, some cosmetics, and some Raider Tokens.</p>



<p>The trick is, you get <strong>no progress points </strong>(known as ‘Merits’) for this event for killing or maiming <strong>other players</strong>, stripping focus away from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-arc-raiders-pvp-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s PvP loop</a>. It’s ambitious on Embark Studios’ part, but the problem is, ARC Raiders feels way too far gone to be a proving ground for a PvE-led event, and players are quickly discovering that.</p>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-shared-watch-event-in-arc-raiders-all-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shared Watch</a> gives incentives for working as a team, either with friends or with strangers, to take down ARC enemies. For every enemy you damage, destroy, or assist in destroying, you earn Merits that push you along a reward path. That path culminates in a nice, new helmet for your rooster, Scrappy, but there are other items to secure along the way.</p>



<p>However, Shared Watch also pushes the PvE agenda a little further, attempting to encourage users to <strong>work together</strong> and stop slinging lead at one another for five minutes.</p>



<p>Last night, I hopped on ARC Raiders with a friend to participate in Shared Watch, and ten raids later, we’d <strong>not had a single successful extraction</strong>. We were prioritizing Trials, almost all of which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-easily-complete-all-arc-raiders-trials-this-week-february-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are geared this week</a> around fighting ARC enemies, and trying to crack through that reward path.</p>



<p>On every single occassion, we were met with incoming fire from other raiders, despite <strong>rarely </strong>opening fire first. Twice, we were pushed at extraction and shot in the back while trying to get out of the map. On another raid, we fought to take down a Leaper for our Trial, learning that a duo sat in the bushes waiting for us to secure the kill so they could, subsequently, laser us to death.</p>



<p>This is the go-to standard in ARC Raiders now. There are videos and guides online geared towards ‘guaranteed entry’ to PvE-focused lobbies, which involve shooting <strong>no human enemies </strong>for around ten raids, but it’s a loose concept at best. Like the game’s loot model, securing a PvE-focused raid is based on RNG, and it depends entirely on who you’re matched with.</p>



<p>For a PvE-focused event to work in ARC Raiders, and I mean <strong>truly work with a 0% failure rate</strong>, Embark Studios has to build servers (even temporary ones) that have raider damage switched off or altered. By that, I mean you cannot take damage from another raider, period. On these servers, only ARC will be a threat.</p>



<p>To capitalize on that and keep things balanced, I’d be willing to see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">Embark Studios</a> <strong>increase the risk </strong>from ARC on these servers. Make them tougher, more plentiful, more aggressive, whatever it takes. But the balance is, you can’t be gunned down by ARC enemies.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has said time and again that PvE doesn’t work, despite the game’s original operating model being geared towards just that. But as a limited-time event, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a map condition</a>, or even a specific map built <strong>only </strong>for PvE, I think an entire audience would feel validated and well served.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Insane $4,000+ Handheld is ‘Dreamlike’ and Beats Most Gaming Laptops]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ayaneo-next-2-insane-handheld-beats-laptops/</link>
            <guid>1431934</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you thought that spending $800 to acquire a ROG Xbox Ally X was a stretch, you’ll baulk at the Ayaneo Next 2. This all-new gaming handheld, dubbed ‘dreamlike’ by Ayaneo, carries a price tag of up to <strong>$4,299</strong> if you want to get the most powerful version available. It’s tough to fathom <strong>why</strong>, but when you uncover the tech specs, it starts to make a little sense.</p>



<p>This immensely aspirational device is ambitious, and it’ll probably sell all of about three units in its lifetime, but it’s an indication of just how much effort handheld manufacturers are willing to cram into these devices.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-the-ayaneo-next-2-so-expensive">Why is the Ayaneo Next 2 so Expensive?</h2>



<p>To be fair, the <a href="https://ayaneo.com/article/901" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ayaneo Next 2</a> pricing starts at $1,999, or $1,799 if you pre-order and soak up an early bird discount. That version boasts AMD’s new Ryzen AI Max 385 processor and Radeon 8050S graphics, which come equipped with 32 GB of memory and 1 TB of storage. That’s already enough to trump every other handheld on the market.</p>



<p>But if you ramp up the specification and head for the top-tier version of the Ayaneo Next 2, you’re getting one hell of an upgrade.</p>



<p>For a princely sum of $4,299, or just $3,499 with that pre-order discount, you’ll get the AMD Ryzen Max+ 395 processor, a Radeon 8060S iGPU, an eye-watering 128 GB of memory, and double storage – 2 TB total.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about the makeup of this thing.</p>



<p>The Ayaneo Next 2 has a gorgeous OLED screen measuring just north of 9 inches. across, and a dynamic, adjustable refresh rate of up to 165Hz. It effectively puts other handhelds to shame, as the OLED screen is still rarely seen in the on-the-go gaming space.</p>



<p>There’s a massive on-board battery with a 116Wh capacity, which decimates the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-ally/" id="2725">ROG Xbox Ally X’s</a> 80Wh battery. But that’s because the Ayaneo Next 2 has <strong>so much to power</strong>. We’re talking advanced cooling solutions, RGB elements, two USB-C ports, Hall Effect triggers, TMR joysticks, insane brightness capabilities, and powerful, front-facing speakers.</p>



<p>Ayaneo has gone beyond the standard considerations, including features like trigger locks and even more rear buttons than you’d expect.</p>



<p>When it drops, the Ayaneo Next 2 will have shells available in both ‘Polar Black’ and ‘Aurora White’. It’s worth stressing that it’s not expected to be released until <strong>June 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>Do you think the Ayaneo Next 2 is worth more than $4,000? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
