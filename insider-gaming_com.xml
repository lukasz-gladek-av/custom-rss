            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The prices for all four editions of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wwe-2k26/" id="3461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K26 </a>have leaked ahead of the official start of pre-orders on January 30.</p>



<p>WWE 2K26 will be released in four versions, and according to a new report from billbil-kun of <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/wwe-2k26-switch-2-plateformes-date-de-sortie-ce-que-lon-sait-60917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, the prices for the upcoming game have been released. The Standard Edition, which includes only the base game, will be priced at $69.99. The King of Kings Edition, the second-tier “Deluxe” edition, will be priced at $99.99.</p>



<p>Then, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/" id="171784" rel="nofollow">Attitude Era Edition</a>, the “Premium” Edition of the game, will release for $129.99. Finally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-reveals-monday-night-war-edition-cover/" id="171836" rel="nofollow">Monday Night War Edition </a>will provide access to the most content throughout the game’s lifecycle and will be priced at $149.99.</p>



<p>In addition to providing players with more content at no additional cost, all higher-priced tiers will grant access to the game on March 6. Reportedly, this is 7 days earlier than when players who purchased only the standard tier will be able to play.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-leaves-last-gen-consoles-behind">WWE 2K26 Leaves Last-Gen Consoles Behind</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>After years of the current WWE game line releasing on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the ESRB rating for WWE 2K26 confirms that this year’s release will be limited to current-gen consoles.</p>



<p>Ironically, while WWE 2K26 leaves the past behind with its console releases, much of the game’s marketing has been rooted in WWE’s past. The Attitude Era and Monday Night War Editions focus heavily on the peak of WWE popularity in the late 90s and early 2000s.</p>



<p>Also, all three covers for the higher-priced tiers feature WWE Legends, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-king-of-kings-edition-cover-features-triple-h/" id="171834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one legend in particular on all three covers: Triple H.</a></p>







<h2>WWE 2K26’s Showcase Focuses on CM Punk</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As first reported by Insider Gaming, this year’s 2K Showcase campaign focuses on CM Punk. Players will get to relive some of CM Punk’s greatest moments from his WWE career.</p>



<p>Also, fans can experience fantasy scenarios that may have occurred if CM Punk not left WWE in 2014 before returning in 2023. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" id="169985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Two more castings have been made in the upcoming God of War series on Prime Video. One is a star of Severance. The other is a legendary actor.</p>



<p>As the Prime Video <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war/" id="106">God of War</a> series continues to take shape, two additional casting decisions have been announced. <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/mandy-patinkin-cast-odin-god-of-war-tv-series-1236702507/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline </a>reports that the legendary Mandy Patinkin, known for playing Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride, will be in the upcoming series playing Odin. Odin is known as the “All-Father.” The Ruler of the Norse Pantheon is also the father of Thor and Heimdall. It was previously confirmed that Max Parker will play Heimdall. However, we now know who will play Thor.</p>



<h2>Thor Will Be Portrayed by a Severance Star in the Forthcoming God of War Series</h2>



<p>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson, known for his role as the stern and violent, when necessary, Mr. Drummond on the Apple TV series Severance, will portray the God of Thunder, according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/olafur-darri-olafsson-cast-thor-god-of-war-1236702443/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>. Furthermore, the series will portray Thor as a former soldier of Asgard and Odin’s former right-hand man. He is dealing with some confidence issues and is struggling with alcohol as a means of coping.</p>



<p>Ironically, Ryan Hurst, the series’ Kratos, previously voiced Thor in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok/" id="107">God of War: Ragnarök</a> video game. It has also been confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-live-action-series-has-reportedly-secured-another-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Teresa Palmer will play Thor’s wife, Sif,</a> in the series.</p>







<h2 id="h-prime-video-s-god-of-war-is-already-renewed-for-season-2">Prime Video’s God of War is Already Renewed for Season 2</h2>



<p>Without even having filmed a single episode, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-god-of-war-director-second-season-greenlit-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon renewed the series for a second season</a>. Production is expected to begin in February 2026. The first two episodes are to be directed by Frederick E. O. Toye, who previously directed the video game–to–TV adaptation Fallout.</p>



<p>As of now, there’s no word on when the series will premiere. Insider Gaming will continue to monitor the story and report any and all updates.</p>

<p>Get ready to kid the kids to the vacant lot. A new Backyard Baseball game is coming this year.</p>



<p>Playground Productions has officially announced a new Backyard Baseball game will launch in Summer 2026. It’s the first new game in the Backyard Sports series since Backyard Sports Baseball 2015 for iOS and Android. With a likely release for console, it would be the first for major platforms since Backyard Sports: Rookie Rush in 2010.</p>







<p>Details on the game itself weren’t revealed, but Playground Productions says that information will come in the near future.</p>



<p>To hold over until more news comes, Playground has released Backyard Sports: The Animated Special on YouTube. The nearly 12-minute show features an all-star cast of Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Ego Nwodim, Donald Faison, Adam Pally, and more. </p>



<p><strong>“In a high-energy new animated special from Playground Productions, the beloved 90’s video game franchise “Backyard Sports” returns as superstar Stephanie “Bubbles” Morgan is in crisis after losing her gotta-have-it, never-play-without-it lucky bubble gum,”</strong> the show’s description reads. <strong>“With just 30 minutes until game time, the Backyard kids embark on a wild, time-sensitive mission to track it down and save their season.”&nbsp;</strong></p>
