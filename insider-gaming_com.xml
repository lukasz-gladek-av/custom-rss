            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2025 has been an outstanding year for video games, with countless studios delivering ambitious projects and unforgettable experiences. But even in a year packed with hits, not every release can land on its feet.</p>



<p>As we approach the end of the year, it’s the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-wrapped-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perfect time to look back</a> at the titles that missed the mark—not to revel in their shortcomings, but to understand where things went wrong and how future games can avoid repeating the same mistakes.</p>







<p>So, if you’re wondering which titles might be worth sidestepping, or you’re simply interested in how the year’s disappointments stacked up, here’s a closer look at the ten lowest-rated video games released in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-top-10-lowest-rated-games-released-in-2025">Top 10 Lowest-Rated Games Released In 2025</h2>



<p>This roundup is based entirely on Metascore ratings from Metacritic. To qualify, a game must have launched in 2025 and earned at least seven critic reviews. Keep this in mind with the entries.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">10. Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A tech demo at best. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 54</strong></p>



<p>Kicking off the list is Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a title many argue feels more like a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2s-paid-tutorial-welcome-tour-almost-made-a-player-fall-asleep-at-nintendo-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid tech demo than a traditional game</a>. Designed to highlight the capabilities of the Switch 2, it delivers a handful of fun minigames and some neat insights into the system’s new features.</p>



<p>The real sticking point is value. Fans questioned why this wasn’t bundled for free with the console, similar to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bafta-games-awards-astro-bot-scoops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro’s Playroom on PS5</a>. As a paid standalone release, it’s tough to recommend—and that ultimately lands it among 2025’s lowest-rated titles.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-rennsport">9. RENNSPORT</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t let the graphics deceive you. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 53</strong></p>



<p>On the surface, RENNSPORT presents itself as a competent racing sim, with sharp handling, impressive vehicle audio, and a decent variety of tracks. But it doesn’t take long to notice that it lacks the depth and breadth offered by its biggest competitors.</p>



<p>That shallow content offering raised major concerns when the game launched at a premium price point. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gran-turismo-7-update-1-57-adds-three-new-cars-world-circuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Compared to titles like Gran Turismo</a>, RENNSPORT feels more like a paid demo than a full-featured racing experience, a perception that heavily contributed to its low reception.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-bubsy-in-the-purrfect-collection">8. Bubsy In: The Purrfect Collection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>An unsavoury return of an icon. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 53</strong></p>



<p>There was never much working in favour of Bubsy In: The Purrfect Collection to begin with. While the compilation itself is competently put together and preserves the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-selling-ps1-games-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">classic Bubsy titles</a> accurately, the core problem remains: the original games were never particularly good.</p>



<p>The collection is almost too faithful, offering little to make the experience more palatable for modern players. Despite some welcome extras and accessibility options, you’re still left with four games that range from mediocre to outright bad. As a preservation effort, it’s honest—but that honesty is exactly what lands it as one of 2025’s lowest-rated titles.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact">7. Hunter x Hunter: Nen x Impact</h3>



<figure><figcaption>An underwhelming fighting game debut. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 53</strong></p>



<p>Fans of Hunter x Hunter may appreciate seeing the series make its fighting-game debut, but that doesn’t mean Nen x Impact escapes criticism. There’s the outline of a solid fighter beneath the surface, yet too many shortcomings get in the way.</p>



<p>A thin character roster, underwhelming single-player offerings, and a clunky multiplayer experience all chip away at its potential. Unless you’re a dedicated fan of the franchise, there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-definitive-edition-is-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">far stronger fighting games</a> worth your time.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-neptunia-riders-vs-dogoos">6. Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A mess of a UI. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 51</strong></p>



<p>If Hunter x Hunter caters to committed fans, then Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos is strictly for the diehards. With a brief three-hour campaign, frequent glitches, and a host of technical issues, newcomers are unlikely to stick around long enough to see what the wider series has to offer.</p>



<p>It’s a shame, because there are fleeting moments of the familiar Neptunia charm and playful silliness that fans love. But the lack of substantial content—paired with a price tag that feels far too high—ultimately drags the whole experience down.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-captain-blood">5. Captain Blood</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Well, there’s the blood. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 50</strong></p>



<p>If this were the early 2000s, Captain Blood might have been a bit of a cult favourite. But two decades on, it’s far harder to overlook its flaws—and it’s clear why it ranks among the lowest-rated games of the year.</p>







<p>The gameplay quickly becomes repetitive, the audio feels unfinished, and the overall lack of polish drags the experience down significantly. If you’re craving a PS2-style hack-and-slash, this might scratch that itch, but ironically, many games from that era still hold up better than this modern attempt.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-scar-lead-salvation">4. Scar-Lead Salvation</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Eyes on the orbs. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 44</strong></p>



<p>It’s obvious that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/returnals-4th-anniversary-celebrated-with-ps5-pro-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Returnal heavily inspired</a> Scar-Lead Salvation, which makes it all the more disappointing that it fails to capture what made the PS5 exclusive so compelling. Instead, the result is an uninspired roguelike weighed down by clunky animations and limited enemy variety.</p>



<p>The odd choice to have the protagonist lose clothing as they take damage makes the intended approach pretty transparent. Unfortunately, even the game’s attempts at sex appeal can’t quite mask the frustrations lying beneath the surface.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-ambulance-life-a-paramedic-simulator">3. Ambulance Life: A Paramedic Simulator</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Would you trust your life in their hands? Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 44</strong></p>



<p>Simulators are always a difficult genre to judge; they’re either the cream of the crop or a downright mess. Unfortunately, Ambulance Life might just fall into the latter, as it’s one of 2025’s lowest-rated games.</p>



<p>The game aims to recreate the intensity of emergency response work, but it stumbles in almost every area. In the end, you’re more likely to save a life by avoiding the game than you are playing it. </p>



<h3 id="h-2-tamagotchi-plaza">2. Tamagotchi Plaza</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A charmingly soulless experience. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 43</strong></p>



<p>Everyone loves a Tamagotchi—or at least they used to. After spending time with Tamagotchi Plaza, that nostalgia might fade fast. What made <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tekken-director-katsuhiro-harada-leaves-bandai-namco-after-30-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bandai Namco’s</a> virtual pets so charming back in the day is almost entirely absent here.</p>



<p>There’s simply not much to do. The world you explore feels dull and empty, and the minigames offer little in the way of fun or purpose. Much like the old digital pets themselves, this is one you might want to quietly put away and forget about.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-mindseye">1. MindsEye</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The ‘GTA-killer’ only killed itself. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 37</strong></p>



<p>Oh, MindsEye, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-relaunch-as-ceo-blames-saboteurs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where did it all go wrong</a>? With Leslie Benzies—a former Rockstar veteran—at the helm, expectations were sky-high. Fans hoped he would take everything he learned from one of gaming’s most influential franchises and push the genre into bold new territory.</p>



<p>Instead, what arrived was a launch mired in chaos. Riddled with bugs and technical issues, MindsEye was barely playable for many. And even if you look past the performance problems, the uninspired gameplay and flat narrative leave you wondering why the project was greenlit in the first place.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Year In Review: 2025 Is The Year The Console Wars Ended]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-2025-is-the-year-the-console-wars-ended/</link>
            <guid>1396696</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As a 32-year-old who was in high school during the peak of the PlayStation and Xbox war, 2025 was surreal to me. I was raised as a PlayStation gamer, and even to this day, I have never owned an Xbox console. When the PS3 was being absolutely dominated by the Xbox 360 by all metrics in the mid-to-late 00s, it sucked. The PlayStation 2 is the best-selling console of all time, and the PS3 did an awful job of following it.</p>



<p>It had few must-have exclusives for years, while the Xbox 360 was throwing out the likes of Halo, Gears of War, Forza, Banjo-Kazooie, Viva Piñata, and Left 4 Dead like there was no tomorrow. Eventually, the PS3 went on an exclusive hot streak, and the tide seismically shifted Sony’s way with the PS4 and Xbox One. This has continued with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-years-of-ps5-what-the-numbers-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5</a> and Xbox Series X|S, to the point where it’s evident Microsoft has waved the white flag in the console wars once and for all.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-gears-of-war-is-over">The Gears of War…Is Over</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Xbox’s game plan shifted with the Xbox One, tailoring the experience more toward an all-purpose media device, as opposed to Sony and PlayStation’s single-minded vision for the PS4: Gaming. I feel this is the pivotal moment where Xbox got everything <strong>wrong</strong>, allowing PlayStation to catch up, and the blue brand hasn’t looked back since.</p>



<p>The PS4 outsold the Xbox more than 2 to 1 (which is huge), but Microsoft managed to find a way to engage and retain a healthy amount of its player base—the allure of Xbox Game Pass. A paid subscription service offering a huge catalog of games, including Xbox exclusives, and giving players a new Xbox exclusive on day one.</p>



<p>This was an effective tactic for the longest time. But the model has long been touted as destructive to the industry: Ask <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arkane-studios-founder-game-pass-unsustainable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arkane Studios’ founder, who branded Game Pass as ‘Unsustainable’ and ‘Damaging’</a>. 2025 saw the infamous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-tries-to-defend-xbox-game-pass-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass price hike</a> that left everyone in shock, but it doesn’t seem to have had the big negative impact that was feared.</p>



<p>Microsoft is still making games, but there’s talk that future Xbox ‘exclusives’ are PS5-bound. This is probably expected after a manic 2025, which has effectively seen the console wars end, and Microsoft give up its biggest IPs to its once-rival.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-for-your-thoughts-xbox">Halo For Your Thoughts, Xbox?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image from Microsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s probably an alternate timeline somewhere where Xbox Elite controllers are being used to guide Nathan Drake to Shambhala, strum a guitar in The Last of Us Part 2, and help guide Kratos and Atreus through the fires of Muspelheim. We’re in <em>this </em>timeline, where the Horizon festival is bouncing on PS5 Pros, and Astro Bot-themed devices are having their analog sticks twiddled and turned in an effort to combat Gears of War Reloaded’s Locust.</p>



<p>2025 has been a mega year for PlayStation gamers such as myself. Forza has always eluded me, so has Gears of War, and it’s been a pleasure to soak up these legendary franchises that have stood tall as pillars of Microsoft’s success. However, you can pinpoint the moment when hell froze over, the skies were rife with airborne pigs, and the cows finally came home.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved was officially announced</a> on October 24, and I think it was the <strong>final nail in the coffin for the console wars</strong>. </p>



<p>The biased, 14-year-old Sony fanboy in me felt smug, but maturity hits different. I don’t know how I feel now. A unified platform where games can be played on one console is logically the most consumer-friendly solution. Obviously, Nintendo will never let this happen as it doesn’t need to. But it’s almost shocking that it’s come to this: PlayStation logos appearing in Xbox trailers, and even future Xbox games will likely be coming to PS5 to maximize Microsoft profits. </p>



<p>But where does Xbox go from here? If the biggest Xbox games can be played on PC and PS5, why own an Xbox? Blind brand loyalty? Years of digital purchases and investments forcing you to stick to Xbox? This is where Insider Gaming wants to hear from the community. Do you agree that the console wars are officially over? What’s the best thing Microsoft can do from here?

            <title><![CDATA[The Sims 4: Royalty & Legacy is the Game’s Upcoming 21st Expansion Pack]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sims-4-royalty-and-legacy-final-expansion-pack/</link>
            <guid>1396684</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Sims 4 is set to be expanded <strong>yet again </strong>very soon with the game’s <strong>21st expansion pack </strong>since it was released in September 2014. Fans have been wondering what’s coming for the longest time, as it’s almost inevitable that there always was going to be <strong>at least one more</strong> expansion.</p>



<p>However, the newly uncovered Royalty &amp; Legacy expansion should be the <strong>last expansion pack </strong>ever released for The Sims 4. Electronic Arts is planning to move on after more than a decade of crafting content for the best-selling life sim title.</p>



<h2 id="h-royalty-amp-legacy-is-coming">Royalty &amp; Legacy is Coming</h2>



<p>Recently, it was discovered that the South Korean ratings board had registered The Sims 4: Royalty &amp; Legacy as the 21st, and potentially final, Sims 4 expansion.</p>



<p>In a listing published on December 26, it’s explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The 21st expansion pack for The Sims 4 allows players to become nobles and build a long-lasting dynasty.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It seems like the perfect final expansion for The Sims 4, which has been running for more than a decade. Giving players the ability to create a lasting dynasty in a royal setting is a decent farewell.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.gcrb.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?app=ZUa9f5yNjhI=&amp;type=xl/kTOU3dYU=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Korean ratings board</a> issued a ‘For ages 15 and up’ certificate on account of the expansion having ‘indirect and limited sexual expressions’ and ‘realistic expressions of violence’, which are nothing new for The Sims.</p>



<p>Woo-hoo, right?</p>



<p>The filing was submitted by Electronic Arts Korea Ltd., and while it’s the first rating of its kind, it won’t be the last. We checked the ESRB and PEGI ratings boards but couldn’t find a similar listing at the time of publishing.</p>



<p>Typically, these ratings start getting logged mere days or weeks before an announcement or reveal is made by the developer or publisher. We could be very close to getting a full look at what might be the last Sims 4 expansion ever made.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#938)—Clues and Answers for Sunday, January 4]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-4-938/</link>
            <guid>1396681</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>How is your 2026 going so far? Let’s hope your NYT Connections streak is still running strong and that today you can push that a little further. Today’s puzzle isn’t so challenging, but if you want the fastest solution possible, I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and answers you need down below.</p>



<p>Feel free to scroll down and resolve today’s NYT Connections as quickly as you can!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-4">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 4)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #938:</p>



<ul>
<li>TACKLE</li>



<li>EDITION</li>



<li>REEL</li>



<li>GRUMP</li>



<li>BLOCK</li>



<li>COIL</li>



<li>ISSUE</li>



<li>DREAR</li>



<li>CRANK</li>



<li>SACK</li>



<li>SCAN</li>



<li>WIND</li>



<li>COPY</li>



<li>BLITZ</li>



<li>ETAIL</li>



<li>PRINT</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about words that show up when something is published, reproduced, or released to the public.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Picture something that <strong>rotates, twists, or winds up</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are all actions you’d hear shouted by commentators during a <strong>high‑pressure defensive moment in American football</strong>.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These look like normal words — until you notice they’re hiding something.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 4:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-january-4-938">NYT Connections Answers for Today, January 4 (#938)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>

</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Use these active Roblox Walk or Die monthly redeem codes to get free rewards like Dollaz in the game, and get ahead of the competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inspired by Stephen King’s The Long Walk, Walk or Die is a survival <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-drift-36-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that lives up to the phrase “survival of the fittest.” Players must keep walking behind a military truck, collect resources along the way, and avoid falling behind or face death by gunfire. On top of that, the map throws deadly disasters at you, including different types of spikes, fire, and more, causing many avatars to drop dead during the long march. To become the last one standing, you’ll need the best Classes, storage upgrades, and other survival-focused tactics. Since these cost a lot of Dollaz, you can use the active Walk or Die codes to fill your treasury and buy them without grinding.</p>
