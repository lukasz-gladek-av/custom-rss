<p>Calling all PlayStation Spartans in training, there’s a hydra-sized God of War Sons of Sparta Trophy List for you to climb, making the arduous trek to Olympus seem like child’s play.</p>



<p>A Metroidvania <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war/" id="106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> title was a constant discussion in the rumor pipeline for a long time. The speculation suggested a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumoured God of War Metroidvania game would feature Kratos’ Brother</a>, and it does. </p>



<p>Now that Sons of Sparta is here, there’s no mystery left, other than its Trophy List. A mystery solved in this guide right now.</p>

<p>His wife, Amelia Rose Blaire, is also featured in the game. She will be voicing Eleonora.</p>
