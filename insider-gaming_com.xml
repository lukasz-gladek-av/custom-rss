<p>FragPunk has announced that it is launching for Xbox Series X/S and PS5 on April 29, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-fragpunk-console-launch-gifts-crossplay-support-and-more">FragPunk Console Launch Gifts, Crossplay Support and More</h2>



<p>To celebrate FragPunk’s launch on consoles, the developers have arranged some gifts for players. Players who use newly registered console game accounts can claim the gifts. The gifts will also include exclusive time-limited event rewards that will be available from the start of Season 1 to April 29. The owners of the Pioneer bundle will be eligible for these gifts. More details about rewards and distribution will be revealed close to the launch.</p>



<p>FragPunk players wondering if they can compete with PC players or want to have their accounts on both platforms will be happy to know that the console version will feature crossplay and cross-progression. More details about cross-platform features will be shared ahead of the launch.</p>



<p>FragPunk’s console launch will also bring some buffs to controllers to provide a smooth gameplay experience. Players on the console version will observe that the controller players will have enhanced aim assist. This feature has been added to “minimize the disparity between controller and keyboard/mouse input and provide an equally competitive environment for all players.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/balatros-latest-accolade-is-a-surprise-appearance-in-netflixs-black-mirror/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a wildly successful awards seasons, the breakout indie game sensation Balatro continues to reach a mainstream audience, with a surprise appearance in the hit Netflix series Black Mirror. The show’s creator is a big fan, and the game’s appearance is the latest accolade for a game with momentum that will not slow down.</p>



<h2 id="h-balatro-s-breakout-success-carries-into-2025-with-black-mirror-appearance">Balatro’s Breakout Success Carries Into 2025 with Black Mirror Appearance</h2>



<p>A number of fans of the show Black Mirror quickly spotted the appearance of Balatro in “Hotel Reverie,” the third episode of the latest series, which stars actresses Issa Rae, Awkwafina, Emma Corrin, and Harriet Walter. The sci-fi-dystopia series released its seventh series today, and its fifth since switching from the UK’s Channel 4 to global streaming giant Netflix. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Charlie Brooker, the creator, producer, and head writer for Black Mirror, was at one point obsessed with Balatro, according <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-interview-1236034654/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to an interview</a> he did with entertainment outlet Deadline back in August 2024.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This is going to sound so tragic, but right now there’s a game called Balatro. It’s like poker, and it’s possibly the most addictive thing ever created. It’s currently on Nintendo Switch and Steam deck, but it’s going to be released on phones, and at that point I think humankind’s activity is going to drop about 25%. I play that in short bursts when I’m writing to reward myself.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans of the game wished at the time that maybe Balatro could be the primary focus of an episode of Black Mirror, but most are happy with an appearance in the show. I say “most” since <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1jvun13/balatro_is_in_the_new_black_mirror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a number of fans are upset</a> with how the character is playing. One of the Jokers in play is Sixth Sense, which rewards you with a Spectral card if your first hand is just a single 6, but they play a Full House instead. Some with even keener eyes have noticed that the all the Jokers in play line up with the tutorial seed.</p>



<p>After releasing in the beginning of 2024, Balatro ended the year with widespread critical and commercial success. The game has landed several awards over the past few months, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Community’s Indie Game of the Year award</a>, and added a BAFTA for Debut Game just days before the latest Black Mirror series dropped.</p>



<p>What else is next in Balatro’s meteoric rise? A movie appearance? A sequel? Let us know what you think in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>At the BAFTA Games Awards in London, I had the phenomenal opportunity to catch up with Masumi, the talented performer behind Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Naoe. The shinobi character took my expectations and firmly exceeded them, so much so that I labelled her the best Assassin’s Creed character we’ve seen in many years.</p>



<p>As I chatted with Masumi on the red carpet, I was curious to learn how she came to land the role of Naoe, given that it was her first ever job in video games.</p>



<p>What she revealed was quite surprising – but as I’ve learned, not entirely out of the ordinary.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has delivered on bold promises made by Ubisoft. It’s a stunning game with a solid amount of meat on the bones, and it’s a turning point of sorts for the series. My only hope is that Ubisoft can capitalise on the game’s success and keep the ball rolling.</p>



<p>I asked Masumi, who plays Naoe in Shadows, about how she landed the role and how it felt to be such a pivotal part of this transformation. This is her <strong>first video game role</strong>, after all.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m so honored. I <strong>didn’t know what Assassin’s Creed was</strong> before I booked it, because I don’t play video games, so actually, it was like a gradual realisation of what I’m a part of, and I just feel so excited and honoured.</p>



<p>I got an audition for it but I prepped the role just like I would for film or TV. I had to spend two years – actually I’m still on it, so it’s like a long time – developing this character, so I got to really dive into Naoe, which was amazing. It was so layered, her character was.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also discussed some of the more controversial topics, such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-lead-actress-shrine-destruction-hurt-heart/">‘shrine destruction’ theme</a> that was aired ahead of the game’s release. She explained how she didn’t know those elements were present in the game, but they ‘hurt her heart’ to see them.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be expanded in the coming months by expansions, and I, for one, am very excited to see them and to continue down this path with Masumi’s character.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think about Masumi’s performance on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
