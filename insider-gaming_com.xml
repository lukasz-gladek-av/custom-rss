<p>Developer Strange Scaffold has announced the release date for its latest game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT): Tactical Takedown. The game is currently scheduled to release for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC</a> on May 22.</p>



<p>Created by the studio behind games like El Paso, Elsewhere and I Am Your Beast, TMNT: Tactical Takedown is a turn-based game that follows what happens after both Splinter and Shredder die.</p>



<p>“Reimagining the franchise with a bold new vision,&nbsp;Tactical Takedown&nbsp;blends turn-based strategy with fast-paced beat-em-up action,” the game’s description reads. “With Splinter and Shredder dead, and the Turtles on the cusp of adulthood, players fight through 20 mutating levels, battling iconic foes like the Foot Clan in this coming-of-age story.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ea-skate-microtransactions-range-from-e5-e99-in-closed-alpha/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On Tuesday night, Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-adds-microtransactions-to-skates-closed-alpha/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the first to report</a> of microtransactions being added to the closed alpha playtest of EA Skate. Now, just a couple days later, we have an idea at what EA is charging for their San Van Bucks (SVB) within the game.</p>



<p>Thanks to a Reddit user by the name of <a href="https://postimg.cc/gallery/CkGNDr3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sm1one_out_there</a>, it appears that EA is charging users a range of €5-€99—the prices shared are in Euros, but the conversion for microtransactions is usually similar to USD, so expect $5-$99—for the in-game currency. </p>



<p>At €5, you get 500 SVB. At €9.99, that jumps to 1050 SVB including a 5% boost in the amount you receive. The rest of the options are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>€24.99 – 3,000 SVB</li>



<li>€49.99 – 6,250 SVB</li>



<li>€99.99 – 13,000 SVB</li>
</ul>



<p>Based on other images shown, as well as previously announced plans by EA, all of the microtransaction purchases go towards in-game cosmetics. There are no pay-to-win mechanics coming to EA Skate.</p>



<p>An example of item costs include 200 SVB for socks, 300 SVB for board art, and 400 SVB for a tank top.</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that the microtransactions are currently only being added to PC and PlayStation players during the playtest. EA and Full Circle will also cease giving players “random grants of SVB” that it had been doing in prior playtests. </p>



<p>They also reaffirmed that “any SVB purchased will be credited back at Early Access launch” provided you are using the same EA account for both playtests and Early Access. Lastly, it was confirmed that items acquired during the playtest will also be reset at Early Access launch, but not during the playtest itself.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-is-partnering-with-asus-for-upcoming-gaming-handheld-its-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new report claims Xbox’s upcoming gaming handheld is being developed in partnership with Asus.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-and-asus-partner-up">Xbox and Asus Partner Up</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-launching-partner-gaming-handheld-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that Microsoft was working on a partner gaming handheld for 2025 called Project Kennan. Now, through a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-project-kennan-gaming-handheld-everything-we-know-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, we know that Xbox is partnering with Asus on the project. The device will be similar to the Asus ROG Ally but with “an Xbox-y twist.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Xbox x Asus gaming handheld will seemingly follow a more ‘Xbox style’, featuring an Xbox Guide button that was reported earlier. However, it is unclear whether the device will be a separate SKU from the ROG Ally 2 or be a version of that device, which is “subsidised by Xbox”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report also tells us that the Xbox x Asus handheld will not play Xbox games, as it is “a tried-and-true Windows PC in essence”. Players will have the same access as they have on the Asus ROG Ally, being able to play games from Xbox Play Anywhere, Xbox Cloud Gaming and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. At the same time, they can also use other stores such as Steam, Epic Games Stores and launchers like Riot on the upcoming handheld.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-project-kennan-specs-price-and-more">Project Kennan Specs, Price and More</h2>



<p>The report also discusses the specifications, price, and other details of the Xbox x Asus gaming handheld. The device could use an AMD Z2 Go or a Z2 extreme chipset. The cost, which has to be taken with a massive grain of salt, could be between $499 and $599 for the base model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, Microsoft wants the upcoming handheld to resemble the Xbox as closely as possible, and it will exist “as a proof of concept of sorts.” The Xbox apps are being redesigned to be better optimised on small screens, and the Xbox Game Bar also received an update recently to make it look more like an Xbox rather than a Windows PC.</p>



<p>In other news, a next-gen Xbox console is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-gen-xbox-console-release-planned-for-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned for 2027</a>. According to claims, the next console might <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-not-a-console-at-all-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not be a traditional one</a>. What are your thoughts on the Xbox x Asus handheld?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
