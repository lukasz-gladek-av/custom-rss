<p>After an earlier claim—or belief, depending on how you want to look at it—stating otherwise, some insiders have started to say that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is not coming out in 2026. In addition, it won’t be in attendance at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Last year at The Game Awards, Naughty Dog revealed its next title,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. The sci-fi set space fantasy looked way different than previous studio titles, minus some familiar faces. Hype for the title has been palpable, so when former gaming journalist Colin Moriarty appeared to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-2026-release-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claim the game</a> would release in 2026, many were excited. However, it seems it would be short-lived, as credible insiders have come to debunk the report, including Moriarty himself.</p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I sympathize with being misquoted. He was speculating and people on the internet pretended he wasn't. Either way, this caused people to confirm to me it won't be out in 2026 and it won't be at TGAs. </p><p>I'm not interested in keeping score on who said what right on a podcast.</p></div>— Grubb (@JeffGrubb) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1992351916517683631?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>After Colin Moriarty’s comments went viral, some insiders <strong>quickly hopped onto social media</strong> to <strong>debunk the report of Intergalactic releasing in 2026</strong>. The first to do so was <strong>Jason Schreier</strong>, a notable name in the gaming industry. Commenting on a /GamingLeaksandRumours post, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p3zwoe/comment/nq8f5f9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he states</a>, “<strong>Can assure you that Intergalactic is not coming out in 2026.</strong>“</p>



<p>Then, video game journalist and insider Jeff Grubb <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1992351916517683631?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on Twitter</a> that not only would Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet <strong>not come out in 2026</strong>, but <strong>it won’t be at The Game Awards this year</strong>. Following suit, Colin Moriarty <a href="https://x.com/longislandviper/status/1992340284026331442">commented on social media</a> that his words, used in the report, <strong>were taken out of context</strong> and that <strong>it was his opinion</strong>.</p>



<p>Either way, it does look like Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will be quite a while away. Neil Druckmann himself, who is directing the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-will-fans-see-more-of-intergalactic-neil-druckmann-wont-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">couldn’t confirm</a> when we’d see the title again. It will be interesting to see when more will come out, though it’ll be exciting to watch gameplay. Naughty Dog’s track record is rather solid, so, whatever year it does launch, it’ll be one to watch out for.</p>
