<p>The Indie Game Awards have announced the full list of award categories and nominees for its inaugural show on December 19.</p>



<p>In total, there are 15 awards up for grabs at the event with 63 games vying for awards in music, gameplay design, innovation, narrative, and more. Two awards, Storyteller and Industry Impact, didn’t have a list of nominees announced. Instead, those two awards will be announced specifically during The Indie Game Awards show.</p>



<p>“Narrowing down 365 days of remarkable indie games across the 15 categories was a gargantuan task for our curation jury,” The Indie Game Awards co-creator Mike Towndrow told Insider Gaming. “But the list we’ve landed on is a killer reflection of how much the indie scene has stepped up this year. </p>



<p>He added: “Take the Game of the Year category, for example. Those 10 games represent an incredibly diverse range of elements we all look for when discussing some of the greatest games of all time. They’re a perfect snapshot of how indies continue to push the boundaries and drive the industry forward.”</p>



<p>As mentioned, Game of the Year, the biggest award of the show, has 10 games nominated. Those games include 1000xRESIST, ARCO, Animal Well, Balatro, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, Neva, Nine Sols, UFO 50, Mouthwashing, and Crypt Custodian.</p>



<p>“Our goal is for The Indie Game Awards to become the definitive annual celebration of the indie scene,” Towndrow said. “That endgame vision is made possible through the deep collaboration we’ve built with fellow indie showcases, organizations, journalists, content creators, and, of course, the developers themselves. </p>



<p>“And this is just the beginning. We’re more motivated than ever to expand that collaboration and scale, bringing even more individuals into the fold to make The IGAs a staple of the indie scene—a celebration that breaks through into the wider gaming industry.”</p>



<p>You can check out the full list of nominees below. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of The Indie Game Awards when they air on December 19 at 7pm ET.</p>

<p>Remedy Entertainment has announced that Alan Wake 2 has sold 1.8 million units to date.</p>



<p>The news came via the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s capital markets day</a>, during which the company deep-dived into its financials and past and future projects. During the presentations, it was announced that Alan Wake 2 sold 1.8 million units since its October 2023 release date (just over one year).</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Remedy Entertainment announced that the game was close to fully recouping its development and marketing costs with its ongoing sales. Still, it’s unclear if the game has become profitable at the time of writing. However, the recent sales numbers show that 1.8 million times 70 dollars (the high-end average) would put the total amount generated at approximately $126 million.</p>



<p>Released on October 27, 2023, Alan Wake 2 received generally favorable reviews according to review aggregated Metacritic and sold one million units by February 2024. The game won multiple awards at The Game Awards 2023, including Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, and Best Art Direction.</p>

<p>Aim is everything in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a>, as you’ll need to stay accurate to get the fastest TTK possible. While using the meta <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-krig-c-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-dragons-breath-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attachments</a> helps a lot, having the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-black-ops-6-controller-settings-aiming-combat-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best and most comfortable aim settings</a> can be extremely beneficial, especially on controller.</p>



<p>This is mainly due to Aim Assist, and while it’s been nerfed in BO6, it remains a fundamental advantage that controller players will want to make the most of. That said, here are the best Aim Assist settings in Black Ops 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-aim-assist-settings-in-bo6">Best Aim Assist Settings in BO6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Sensitivity Multiplier: </strong>Preference</li>



<li><strong>Look Inversion (On Foot): </strong>Standard</li>



<li>Aiming Advanced Settings
<ul>
<li><strong>Look Inversion (all):</strong> Standard</li>



<li><strong>ADS Sensitivity Transition Timing:</strong> Gradual</li>



<li><strong>3rd Person ADS Correction Type: </strong>Assist</li>



<li><strong>Aim Response Curve Type:</strong> Standard</li>



<li><strong>Custom Sensitivity Per Zoom:</strong> Off</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Target Aim Assist: </strong>On</li>



<li><strong>Motion Sensor Behavior:</strong> Off</li>
</ul>



<p>The most important setting here is Target Aim Assist as if you turn this off, you won’t receive any help when your crosshairs are near an enemy. It’s important to note that Aim Assist has been nerfed in BO6, as the devs reduced its strength when in close-quarters combat. Also, there are no longer multiple Aim Assist options, with the devs deciding to simplify the aiming system for controller.</p>



<p>Other controller settings like Sensitivity and Deadzone Inputs will further help your accuracy and therefore increase the effectiveness of Aim Assist, so it’s important to have these settings dialed in too. We recommend playing around with different Sensitivity settings and choosing one that feels comfortable, and as for Deadzone, reduce the right stick value to as low as 3, but if your stick is drifting, increase this value until the drift stops.</p>

<h2 id="h-where-to-find-aim-assist-setting-in-bo6">Where to find Aim Assist setting in BO6</h2>



<ol>
<li>Boot up Call of Duty.</li>



<li>Go to Black Ops 6.</li>



<li>Head to Settings.</li>



<li>Scroll to the Controller tab and then Aiming.</li>



<li>You’ll find Aim Assist under the second section.</li>
</ol>



<p>Aim Assist is a controversial topic for competitive online FPS games, as the war between mouse and keyboard vs controller continues. </p>

<p>As per the latest reports, Pokemon TCG Pocket has raked in over $120.8 million between October 30 and November 17, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to data from <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AppMagic</a> (shared via <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-surges-past-100-million-in-17-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PocketGamer</a>), Pokemon TCG Pocket reached over $100 million in earnings on November 15 and exceeded $120 million by November 17. The game has been generating over $6.4 million in daily player spending since launch, with November 17 marking its highest earnings at $8.2 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In its first week, Pokemon TCG Pocket earned $35.8 million. In the second week, earnings increased to $48.5 million, and in the third week, they reached $37.2 million with a few days still remaining.</p>



<p>When it comes to regional spending, fans from Japan are the most significant contributors, accounting for 42% of the global expenditure, with a total of $50.6 million spent. The United States follows, making up 28% of global spending with $33.6 million.</p>



<p>The Pokémon TCG Pocket has made an impressive debut, surpassing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-crossed-30-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30 million downloads in just the first 9 days</a> and generating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-already-earned-over-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over $12 million in revenue within the first 4 days</a>.
