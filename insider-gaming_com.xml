<p>For many, the holiday season is the only time of the year they get off from work. It’s a chance to sit back on the couch, relax between chores around the house, and play a video game or two. You might even have time to beat one. If you’re on the fence about what to play, however, we can help. Here are the five best video game releases from 2024 worth replaying this holiday season!</p>



<h2 id="h-top-5-game-releases-worth-replaying-in-2024">Top 5 Game Releases Worth Replaying in 2024</h2>



<p>It was a big year in gaming, with too many new releases to count, and more than a handful of standout releases. If you were unable to keep up with all the new launches, or have a handful of favorites that you’d like to return to, this holiday season is a good time!</p>



<h3 id="h-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following the announcement of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, which features <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solo or three-player co-op</a> play, many of us fully intend to return to the world of The Lands Between this holiday season. But more importantly, it’s an excellent time to dive into the expansion, which is absolutely massive and, in some cases, more challenging than the vanilla game.</p>



<h3 id="h-slay-the-princess-the-pristine-cut">Slay the Princess – The Pristine Cut</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s like Groundhog Day but more twisted. Slay the Princess is an existential horror game in which your dialogue choices change the course of the story across various timelines. Each world varies in some way, from a different setting to a different princess altogether, and your choices can either set off a chain of events that end the world or save everyone at a significant cost.</p>



<h3 id="h-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>While it didn’t fully stick its landing, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is still an exceptional RPG with so much depth and potential. There’s a lot to explore, from countless quests to mini-games to collectibles. It’ll eat up most of your vacation time, and you might finish it if you’re lucky, but now’s a good time to try before the third entry releases.</p>



<h3 id="h-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you only want to play one game this holiday season, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth will eat up every second of your free time. It’s a massive, lengthy RPG featuring Ichiban Kasuga, the loveable underdog, and Kazuma Kiryu, the broken fighter, exploring a huge landscape with countless turn-based battles and memorable minigames to play.</p>



<h3 id="h-balatro">Balatro</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to LocalThunk</figcaption></figure>



<p>What’s left to say about Balatro? It’s one of the more unique releases of the past year, focusing on roguelike deck-building and out-there poker mechanics that make for an enthralling experience. It’s one many were hoping would win Game of the Year, though Astro Bot beat it, as expected, but that shouldn’t stop anyone from sitting down for a hand or two or fourteen this holiday season!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-games-coming-in-2025-best-new-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>After an epic 2024, it’s already time to look ahead to the biggest games coming out in 2025 across all the major platforms: PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC—and it’s good news, many amazing-looking titles are looking to bankrupt us all.</p>



<p>I would argue 2024 didn’t reach the sky-high heights of 2023’s barnstorming 12 months. However, this isn’t to say it was a bad year by any means. RPGs have smashed it with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-games-coming-in-2025-best-new-games/ReFantazio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a> brought a new lease of life to 3D platformers, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-has-generated-approximately-4-4-million-on-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro</a>—an underdog indie title—justifiably achieved Game of the Year recognition.</p>



<p>There’s been plenty to enjoy in 2024, but now, we look ahead to the next year. 2025’s biggest projected games are seriously seismic, and my bank account is already worried. Providing we don’t get any delays, here is our projected list of the nine best new games releasing in 2025 across PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>



<h2 id="h-9-best-new-games-releasing-in-2025">9 Best New Games Releasing in 2025</h2>



<p>You can never tell what the gaming industry has up its sleeve. For now, this is our list of top titles expected to come out in 2025, but expect to be blindsided by shadow drops and shock announcements during Summer Game Fest, Gamescom, and the Tokyo Game Show, amongst others.</p>



<h2 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Expect GTA 6 to mirror real life more than ever. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s be honest, if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> does release in 2025, it’s game over for everyone else. Every subsequent launch for about a month  (and beyond) has to contend with millions of players getting stuck into GTA 6. It’s probably already got Game of the Year in the bag, and it’s the<strong> biggest video game ever</strong>. </p>



<p>Rockstar’s track record is about as good as any, and while we’ve seen very little of GTA 6—we don’t need to—what we have seen looks like the meatiest and most engaging GTA project to date. Fingers crossed GTA 6 comes out in 2025, and if it does, we’re already in for one of the best gaming years in recent memory.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for 2025.</p>







<figure><figcaption>SNAAAAAKE. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>The initial Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake trailers show Konami is faithfully recreating the original story and fleshing it out with refined gameplay mechanics. The lifelike graphics are what we come to expect from a Konami production, and the fact a new generation gets to experience the thrill of where the series chronologically began, gives me a beaming smile on my face.</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid is one of my two favorite franchises ever (God of War being the other) and I’m not making it up when I say <strong>MGS3 is my pick of the bunch</strong>. The fact it’s the first one to get the fully-fledged, next-gen remake treatment warms my soul more than any fire-roasted Kenyan Mangrove Crab could. Welcome back, Big Boss.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for 2025.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Z-A has big shoes to fill. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>In Pokémon Legends: Z-A, we’re in Lumiose City—set in the Kalos region. Again, not much is known about what the new adventure entails. It is another isolated journey in a fixed location, and the debut trailer suggests the game world might be slightly more crowded compared to the quieter nature of Arceus.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends Arceus deviated from what is considered the norm for a Pokémon game. Its large, open-world design is still relatively new, it moves away from the familiar locales of cities, gyms, and the hustle and bustle of an active Pokémon title, and it features the game-changing attribute of having wild Mon attacking you! Between the flexible catching mechanics, epic Raid-style boss battles, and unique story, Legends Arceus was a bold and beautiful new direction for the franchise. </p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can Ubisoft finally get it right? Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>2024 was not a good year for Ubisoft</strong>, and its stock might metaphorically and literally might be as low as it’s ever been. Skull &amp; Bones’ hellish development cycle costing hundreds of millions of dollars flopped, Star Wars Outlaws is more low-level rookie than it is heroic wookie, and XDefiant—Ubisoft’s much-hyped Call of Duty killer—is already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-xdefiant-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down</a> in 2025. Several other Ubisoft games have been canceled, the company is facing countless layoffs, and the public perception of the once-legendary studio isn’t great.</p>



<p>No pressure on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> then. The cut-and-dried Ubisoft open-world formula is a big concern heading into the latest AC game. Players are tired of the same routine, collect-a-thons with barebones stories, and a lack of innovation. Shadows can write these wrongs, its 16th-century Japanese setting intrigues, and gameplay footage shows you can be a true assassin once again. Ubisoft needs a big win here, and it could be a true Valentine’s love story if Assassin’s Creed Shadows captures the hearts and minds of its fan base on launch day.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Feb. 14, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t toy with our emotions, Nintendo. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond didn’t have the “Beyond” name for a while, nor did it have any identity, or fill fans with confidence it would ever see the light of day. Metroid Prime 4 was announced at E3 2017 and went through development hell after having its progress restarted. Finally, the June 18, 2024, Nintendo Direct showed us the first-ever gameplay footage of Prime 4.</p>



<p>Two minutes of Morph Ball mayhem, Space Pirate scallywags, and Samus being Samus later, and Metroid Prime fans everywhere are crying—me included. <strong>I fail to see a universe where Metroid Prime 4: Beyond isn’t a GOTY contender</strong>, and even if it’s not, everyone is primed and ready for what’s coming—and Beyond.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-judas">Judas</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Years in the making. Credit to Ghost Story Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Oh, Ken Levine, where have you been in my life for the last 11 years? The Bioshock trilogy is as consistent as three games get, and Judas is the natural successor to Levine’s masterful trifecta of first-person shooters. <strong>Judas’ core mechanics are akin to System Shock and Bioshock</strong>, and short of having the word “shock” somewhere in the game title, I’m pleased to say the shooter appears to share a lot in common with those who painfully paved the way through Rapture and Columbia.</p>



<p>Your left hand is used for magical powers and elemental enchantments, whereas your right hand is mainly used to fire weapons. I expect another deeply woven story with an assortment of narrative strands taking us in every direction, allowing us to dictate our ending. The enemies manage to look equal parts cutesy, terrifying, and horrifying, and Judas’ biomes are sure to give Levine’s previous work a run for its money.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for March 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-2025">Call of Duty 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’ve got another job to do. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>CoD titles leaking years in advance is a common occurrence. We already know the 2025 edition of Activision’s multi-billion shooter bonanza is a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">semi-futuristic Black Ops 2 sequel.</a>” It’s under the codename of “Saturn,” and <strong>Call of Duty 2025 is set well in the future</strong>. It remains to be seen if your boots remain on the ground—I hope so—but what is going to be seen is an assortment of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-2024-black-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops map remakes</a>.</p>



<p>BLOPS campaigns are always a blast, so it should be fun to see where the franchise goes next. Call of Duty 2025 should have no connection to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, and we expect more leaks to come out of thin air like a ramp-propelled RC-XD. Stay tuned for further developments throughout 2025.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for October / November 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A beloved classic is back. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Oddly, we haven’t had an original Donkey Kong game in a while, but Donkey Kong Country Returns HD should suffice. In the same way, 2018’s Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze was a port of the OG 2014 release, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a sprucing up of 2010’s Donkey Kong Country Returns—first debuting on the Nintendo Wii.</p>



<p>You know what to expect with Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, and even if you’ve played it before, it might be worth swinging into the jungle one more time—you’d be bananas if you didn’t, so stop monkeying around.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Jan. 16, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Monster Hunter be wild. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>It can be argued that 2018’s Monster Hunter: World catapulted the long-running series into the marquee: Finally achieving worldwide superstardom. A metaphorical sleeping beast is now very much awake. The attention Monster Hunter: Wilds has gotten already—thanks to exposure from PlayStation Showcases and similar presentations—shows Capcom’s monster-maiming franchise is escalating at a monstrous (pun intended) rate.</p>



<p><strong>Monster Hunter: Wilds incorporates more naturalism and realism</strong>, it’s catering to fans both old and new, and features a slew of new monsters waiting to be slain or saved. The first open beta alone attracted half a million players on Steam, and you can tell Capcom is chomping at the bit to make Wilds larger than life.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Feb. 28, 2025.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Leak Reveals Data About Loot Boxes]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-reveals-data-about-loot-boxes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-leak-reveals-data-about-loot-boxes.1068579/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-reveals-data-about-loot-boxes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A prominent Marvel Rivals leaker has revealed some details about loot boxes that were seemingly removed from the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-datamine-leak-loot-box-scrapped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, RivalsLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871169815278195163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) has provided information about Marvel Rivals’ cancelled loot boxes, such as the rarities, animations, icons and more. The loot boxes would’ve been divided across four tiers: Gray, Blue, Purple, Yellow, and Red. Grey would’ve been the least rare, providing potentially a recolour of the skin, and Red would be the rarest of the lot, where all the premium cosmetics can be found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To acquire these loot boxes, players would have to “convert Lattice and Units into Crystallization (main currency) and Marscoin (blue currency), which can then be used to pull for skins.” Besides a new skin, these boxes might’ve also included rewards like emotes, player cards, sprays and more. Moreover, the files revealed that the loot box system is time-bound and potentially connected to a special limited-time event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, RivalsLeaks has clarified that they could be wrong about Marvel Rivals loot boxes, as they are only going by the information they can dig up from the files. In the same thread, the original poster also <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871178424016105934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a> that they had been told that the loot boxes “might be crapped, but who knows, maybe one day they might get added?”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals celebrated reaching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-celebrates-20-million-players-with-a-free-reward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20 million players with a free reward</a>. Also, here’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-free-skins-in-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to get free skins</a> in the game.
