<p>Epic Games continues to give people what they want. More OG Fortnite content is on the way thanks to OG Season 3, and there‚Äôs plenty of love for this early season, meaning the anticipation is already building.</p>



<p>OG Fortnite Season 3‚ÄîAKA Meteor Strike‚Äîis next up for the battle-royale title in 2025. Fortnite has a plethora of game modes at this point with regular battle royale, LEGO Fortnite, a Rocket League crossover, and so much more. But Fortnite OG is another shrewd move from Epic: Giving us all a chance to enjoy the earlier years.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG Season 3 was first released in February 2018, and yet we‚Äôre celebrating it again in 2025‚Äîpossibly with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-mortal-kombat-mythics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat Mythics</a> and maybe some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-receiving-yakuza-skins-soon-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yakuza skins</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-og-season-3-releases-in-march">Fortnite OG Season 3 Releases in March</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How did we get so Lucky? Credit to Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A message on the <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1903099532868505615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite X social media channel</a> has confirmed <strong>Fortnite OG Season 3 gets underway on March 25</strong>. One of its standout additions was a new POI‚ÄîLucky Landing (shown in the screenshot above).</p>



<p>Lucky Landing is characterized by its Asian-themed buildings and lush, eye-popping Cherry Blossom tree in the center. The majority of the season‚Äôs storyline focused on a meteor heading for the map. </p>



<div><article><p><span>Why crash out when you could crash in?

Back to where it all started‚Ä¶OG Season 3 launches March 25 üöÄ </span></p></article></div>



<p>The map slowly started altering as the season progressed, and we were beginning to see the creativity of the Fortnite map and how your experience would dynamically change as the weeks went on. I also fondly remember the Battle Pass having the ‚ÄúTake the L‚Äù emote which I unashamedly dropped on fallen enemies after I two-tapped them with Pump Shotguns.</p>



<p>It was a simple time. Long may the OG Fortnite map trend continue.</p>

<p>Dave the Diver‚Äôs Like a Dragon DLC, Ichiban‚Äôs Holiday, will release on April 10, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-dave-the-diver-s-ichiban-s-holiday-dlc">What‚Äôs New in Dave the Diver‚Äôs Ichiban‚Äôs Holiday DLC?</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/dave-the-diver-x-like-a-dragon-collaboration-dlc-ichibans-holiday-launches-april-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>, Dave the Diver‚Äôs Ichiban‚Äôs Holiday DLC will see the beloved character, Ichiban Kasuga, and his favourite bartender from Survive Bar arrive at Blue Hole for a vacation. However, things never go smoothly for Ichiban, and during his vacation time, he gets into a conflict with Sea Blue when he realises that they are capturing dolphins.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-classic-arcade-brawler-experience">Classic Arcade Brawler Experience</h3>



<p>To remedy the situation, Ichiban decides to infiltrate Sea Blue‚Äôs base. However, things will not be easy for him, and he needs a partner. Cobra joins on the journey, and as soon as you reach the base, the game turns into a classic arcade beat ‚Äôem up title, with players having to switch between both characters during the fights. Players should keep an eye out for a special reward at the end of this stage.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-karaoke-minigame-and-more">Karaoke Minigame and More</h3>



<p>Moreover, Ichiban‚Äôs Holiday DLC will add more content to Dave the Diver. In the spirit of Like a Dragon, players now have a new Karaoke minigame where they can sing along with their favourite characters. Also, some unique characters from the Like a Dragon series will be introduced as Bancho Sushi staff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that Ichiban‚Äôs Holiday will be the first paid DLC for Dave the Diver. Also, the DLC will be only available for a limited time of six months on all platforms once it arrives, as this is ‚Äúa special collaboration with a big game‚Äù, revealed game director Jaeho Hwang.</p>

<p>A new PlayStation patent describes a controller that can be charged with solar energy, which might solve all your battery-related problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-solar-power-controllers/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJIDShleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHVwVHGQueVMZZupV-8DT_-KIESWvFQMimNqN7_WL90EACfvjRBhqzmNO1g_aem_pn2iGOc8pztrFDDWfs47hQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment has published a new patent called ‚Äò<a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025046814&amp;_cid=P21-M80ZRL-19120-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Operation Device</a>‚Äô. The patent is for a PlayStation controller that features ‚Äúa plurality of photovoltaic elements‚Äù on its housing and a storage area that ‚Äúaccumulates power generated by the plurality of photovoltaic elements‚Äù, which in turn will charge the device with solar energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The diagrams provided on the website suggest that the photovoltaic elements will be placed on the top half of the body, around the analogue sticks and the different buttons. This controller can then be placed under sunlight to charge itself.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has also mentioned the problem they are trying to solve with the solar-powered PlayStation controller. Sony has stated that a conventional controller needs a replaceable or rechargeable battery to run, and without this power source, it cannot operate. With their new patent, they wish to solve this problem with technology that charges a controller‚Äôs secondary or primary battery through an external power source.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not the first patent PlayStation has published. Last year, we saw a controller concept <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-new-patent-reveals-a-controller-concept-with-conductive-ink/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that uses conductive ink</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-adaptive-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox‚Äôs one-handed ‚Äòadaptive joystick</a>‚Äô controller is now available.
