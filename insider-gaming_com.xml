<p>There have been back-and-forth rumors for weeks about Leon Kennedy appearing in Resident Evil Requiem, either as a playable character or as a part of the main story. The PlayStation Store seems to have finally given us an official Leon Kennedy answer for Requiem.</p>



<p>Leon Kennedy is one of the pillars of the Resident Evil franchise. He’s been a playable main character across multiple Resi titles—such as Resident Evil 2 and 4—and with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-new-look-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> taking us back to Raccoon City, the question has been asked since day one—is Leon Kennedy ready for one last zombie rodeo?</p>

<p>If you buy Resident Evil Requiem through the PlayStation Store, you’ll be able to check your purchase and see how long it is until the game goes live.</p>







<p>However, if you look closely at the Requiem game art image, while you can clearly see Grace Ashcroft, there’s a huge Leon Kennedy avatar in the background.</p>



<p>If he weren’t in the game, he wouldn’t be in this image. It’s that simple, folks. This also confirms what Dusk Golem has been saying for months. You can see the evidence below, and it’s reportedly been confirmed by multiple people who’ve pre-purchased Resident Evil Requiem’s Standard Edition.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Playstation for real this time accidentally just leaked Leon in Resident Evil Requiem. Checked with some people to absolutely confirm this was real first, and it is. If you have the standard non-Deluxe Edition of RE9 on PS5, you can see this cover if try to schedule pre-loading. <a href="https://t.co/yZv69ecd2u">pic.twitter.com/yZv69ecd2u</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1998347199311167788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>This all but confirms the return of the legendary character. It doesn’t necessarily mean Leon will be playable in Requiem, though, so rein in those expectations for now. It would be wise to assume Leon is playable in Requiem, and if so, it’ll be interesting to see how Capcom switches back and forth between Grace and Leon, or if you have the option to play the entire game as either protagonist.</p>



<p>What do you think of this reveal? Was Leon always going to be in the game? Let us know what you think of this tidbit, what it means for Resident Evil Requiem, and if you’re excited for the game.

            <title><![CDATA[Fans Think Ron Perlman is in Fallout Season 2 After Premiere Appearance]]></title>

<p>For the uninitiated, Ron Perlman has a lengthy history with the Fallout franchise. The instantly recognisable actor has contributed his gravelly vocal talents to the franchise since the first game debuted in 1997, providing the voiceover for every game’s intro sequence. The only game he never appeared in was 2004’s Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel.</p>



<p>Recently, Perlman appeared in a cast lineup at the Los Angeles premiere of Fallout’s second season, set to debut next week. This has prompted fans to assume he’s set to appear in the show in one way or another.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-ron-perlman-in-the-fallout-tv-show">Is Ron Perlman in the Fallout TV Show?</h2>



<p>Ron Perlman has voiced the introduction of almost every Fallout game. The only exception is an obscure PS2 release and 2015’s Fallout 4, in which he played the newscaster in the game’s opening chapter.</p>



<p>Last night, Perlman, who many will recognize from roles such as Hellboy and Clay Morrow from Sons of Anarchy, appeared in a star-studded image on the red carpet at the LA premiere of Fallout’s second season.</p>



<p>The show is set to land next week and will release on a once-weekly schedule, running until February 4, 2026. It’s the long-awaited second coming of the award-winning show that debuted in April 2024. I recently attended <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-revealed-what-makes-fallout-special/">a London screening</a>, and the first two episodes that I was lucky enough to see surpassed my expectations.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>As you can see in the images shared above, Perlman was almost <strong>hidden </strong>in the picture, which might suggest he nipped in at the last second.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely out of the question for Perlman to at least secure a <strong>cameo </strong>in Fallout. He has contributed to the games for almost three decades, and he’s one of the best actors in the image. Early theories suggest the actor, who was once known for his dominating frame, could be playing a Super Mutant character.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that not everyone who attends these screenings and premieres of Fallout’s second season is in the show. At the London screening, Aaron Paul was in the audience, and that’s just because he’s a fan.</p>
