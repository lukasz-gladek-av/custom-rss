            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sony-major-changes-structure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In major news that was revealed by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/sony-corp-shake-up-hiroki-totoki-ceo-hideaki-nishino-playstation-1236289299/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> on Tuesday night—Wednesday morning in Japan—, Sony Corp. has made unexpected changes to its organizational chart.  Hideaki Nishino, who was appointed co-CEO and handled the platform side in 2024, will now act as sole president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE). </p>



<p>Hermen Hulst, who was named Co-CEO of SIE last year no longer overseeing the entire company alongside Nishino. However, he remains in his position as CEO of the Studio Business Group, a subdivision created to run the PlayStation studios.</p>



<h2 id="h-sony-s-structural-changes-at-sie">Sony’s Structural Changes At SIE</h2>



<ul>
<li>Hideaki Totoki has been promoted to CEO of Sony Corp.</li>



<li>Hideaki Nishino has been promoted to president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment. He also will hold his positions as CEO of the Platform Business Group.</li>



<li>Hermen Hulst is no longer co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment as a whole. He will remain as CEO of the Studio Business Group and will lead PlayStation Productions.</li>
</ul>



<p>The change represents the second major leadership change over the last year at SIE. Previously, the position of CEO was held by a single person, Jim Ryan, who retired after 30 years of service. With his departure, Sony announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-hires-two-new-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the position would be filled by two people</a>, the aforementioned Hulst and Nishino.</p>



<p>Now, the company has gone back on its decision, in a way. Another notable change was in the position of CEO of Sony Corp. Hideaki Totoki, a 38-year veteran of the company, will take over the position previously held by Kenichiro Yoshida. All of the above decisions were approved by the board and take effect on April 1st.</p>



<p>Totoki said the following:</p>



<p><em>“I am incredibly honored and humbled to have been entrusted with the important role of President and CEO,</em>” Totoki said. “<em>My predecessors as CEO, Kazuo Hirai and Kenichiro Yoshida, have greatly enhanced Sony’s value, and I will do my utmost to further build on this success and pass on an even better Sony to the next generation. At our Corporate Strategy Meeting in May of last year, we newly announced our `Creative Entertainment Vision,’ which outlines where we want Sony to be in 10 years, with our Purpose as the guiding principle. Our greatest driver in achieving this is the diversity of our businesses and people, which is part of Sony’s DNA, and our boundary spanners that transcend organizational barriers and organically connect that diversity to create new value. Together with our employees, creators, partners, and our new leadership team, I will work to create a bright future filled with a boundless sense of Kando (emotion).</em>”</p>



<p>Hideaki Nishino also commented on his promotion:</p>



<p>“<em>I am truly honored to take the helm at Sony Interactive Entertainment. Technology and creativity are two of our biggest strengths as we continue to focus on developing experiences that deliver entertainment for everyone. We will continue to grow the PlayStation community in new ways, such as IP expansion, while also delivering the best in technology innovation,</em>” Nishino said. “<em>I want to thank Hermen for his expertise and leadership as he continues his role as CEO, Studio Business Group. I am deeply grateful for the PlayStation community and their continued support and I am very excited for what the future holds,</em>“</p>

<p>After announcing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-2-makes-surprise-premier-season-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the end of Counter-Strike 2 Premier Season 1 last week</a>, Valve has officially started Season 2. Season 2 will not last nearly as long as Season 1, but CS2 players will have to contend with the highly anticipated map pool changes and the tweaks to rifles.</p>



<p>Get your buddies and get into the Premier queue, the newest season of Counter-Strike 2 is now live.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cs2-premier-season-2-patch-notes">CS2 Premier Season 2 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>Now that CS2 Premier Season 2 has begun, the active duty map pool will introduce Train and sub out Vertigo. Train made its CS2 debut and its anticipated return to Counter-Strike back in November, with a number of layout changes, a fresh coat of paint, and even some satisfying rain effects. Vertigo had become increasingly unpopular amongst pro players, though because it’s so new there have been no selections of Train at top tier tournaments yet.</p>



<p>Two major changes to rifles are now live as well. The M4A4 has received a price reduction, dropping down to the $2900 price point that its counterpart the M4A1-S has. Both M4s have been popular amongst players, with some preferring the controlled spray of the silenced M4A1-S, while other prefer the damage and larger magazine of the M4A4. For now, cost will no longer weigh be a decider. The FAMAS now only costs $1,950, and it received an accuracy improvement.</p>



<p>Additionally, the AUG and the SG received an adjusted scope dot to “be more useable at range,” while the MP9, the MP5-SF, and the MP7 all received reduced crouching accuracy, making them less effective for long-range duels. The <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/news/updates#:~:text=UPDATES-,JANUARY%2028%2C%202025,-Counter%2DStrike%202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full patch notes</a> also include some minor changes to the UI and Train.</p>



<p>As for the Premier season itself, players that earned a CS Rating while playing in Season 1 will receive a commemorative with detailed season stats. To be eligible for a medal in Season 2, players will need to refresh their CS Rating by winning 10 Premier matches. Season 2 will end at the conclusion of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLAST.tv Austin CS2 Major</a>.</p>

<p>According to reliable insiders, Fortnite Festival’s next Season will have Sabrina Carpenter at the centre stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shpeshal Nick</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1884279980621979689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>), Fortnite Festival’s next Season will seemingly focus on the artist behind some of the most popular tunes of 2024, Sabrina Carpenter. If the ‘Espresso’ singer turns out to be the icon of the Fortnite Festival Season 8, then players can expect a bunch of new cosmetics and jam tracks inspired by the American artist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like previous Icons, the Fortnite Festival could receive a music pass with a Sabrina Carpenter skin, new emotes, and cosmetics. The popular singer might also be featured in the Fortnite Item shop as a bundle with exclusive items. However, it is hard to confirm anything without an official announcement. </p>



<p>Sabrina Carpenter has already collaborated with Fortnite in August 2024, where players received a couple of emotes and jam tracks featuring popular songs from the artist but no skins. So it isn’t very farfetched to expect Sabrina Carpenter to be the main attraction of Fortnite Festival’s next Season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the same duo responsible for this leak claimed Fortnite will receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-receive-red-hulk-falcon-and-superman-skins-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Hulk, Falcon and Superman Skins</a>. Also, here’s everything you need to know about Fortnite’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-godzilla-event-release-date-godzilla-skin-king-kong-crossover-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Godzilla event</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-valorant-champions-winners-%E2%80%93-full-list-of-valorant-world-champions.1094268/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-valorant-champions-winners/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Every year, the best VALORANT team at the world is crowned at VALORANT Champions, which serves as the world championship for Riot Games’ agent-filled tactical shooter. Over time, the event <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-was-the-most-watched-esports-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has drawn larger audiences as the game expands its global reach</a>, and that reach is exemplified in all the different regions that have claimed the trophy at VALORANT Champions.</p>



<p>VALORANT may have a shorter history than several other esports titles, but that just makes the hall of Champions winners that much more exclusive.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-valorant-champions-winners-in-order">All VALORANT Champions Winners, In Order</h2>



<p>There have been four VALORANT Champions winners so far, beginning with the inaugural tournament in 2021.</p>



<h3 id="h-acend-2021">Acend – 2021</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Jianhua Chen for Riot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Acend’s story has somewhat of a sad ending, as the organization didn’t acquire partnership in the VCT international leagues, and was <a href="https://x.com/AcendClub/status/1835685812031365594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to close its doors</a> in 2024 due to unsustainability. But the organization and its players still hold the distinction of being the first ever VALORANT Champions winners, defeating a Gambit team that had dominated the scene for virtually the entire year in a thrilling five-map series in the grand finals.</p>



<ul>
<li>Santeri “BONECOLD” Sassi</li>



<li>Mehmet “cNed” İpek</li>



<li>Vladyslav “Kiles” Shvets</li>



<li>Patryk “starxo” Kopczyński</li>



<li>Aleksander “zeek” Zygmunt</li>



<li>Laurynas “Nbs” Kisielius (coach)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-loud-2022">LOUD – 2022</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Brazilian organization LOUD entered VALORANT at the start of 2022, and finished the year with a world championship. LOUD pulled the best talent from Brazil together under one electric green banner, and found a rival wearing green themselves in OpTic Gaming. The two teams faced each other six times during the 2022 season, but LOUD got the last laugh in the upper bracket final and the grand final of Champions 2023.</p>



<ul>
<li>Bryan “pANcada” Luna</li>



<li>Gustavo “Sacy” Rossi</li>



<li>Matias “Saadhak” Delipetro</li>



<li>Erick “aspas” Santos</li>



<li>Felipe “Less” Basso</li>



<li>Matheus “bzkA” Tarasconi (coach)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-evil-geniuses-2023">Evil Geniuses – 2023</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Colin Young-Wolff for Riot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Evil Geniuses’ championship run in 2023 is considered one of the miraculous runs in the history of esports. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eg-coach-potter-says-yay-has-to-prove-hes-not-a-chamber-main/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coach Christine “potter” Chi</a> started with a roster of lowly regarded players and added a completely unknown player from an open tryout mid-season. The North American team stunned the international audience with a grand finals run at Masters Tokyo, then knocked off Champions contenders like DRX, LOUD, and finally Paper Rex to win the world championship in front of a Los Angeles home crowd.</p>



<ul>
<li>Kelden “Boostio” Pupello</li>



<li>Ethan “Ethan” Arnold</li>



<li>Alexander “jawgemo” Mor</li>



<li>Corbin “C0M” Lee</li>



<li>Max “Demon1” Mazanov</li>



<li>Christine “potter” Chi (coach)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-edward-gaming-2024">EDward Gaming – 2024</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Colin Young-Wolff for Riot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Riot Games’ expansion of the international VALORANT esports ecosystem into China couldn’t have gone any better for the region. EDward Gaming, after dominating the Chinese scene again but falling short on the international stage, finally had their moment at Champions 2024. In Seoul, EDG went undefeated in playoffs, defeating Team Heretics in an amazing grand final, cementing Zheng “ZmjjKK” Yongkang as the top star of Chinese VALORANT.</p>



<ul>
<li>Wan “CHICHOO” Shunzhi</li>



<li>Wang “nobody” Senxu</li>



<li>Zheng “ZmjjKK” Yongkang</li>



<li>Zhang “Smoggy” Zhao</li>



<li>Hsieh “S1Mon” Meng-hsun</li>



<li>Tang “Muggle” Shijun (coach)</li>
</ul>



<p>Across these four years of VALORANT, no team has accomplished the feat of winning both a Masters event and Champions. Only one player has accomplished this: Sacy, who won Champions 2022 with LOUD and Masters Madrid 2024 with Sentinels.</p>



<p>Who do you think will lift the Champions trophy in 2025? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Bungie announced today that Destiny 2 will receive Star Wars skins and cosmetics on February 4, 2025, along with the game’s third and final Episode, Heresy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have only <a href="https://x.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1884318035000938780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">teased</a> the upcoming Destiny 2 Star Wars skins and cosmetics, and we have yet to learn what exactly will be released. Players should expect new armour ornaments, accessories, emotes, and finishers inspired by Star Wars. Additionally, at the launch of Heresy, three new armour ornaments (one per Guardian class) will become available. And the inspiration for these ornaments will be “the soldiers of the Galactic Empire”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-destiny-2-s-heresy-act-1">Destiny 2’s Heresy Act 1</h2>



<p>Apart from the Destiny 2 x Star Wars collaboration, the developers have released <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/28/inside-destiny-2-heresy-launching-february-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">details</a> about their third episode and final epilogue, Heresy. Guardians should expect the return of a familiar foe: the Dreadnaught. However, this time, the players will take the fight to the Dreadnaught through a new exploration and combat-based activity: The Nether.&nbsp;The Heresy Episode will consist of three Acts. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers will experiment with player modifiers in the upcoming Destiny 2 update. Once the Heresy update arrives, players will observe new modifiers “with increased health pools, no regenerating of health, low ammo drops and revive tokens, and a modification on healing in the sandbox over the course of play.” Bungie wants players to strategically build their loadouts for survivability as health pools increase and regen is stopped in the upcoming update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, according to claims, Bungie’s upcoming MOBA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-upcoming-gummy-bears-moba-is-inspired-by-smash-bros-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is inspired by Smash Bros</a>. The development studio allegedly hired fans because they would “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-hired-fans-as-they-would-work-for-less-former-exec-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work for less.</a>” What are your thoughts on Destiny 2’s Star Wars collaboration?

<p>In the aftermath of the bombs dropping in and around Appalachia, much of the wasteland is barren and rife with danger. But some settlements and tows prove relatively sane and peaceful. Helvetia is neither. It’s a strange haven. But it’s where you’ll find the annual <strong>Fasnacht Event</strong>! Here is where to find Helvetia in Fallout 76!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-helvetia-in-fallout-76"><strong>How to Find Helvetia in Fallout 76</strong></h2>



<p>You can find Helvetia in Fallout 76 by venturing into <strong>The Forest region</strong>, an early-game portion of the world map, and then head south of <strong>Morgantown</strong>, along the river, and just east of <strong>Sutton</strong>. It’s a small town with a main road, a three-way intersection, and a handful of buildings, including a church and several residential abodes.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Overall, the area is relatively quiet for the post-apocalypse. It’s home to a handful of Scorched on any given day, except during Fasnacht when all hell breaks loose, and people flock to the town in droves to celebrate in strange masks and with music aplenty!</p>



<h2 id="h-quests-in-helvetia"><strong>Quests in Helvetia</strong></h2>



<p>You won’t find typical quests in Helvetia, though you will partake in various events, such as <strong>Fasnacht Day</strong>. It’s an annual event that brings players together to help the Protectrons of Helvetia celebrate the iconic albeit strange holiday commonly found in West Virginia. It’s characterized by strange masks, cheerful music, and plenty of brews to wash down the radiation.</p>







<h2 id="h-creatures-in-helvetia"><strong>Creatures in Helvetia</strong></h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>On an average day, Helvetia is quiet. It’s home to a handful of <strong>Scorched</strong>, none of which pose much of a threat to a terrifying Vault Dweller such as yourself, right? But during Fasnacht, the town starts to experience the hustle and bustle of the wasteland. During the annual event, you’ll stumble upon:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bee Swarms</strong></li>



<li><strong>Honey Beast</strong></li>



<li><strong>Megasloth</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rabbit</strong></li>



<li><strong>Radtoad</strong></li>



<li><strong>Squirrel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Super Mutant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Super Mutant Suicider</strong></li>



<li><strong>Wolf</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Plus, there’s always the occasional Protectron to assist!</p>
