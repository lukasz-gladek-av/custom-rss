<p>We’ve witnessed a whole lot of turmoil surrounding the development of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, with delays and controversy marring the title before its release. Well, as it turns out, there may be a reason why the upcoming AC game is so controversial. It appears Assassin’s Creed Shadows is going to be the first game for a number of game developers at Ubisoft. While it’s common practice to bring in new talent regularly and keep the old-timers on their toes, it would seem much of the team behind Shadows is completely green behind the ears.</p>



<p>In an appearance at the External Development Summit 2024 (XDS24), Assassin’s Creed Executive Producer Marc-Alexis Côté said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the things that I’ve noticed since the pandemic is that we have a lot of juniors in our teams. Probably half the team that’s building Assassin’s Creed is building a game for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the video below is set to begin approximately where Marc-Alexis Côté spoke about the game’s development, you can watch the full keynote from XDS24 here:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, the sour news doesn’t stop there. According to Marc-Alexis Côté, the game’s internal evaluation isn’t promising, either. The team behind Shadows considers this entry to be the weakest in the entire Assassin’s Creed franchise, which speaks volumes about Ubisoft’s development overall. </p>



<p>When Assassin’s Creed Shadows finally launches in 2025, it might do so to lackluster reviews and poor critical reception. For now, only time will tell!</p>



<p>What do you think of Assassin’s Creed Shadows? Is it destined to be a flop before it ever releases?

<p>A terminally ill fan of the Borderlands series was given the opportunity to play Borderlands 4 after his plea reached developer Gearbox.</p>



<p>Caleb McAlpine, a Borderlands fan with Stage 4 terminal cancer, was flown out with a friend to Gearbox Software in order to experience the upcoming game. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/1h01zdn/just_an_update_thank_you_everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Reddit</a>, McAlpine spoke about his experience at the studio. </p>



<p>After meeting the developers and CEO Randy Pitchford to playing an early build of Borderlands 4, he wanted to express his thanks to everyone who helped make this dream a reality. </p>



<p>“We got to play what they have for Borderlands 4 so far and it was amazing,” McAlpine said. “I don’t know if I will be around when the game Comes out but I just want to say thank you to all of you for all of your love and support and for helping in making this happen. It truly was an amazing experience and it was just awesome.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-announced-at-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch sometime</a> in 2025 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. More details about the game will be announced at a later date.</p>



<p>McApline’s latest prognosis as of October was that he had less than two years if chemotherapy slowed the progression of the cancer. </p>



<p>We wish Caleb all the best in his current fight. </p>

<p>Are you struggling with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s new game mode, Ransack? Insider Gaming has a few tips and tricks to help you survive and excel in the new mode, score gold, help your team score big, and rank up in the process!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-ransack">What is Ransack?</h2>



<p>Ransack is the newest game mode added to Black Ops 6 in November 2024. It is a 6v6 mode where you loot gold bars from stashes around the map. One stash will open at a time; you gather the gold from it and bring it back to your team’s safe. You can also take gold off of enemies you down and steal from the enemy safe! Whichever team reaches the gold cap first or whoever has the most gold at the end of the round when the timer goes off wins.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-succeed-at-ransack">How to Succeed at Ransack</h2>



<p>Working with your teammates is critical in this mode. Each team must guard their safe, loot and steal gold from the other team, and watch their backs. Loadouts, scorestreaks, and equipment must be chosen carefully to maximize success. You should play your most comfortable loadout to play your best for your team; solo play is a detriment to your entire team.</p>



<p>Many players recommend varying your “tasks” in this game mode. You don’t want to always be on the attack or always on the defense. Changing your strategy to switch between looting, killing, and defending is essential.</p>







<h2 id="h-suggested-loadouts-scorestreaks-and-equipment-for-ransack">Suggested Loadouts, Scorestreaks, and Equipment for Ransack</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>As for loadouts, it’s once again worth mentioning that you should play how you’re most comfortable. If you’re great with an LMG or a shotgun, go for it. Just make sure your team is balanced between long-, mid-, and short-range weapons.</p>



<p>Scorestreaks are important in all modes of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, but for Ransack, they’re particularly essential. Some recommended scorestreaks are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Scout Pulse</strong> so that you can see enemies around you.</li>



<li><strong>UAV</strong> so that you can see enemies all around the map.</li>



<li><strong>Counter UAV</strong> so that enemies can’t see you on the map.</li>
</ul>



<p>For equipment, go big or go home!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Lethal Equipment</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sticky Grenade</li>



<li>Frag Grenade</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Tactical Equipment</strong>
<ul>
<li>Concussion Grenade</li>



<li>Flashbang Grenade</li>



<li>Smoke Grenade</li>



<li>Shock Charges</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrades</strong>
<ul>
<li>Assault Pack</li>



<li>War Cry</li>



<li>Spring Mine</li>



<li>Trophy System</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>However you decide to play Ransack, know that it’s an entertaining mode. It’s one of my favorites to play while unwinding after a long day. Let us know in the comments how much you like (or dislike) this mode!</p>

<p>Here at Insider Gaming, we spent a lot of time surviving the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/frostpunk-2-guides-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">world of Frostpunk 2</a> on release, with countless guides under our belt to help newcomers and returning players survive the frozen wasteland. Well, it appears we’re not entirely done with the post-apocalypse. Today, developer 11 bit studios announced its Frostpunk 2 roadmap for 2025, featuring its plans for additional content and improvements in the coming year. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Since its launch in September, Frostpunk 2 has been ‘Mostly Positive’ on Steam, with nearly 1,000 players in-game at the time of this writing, which is, surprisingly enough, in the middle of the work day. At launch, the survival city-building game hit a peak player count of over 35,000 at one point!</p>

<p>Here’s what we have to look forward to from Frostpunk 2 in 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Major Content Updates</strong>: At least one major content update is currently planned for 2025, with quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and new game content and mechanics added based on player feedback.</li>



<li><strong>Console Launch</strong>: Frostpunk 2 will officially launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2025, though the studio has not released an official date.</li>



<li><strong>DLC</strong>: Three major DLC packs will launch throughout the year to Frostpunk 2 in 2025—Spectrum, Aurora, and a currently unnamed DLC pack. These DLC packs will include additional story elements, new mechanics, and so much more to expand the unforgiving world of Frostpunk 2!</li>
</ul>
