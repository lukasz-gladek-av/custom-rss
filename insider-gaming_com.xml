<p>Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, has gone on record stating that Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty launch <strong>ever</strong>. This news came amid Microsoft’s first-quarter earnings call, held just days after Black Ops 6 hit the market.</p>



<p>This was the first Call of Duty game to be released on Game Pass on day one, which was a huge win for Xbox. It was mentioned by Nadella that the launch of Black Ops 6 set a record for the number of new Game Pass subscriber adds.</p>

<p>Speaking during the Microsoft call, Satya Nadella said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Last week’s launch of Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty release ever, setting a record for day one players as well as Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day. </p>



<p>And unit sales on&nbsp;PlayStation&nbsp;and Steam were also up over 60% year-over-year. This speaks to our strategy of meeting gamers where they are by enabling them to play more games across the screens they spend their time on.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since dropping worldwide, Black Ops 6 has gone from strength to strength. We reviewed it at launch and awarded it a lofty score, recommending that Call of Duty fans everywhere invest in this wondrous game. From the campaign to the Zombies, and from the multiplayer to everything that’s coming next, it’s well worth the time and effort you’ll pour into it.</p>



<p>On November 14, the game’s first season will go live, introducing the first content drop, amongst other things. Also, on November 1, Nuketown returns to Call of Duty, with Treyarch having assembled a remaster of the original map that appeared in 2010’s Black Ops.</p>
