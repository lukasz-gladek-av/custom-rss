<p>Ubisoft has revealed the group draw for the Six Invitational 2026, setting the stage for one of the largest esports events in the entire business. What has been uncovered reflects a stunning selection that should make for some exciting match-ups straight out of the gate.</p>



<p>As usual, the tournament begins with four groups of five teams competing for spots in the playoffs. The two-bracket split will be populated by these teams, but not <strong>every organization </strong>in the group stage will advance to the final round. Four teams will be eliminated before they can make it anywhere close to the final stage.</p>







<h2 id="h-six-invitational-2026-groups-confirmed">Six Invitational 2026 Groups Confirmed</h2>



<p>The group draw for the Six Invitational 2026 was completed recently by Ubisoft:</p>



<p><strong>Group A:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Weibo Gaming</li>



<li>M80</li>



<li>FEARX</li>



<li>Ninjas in Pyjamas</li>



<li>Project Zero</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group B:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Elevate</li>



<li>Wildcard</li>



<li>Daystar</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group C:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Shopify Rebellion</li>



<li>DPlus</li>



<li>Black Dragons</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group D:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Spacestation</li>



<li>Team Secret</li>



<li>Fluxo W7M</li>



<li>ENTERPRISE Esports</li>



<li>Oxygen Esports</li>
</ul>



<p>It could be argued that Group C is the most energetic and unpredictable of the bunch. FaZe Clan, G2, and Shopify Rebellion are all the most legitimate contenders for the trophy, and we’re sure to see sparks fly in Paris before the playoffs even kick off.</p>



<p>Group D is also bursting with potential. Every team there has a credible playoff claim, with Team Secret especially coming in as the Esports World Cup 2025 champions.</p>



<p>As always, the Six Invitational will remain relatively hard to pin down. It has one of the largest single prizes in the esports space, so you’d best believe every team taking to the stage will fight tooth and nail to secure the biggest chunk of it.</p>







<p>Which team do you have taking the win in Paris next month? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tarkov Dev’s New Game Could Be Revealed on February 1st]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-dev-new-game-revealed-february-1/</link>
            <guid>1410358</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Over the last couple of weeks, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, Nikita Buyanov, busied himself posting cryptic images and brain teasers on social media. Eventually, an entirely new website surfaced, seemingly hosting some minigame teasing <strong>a new project called COR3.</strong></p>



<p>Now, <strong>another </strong>website has surfaced, this one hosting nothing more than a countdown and a blurry video that, when examined, represents a first-person shooter that scales back to show an entire planet. That countdown expires on February 1st, which is when everyone believes we’ll get something tangible about this game.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-cor3-and-why-is-it-exciting">What is COR3, and Why is it Exciting?</h2>



<p>Nikita Buyanov is one of the creative minds who has directed the growth of Escape from Tarkov over the last decade. He has dedicated his life to the extraction shooter, a fact that he pointed out when we interviewed him as part of a recent episode of Access Granted.</p>



<p>He recently took a cryptic turn on social media, posting stacks of enigmatic images and puzzles, which his followers set to decoding.</p>



<p>Before long, <a href="https://os.cor3.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a website had been found</a>, an interactive thing that placed users in some kind of post-apocalyptic bunker with a retro-futuristic computer system bursting with lore, teasers, and world-building elements. As it stands, we have <strong>little idea </strong>what COR3 is, but the best guess is that it’s Buyanov’s new project.</p>



<p>We say ‘Buyanov’ and not <strong>Battlestate Games</strong>, as right now, there’s <strong>no indication </strong>that Battlestate is linked to COR3. The COR3 trademark, dug up by eagle-eyed netizens, is in Nikita’s name, and nobody <strong>but </strong>the man himself has been sharing content related to COR3 online.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>On <a href="https://m7.repnodemassive.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the countdown website</a>, a clock is running out, and it’s set to expire on February 1st at 3 PM GMT / 10 AM EST. Nobody knows what will happen when that countdown hits zero, but it’s a safe bet that something more tangible will be revealed by Buyanov, and whoever else he’s working with (if anyone).</p>



<p>COR3 appears to represent some kind of alternate reality title set in a universe where Earth suffered from a catastrophic event. There’s talk of interplanetary travel, space pirates, and ships adrift in the great beyond, all of which couldn’t be further from Escape from Tarkov, the leading extraction shooter.</p>



<p>It’s set hundreds of years in the future, but the COR3 website that users could interact with boasted grounded elements like modern-day armor items and traditional computers.</p>

<p>Destiny 2’s next major update has reportedly been delayed due to the forthcoming release of Marathon, Bungie’s new extraction shooter, in early March.</p>



<p>Destiny 2: Shadow &amp; Order was originally slated for a March 3 release. However, after Bungie officially announced Marathon’s release date on Monday, Forbes’ <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/2013302457787437355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Paul Tussi reported</a> that the next free Destiny update has been postponed. There’s no tentative release window for the content at the moment.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have heard Shadow and Order will in fact be delayed to make room for Marathon on March 5, given that it was supposed to come out on March 3. Not sure how long, or when it will be announced, however. <a href="https://t.co/ImVb50bOUZ">pic.twitter.com/ImVb50bOUZ</a></p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/2013302457787437355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Shadow &amp; Order is slated to be the final major update of the Year of Prophecy season of the game, which started back with the Rite of the Nine in-game event that occurred in May 2025.</p>











<p>While it’s full steam ahead on the marketing push for Marathon, pre-ordering Bungie’s new game scores Destiny players new cosmetics, Sparrows, and Ships. There are also new shaders, emotes, and more in celebration of the upcoming release.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Infil into the dark sci-fi world of Tau Ceti IV on March 5, 2026.</p><p>Celebrate <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonTheGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MarathonTheGame</a> in Destiny 2 with the new Waiting for Exfil emote, Silkworm Weave Shader, and Modern MIDA Multi-Tool Exotic Weapon Ornament from Eververse, available to all players.</p><p>🪱… <a href="https://t.co/kY0PbQBQm0">pic.twitter.com/kY0PbQBQm0</a></p></div>— Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/2013287839325106318?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>In addition, the marathon marketing push includes a new limited edition PlayStation DualSense and Pulse Elite wireless headset.
