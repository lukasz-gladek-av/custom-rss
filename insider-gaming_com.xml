            <title><![CDATA[‘Several’ Tier 1 Counter-Strike 2 Events Won’t Happen in 2026, It’s Confirmed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/several-tier-1-counter-strike-events-not-happening/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98several%E2%80%99-tier-1-counter-strike-2-events-won%E2%80%99t-happen-in-2026-it%E2%80%99s-confirmed.1352164/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent post on social media, the CEO of PGL, Silviu Stroie, confirmed that ‘several’ high-tier Counter-Strike 2 tournaments won’t take place in 2026. This is because an announcement pathway wasn’t followed, which unfortunately violates Valve’s tournament operation requirements.</p>



<p>The post on social media confirmed that <strong>none of the Starladder events </strong>in 2026 will take place, and two of the three Fissure events in 2026 have also been struck from the schedule.</p>







<h2 id="h-cs2-events-slashed-from-the-schedule">CS2 Events Slashed From the Schedule</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/ssilviu/status/1988490449951015313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The post</a> from Silviu Stroie, CEO of PGL, reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Several CS2 Tier 1 events in 2026 won’t take place, as they missed the deadline for announcing the additional details. None of the Starladder CS2 Tier 1 events in 2026 will take place. The same applies to two of the three Fissure CS2 Tier 1 events in 2026 (Playground 4 and Playground 5). So far, there has been no Starladder announcement for any Tier 1 event in 2027.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In one of the most important comments under the post, a user wrote, ‘How can this happen? Like, if you know that this is a requirement, there’s like a 0% chance of missing the deadline if it’s your main business.’</p>



<p>Valve’s tournament operation requirements demand that organizers provide ‘additional information’ within a certain timeframe after an initial announcement. That deadline was missed by some, and therefore, these tournaments will not be allowed to go ahead.</p>







<p>Neither of the organizers impacted by this confirmation have provided a statement to say what’s happening, but Stroie also mentioned that no Starladder events have been announced (at Tier 1) going into 2027, which is cryptic to say the least. This was later refuted by Starladder, as the company revealed that ‘the next Tier-1 Starladder event comes in October 2027’.</p>



<p>Are you bothered about the loss of these events, or do you feel that there are already enough Counter-Strike tournaments lined up? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This weekend, Escape from Tarkov hits a 1.0 state after a <strong>decade </strong>in testing and development. It’s a monumental time to be a fan of the spearhead extraction shooter, and the release comes as the genre is experiencing something of a boom, spurred onwards by the recent arrival of ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games confirmed that Escape from Tarkov will have a new Twitch Drops campaign that’s kicking off to celebrate the launch of the game on November 15, this coming Saturday.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-twitch-drops-coming">Tarkov Twitch Drops Coming</h2>



<p>From November 15 to December 6, Tarkov fans will be able to watch their favorite streamers exploring the new 1.0 update that brings the game into an entirely new world. The drops will reward players with different reward crates, containing some loot that could be considered highly exclusive:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hideout Targets</li>



<li>Tarko Figuring</li>



<li>Nikita’s PMC Voice</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s a split between the rewards coming to the Escape from Tarkov Twitch Drops campaign, and that’s between <strong>free </strong>and <strong>paid-for </strong>rewards. If you dish out subscriptions during the event, you’ll unlock even more content in Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li>5 Subs – Cap, M-2 Brown &amp; Secure Container</li>



<li>3 Subs – PMC Dogtag (Twitch)</li>



<li>1 Sub – Hideout Decor</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p><a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It was stressed</a> that the split is timed differently, too. The free drops run until November 28, while the paid rewards will stay live until December 6.</p>







<p>More content will be added, per a graphic published by Battlestate Games, so expect plenty of rewards to flow going into Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release – provided you watch those streaming the game. The 1.0 update is highly anticipated and will bring a new map, story, and many other quality-of-life improvements and upgrades.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-north-line-update-release-time%E2%80%94stella-montis-unlock.1352155/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has a new supersized update inbound called North Line, and it introduces a new map, new ARC enemies, weapons, quests, and more. It will be made accessible via a community event that requires all users to contribute to a project to bust open a tunnel leading to the new map, Stella Montis.</p>



<p>Many are wondering when the North Line update will be released. It’s coming out today, but the release time for the update isn’t clear. Read on to learn what we know about the ARC Raiders North Line update release times.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-north-line-releasing-on-arc-raiders">When is North Line Releasing on ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>The North Line update for ARC Raiders will be released today, November 13, at 09:30 AM GMT / 04:30 AM ET / 01:30 AM PT.</strong> This timing convention is to allow for a unified launch of the update across all platforms and territories.</p>



<p>Fans of the post-apocalyptic extraction shooter will be able to enjoy some of the trappings of the North Line update when it drops, but the bulk of it will come after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-arc-raiders-map-open-breaking-new-ground/">the Breaking New Ground event</a> has been completed.</p>



<p>This is where players must contribute Metal Parts, Fabric, Chemicals, Plastic Parts, and Rubber Parts to the centralized project to open up the tunnels to Stella Montis. Here, players will be able to explore a new path in ‘Staking Our Claim’, digging deep into Stella Montis, facing new ARC threats, and preparing for the <strong>next </strong>major ARC Raiders update – Cold Snap.</p>







<p>There’s a busy roadmap ahead, and Embark Studios has promised to support ARC Raiders for the next decade, so expect plenty more maps, modes, weapons, and more to be added in the coming months to make way for that lifecycle.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-pve-platform-change-coming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-pve-platform-might-have-a-drastic-change-coming.1352152/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov is finally being ‘released’ this week after a decade in alpha and beta stages. It brings an end to years of development that have culminated in Escape from Tarkov being the most popular extraction shooter ever made. It’s a paradigm shift of a title that’s evolving into a 1.0 state this coming Saturday.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, Nikita Buyanov, suggested that a drastic balancing mechanic might be put into play for Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform.</p>







<h2 id="h-they-might-wipe-the-pve-flea-market">They Might Wipe the PvE Flea Market</h2>



<p>Nikita suggested in a recent interview with Pestily that the team at Battlestate Games might wipe the Flea Market <strong>specifically on the PvE platform </strong>when 1.0 drops. Pestily addressed the Flea Market being ‘filled with stuff’ that PvE players have collected over many months, impacting the mode’s economy.</p>



<p>Nikita said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We will see. Maybe we will wipe the Flea Market, for example.</p>



<p>Nobody said that we can’t do that. We can wipe the Flea Market, and nobody will say anything to us, because the Flea Market is just a sub-system that we can wipe.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I laughed out loud at this clip <a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nikgeneburn</a>.  Glad you are keeping your humor!</p><p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/Pestily?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Pestily</a>'s interview today, Nikita says they might wipe the flea for PvE to keep people from snowballing with 1.0…</p><p>BUT…. if this is all you guys have planned It's not enough, you are going to… <a href="https://t.co/VZCegXIYsE">pic.twitter.com/VZCegXIYsE</a></p></div>— Airwingmarine (@Airwingmarine1) <a href="https://twitter.com/Airwingmarine1/status/1988718220728234146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p><br>Escape from Tarkov players focused on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-players-need-to-wipe-for-full-release-quest/">PvE will need to wipe their accounts</a> to access the new story being introduced with 1.0. This story will finally allow players to <strong>escape from Tarkov</strong>, presenting them with a branching campaign with multiple endings.</p>



<p>This is bad news for the PvE players (like myself) who have spent the last year racking up a phenomenal stash and building the strongest character they’ve ever made, simply because PvE <strong>doesn’t automatically wipe</strong>.</p>







<p>The economy that has been created because of that is a little skewed, so pushing for a reset of this kind might be a neat balancing tactic.</p>



<p>Do you think that Battlestate Games should better balance the PvE platform? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-13-886/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-886-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-thursday-november-13.1352149/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The week is almost over, but before the final days arrive, you’ve got a few more NYT Connections puzzles to solve. Today’s puzzle is pretty interesting, as at first blush, very few things seem to relate to one another, but that’s why I’m here to provide the best NYT Connections hints around.</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections solutions that I know you’re here for.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-13">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 13)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #886:</p>



<ul>
<li>FIRE EXTINGUISHER</li>



<li>AIR PURIFIER</li>



<li>MICROSOFT</li>



<li>INSTAGRAM</li>



<li>CIGARETTE</li>



<li>BOX</li>



<li>OVAL</li>



<li>THREADS</li>



<li>FIT</li>



<li>POST</li>



<li>COFFEE MAKER</li>



<li>BEER</li>



<li>SHAVING CREAM</li>



<li>GETUP</li>



<li>SEA</li>



<li>DUDS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Stylish slang for what you’re wearing.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Bubbly, frothy, and sometimes messy.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Filtered for freshness, flavor, or flair.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Fill in the blank to find the workplace.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 13</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-13-886">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 13 (#886)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– DUDS, FIT, GETUP, THREADS</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BEER, FIRE EXTINGUISHER, SEA, SHAVING CREAM</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – AIR PURIFIER, CIGARETTE, COFFEE MAKER, INSTAGRAM</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BOX, MICROSOFT, OVAL, POST</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Death Stranding Anime is in the Works at Disney+]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-isolations-anime-disney-kojima/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-death-stranding-anime-is-in-the-works-at-disney.1352107/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Death Stranding is becoming an anime series thanks to the folks at Disney+. Furthermore, creator Hideo Kojima will executive produce while animator Takayuki Sano (Jujutsu Kaisen 0, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood) will direct the show.</p>







<p>The Death Stranding series is the first new IP from Kojima Productions, led by Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima. With two entries, with On the Beach releasing in 2025, the post-apocalyptic strand game has become a hit for PlayStation fans. It helps that it bolsters an all-star cast, led by The Walking Dead’s Norman Reedus, and some great visual and narrative storytelling. A few months ago, Kojima announced more projects based on Death Stranding, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-anime-confirmed-by-hideo-kojima/">an anime movie</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-film-a24-original-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">film adaptation from A24</a>. Now, it seems there’s another project in the works and at Disney+, of all places.</p>



<h2 id="h-death-stranding-isolations-to-stream-on-disney-in-2027">Death Stranding Isolations to Stream on Disney+ in 2027</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The official poster for Death Stranding Isolations, streaming on Disney+</figcaption></figure>



<p>The news comes from Disney at the Disney APAC Showcase, currently going on in Hong Kong. There, the company revealed that it’s releasing Death Stranding Isolations (title not final), a 2D hand-drawn anime, in 2027. The animation will be handled by E&amp;H production, led by Jujutsu Kaisen director Sunghoo Park. Directing the show is Takayuki Sano, whose resume includes anime like Attack on Titan, Banana Fish, and Promare. A short synopsis was also provided by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/disney-unveils-death-stranding-isolations-from-game-creator-hideo-kojima-1236616004/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>. It can be found in full below.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Set in the same world as the video game,&nbsp;Death Stranding Isolations<em>&nbsp;</em>follows Sam Bridges as he attempts to save America, and those trying to deal with their isolation in their own way. </p>



<p>An old man is trying to realize salvation through ways outside of the connection advocated by Bridges. A female warrior is trying to kickstart a world of constant fighting. A boy holds a grudge against Bridges, and a girl has embraced her loneliness. On the precipice of the end of humanity and the world, their fates and hopes converge, as another story of Death Stranding begins.</p>
</blockquote>



<p> In attendance at the Disney APAC Showcase was creator <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wishes-to-scan-real-ghosts-for-od/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a>, who will executive produce the show. Speaking on behalf of the team at the event, Kojima stated,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I grew up loving Japanese anime, and it has shaped my worldview,” said Kojima. “I’ve always been a fan of Disney, since I was small, and I was glad that they showed my documentary on the platform. When they approached me, I decided to work with them.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Interestingly enough, this isn’t the only anime of Death Stranding we’re getting. Death Stranding: Mosquito, an animated film by ABC Animations, is currently in the works, as well. However, it seems like Sam Porter Bridges is going to be in Isolations and not Mosquito, as far as we know. We’ll likely learn more about both as 2026 comes around, but at least we have a look at the title through the artwork, shown above.</p>







<p>What do you think about Death Stranding Isolations? Did the series need an anime? When do you think it’ll come out in 2027?

<p>An MMORPG based on PlayStation and Guerrilla Games’ Horizon series has been leaked before its official reveal. We now know several details surrounding the game, now called Horizon Steel Frontiers.</p>







<p>While a newer IP, the Horizon series, consisting of 2017’s Zero Dawn and 2022’s Forbidden West, has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-franchise-32m-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-received by critics</a>. The third-person post-apocalyptic shooter is known for its gorgeous graphics and intuitive open-world gameplay. With hulking mechanical monsters and a lush environment, Horizon’s iconic settings make for the perfect setup for games outside of the main series. We did see LEGO Horizon Adventures and a VR spinoff, but it’s stayed in its lane for a bit. However, rumors of an MMORPG had surfaced over the past years, but it was thought to be cancelled. However, according to new information, it seems it’s here and, most likely, will be revealed quite soon.</p>



<p>UPDATE: Horizon Steel Frontiers is, indeed real, as PlayStation and NCSoft announced the project soon after publication. The video mentioned in the article <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiogVFtmchg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can be found here</a>. Most of the details regarding gameplay and such can be found below.</p>

<p>The leak in question comes from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819657/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-sony-ncsoft-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, which supposedly saw a 10-minute video of the Horizon MMORPG, called Horizon Steel Frontiers. It even included key art, which we have above. Supposedly, the game is set to be revealed at the G-STAR 2025 event, but information came out early. </p>



<p>In the article, it mentions that the game is a collaboration between PlayStation and Korean developer NCSoft. The video, planned to be shown there, showcases gameplay, both complete and in development. As it is an MMORPG, instead of playing as Aloy, you’ll create your own character and join others in the world, called the Deathlands. It also says that the title will release on PC, iOS, and Android. No mention of a release date or if it will go to PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>As the game is not yet confirmed, take the news with a grain of salt for now. However, given the content leaked, it’s safe to say it’s only a matter of time before it’s announced. Either way, it will be interesting to see how Horizon fits into the MMORPG genre and the differences between it and the main series.</p>
