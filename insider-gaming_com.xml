<p>S-GAME is looking to deliver its A-game with Phantom Blade Zero. The hack ‘n’ slasher looks slick and quick, and will be the action game to watch out for in 2026. PS5 gamers are eyeing it up, but it might not stay this way forever.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-release-date-trailer-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phantom Blade Zero release date</a> was finally revealed at The Game Awards 2025. It’s going to add to an incredibly stacked year of gaming, and the pre-release hype is already big. Early marketing has made it clear it will launch on PS5—and PC—and not Xbox. Yet.</p>







<h2 id="h-phantom-blade-zero-could-release-on-xbox">Phantom Blade Zero Could Release On Xbox</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There’s always an asterisk. Credit to S-GAME</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s amazing how often little details are picked up on by players days after a new trailer or announcement. The Game Awards 2025 is well behind us, but only now is it apparent that Phantom Blade Zero’s Release Date trailer had new information in plain sight.</p>







<p>At the very end of the four-minute trailer, a big blue screen pops up with an interesting message: “PlayStation 5 Console Exclusive.”</p>



<p>This was already known. However, as you should with all contracts, if you read the fine print, there’s more than meets the eye:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Also available on PC. Not available on other consoles until at least 12 months after the release date.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Simply, this means Phantom Blade Zero is a timed exclusive. Like Silent Hill 2 or Square Enix’s Final Fantasy Remake games, it will launch on PS5 first (on consoles), and then we could easily see an Xbox port later down the line.</p>



<p>More than likely, this is what will happen. The console wars are over, and it seems to be about maximizing profits for Sony and Microsoft. It will get to the point where pretty much every game is on every other console—apart from Nintendo, don’t expect Mario on PS5 anytime soon!</p>



<p>Here’s the full Phantom Blade Zero trailer from TGA 2025.</p>

<p>Will Phantom Blade Zero be a day-one buy on PS5 or PC? Or does this revelation give you enough hope to hang on for a possible Xbox port later down the road?

            <title><![CDATA[Leaks Reveal Winter Wildcards As Next EA FC 26 Promo]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/leaks-reveal-winter-wildcards-as-next-ea-fc-26-promo/</link>
            <guid>1383274</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Winter Wildcards has been expected to make its return to EA FC 26 for weeks, but new leaks now suggest the festive promo is officially next in line. Set to begin on Friday, December 19 at the usual 6 PM UK time, this year’s edition is shaping up to be the biggest Winter Wildcards event the series has ever seen.</p>



<p>And for once, it’s not just the player list doing the rounds. The leaks for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-26-announces-12-new-icons-including-francesco-totti-andres-iniesta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC 26</a> have been unusually broad, hinting at everything from significant new card upgrades to multiple versions of the same players with differing positions and stat tweaks. With so much information surfacing early, anticipation for this year’s Winter Wildcards is building fast—if the leaks hold true, you’re in for a truly wild festive promo.</p>











<figure><figcaption>Some big Icons will be getting major upgrades. Image by EA.</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/FutSheriff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FUT Sheriff on X</a>, a flood of new details has emerged about the upcoming Winter Wildcards promo in EA FC 26—and there’s plenty to get excited about. The standout reveal is the suggestion that three full promo teams are on the way. With EA recently sticking to rapid-fire, one-week promos, a longer, more substantial festive event would be a welcome change and give players something meatier to dig into over the holiday period.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨WINTER WILDCARDS INFORMATION 🎄🎅🥶</p><p>• ✅ 3x Promo Teams<br>• 👶 Baby &amp; Prime Icons<br>• ⚡️ ONLY 1 PS+ <br>• 🔥 DAILY PLAYER SBC’S 💣 <br>• 👀 Some normal players also have 2x versions <br>• 👑 Best Of in packs<br>• ➕ More 👀💣🔜</p><p>Thoughts on Power Curve? Only one PS+ 🥶</p><p>Follow… <a href="https://t.co/57OBPVR8bo">pic.twitter.com/57OBPVR8bo</a></p></div>— Fut Sheriff (@FutSheriff) <a href="https://twitter.com/FutSheriff/status/1999883932926435378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>But that’s far from the only headline. Another major leak claims that a select group of Winter Wildcards cards will become the first items in EA FC 26 to receive <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/winter-wildcards-breaks-ea-fc-26-trend-with-game-changing-playstyle-boosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two PlayStyles+</a>, marking a significant shift in the game’s power structure. It appears EA is experimenting with gradually introducing higher-tier cards without abruptly breaking their slower power-curve philosophy—and double PlayStyles+ could be their first step in that direction.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for player names, the leaks are coming thick and fast. Icons like Zidane, Ibrahimović, and Ronaldinho have already been mentioned, and more are expected as we get closer to launch. If you want to stay on top of every new Winter Wildcards leak, <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/winter-wildcards-promo-team-1-in-ea-fc-26-ultimate-team-leaked-players-start-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Gaming Zone</a> will be updating fans with all the latest information as it drops.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#918)—Clues and Answers for Monday, December 15]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-15-918/</link>
            <guid>1383190</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re halfway through December (almost), and the festive window is rapidly drawing nearer. Before it gets here, you’ve got a couple of weeks of NYT Connections puzzles to solve. Fortunately, I’m on hand to give you the answers you need! Below, you’ll find the latest NYT Connections hints to crack today’s puzzle as quickly as possible.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-15">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 15)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #918:</p>



<ul>
<li>FINAL</li>



<li>BUMPER</li>



<li>QUALIFIER</li>



<li>GIANT</li>



<li>QUARTER</li>



<li>MONSTER</li>



<li>SEMI</li>



<li>TITANIC</li>



<li>DIVE</li>



<li>CELSIUS</li>



<li>DUMP</li>



<li>COLD</li>



<li>HOLE</li>



<li>ONE HUNDRED</li>



<li>JOINT</li>



<li>SEE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of the stages you pass through before a champion is crowned</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Words you’d use to describe something so big it feels exaggerated</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Places you might warn a friend not to hang out in</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Different contexts where the single letter “C” takes on a specific meaning</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 15:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-15-918">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 15 (#918)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– FINAL, QUALIFIER, QUARTER, SEMI</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BUMPER, GIANT, MONSTER, TITANIC</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – DIVE, DUMP, HOLE, JOINT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> -CELSIUS, COLD, ONE HUNDRED, SEE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When is the ARC Raiders Cold Snap Update Coming Out?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-release-time/</link>
            <guid>1383184</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is set to receive a major update this week, with Embark Studios pushing Cold Snap to all platforms. It’s one of the biggest updates to launch since the game was released on October 30, and it’s set to introduce new map conditions, quests, and a fresh weather system.</p>



<p>Fans are excited, but when is Cold Snap being released in ARC Raiders? Find out everything you need to know about this update below.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-cold-snap-being-released">When is Cold Snap Being Released?</h2>



<p>Cold Snap will be released on December 16th, most likely at 04:30 AM EST. While we know the update is being released on December 16th, Embark Studios has yet to confirm the specific time that the update goes live. However, if it mirrors the launch of North Line on November 13th, it’ll drop at 04:30 AM EST (09:30 AM GMT).</p>



<p>This is the most anticipated update to hit ARC Raiders since the North Line update introduced Stella Montis just over a month ago. While no new maps are being added in Cold Snap, fresh map conditions are coming to blanket the game in snow, altering the landscape.</p>



<p>The Flickering Flames event will also be added to ARC Raiders with this update. Again, not much is known about this event, but it’s widely assumed it’ll be a harsh change that causes players to take damage if they’re stranded outside in snowy conditions. It should function similarly to the other map conditions we already have, like Lush Blooms, Harvester, and Prospecting Probes.</p>



<p>Cold Snap will be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on December 16th. Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re excited to explore ARC Raiders in the snow.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bethesda Game Studios has invested significant resources into Fallout Shelter, the popular mobile game that has since expanded to multiple platforms, boasting over 250 million downloads as of 2025. The staggering update has introduced a wealth of new content into the game, particularly on Steam, with new quests, characters, themes, and more being added in one comprehensive update.</p>



<p>The supersized update also introduces the first of many Fallout Shelter Seasons, new limited-time events that populate the game with new experiences, exclusive rewards, and a spin-wheel mechanic.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-shelter-is-still-giving-a-decade-later">Fallout Shelter is Still Giving, a Decade Later</h2>



<p>Fallout Shelter is a phenomenal mobile-first title for Fallout fans everywhere. It dropped before the launch of Fallout 4 in 2015 and has remained a staple of the series ever since. In Fallout Shelter, players are charged with building and managing their own vault, embarking on missions into the wasteland, levelling up vault dwellers, and repopulating a fractured planet.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588430/view/514102575975368959">blog post on Steam</a>, the team at Bethesda Game Studios revealed that the <strong>largest update yet </strong>has arrived in Fallout Shelter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Rejoice, Overseers – Fallout Shelter’s biggest update yet is here! Years of content previously only available on mobile is now available on Steam, including new questlines, characters, weapons, themes, and more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This atomic update includes the first Fallout Shelter Season, dubbed ‘Viva New Vegas’ in tribute to the second season of the Fallout television series. It also adds a new questline that mirrors the show perfectly, named Power Struggle. It features all the main characters of the show and boasts <strong>eight </strong>linear quests.</p>



<p>Fans of the show can even unlock CX404, the adorable pup adopted by The Ghoul, as a vault pet.</p>
