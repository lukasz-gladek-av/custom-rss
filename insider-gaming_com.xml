<p>Sony decision to release PlayStation games on Steam seems to be paying off. According to one analytics firm, the company has made over $1.2 billion since it began putting first-party games on the platform.</p>



<p>In its latest report, Alinea Analytics goes into detail on the success of PlayStation Studios’ titles. They mention that the number comes after Valve’s cut of sales is taken into account.</p>







<p>The firm says that, <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-selling-playstation-games">according to their estim</a><a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-selling-playstation-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a</a><a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-selling-playstation-games">tes</a>, over $1.5 billion in revenue has been generated in total. Of that total, Sony received $1.2 billion while Valve has come away with at least $350 million. For Valve’s portion of the cuts, they take 30% of sales initially. Once a game reaches $10 million in sales, that drops to 25%. After $50 million it falls a bit further to 20%.</p>



<p>Still, even with the profits that are going to Valve, Sony has to be pleased with what PlayStation games are generating on the platform. </p>



<h2 id="h-five-games-lead-the-way-for-playstation-on-steam">Five Games Lead The Way For PlayStation On Steam</h2>



<p>Going into their estimates,—again, it’s important to note that many of these numbers haven’t been fully confirmed by Sony—Alinea reports that Helldivers 2 is the most successful first-party game on Steam. Since its release in February 2024, the game has sold 12.7 million copies. In a distant second is Horizon Zero Dawn, which sold 4.5 million copies. That’s then followed by God of War at 4.2 million, Days Gone at 3.4 million, and Spider-Man Remastered with 2.7 million copies sold.</p>



<p>Despite the success of these games, Alinea cautions that the “novelty” of PlayStation games on Steam is wearing off a bit.</p>



<p><strong>“The audience that was once excited to experience these games for the first time has largely been served,”</strong> Alinea’s head of market analysis Rhys Elliot said. <strong>“Later releases naturally face smaller potential audiences, and our estimates clearly show this.”</strong></p>







<p>Looking at their data, Alinea notes that sales were stronger when PlayStation first started releasing its titles on Steam. One example they used is God of War. When it released, the game sold 2.5 million copies in 427 days. That ended up being 2.5x more than the sequel, God of War Ragnarök,&nbsp;sold in the same timeframe. </p>



<p>Another game used was Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2. Over the first 294 days on the platform, Spider-Man sold twice as many copies as its sequel.</p>



<p>Whether this is a worrying trend or just a case of players not wanting to play the latest games right now remains to be seen. There have been rumors of Sony changing its strategy when it comes to whether or not it keeps releasing PlayStation games on Steam. With the reported generated revenue thus far, however, it feels like Sony could be leaving a lot of money on the table if they were to pull back. </p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Ubisoft was working on a new entry in the Splinter Cell franchise, but Ubisoft decided to cancel it before it was ever announced.</p>

<p>Herman was hired in 2017 by Ubisoft, along two other AdHoc cofounders Pierre Shorette and Dennis Lenart, and moved to work in Ubisoft’s San Francisco office. Upon arrival, they were put on the new Splinter Cell project.</p>

<p>According to the data provided, Battlefield 6 is the best-selling game in series history. It’s sales alone in October not only made it the best-selling game of both the month and year, but also saw it surpass the lifetime sales of Battlefield 1.

<p>Hypixel Studios is back, and they have brought an old friend along with it. On Monday, founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced that they had reacquired the rights to sandbox game Hytale from Riot Games.</p>

<h3>Concord Has Effectively Been Shut Down By Sony For A Second Time</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sony</figcaption></figure>



<p>Concord has gone down in infamy as an all-time Sony and PlayStation blunder. It’s also understandable that the company wants to sweep the game’s existence under the rug, which is why Sony has presumably and swiftly issued DMCAs notices to gameplay videos of a fan-inspired Concord reboot, causing access to the game to be halted.</p>



<p>Now, a community effort to resurrect the game has been met with strong action.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>The long road to Star Citizen’s full release looks to be continuing, as it’s been 13 years since the game was announced. We’ve checked back in from time to time, and the latest update is that Star Citizen is still in alpha, and it’s swiftly closing in on $900 million of crowd-funded money.</p>



<p>Say what you want, yes, but&nbsp;Star Citizen&nbsp;actually looks like a quality game. On the other hand, it probably should do when it’s had the development time that many multi-game franchises get and enough money to fund several Hollywood-level movies. Cloud Imperium Games’ Star Citizen could end up being one of the most fascinating games of our time.</p>

<h3>Resident Evil Requiem Producer Addresses Leon Kennedy Rumors</h3>

<p>It should be noted that Kumazawa’s responses were translated via an interpreter. While we don’t discredit the translator, there’s always the possibility that something was lost in translation. But when asked about the future of Leon Kennedy and the rumors that he might be in Resident Evil Requiem, Kumazawa had a simple response…</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-set-b1a/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket-next-set-release-details%E2%80%94new-set-b1a-explained.1360960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Even though the developers seem to be listening, Pokémon TCG Pocket content is still coming thick and fast. Set B1a will be here before you know it, so you should know its potential release details and what to expect from it.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising-b1-release-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Rising</a> was the culmination of one year of Pokémon TCG Pocket. B1 brought us full circle and did so with a huge collection of cards that will take weeks to collect. Creatures Inc. and DeNA have been easing up slightly on the new sets—with Deluxe Pack ex proving to be a rest point for some.</p>







<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is going to drop Set B1a in the future, and it might be wise to have Hourglasses ready.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-pokemon-tcg-pocket-set">When Is The Next Pokémon TCG Pocket Set?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Probably won’t be a big one. Credit to the Pokémon company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to various sources, Pokémon TCG Pocket Set B1a isn’t arriving until December 17.</strong></p>



<p>If this is correct, this means we aren’t getting a new Pokémon TCG Pocket set in November 2025. This would mirror what happened in Pocket’s first year. Genetic Apex was the debut set for the game, and Set 1a didn’t arrive until toward the end of December 2024—giving everyone two months to try and complete the collection.</p>







<p>Leaks suggest the plan is the same for Pokémon TCG Pocket in 2025. Mega Rising will carry over into December 2025, presumably due to the size of the set (over 300 new cards is a lot).</p>



<p>Then, a new, as yet unnamed, set will drop at the end of December 2025, giving everyone some festive cheer.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-can-we-expect-from-pokemon-tcg-pocket-b1a">What Can We Expect From Pokémon TCG Pocket B1a?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket B1a is likely to be a mini-set featuring a much smaller assortment of cards.</strong></p>



<p>Because it’s so far away, we haven’t seen or heard any B1a leaks. Conversely, it’s common sense that the next set will follow in the footsteps of other sets that end with an “a” or a “b.” Genetic Apex was followed up by Mythical Island, which only added 86 cards.</p>



<p>Triumphant Light (A2a) included 96 cards, and Shining Revelry (A2b) had 112 cards, for example. While each new set is growing bigger—thanks to Shinies and other special designs—B1a will probably have between 100-120 new cards—including Rares.</p>
