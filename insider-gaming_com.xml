<p>It has been officially announced that Conan the Barbarian will join Mortal Kombat 1 on January 21, 2025.</p>



<p>The announcement came from <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1866488904121282808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ed Boon</a> on X (formerly Twitter), which showed a brief snippet of Conan the Barbarian in action.</p>

<p>According to leakers, Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from Terminator 2 are some of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last characters to be coming to the Mortal Kombat 1 roster</a>. Rumors suggest that Kombat Pack 3 and the second-story expansion for Mortal Kombat 1 have since been canceled due to poor expansion sales. Several Mortal Kombat insiders have since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-mortal-kombat-insiders-say-that-future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-is-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corroborated the claims</a> since the original rumor.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has contacted NetherRealm Studios for comment on the claims.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/latest-black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush-mode/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the latest Black Myth: Wukong update, which is being deployed later today, players will be invited to take part in a new ‘boss rush’ challenge mode. This mode is split into two branches, and it’ll see players select former opponents to battle across a range of difficulty levels.</p>



<p>Game Science also revealed a new ‘Journeyer’s Chart’ mechanic, as well as a fresh set of armour, a new soundtrack application, and dozens of bug fixes.</p>



<p>Read on for the full scope of the next Black Myth: Wukong update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-a-challenge">Prepare for a Challenge</h2>



<p>Per an update published by Game Science, the new boss rush mode introduces two core challenges:</p>



<ul>
<li>Return of Rivals</li>



<li>Gauntlet of Legends</li>
</ul>



<p>In Return of Rivals, players are invited to fight past opponents, tweaking the difficulty settings to suit their abilities.</p>



<p>In Gauntlet of Legends, players can undertake a journey, fighting multiple boss characters in succession using a series of customised curses to alter gameplay elements. It was noted that some old bosses will appear with fresh movesets, just to keep players on their toes.</p>



<p>By completing the Gauntlet of Legends, players will unlock rare treasures, including curios, medicine, equipment, and up to three new weapons.</p>



<p>The ‘Journeyer’s Chart’ isn’t immediately obvious, but here’s the description <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from the blog update</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A remarkable one has captured these landscapes, organizing them into charts for guidance and marking.</li>



<li>A Journeyer’s Chart can be unlocked when the Destined One first enters Black Wind Mountain and meets the Keeper.</li>



<li>Afterwards, for each new territory reached, a “Journeyer’s Chart” can be purchased at the Keeper’s Shrine.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Also, Game Science has introduced a new equipment set – the ‘Set of Opulence’, which has been designed to celebrate the impending Chinese New Year. Elsewhere, players can use the Black Myth: Wukong Soundtrack Selection feature to enjoy the game’s OST more intricately.</p>



<p>These updates have been made in addition to dozens of changes and bug fixes, along with further localisation tweaks, such as Turkish language support.</p>



<p>The update – 1.0.12.16581 – is available today on PC and PS5.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the boss rush mode in Black Myth: Wukong? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle revealed that CD Projekt Red was unhappy with him for stating that Geralt will be a part of Witcher 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During a conversation with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WiKrmDmyL8&amp;t=1161s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Geektown</a> on YouTube (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/the-witcher-4-polaris/220849/news/doug-cockle-got-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-saying-geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-but-not-as-the-main-char" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), Doug Cockle revealed how he “got slapped by CD Projekt” for stating Geralt was in The Witcher 4. Cockle added that he wasn’t sure about “how true it is” and “went off a rumour”. He thought that he had “seen somebody from CD Projekt say that Geralt will be in Witcher 4, but he won’t be the main character”; however, he wasn’t sure how true this was. CD Projekt Red came to him stating, ‘We haven’t put anything out there, don’t say anything.’</p>



<p>Cockle explained that he doesn’t know “what it’s going to be” he thought he had an ‘idea’ about what it was, but then he was told by CD Projekt Red, ‘We haven’t put anything out there, don’t say anything.’ He also pointed out that his information might be “from a really really old statement that somebody who no longer works for CD Projekt actually put out about three years ago”. Currently, Witcher 4 is a “complete mystery” for the Geralt voice actor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s some context for those wondering what Cockle had stated about Geralt and Witcher 4. During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkl5T0pMFb4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fall Damage</a> on YouTube about four months ago, Cockle stated, “Geralt will be part of the game.” He wasn’t sure how prevalent his role would be, but he knew the game wouldn’t focus on the character. Cockle also added that he hadn’t seen the script yet and could be lying through his teeth.</p>
