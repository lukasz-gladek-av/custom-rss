<p>Battlefield fans are up in arms again about a suspected AI design used in the new ‘Windchill’ cosmetics bundle. In recent hours, eagle-eyed gamers discovered telling signs tied to a sticker in this bundle, and all indications point to it being a faulty generative AI creation.</p>



<p>Fans on social media platforms were running rampant, trying to burn the game to the ground. For some, it’s a minor issue, but for others, it’s indicative of that much bigger problem creeping across the games industry.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-ai-sticker-scandal-runs-wild">Battlefield 6 AI Sticker Scandal Runs Wild</h2>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1prq9x9/remove_this_ai_shit_from_the_store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield subreddit</a>, a user shared an image of the new Windchill bundle, revealing a <strong>player card sticker </strong>that stinks of flawed generative AI design. The image showcases a soldier within a snowflake, wielding an M4A1, but there are clear indications that it’s <strong>most likely </strong>created by AI.</p>



<p>The M4A1 in question has two obvious barrels, one above the other. It also seems to have two handguards, which is hardly the most common feature in the world of firearms.</p>



<p>Here’s a zoomed-in shot of the player card sticker:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Users were quick to flock to social posts, stating that this isn’t the only example of something that <strong>looks like </strong>generative AI in Battlefield 6. In social circles, the comments were damning. One user wrote, ‘Just the fact they didn’t catch that before releasing shows how little they are trying.’</p>



<p>Another said, ‘They got your money, so they don’t care about which hill you choose to die on.’</p>



<p>One user condemned the wider use of AI, ‘AI art is generated based on stolen artwork and takes jobs away from real artists.’ Another echoed that sentiment: ‘I didn’t pay for AI garbage. EA pay your f***ing artists!’</p>



<p>In similar news, the world’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-game-playable-demo-codex-mortis/">first game created 100% with AI</a> recently launched a playable demo, and it went as well as you could expect.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#925)—Clues and Answers for Monday, December 22]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re kicking off the <strong>official </strong>festive week with the NYT Connections solutions and hints that you need to get the job done! Today’s puzzle is the first in a few that will lead you up to the big day and beyond, so be sure to scroll down as soon as needed to uncover today’s answers.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-22">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 22)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #925:</p>



<ul>
<li>RUSH</li>



<li>PIN</li>



<li>PLAYING</li>



<li>LATER</li>



<li>GREETING</li>



<li>CYA</li>



<li>RASH</li>



<li>COMING</li>



<li>WAVE</li>



<li>BUSINESS</li>



<li>FUTURE</li>



<li>BROW</li>



<li>WHIT</li>



<li>FOLLOWING</li>



<li>MEMBERSHIP</li>



<li>SURGE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>They’re all about a sudden <strong>increase in amount or intensity</strong></em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em><strong>All imply ‘not yet’ — something ahead in time</strong></em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Which of these words show up <strong>in your wallet, on your desk, or at a game table</strong>?</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These are colors that feel like they’re <strong>missing something</strong></em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 22:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-22-925">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 22 (#925)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– RASH, RUSH, SURGE, WAVE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COMING, FOLLOWING, FUTURE, LATER</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BUSINESS, GREETING, MEMBERSHIP, PLAYING</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BROW, CYA, PIN, WHIT</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bethesda Needed a Decade to ‘Feel Comfortable’ with Creating ‘New Stuff’ in Fallout]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-fallout-a-decade-to-feel-comfortable/</link>
            <guid>1389469</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout is one of the most recognizable post-apocalyptic franchises in modern gaming. It has become a multimedia gem in recent years with the emergence of the live-series television show, and it boasts a lengthy lineup of titles that span almost a thirty-year history. </p>



<p>In 2004, Bethesda Game Studios acquired a license to develop Fallout 3, before purchasing the franchise outright in 2007. In the words of one of the most notable developers in the Fallout space, it wouldn’t be until Fallout 4 was developed and released almost a decade later that the team felt ‘comfortable’ with the series.</p>



<h2 id="h-getting-comfortable-with-creation-in-fallout">Getting Comfortable with Creation in Fallout</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with GamesRadar, Emil Pagliarulo, one of the Bethesda veterans who has driven the production of Fallout forward over the years, dropped a tasty titbit. He suggested that it took <strong>a long time </strong>for Bethesda to get comfortable with this legendary series, especially following the pivot that saw Fallout 3 become a transformative first-person RPG.</p>



<p>He suggested that buying the brand wasn’t enough for the company to feel as flexible and inventive as they might have wanted. In Fallout 3, it was all about paying tribute to what had come before, and it wasn’t until 2015’s Fallout 4 that the team felt more creative.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The big thing about Fallout 3 was it’s this transitional game. It was the first Fallout we had done. So we wanted to make sure we were really honoring the legacy of the franchise and those earlier games.</p>



<p>We owned it, but owning a franchise and an IP is different than feeling like you own it creatively.</p>



<p>I think by the time Fallout 4 came around we felt more comfortable with like okay, ‘we don’t have to be so reverential now, it’s not all nostalgia, we can create some new stuff.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thanks to <em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/bethesda-was-scared-of-making-fallout-3-but-by-fallout-4-it-had-chilled-out-we-dont-have-to-be-so-reverential-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> </em>for the interview quote.</p>



<p>Perhaps Emil is forgetting the creation of Fallout Shelter, which was released just before Fallout 4 and was a pretty innovative and transformative game in itself.</p>



<p>Fallout 3 is seen as being one of the greatest games ever made. It’s a treasure trove of a title that was expanded with stellar drops for months after the game launched, and even today, it remains a fan favorite title. Fallout 4, which is by numbers a better seller than Fallout 3, wasn’t received quite as well.</p>



<p>And in the middle of that, you have Fallout: New Vegas, seen by many as the best Fallout game ever made, which Bethesda <strong>published </strong>rather than developed outright. That accolade goes to Obsidian.</p>



<p>The wider community has mixed feelings about Bethesda’s ‘treatment’ of Fallout over the years. It’s expected that the next major release in the series, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-todd-howard-confirmed-fallout-5-details/">Fallout 5</a>, won’t surface for many years, and for now, Fallout 76 and Fallout Shelter are the only games in the series receiving substantial updates.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Quietly Ends Production of the Most Affordable Steam Deck]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valve-ends-production-affordable-steam-deck-lcd/</link>
            <guid>1389466</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Valve has undertaken a shake-up of sorts in the handheld gaming world, nixing production of the most affordable Steam Deck, the LCD ‘OG’ model. It was recently discovered by eagle-eyed gamers that Valve had silently posted a note on the <span>Steam Deck store page, referenc<strong>ing the end of production</strong>, with what was left representing the final stock of&nbsp;</span>the LCD model.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, we were able to add the 256GB LCD model to our basket, but who knows how many are left to purchase in Valve’s supply lines?</p>







<h2 id="h-oled-or-bust">OLED or Bust</h2>



<p>If you want a Steam Deck going forward, you’ll soon need to rely exclusively on the OLED model, which has an entry pricing point of $549 for the 512GB variant. That’s a fair reach over the 256GB LCD model, which boasts a price tag of $399 at the time of writing.</p>



<p>Of course, the OLED model is an improvement in <strong>many ways</strong>. It has a bigger, better screen, better networking capabilities, a larger battery, and a *<em>checks notes</em>* longer charging cable, amongst other things.</p>



<p>It comes as no surprise to learn that Valve is discontinuing the LCD Steam Deck, but many expected a cut-price deal to get rid of them, particularly amidst the ongoing Steam Winter Sale and the approach to the festive window. If stock is there to be cleared, then host a clearance sale!</p>



<p>Last year, when discontinuation plans started surfacing, Valve knocked 15% off the price before phasing out the 64GB LCD Steam Deck.</p>



<p>If you head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam’s storefront</a> and try to shop for a Steam Deck, you’ll see the small print:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model. Once sold out, it will no longer be available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Valve is moving on to bigger and brighter things, like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-machine-everything-to-know-about-valves-new-system/">recently revealed Steam Machine</a>, a hybrid device that’s supposed to be the perfect combination of a gaming PC and a traditional home console.</p>



<p>It’s slated for a 2026 release, but nobody has the pricing structure for the thing on lock just yet.</p>







<p>Are you hoping that the Steam Deck LCD model gets a price slash so you can scoop one without breaking the bank? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
