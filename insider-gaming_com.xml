<p>Bethesda Game Studios has just released ‘The Gleaming Depths’ update on Fallout 76. This super-sized patch stands as the largest endgame update the game has ever received, and it introduces a string of new features – including the game’s first ‘raid’ – to give late-game players more of a point in playing.</p>



<p>Read on to learn about everything coming in Fallout 76’s last major update in 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-gleaming-depths">Enter The Gleaming Depths</h2>



<p>The most important thing being delivered in this update is The Gleaming Depths, an all-new raid that’s designed to push players to new heights in terms of a solid, in-game challenge. It’s built to be tackled by a team of four players, all overseeing a unique role, such as Healer, Tank, or DPS.</p>



<p>Bethesda has finally introduced 4-Star Legendary Items into Fallout 76 with The Gleaming Depths update. Players will need to complete challenges in the new raid to unlock the top-most Legendary mods that boast powerful attributes.</p>



<p>Pets are also being brought into the game in The Gleaming Depths update. These C.A.M.P. items are open to everyone, but they’re locked to these ‘bases’ in-game. They won’t follow you around, but they can be customised slightly and interacted with, if that’s your kind of thing.</p>



<p>Following this update, you’ll also be able to assign yourself a title, using a series of prefixes and suffixes earned through quests and events to denote what kind of player you are in the Appalachian wasteland.</p>



<p>And of course, The Gleaming Depths update marks the arrival of Season 19 – The Scientific Forge. This update offers a boon for Enclave fans, as the entire scoreboard full of rewards is focused on the mysterious, malicious faction.</p>



<p>Finally, the team has worked to bring about hundreds of bug fixes, perk adjustments, and optimisations to the game. It’s one hell of an update.</p>



<p>Here are the install sizes for <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/5jYSbvocrji7E0eDJRJl9z/fallout-76-the-gleaming-depths-release-notes?linkId=100000315193526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gleaming Depths update</a>:</p>
