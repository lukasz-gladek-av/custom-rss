<h2 id="h-it-s-all-about-the-tricks-of-the-trade-in-mlb-the-show-26">It’s All About the Tricks of the Trade in MLB The Show 26</h2>



<p>This year, Sony San Diego is heavily promoting the brand new Trade Hub, which they’re calling a one-stop shop for all the deals players will make as Franchise general managers. The logic across all trades has been updated. Players will have access to a more complex system that takes into account several factors, including season standings, market size, rivalries, and more. They’ve also incorporated secondary positions into roster decisions. The hope is that this will lead to the most realistic GM experience yet.</p>



<p>Sony San Diego is also touting updates to the Lineup and Rotation Logic, making it more in line with current MLB lineup trends. There’s also an added trade slot, which means players can make up to 4 for 4 trades this year. Overall, this means more customization, more realism, and hopefully more enjoyment.</p>
