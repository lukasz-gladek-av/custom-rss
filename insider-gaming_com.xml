<p>If you have not played GTA Online in the past 60 days, you might be eligible for Rockstar’s one-time exclusive offer, which gives players $3 million in-game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, you read that right: Rockstar is offering players $3 million in-game to return to GTA Online, but there’s a catch. Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/532607/article/rockstar-games-trying-to-win-some-gta-online-players-back-with-3m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, players should meet a set of eligibility requirements before claiming the in-game currency. Moreover, Rockstar only offers $1 million for free; for the remaining $2 million, players would need to make additional purchases, including buying a Shark Card and subscribing to GTA+.</p>



<h2 id="h-eligibility-requirements-for-claiming-3-million-in-gta-online">Eligibility Requirements for Claiming $3 Million in GTA Online</h2>



<ul>
<li>Players should have a Rockstar Games Account that’s linked to their platform.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Claim the offer on Rockstar’s <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Players should not have signed into GTA Online in the past 2 months (60 days).&nbsp;</li>



<li>The account should not have received a ban or suspension from Rockstar at any point.</li>



<li>The offer should not be redeemed already.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-3-million-in-gta-online">How to Claim $3 Million in GTA Online?</h2>



<p>To claim the $1 million, the player must claim the offer from Rockstar’s website and sign in to GTA Online using the same account. Once done, players will receive the in-game money within 72 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To receive the additional $1.5 million, players must purchase a Great White, Whale, or Megalodon Shark card.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, for the final $500,000, players need to subscribe to GTA+. If you are already a GTA+ subscriber, you can still claim the money if you haven’t played GTA Online in the past 60 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, GTA 5 Enhanced has become the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-enhanced-worst-rated-steam-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worst-rated</a> Grand Theft Auto title on Steam. Also, Rockstar’s parent company has sued a GTA Online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-parent-company-sues-gta-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Market</a> provider.

<p>United States video game sales data for February 2025 has been released. Not only is Monster Hunter Wilds the best-selling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-was-february-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game of the month</a>, but it’s the best selling game of 2025 through two months.</p>



<p>According to the latest data from Circana, Monster Hunter Wilds was the best-selling game of the month for PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam. When looking at the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqai5telk2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam data</a>, it has accounted for “more than half of the title’s total dollar sales”.</p>



<p>When it comes to the Monster Hunter franchise, the release of Monster Hunter Wilds doubled that of Monster Hunter Rise in terms of dollar sales. It’s worth noting that Monster Hunter Wilds launched at $69.99 while Rise launched at $59.99.</p>

Other new titles to make the list include Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (2nd), Civilization 7 (3rd), PGA Tour 2K25 (6th), Avowed (13th), and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii (18th).</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/japan-government-worried-attacks-assassins-shadows/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/japan%E2%80%99s-government-worried-about-%E2%80%98imitation-attacks%E2%80%99-based-on-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows.1139034/</guid>

<p>Japan’s government recently convened to discuss a series of topics in a Diet, one of which was the recent controversy surrounding Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The game’s more scandalous scenes have showcased Yasuke, an African samurai, destroying shrines, sequences which have naturally prompted concerns in the Japanese government.</p>



<p>In a recent discussion, Japan’s Prime Minister voiced a strict response to these concerns, answering points raised by other party members suggesting that ‘imitation attacks’ could occur in real life.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-absolutely-unacceptable">‘Absolutely Unacceptable’</h2>



<p>Hiroyuki Kata, a Lib Dem party member, brought up the topic of shrine destruction in Assassin’s Creed Shadows at a recent Diet, putting questions to the nation’s Prime Minister.</p>



<p>He explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to ask about the Assassin’s Creed issue. </p>



<p>In the game, the samurai protagonist smashes drums, sacred mirrors, and altars inside the worship hall of a shrine that appears under its real name. He slashes at people who appear to be priests, shoots arrows, and engages in other violent mayhem. When I asked the chief priest, he said that the game company had not contacted the shrine to ask for permission to use the name.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The politician floated the suggestion that imitation attacks might take place at real shrines across Japan and that other concerns, like ‘tourist pollution’, were also being considered. These details were reported by <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2503/19/news167.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ITMedia</a> (picked up by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/japanese-government-addresses-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy-as-ban-rumors-spread-3165590/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>).</p>



<p>By way of a response, the nation’s Prime Minister, Ishiba Shigeru, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is absolutely unacceptable to graffiti a shrine. It is nothing but an insult to the country.</p>



<p>It is natural to have respect for the culture and religion of a country, and I think it is important to send out the message that we will not tolerate any behavior that does not respect the culture and religion of a country and will not tolerate it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was suggested that such wanton destruction of culturally significant facilities wasn’t replicated in any other Assassin’s Creed title, prompting further worries from the Japanese government. The comments made by the Prime Minister and other party members are not indicative of any further action.</p>

<p>Inzoi is under the stewardship of Inzoi Studio—published by Krafton—and its release date can’t come soon enough for fans of life-sim titles. We’ve got the key details you’re looking for, including its cost and platforms.</p>



<p>Attention Inzoi fans, the wait is nearly over. Whether the life simulator has only recently caught your eye or since its announcement a couple of years ago, you don’t have to imagine what your idyllic world looks like for much longer.</p>



<p>Inzoi’s release date is getting closer, and we’re ticking days off the calendar quicker than we can count!</p>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-release-date">Inzoi Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ve got the whole world in your hands. Credit to Inzoi Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>March 28 is the official Early Access release date for Inzoi.</strong></p>



<p>To reiterate, this signals the full-scale, playable debut of Inzoi, but this isn’t its official launch. If you don’t know, Early Access lets players get hands-on with a title, and it’s a far more sophisticated beta test in many ways. </p>



<p>You get access to most of the content that will be available at launch, but it’s a chance to refine the product and iron out flaws before launch. You still purchase Inzoi, own it, and get a ton of content, but it’s your chance to help refine it before its full release.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-inzoi-platforms">All Inzoi Platforms</h2>



<p><strong><strong><strong>PC players get first access to Inzoi, and a PlayStation and Xbox release is only happening once the title completes its Early Access run.</strong></strong></strong></p>



<p>You can check out everything we know about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-inzoi-platforms-is-it-coming-to-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi’s platforms and console availability</a> here. The quick details are that PC Early Access is up first—although we don’t know how long it will last. Furthermore, future console ports should arrive for the full release.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-inzoi-cost">How Much Does Inzoi Cost?</h2>



<p><strong><strong>Inzoi will cost $39.99 when it launches in Early Access.</strong></strong></p>



<p>We’ve also dove into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-inzoi-cost-inzoi-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi’s cost</a> in greater detail. But I can tell you it’s definitely going to be <strong>$39.99 in Early Access</strong>, and we’re theorizing a <strong>potential £34.99 price tag elsewhere</strong>. This isn’t a low-key, low-effort project: Inzoi is looking to be the real deal in 2025—hence the retail price.</p>



<p>There are no special Editions to consider for the time being. Early Access isn’t known for having Deluxe Editions or anything like that, but this might be a question once Inzoi is looking to release in its entirety.</p>

<p>If you’ve played Escape from Tarkov lately (or in the last couple of years…) you’ll be aware of how disruptive heavy rain can be. It’s a deafening thing that has you ruing the start of a raid and reaching for your volume controls to avoid blowing out your eardrums.</p>



<p>Well, based on the results of a recent in-game survey, Battlestate Games is preparing to adjust weather effects in the game, including the volume of heavy rain. This is based on more than 66% of respondents having an issue with how loud rain can be.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-quality-of-life">Quality of Life</h2>



<p>The latest <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/337?utm_source=x_post&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=winter_drops_24-25&amp;utm_term=link_1&amp;utm_content=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Escape from Tarkov survey</a> was geared towards understanding players’ opinions about the in-game weather systems. From fog to the volume of rain and from the ability to switch seasons in PvE to how often the weather changes mid-raid, everything was laid on the table.</p>



<p>The results of the survey are in, and they reveal some interesting tidbits:</p>



<ul>
<li>40% of players are irritated by fog, but 7% of players hate <strong>clear weather</strong></li>



<li>53% of players want to see <strong>extreme weather </strong>in the game</li>



<li>53% of players want to choose between seasons in PvE raids</li>



<li>12% of players don’t want the weather to change at all while they’re raiding</li>
</ul>



<p>Strangely, a whopping 34% of players don’t have an issue with how loud the rain is. I’m assuming they’re the players whose hearing has already been damaged beyond repair by relentless rainfall.</p>



<p>The last survey saw Battlestate Games make dozens of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-ai-upgrade-patch/">amendments to the in-game AI</a>, adjusting behaviour per the community’s feedback to make things better for everyone. Now, AI enemies can’t beam you through bushes and their long-range engagement behaviour is much more realistic, amongst other things.</p>



<p>Has the rain ever given you a headache in Escape from Tarkov? Let me know in the comments.</p>
