<p>On Wednesday, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-purchase-hasnt-helped-xbox-game-pass-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report from The Information</a> claimed that Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard hasn’t resulted in the growth that the company expected with its Xbox business at this point. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-gaming-business-falls-short-despite-activision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report quotes (paywalled)</a> one analyst—portfolio manager Danny Fish—as saying “Activision has been disappointing” for the company’s overall revenue. After reaching out to Activision and Microsoft for comment, representatives from both companies not only said The Information’s report wasn’t accurate and “through omission is misrepresenting the business”, but provided context to show how the company has performed since the purchase along with the state of Microsoft gaming.</p>



<p>In its last four earnings reports, Microsoft has reported revenue increases regularly for Xbox content and services. Going back to Q2 FY2024, Xbox content and services revenue increased by 61% “driven by 55 points of the net impact from the Activision acquisition.” For the next quarter, revenue was reported to have increased by 62% with 61 points attributed to Activision. For Q4 2024, it was up another 61% with 58 points of net impact from the purchase. Lastly, Q1 of FY2025 saw the revenue increase by 61% with 53 points coming from Activision. </p>



<p>Breaking the numbers down, Activision has accounted for over 85% of each quarter’s revenue increase. It also shows, over the last three quarters, a slight steady growth outside of Activision’s impact from a low of one point to eight points as of Q1 FY2025.</p>



<p>What’s more, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella alluded to the purchase’s benefit during the company’s Q1 FY2025 earnings call last October about the acquisition and gaming’s growth.</p>



<p>“We set new records for monthly active users in the quarter, as more players than ever play our games across devices and on the Xbox platform,” he said while saying that the business is “positioned for long-term growth”. </p>



<p>Regarding Xbox Game Pass, Nadella said that the service set a record for the number of new Game Pass subscriptions on Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s launch day. He added that the service “set a new Q1 record for total revenue and average revenue per subscriber.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moving on to the suggestion from the report that, in 2021, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the company could “wind down its games business entirely”, the company flat out denies that. They point to comments made around that time with Nadella expressing that Microsoft is “all in on gaming”. </p>



<p>They closed by saying that engagement on Xbox platforms is “at an all-time high”. Microsoft says that they “are well over&nbsp;500 million monthly players&nbsp;and over the last year, we’ve seen consistent growth in monthly users on cloud”.</p>



<p>Regarding the report’s claims on Azure servers and the Activision deal not being a catalyst to get other studios to release their games on Game Pass, Insider Gaming was told that The Information’s report “conflates an opinion that developers are scared of profit loss with the fact that the business is already set up to pay developers up front if that’s their choice for how they want to structure deal”. </p>



<p>Microsoft is scheduled to announce its Q2 earnings for FY2025 on January 29.</p>

<p>Soul Assembly, the developers behind Just Dance VR, has let go 15% of its staff in the latest string of layoffs to hit the games industry. First reported by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/soul-assembly-layoffs-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UploadVR</a>, the layoffs are across multiple areas of the company including animation, marketing, QA, and more. </p>



<p>“This decision was taken to ensure the studio is aligned with the requirements of our upcoming projects,” Soul Assembly CEO David Solari told UploadVR. “We are providing support to the affected team members as they transition to new opportunities and thank them for their contributions. This step was necessary to position the company for future success during a challenging time for the gaming industry.”</p>



<p>As far as the number of employees being let go, the company only says 15%. The <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/520511-23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest employment data</a> from 2023 says that company had 72 people working at the studio with a goal of hitting over 100 by 2024. If we were to go based on that information, the company let go anywhere from 11-20 people if it surpassed 100 employees as it intended. Insider Gaming has reached out to get an exact number of people impacted, and will update this story should a response be received.</p>



<p>The layoffs at Soul Assembly <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mark the 11th company</a> to hold layoffs so far in 2025. After 2024 saw nearly 16,000 known jobs lost, 2025 has seen an estimated 200+ jobs lost in its first 16 days.</p>



<p>In addition to Just Dance VR, Soul Assembly <a href="https://soulassembly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has developed games</a> such as Warhammer 40K: Battle Sister, Last Stand, and the Drop Dead franchise.</p>

<p>The best Counter-Strike 2 case to open depends on entirely on what you’re trying to get out of a case. Opening cases in CS2 is a gamble, as you’re most likely to open a blue Mil-Spec tier skin that’s not worth the price of the case key. But if you’re lucky, a Covert red skin or an Exceedingly Rare item might fall your way.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-cases-to-open">Best CS2 Cases to Open</h2>



<p>The best cases to open in CS2 are the ones that feature the most aesthetically pleasing and valuable skins. But cases with the most valuable knife skins are also considered the best. From the perspective of pure value, the older, rarer cases contain the most valuable skins, but those cases are easily the most expensive. Sure, you can pay $120 for the classic CS:GO Weapon Case, but unless you’re lucky you’re more than likely going to end up with a skin worth $40.</p>



<p>If you’re fishing for knives, but don’t mind ending up with some nice skins as a consolation, here are the CS2 cases to target.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-spectrum-2-case">The Spectrum 2 Case</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Spectrum 2 Case has some of the most valuable rare items in Counter-Strike. Its Covert red skin is the gorgeous AK-47 The Empress skin, and you have a chance at opening a Butterfly Knife Doppler, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-expensive-counter-strike-skins-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most valuable skins</a> in all of Counter-Strike. It’s currently listed at $2.64 per case on the Steam community market, so it’s a bit high risk, but it’s also high reward.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-prisma-case">The Prisma Case</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Prisma Case is a little more cost effective at $0.95 per case, but what makes it worth opening is a chance at one of the most gorgeous M4A4 skins. The Emperor skin for the M4A4 is one of the most esthetically pleasing and clean skins for the CT rifle, but you might also luck out with an extremely valuable Doppler knife skin. The AWP Atheris is also a solid get.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-recoil-case">The Recoil Case</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Recoil Case is the cheapest case on the Steam community market, currently listed at just $0.24 per case. The lower price is due to it featuring a small chance at gloves instead of a knife, but it also has some nice skins you could potentially get. The M4A4 Poly Mag, the AK-47 Ice Coaled, the Glock Winterized, and the USP-S Printstream are all really clean skins.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-danger-zone-case">The Danger Zone Case</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Danger Zone Case features a classic Covert red skin, the AK-47 Asiimov. The orange, black, and white skin is a iconic color scheme which has been replicated on other weapons as well. Opening a Danger Zone Case also gives you a chance to unbox a lucrative Talon Knife Fade skin.</p>
