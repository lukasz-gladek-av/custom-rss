<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was released little more than a month ago, storming up the charts and becoming known far and wide as a contender for many Game of the Year awards. It stunned players with its depth, visual splendour, and intense realism, and with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dense roadmap ahead</a>, the game has plenty of life left in its medieval lungs.</p>



<p>Since Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 hit the market, one of the gameâ€™s most prolific actors, Luke â€˜LordHansCaponâ€™ Dale, has positively exploded. He has become a superstar streamer in a matter of weeks, pulling in and retaining an audience and securing solid accolades in no time at all.</p>

<p>Luke Dale portrays Hans Capon in the Kingdom Come universe, and heâ€™s front and centre as the game kicks off, with many of the second titleâ€™s most pivotal moments revolving around his existence. In the first game, which dropped back in 2018, he was someone to be hated, but in KCD2, heâ€™s a lovable rogue who youâ€™ll go to great lengths to keep safe.</p>



<p>In the days that followed the launch of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on February 4, Dale kickstarted a streaming campaign that saw his popularity levels skyrocket across Twitch and YouTube.</p>



<p>In January 2025, the talented actor streamed the first Kingdom Come title in anticipation of the follow-up, netting a peak viewer count of around 350 viewers. Little more than two weeks later, he was picking up peak figures of 20,000 viewers. In one post on social media, Dale revealed he was in the 0.01% of streamers on Twitch by numbers alone.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Dang. Iâ€™m in the top 0.01% of streamers in the world ðŸ«¶ 

Shall we get to number 1? </span><a href="https://twitter.com/KaiCenat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@KaiCenat</a><span> Iâ€™m coming for you bro ðŸ‘Š </span></p></article></div>







<p>It didnâ€™t end there, though.</p>



<p>Luke Dale, who went so far as to get a Kingdom Come tattoo while live, went from 32,000 subscribers on YouTube when the game dropped to 102,000 subscribers at the time of writing. He racked up 15,000 followers on Twitch in around two weeks and managed to secure a Twitch Partner spot after streaming Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 just <strong>eight times</strong>.</p>



<p>Before 2025, heâ€™d streamed just three times, <a href="https://streamscharts.com/channels/lordhanscapon/streams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to StreamsCharts</a>. Thatâ€™s one hell of a hot streak.</p>



<p>It helps that Dale is genuinely a nice guy with a penchant for performing, and his role as Hans Capon in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is fantastic and bursting with clippable, quality sequences.</p>



<p>If you want to follow Luke Daleâ€™s latest streams, you can find him on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LordHansCapon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lordhanscapon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, the solo developer behind Balatro, one of 2024â€™s most highly awarded games, opened up about his journey in a blog post. In an article dubbed â€˜The Balatro Timelineâ€™, LocalThunk took a deep dive into the end-to-end history of what it took to make Balatro, which was released in February 2024 to an overwhelmingly positive reception.</p>



<p>LocalThunk explained about the very origins of Balatro â€“ which was first named â€˜Joker Pokerâ€™ â€“ in this timeline walkthrough. He also gives readers a transparent insight into the toll that creating the game had on his mental and physical health, which is something many gamers never realise.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-my-sleep-and-my-heart-are-getting-worse">â€˜My Sleep and my Heart are Getting Worseâ€™</h2>



<p>In The Balatro Timeline, LocalThunk tracks back through three years of development history, going back to December 2021, when the first concept of what would become known as Balatro surfaced. It was being pieced together alongside a full-time IT job, and back then, LocalThunk couldnâ€™t ever imagine it becoming as successful as it has.</p>



<p>The full account of this stunning development journey is a wonder to read, and it paints a clear picture of just how impactful these things can be on developers â€“ especially solo developers.</p>



<p>LocalThunk explained that his mental and physical health were put to the test during the creation of Balatro, with the situation becoming much worse as the launch got closer and the attention around Balatro started ramping up <strong>fast</strong>.</p>



<p>For instance, it was noted that in August 2023, just six months before the launch of Balatro:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is when my sleep and heart started having issues. </p>



<p>I really struggled with my physical and mental health from this time onward all the way up to launch. This was entirely because of the stress around dealing with the public, players, and the pressure to get everything done before February 2024.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By October 2023, things were getting much worse for LocalThunk:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My sleep and my heart are getting worse. Every few nights I need to sleep sitting upright on the couch because sleeping while lying down kept getting interrupted by my heart. </p>



<p>I stupidly thought that I couldnâ€™t handle going to the doctor while dealing with all the dev and business stuff swirling around at the time. I felt totally overwhelmed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Everything from signing with a publisher to hiring lawyers to hammer out contracts is detailed <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/balatro-timeline-3aarh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in The Balatro Timeline</a>. Itâ€™s an account of the highs and lows of solo development, but fortunately, it ends on a jubilant note.</p>



<p>LocalThunk revealed that he made $600,000 in just a couple of hours on Steam alone, and on launch day, he sat down to celebrate with a bottle of champagne and some burgers.</p>



<p>Nice.</p>
