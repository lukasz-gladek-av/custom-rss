<p>A Minecraft Movie is officially launching an awards campaign for consideration for upcoming ceremonies like the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. Yes, you read that right, and yes, it is official from Warner Bros. itself.</p>



<p>Released earlier this year, A Minecraft Movie brought the blocky world of Minecraft to live-action and the results were rather decent. However, the real success came from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-mine-craft-movie-biggest-ever-video-game-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its large box office</a>, which came as a result of successful marketing and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internet memes</a>. Now, there is now a chance we could hear “Steve’s Lava Chicken” sung on the Oscars stage or Jack Black thank ‘Chicken Jockey’ at his Golden Globes acceptance speech.</p>

<p>Warner Bros. has launched campaigns for many of its films to be considered for end-of-year awards like the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. While some films, like the smash-hits Weapons, One Battle After Another, and Sinners, are among the names, one is a bit out-there: <a href="https://www.wbawards.com/screenings/film/?film=aminecraftmovie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Minecraft Movie</a>. It’s not out there for movies, even okay ones, to do award campaigns, as it could snag some nominations if it’s lucky. However, Warner Bros. is putting everything up for the film, including it’s main cast and director.</p>



<p>The full list of contested categories can be <a href="https://www.wbawards.com/screenings/film/?film=aminecraftmovie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found here</a>. Notable ones include Best Picture, Jared Hess for Best Director, and Jack Black for Best Actor. Will it get any of those? Seeing how the race is, definitely not. However, personally, it does have a shot at Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Production Design, and Best Visual Effects. Depending on how some future movies do, you could even put “I Feel Alive” up there for Best Original Song. </p>



<p>While a weird campaign, it’s not surprising for Warner Bros. to do so. As mentioned before, A Minecraft Movie had a meteoric rise at the box office. In fact, it’s currently the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">third-highest-grossing film of 2025</a> behind Lilo &amp; Stitch and Ne Zha 2. A sequel is already greenlit and in production as of earlier this month. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see if it leads anywhere and, if it does, it will be quite entertaining for sure.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EGX and The Death of the UK Gaming Expo]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/egx-death-uk-gaming-expo/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/egx-and-the-death-of-the-uk-gaming-expo.1335157/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The United Kingdom’s relationship with the video game expo scene has crumbled. Once upon a time, the nation boasted showcases like the Insomnia Gaming Festival, WASD, and EGX, but they’ve all disappeared into the shadows over the years.</p>



<p>The Insomnia Gaming Festival went bust (and is trying a half-hearted resurgence), WASD shut down, and EGX has become a pitiful, almost unbranded corner in the larger MCM Comic Con in London. I attended EGX over the weekend, and I’m sad to say that it’s no longer worth keeping alive.</p>



<p>EGX’s disappearance marks the death of the UK gaming expo circuit.</p>



<h2 id="h-uk-gamers-are-left-to-dream-hack">UK Gamers Are Left to Dream(Hack)</h2>



<p>Next year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dreamhack-coming-to-the-uk-in-2025-call-of-duty-dota/">DreamHack returns</a> to the United Kingdom for the first time in <strong>ten years</strong>, which is a saving grace of sorts for gamers across the territory. In some places, the courageous efforts of more grassroots events like EPIC.LAN are trying to get some wheels turning, but the most iconic expos in the business have now faded into nothingness.</p>



<p>In 2024, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomnia-gaming-festival-review/">Insomnia Gaming Festival</a> imploded after 25 years of entertaining visitors, thanks to financial woes brought on by the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s trying to make a grand return in 2025, but <strong>it’s not looking good</strong>.</p>



<figure><figcaption>One of the final Insomnia Gaming Festival events, and while it was bustling, nobody knew it was about to collapse.</figcaption></figure>







<p>Also in 2024, the WASD showcase, a more intimate event in London that was one of my favorite events in the world, was shut down as the event’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/uk-gaming-expo-scene-crumble-wasd/">organiser entered liquidation</a>.</p>



<p>Now, I’m sad to report that EGX is done and dusted.</p>



<h2 id="h-farewell-egx">Farewell, EGX</h2>



<p>Formerly known as the Eurogamer Expo, EGX was once the shining star of the UK gaming scene, a monumental event that drew international acclaim and hosted a showfloor featuring the biggest names in the business.</p>



<figure><figcaption>This was EGX in 2014 after a rebrand from ‘Eurogamer Expo’. It was a massive event that was once seen as the UK’s E3.</figcaption></figure>







<p>The COVID-19 pandemic wasn’t kind to EGX, but in the years that followed the devastation of the virus, EGX seemed to be getting back on an even keel. That growth has ebbed away into nothing, and EGX is now an unrecognizable corner of the larger MCM Comic Con event.</p>



<p>I attended EGX (for the last time) this year, and baulked at what was on display. It was almost impossible to spot any EGX branding, and what I did find was a few scattered indie games and a lone LAN area featuring a few rigs with a mix of playable titles on them. No big names, no exclusive demo opportunities, and almost <strong>nothing </strong>in the way of gaming activations.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The cracks in EGX started showing in 2023 (Image Credit: Later Levels Blog)</figcaption></figure>







<p>In 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/egx-mcm-comic-con-same-event/">EGX and MCM joined forces</a>, but the showcases were separated, and EGX still enjoyed a standalone profile that was represented in the branding of the event. This year, EGX has all but disappeared, leaving MCM standing tall – but even that has issues.</p>



<p>As I walked around MCM, I was greeted by vast swathes of market-style stalls selling anime body pillow covers, mystery bags, animatronic furry tails, AI-generated art prints, and plastic toys aplenty. Amid a sea of half-baked cosplays and bored-looking event employees, I found none of my people; the gamers had failed to show out for EGX, what little of it there was.</p>



<h2 id="h-barely-an-expo">Barely an Expo</h2>



<p>The PR folks backing the event were offering me nothing but film and TV opportunities, and despite there being the likes of Troy Baker, Ben Starr, Chris Judge, Doug Cockle, Neil Newbon, and Elias Toufexis in attendance, nothing came up in a gaming capacity.</p>



<p>I made a conscious effort to request <strong>some kind of connection </strong>from the staff running the meet and greet area, and was palmed off with a ‘Sorry, they don’t have time for that,’ by a go-between messenger of an employee who failed to get me any traction from a nearby manager. I should stress that the manager who had ‘no time’ for me was plainly standing on the spot doing nothing.</p>



<figure><figcaption>You never know you’re in the good times <strong>when you’re in them</strong>. This was one of the first Eurogamer Expos in London</figcaption></figure>







<p>With no games to play, no big-named exhibitors occupying the show floor, and there being nothing in the way of gaming activations, I was reduced to wandering the stalls and trying to get excited about merchandise (spoiler alert: <strong>I didn’t</strong>).</p>



<p>The panels were visited by a half dozen people every time someone was on the stage, the security staff were lacklustre and weren’t doing their job properly, and the busiest portion of the event seemed to always be the ‘food court’.</p>



<p>I can see EGX vanishing entirely next year, and while MCM will persist, it too has been reduced to something almost unworthy of a spot in your calendar. All eyes are now on Gamescom, an utterly phenomenal event that continues to expand year after year. I’ve been to Gamescom twice and can stress that it’s the <strong>ultimate event </strong>in the world for gamers, and I just praise that it’s only a short flight away for me.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, gamers around the world can still enjoy events like Summer Game Fest, PAX, DreamHack, Tokyo Game Show, and other localized, regional events. If you want a regular expo in the UK, you’re out of luck and will need to travel.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite x South Park Collab Coming Soon, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-collab-coming-soon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-x-south-park-collab-coming-soon-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1335118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed that a Fortnite collaboration is coming with <strong>South Park</strong>, the animated show that has been running since the late 1990s. On social media, a claim emerged alongside a source, with the uploader suggesting that someone <strong>at Paramount </strong>corroborated the leak.</p>



<p>Fans quickly busied themselves imagining how it would work, given that South Park characters are fairly diminutive in stature and stand all of about a few feet tall.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-south-park-coming-to-fortnite">Is South Park Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://xcancel.com/SamLeakss/status/1982196155606786464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SamLeakss claimed</a> that South Park is coming to Fortnite in a crossover event.</p>



<p>Far from being the most unlikely thing in the world, players have accepted that this is gospel and have started assembling theories to explain how the collab would work. One user quickly shared an outfit that <strong>might just work</strong>:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Others suggested that Epic Games would be throwing Cartman into a Mech Suit, while others demanded the arrival of Mr. Hanky as a Back Bling item. Those familiar with the South Park universe pointed out that ‘anime versions’ of the characters could be used, but that’s perhaps a little too niche to be a commercial success.</p>



<p>We know nothing beyond the original claim, unfortunately.</p>



<p>In recent Fortnite news, it was revealed that the developers of the Roblox game ‘Steal a Brainrot’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steal-a-brainrot-developers-sue-fortnite-copycat/">are trying to sue</a> Fortnite UGC developers who have allegedly ripped off their creation. This is being taken pretty seriously, as Steal a Brainrot has become one of the most popular Roblox games in record time in recent months.</p>



<p>Also, <strong>The Simpsons </strong>are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-springfield-map-coming-crossover/">coming to Fortnite</a> with a themed map.</p>



<p>Do you want to see any particular South Park characters surface in this collaboration with Fortnite? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
