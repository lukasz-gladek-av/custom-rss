            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-has-set-another-new-all-time-peak-record-on-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 created two concurrent player peak records on Steam within a week, the latest one bringing the number to just under 100,000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just a week ago, Red Dead Redemption 2 hit a new all-time peak of 86,717 on Steam, beating the 2023 record of 77,655. The latest number has been topped, too. Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/red-dead-red-dead-redemption-2-player-surge-on-steam-rockstar-games-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, RDR 2 hit an all-time peak of 99,993 in the past 24 hours (at the time of writing), according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1174180/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. However, its new record is not even close to Rockstar’s 2013 hit title, GTA V, which managed to peak at 364,548 almost a decade ago and has brought in more than 200,000 players in the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what’s responsible for Red Dead Redemption 2 setting new player peak records on Steam? It’s none other than a discount, with Rockstar’s 2018 action-adventure game receiving a massive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redeption-2-breaks-steam-concurrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">75% discount</a> on the platform, bringing its price down to $15. Grabbing Red Dead Redemption 2 for this price is an absolute steal, and the sale is not limited to RDR 2. The Rockstar Games Steam Sale offers up to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/rockstarpublishersale2025?tab=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">80% discount on their games</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 features the most expansive and immersive open-world Rockstar has created, a world you could get lost in. If you don’t want to play the story, you can still get hours of content just by exploration, with each character in the open world having a new story and each corner opening a new secret. And that’s just one of the beauties of the games; the visuals, storytelling, character design and soundtrack of RDR 2 are second to none.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fromsoftware-is-%E2%80%98not-chasing-a-trend%E2%80%99-with-elden-ring-nightreign.1098504/</guid>

<p>FromSoftware recently explained how Elden Ring Nightreign is not following a trend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conversation with <a href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/az-magazines/6936639/pc-gamer-us-edition-magazine-subscription_.thtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-went-roguelike-as-the-focus-was-condensing-the-rpg-experience-down-not-because-fromsoftware-was-chasing-a-trend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>), the game director, Junya Ishizaki, revealed how they are treating Elden Ring Nightreign and why it isn’t following a trend. Ishizaki stated that the developers are focusing on “condensing the experience down”, which includes the RPG stuff, the open-world nature, character development, and levelling up. Their plan was for everything to come together and turn into “a boss fight but in a more concentrated form.”</p>



<p>The developers want to integrate a “new sense of accomplishment” not found in Elden Ring or other FromSoftware titles, along with “some new mechanics and some new elements” they can add to the game. They never really insisted on “let’s absolutely not do anything that other companies are doing or not follow any trends”; hence, they didn’t see Elden Ring Nightreign as “chasing a trend” but as elements that will work within their “multiplayer-focused session-based gameplay.”</p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign was revealed last year at The Game Awards as a spinoff co-op action-adventure game slated to release in 2025. The game will allow you to play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solo or as a trio</a> on a smaller map based on the Limgrave region, with randomised enemies for each playthrough. The title is arriving for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam.</p>



<p>In other news, Elden Ring Nightreign’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-will-have-a-network-test-starting-february-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">network test will be on February 14</a>.

<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket recently released a statement on the Trading Feature, accepting that the restrictions are preventing players from enjoying the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s new post on <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1885447974094070090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> discusses why trading features were implemented and the feedback it has received. The developers revealed that the “item requirements and restrictions” have been imposed so that players do not “abuse” the trading feature with bots or “other prohibited actions,” such as using multiple accounts. Their goal with these restrictions has been to provide a fair and balanced environment for the players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the Pokemon TCG Pocket developers have admitted that these trading restrictions haven’t hampered the player experience, and hence, they will introduce new changes. After the feedback, the developers are “actively investing ways to improve the feature to address these concerns” Moreover, they plan to introduce more channels for players to obtain trade tokens, “including through event distributions”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The comments section of this post is filled with players providing their opinions and solutions for Pokemon TCG Pocket’s trading restrictions. Some players have issues with the number of <a href="https://x.com/Lumix_Corrupt/status/1885448532187812345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trading tokens required to trade</a>; reducing them should be enough for the feature to be enjoyed. Others have stated they want other restrictions to be removed, too, such as allowing trading <a href="https://x.com/jedi_flodux/status/1885448458300948925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">between friends and non-friends</a>, trading cards of any rarity, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Sniper Elite Resistance’s base content isn’t enough, the Season Pass offers more stealth and sniping. It also brings back a familiar face seen throughout Sniper Elite’s DLC over the years. There’s plenty to admire about Resistance’s Season Pass, so let’s take you through it.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> DLC is forthcoming about what it provides. Unlike Sniper Elite’s various editions, there aren’t multiple Season Pass choices, just a standard set of new goodies. It’s a one-off transaction for a big bundle of new Sniper Elite content set to add many hours to its already generous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-sniper-elite-resistance-game-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game length</a>.</p>



<p>Whether you’re gripped by the tone of Harry Hawker’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-voices-harry-hawker-sniper-elite-resistance-voice-actors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voice actor</a> or need more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">missions</a>, the Season Pass has it all.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-sniper-elite-resistance-season-pass">Everything Included in Sniper Elite Resistance Season Pass</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We meet again. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Sniper Elite Resistance Season Pass includes new weapon and character skins, fresh guns, and four brand-new missions to complete.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick rundown of every piece of new content included in the Season Pass:</p>



<ul>
<li>1 Character Skin Packs.</li>



<li>3 Campaign Missions.</li>



<li>3 Weapon Packs.</li>



<li>3 Weapon Skin Packs.</li>



<li>Target Führer Campaign Mission—Lights, Camera, Achtung.</li>
</ul>



<p>There aren’t many specifics when it comes to the nature of the skins or weapons. However, thanks to the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3258690/Sniper_Elite_Resistance_Season_Pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Page</a>, we know to expect “A bolstered cache of authentic World War II weapons.”</p>



<p>Lights, Camera, Achtung is a day-one release. The series tradition of having a DLC mission where you kill Adolf Hitler makes a return. Infiltrate the German leader’s secure area and take him out in a variety of creative ways.</p>



<p>The rest of the content is expected to drop between “<strong>January—March 2025</strong>.” Many Season Passes and instances of post-launch content are dropped periodically in the months after release. So at least you don’t have to wait too long to get everything extra you’ve paid for! </p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-sniper-elite-resistance-season-pass">How Much is The Sniper Elite Resistance Season Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s $34.99 or £29.99 if you want the Sniper Elite Resistance Season Pass on your platform of choice.</strong></p>



<p>With Lights, Camera, Achtung, and an extra three missions on the way, this represents many hours of new content. Given Sniper Elite’s penchant for replayability, this DLC is sure to occupy your time.</p>



<p>Also, if you’re only interested in the Lights, Camera, Achtung Hitler mission, it’s available as a standalone purchase for <strong>$6.99</strong> or <strong>£5.79</strong>.</p>
