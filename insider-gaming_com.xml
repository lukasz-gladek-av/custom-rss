<p>Eclipse Glow Games has released an 11-minute gameplay walkthrough for Tides of Annihilation, which was unveiled this week at the State of Play showcase. Tides of Annihilation has been dubbed ‘Stellar Blade meets Elden Ring’, mostly by <strong>me</strong>. I was looped into the development of Tides of Annihilation last year and loved what I saw, and now it’s out there for everyone to admire.</p>



<p>It doesn’t have a release date, but when it drops, Tides of Annihilation will be available on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC platforms. </p>



<p>Check out the full gameplay walkthrough below.</p>

<p>Tides of Annihilation is an innovative and impressive game that has a relatively unique story. It tells the tale of Gwendolyn, one of the last survivors of humanity and a warrior battling to push back dark, otherworldly forces. To do this, she’ll lean on the spectral powers of ancient knights of Arthurian mythology, fighting alongside them in clashes with immense bosses.</p>



<p>It’s set in an apocalyptic rendition of London, and all the landmarks are front and centre for all to see. In that respect, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-annihilation-revealed-by-eclipse-glow-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s quite like Stellar Blade</a>, and the female protagonist with her undeniable sword-based skills adds further credence to that comparison.</p>



<p>Here’s the 11-minute gameplay walkthrough from Tides of Annihilation:</p>

<p>Tides of Annihilation promises to be a challenging game, but when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-annihilation-interview-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I interviewed the developer</a>, I learned that there will be accessibility considerations made for gamers who want an easier experience. I also learned that there will be extensive customisation opportunities in the game, with players tweaking Gwendolyn’s hair, makeup, outfits, and skill loadouts.</p>
