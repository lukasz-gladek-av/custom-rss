<p>Burnout fans will notice quite a few similarities with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wreckreation-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wreckreation</a> when they read the achievement list above. For example, Road Rage is a mode that originated in that series and involves you forcing the opposition to crash while speeding down the road.</p>



<p>Those similarities are not surprising, though, as the development team for Wreckreation, <a href="https://www.threefieldsentertainment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Three Fields Entertainment</a>, is made up of members from the original iteration of Criterion, who made the Burnout series that EA has completely forgotten about these days. They have developed Danger Zone and Dangerous Driving, which obviously have a lot of Burnout energy in them, and you see that even more now with Wreckreation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gregg Mayles, one of Rare’s longest-serving workers and co-creator of Banjo-Kazooie, is resigning from the company.</p>



<p>The legacy of Rare in the 1990s is beyond incredible. From massive hits like Battletoads and Banjo-Kazooie to Goldeneye and Donkey Kong Country, there was no studio quite like them. After being bought by Microsoft/Xbox in 2002, the company’s track record went a bit low, with success being less and less. Unfortunately, despite Sea of Thieves’ reputation, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rares-everwild-cancelled-amid-xbox-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent cancellation of Everwild</a> has left many dejected, with its director and former creative director now jumping ship.</p>



<h2 id="h-gregg-mayles-co-creator-of-banjo-kazooie-resigns-from-rare-after-everwild-cancellation">Gregg Mayles, Co-Creator of Banjo-Kazooie, Resigns From Rare After Everwild Cancellation</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today was my last day at <a href="https://twitter.com/RareLtd?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RareLtd</a>. Thanks to everyone who played and enjoyed any of the games I helped create while I was there. Also thanks to all the people that worked on the games alongside me. It seemed fitting that I should say farewell with one final rhyme! <a href="https://t.co/X54u8Bc2oI">pic.twitter.com/X54u8Bc2oI</a></p>— Gregg Mayles (@Ghoulyboy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ghoulyboy/status/1978112736270655778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ghoulyboy/status/1978112736270655778?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on Twitter/X</a>, Gregg Mayles announced his retirement from Rare. True to his form, his message is done in rhymes and can be seen above. For many, he crafted people’s childhoods in more ways than one. Mayles, as previously mentioned, co-created Banjo-Kazooie with his brother Steve Mayles at Rare. In addition, Mayles was responsible for designing games like Viva Pinata, Donkey Kong Country, Sea of Thieves, and Kinect Sports. He had also been Rare’s longest-serving worker, starting as a designer, director, and later studio creative director.</p>



<p>Sadly, his final piece of work would’ve been Rare’s Everwild, which he directed and designed. The title was canceled alongside Project Blackbird and Perfect Dark. Just last week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rare-cancelled-everwild-screenshots-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshots of the game</a> emerged, giving us a glimpse as to what could’ve been. With many of the original talents of Rare gone, the studio’s future is a bit uncertain, so hopefully, good will come. Though, with fans hungry for a new Banjo-Kazooie title, the news isn’t the most favorable.</p>

<p><strong>The Outer Worlds 2 full release date is on October 29, but anyone who </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-outer-worlds-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>pre-orders the Premium Edition</strong></a><strong> will be able to play the game five days early on October 24.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-outer-worlds-2-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers</a> will be able to download and play the game on that later date, but if they desire to play early and get all the rest of the content included in the Premium Edition, they can buy the $30 upgrade pack on the Xbox Store.</p>



<p>It might not be the perfect festive game for Halloween, but fans of the first game will hardly complain about being able to run around and mess with the various corporations and NPCs just before the holiday.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-exact-release-time-for-the-outer-worlds-2">Do We Know the Exact Release Time for The Outer Worlds 2?</h2>



<p><strong>According to the </strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6312-PPSA24588_00-0872768154966924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>PlayStation Store</strong></a><strong>, the standard edition of The Outer Worlds 2 will go live at 1 PM ET on October 29, so this version of the game will not have a midnight release. That is not the same for the early access players, who will be able to play starting at 12 AM ET on October 24.</strong></p>



<p>Here is a chart that will break down the starting times for the standard version of The Outer Worlds 2.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">The Outer Worlds 2 Standard Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM—October 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">12 PM—October 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM—October 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM—October 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT)</td><td data-align="center">4 AM—October 30</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The standard edition of The Outer Worlds 2 releasing at midday in the United States is definitely an odd time for the full game to release. Usually, even with games that have an early access period, they will become playable at either midnight Eastern Time or sometime in the morning. Having it set for the afternoon is definitely not the norm with big releases like this.</p>
