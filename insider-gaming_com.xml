<p>YAPYAP sold half 1 million games in its first week on the market.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/yapyap/" id="3501">YAPYAP,</a> a co-op horror game where players use microphones to cast magic spells and wreak havoc in enemy wizards’ towers, was released on Steam in early February 2026. Within a week of its release, the game had sold 500,000 copies. This is despite the game still smoothing out some rough edges.</p>



<h2 id="h-maison-bap-reacts-to-yapyap-s-major-milestone">Maison Bap Reacts to YAPYAP’s Major Milestone</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/maison-bap/" id="3502">Maison Bap</a>, the game’s publisher and developer, shared a message of gratitude upon reaching the milestone. They noted that over the coming weeks, they will continue to fix bugs and polish the game. They will then focus on additional content once all edges are smoothed.</p>



<p>“We also know many of you are eager to hear about future updates, but before jumping into new features and content, we want to make sure the game is fully stable and smooth for everyone. Once that’s locked in, we’ll start planning the fun stuff,” the team said in a message that was shared on Steam on February 9.</p>



<p>The game is still on a small introductory discount. It is currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3834090/YAPYAP/">Steam for $7.99.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega </a>says <span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/sonic-rumble/" target="_blank">Sonic Rumble</a>&nbsp;underperformed and that, overall, the value of the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/angry-birds/" target="_blank">Angry Birds</a>&nbsp;developer&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/rovio-entertainment/" target="_blank">Rovio&nbsp;</a>was written down, resulting in an impairment loss of more than</span> $200 million.</p>



<p>Sega Sammy Holdings Inc., Sega’s parent company, recently <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_q3_presentation_e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported its Q3 earnings</a> for fiscal year 2026. Noted in the earnings that, as it pertained to Rovio’s business, there was a recognized impairment loss of approximately 31.3 billion yen. As of this writing, that amounts to about $205 million.</p>



<p>Sega completed<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/angry-birds-acquisition/" id="6935"> its acquisition of Rovio</a> in August 2023.</p>







<h2 id="h-factors-surrounding-rovio-s-underperforming-quarter">Factors Surrounding Rovio’s Underperforming Quarter</h2>



<p>In the Q3 presentation, Sega attributes Rovio’s performance falling short of initial expectations to “rapid changes in the market environment and other factors.” One of those factors was the collaborative mobile title Sonic Rumble, which struggled to meet key performance indicators.</p>



<p>Moving forward, Sega plans to reverse this momentum by focusing specifically on Angry Birds and Sega IPs, including Sonic, for future games. They also see the release of the third Angry Birds movie, set for December, as another factor driving hopeful increased traction for the brand.</p>







<h2>The Future of Sonic</h2>



<p>Sonic Rumble, which is also available for free on Steam, may have underperformed, but the blue blur always bounces back. It’s Sonic’s 35th anniversary this year. So far, no official game releases have been scheduled in celebration, but the Sonic Team has put out a new audio drama in the Sonic universe. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-unveils-noir-sonic-audio-drama-the-chaotix-casefiles/" id="171225">here</a>.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the filings, Sega announced plans to make mainstay IPs a focus not just in mobile releases but also in traditional console releases. Read more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-plans-four-major-mainstay-ip-releases-in-next-fiscal-year/" id="176620">here</a>.</p>

<p>When Ubisoft announced that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake was canceled</a>, it was also revealed that five other games were ending. Insider Gaming has learned the six games that have been cancelled at Ubisoft.</p>



<p>First reported on Insider Gaming Weekly, Insider Gaming understands that the following six games were canceled:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</strong> – Canceled after being first announced in 2020.</li>



<li><strong>Project Ether</strong> – In development since 2019, which was canceled, but has morphed, in a way, into a newer project. Believed to have been in development at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-employees-unionized/" id="168333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Halifax</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Project Pathfinder </strong>– Known previously as Project U</li>



<li><strong>Project Crest</strong> – A World War 2 extraction shooter</li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Rebellion</strong> – Stopping support</li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Singularity </strong>– A new mobile Assassin’s Creed Game</li>
</ul>



<p>Along with the game cancellations that were previously announced—confirmed above—there was also a multiplayer Assassin’s Creed that had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-an-assassins-creed-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly been shuttered</a>. That game, however, isn’t a part of this group. </p>



<p>One game that is still coming is the Assassin’s Creed: Blag Flag Remake. The latest rumors suggest that a reveal will take place in April after being delayed out of the current fiscal year.</p>



<p>If you want to go directly to the moment in the show below, it takes place <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/rZcgQAfLRd4?si=k8dedz7N5aQ7E0D9&amp;t=3247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around the 54:07 mark</a>.</p>
