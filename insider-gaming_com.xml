<p>The principal game designer at DICE is asking players to share video examples of unexpectedly fast time-to-death (TTD) during the Battlefield 6 open beta. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6‚Äôs first open beta was a resounding success, becoming the franchise‚Äôs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-biggest-ever-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest open beta</a> yet and also beating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty‚Äôs concurrent record</a> on Steam. However, players encountered several bugs during the weekend, but nothing that couldn‚Äôt be fixed. The developers have already begun investigating BF6‚Äôs unexpectedly fast TTD bug. </p>







<p>Battlefield 6‚Äôs open beta is now over, and the developers have started addressing the bugs players encountered over the weekend. Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/as-the-dust-settles-on-battlefield-6s-first-beta-weekend-devs-confirm-theyre-looking-into-unexpectedly-fast-kill-times-in-the-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Florian Le Bihan posted on <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954811982399381685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) earlier today, informing players that the developers are already in the office reviewing BF6‚Äôs open beta feedback. Soon after, Le Bihan posts <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954828663825817791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">again</a>, asking players to share video examples of suspected super bullet / unexpectedly fast TTD‚Äù they might have experienced during the Battlefield 6 Open Beta. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If some of you have some video examples of suspected super bullet / unexpectedly fast TTD that you've recorded in the Battlefield 6 Open Beta ‚Äì send my way üôÇ</p>‚Äî Florian ‚Äì DRUNKKZ3 (@DRUNKKZ3) <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954828663825817791?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Many players shared video examples, and others shared their experiences in reply. One player <a href="https://x.com/Mokonoise/status/1954848559708221684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> videos of two such instances: one where they were fighting under cover and were shot down instantly, and another where they took delayed damage after downing an enemy. For those unaware, TTD or time-to-death refers to the duration it takes for the player to die after taking damage. </p>

<p>Pok√©mon is something I‚Äôve never fully grasped, but I can certainly appreciate the concept of a collector‚Äôs mindset. For decades, Pok√©mon players have hunted prestigious cards, either to bolster their collection or to sell on the open market, but some might not be aware of what they have in their deck.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the Pok√©mon World Championship in California, a little research was put together to outline the super rare Pok√©mon cards that players might be unwittingly sitting on.</p>



<p>Do you have any of these cards?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-most-expensive-original-pokemon-card">What‚Äôs The Most Expensive Original Pok√©mon Card?</h2>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.pinnacle.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Pinnacle</a>, a combination of resale data, keyword trends, and geographical aggregates was used to identify the most expensive original Pok√©mon cards by market value and popularity.</p>



<p>At the top of the table sat the Gyrados Star card from the Holon Phantoms category, worth an estimated $2,000. This Gold Star card is one of the most searched-for items amongst Pok√©mon collectors, particularly those in California and Texas.</p>



<p>The second most expensive original Pok√©mon card is Mewtwo, from the Base Set Shadowless category. This card commands a price of around $900, and it‚Äôs one of the super rare Pok√©mon cards you might have lingering in a binder somewhere.</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs Pinnacle‚Äôs data from the top ten most expensive original Pok√©mon cards:</p>



<ol>
<li>Gyrados Star (Holon Phantoms) ‚Äì $1,999</li>



<li>Mewtwo (Base Set Shadowless) ‚Äì $900</li>



<li>Venusaur (Base Set Shadowless) ‚Äì $793</li>



<li>Rocket‚Äôs Snorlax Ex (Team Rocket Returns) ‚Äì $595</li>



<li>Sabrina‚Äôs Gengar (Gym Heroes) ‚Äì $579</li>



<li>Charizard (Base Set) ‚Äì $455</li>



<li>Charizard (Base Set Shadowless) ‚Äì $420</li>



<li>Dark Charizard (Team Rocket) ‚Äì $386</li>



<li>Rocket‚Äôs Mewtwo (Gym Challenge) ‚Äì ¬£336</li>



<li>Charizard (Base Set 2) ‚Äì $311</li>
</ol>



<p>To get this list, Pinnacle used a seed list of the most valuable Pok√©mon cards, then combined that with the current market price (fluctuations can happen) and keyword data from Google to produce the ranking. </p>



<p>Do you have any of these cards in your collection? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
