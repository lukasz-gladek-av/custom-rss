<p>Resident Evil Requiem offers different difficulty options, which are slightly different from what you’d expect from the difficulty settings in recent Resi games. If you’re having a hard time deciding between the two concerning your playthrough, this guide has everything you need to know.</p>



<p>You know how difficulty settings usually go in these games: Easy, Normal, Hard, and then a harder variant once you complete the game. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> borrows one of its most iconic game mechanics to present a headache.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-the-difference-between-classic-amp-modern-difficulty-settings-in-resident-evil-requiem">What’s The Difference Between Classic &amp; Modern Difficulty Settings in Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An age-old classic. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The main difference between Normal and Classic difficulty in Resident Evil Requiem is that you need to find and use Ink Ribbons to save in Classic Mode when using Grace, with limited autosaves, whereas Normal will use a traditional save system.</strong></p>



<p>Ah, Ink Ribbons…the suspenseful and unusual resource that makes you question whether you <em>really </em>need to save in Resident Evil games.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Resident Evil Requiem On Xbox Game Pass?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>They first appeared in the debut Resident Evil game and became a staple of the gameplay for a few years. They have largely been neglected now in favor of modern save systems, but Requiem is bringing them back, to an extent.</p>



<p>Capcom’s RESIDENT EVIL Showcase revealed that multiple difficulties were available, with Normal and Classic being the focal point of your first playthrough options—along with a Casual mode for those seeking an easier challenge.</p>



<p>Here’s the description for each. Expect there to be another one or two harder settings once you finish the main game.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Resident Evil Requiem Difficulty Setting</th><th data-align="center">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Casual</td><td data-align="center">“Relax while enjoying the story and puzzles.”</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Standard (Modern)</td><td data-align="center">“A balanced experience of suspense and accomplishment at the standard difficulty found among modern Resident Evil games.<p>This game mode can be changed to Casual on the game over screen.”</p></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Standard (Classic)</td><td data-align="center">“A traditional experience with a difficulty similar to classic Resident Evil games. Recommended for long-term fans of the series.<p>Autosaves during Grace’s gameplay are limited and ink ribbons are required to save.”</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<h2 id="h-should-you-choose-classic-or-modern-in-resident-evil-requiem">Should You Choose Classic or Modern in Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Choices. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As Capcom suggests, the difficulty depends on three factors: If you just want to and enjoy the game and story with few to no deaths, if you like a normal challenge, or if you enjoy the suspense of archaic Resi gameplay with limited resources.</strong></p>



<p>Personally, we are long-time Resident Evil fans, so the Standard (Classic) is the obvious choice.</p>

</ul>



<p>If you’re a newcomer, then Standard (Classic) might be better, and Casual is for those new to horror games, or like the genre but are threatened by them, or if you want to blitz through and lap up the story beats.</p>

<p>Nostalgia for Pokémon fans is through the roof ahead of Pokémon Day 2026, with a slew of news set to be announced, and the re-release of Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green on Nintendo Switch platforms is on the horizon.</p>



<p>22 years after an initial release, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green are coming to both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> as re-releases. Unlike other classic games, these will be a separate purchase and won’t be included with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online/" id="1413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch Online</a> membership.</p>



<p>If you’re already counting down the hours until you can explore the Kanto region again, Insider Gaming has all the details on the release date and launch times.</p>

<p><strong>Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green will be released on Nintendo Switch systems on Friday, February 27, landing as part of the Pokémon</strong> <strong>Day celebrations.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-release-for-switch-next-week/" id="178067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of the re-release</a> of the titles originally released on Game Boy Advance two decades ago came a week ahead of their release. It was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-return-teased-by-leaker/" id="175794" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously leaked</a> that the titles would be made available again.</p>

</ul>



<p>Full Pokémon Home connectivity will be added to the titles at a later date, increasing the number of available Pokémon in the game. In the original release, players could transfer Pokémon from other titles like Gold, Silver, Emerald, Ruby, and Sapphire.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear when Pokémon Home functionality will be available, and whether previous events in the game will be made available.</p>

<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green will be released on Nintendo Switch platforms following the conclusion of the Pokémon Presents showcase on February 27.</strong></p>



<p>No precise time for the drop has been shared, and it’s not clear if the titles will be immediately available after the conclusion of the showcase. However, if they’re not available as soon as the show ends, it’s likely to only be a short wait until they’re in the store.</p>

            <guid>1441597</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Styx: Blades of Greed dropped <strong>yesterday</strong>, presenting players with a stealth-driven, goblin-backed adventure packed with brutal kills, open environments, and quips from a protagonist accurately described as ‘caustic’.</p>



<p>In the reviews surfacing online, Styx has been doing very well for itself, earning decent scores from critics. It’s the third game in the series, which emerged in 2014 with Styx: Master of Shadows. In a recent post on social media, the developers took the opportunity to throw shade at competing franchises based on the positivity surrounding the launch of Blades of Greed.</p>







<h2 id="h-pay-attention-assassin-s-creed">Pay Attention, Assassin’s Creed</h2>



<p>Styx: Blades of Greed was given a positive review by Eurogamer, and the social team at Cyanide Studio took it upon themselves to go on the offensive against other developers. Of course, it’s all in the character of Styx himself, a volatile goblin prone to self-deprecation, harsh humor, and sarcastic one-liners.</p>



<p>When news of the positive reviews hit the airwaves, Cyanide went straight to social media, calling out Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed brand:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It didn’t end there. One user asked what Styx would do when faced with the ‘GOAT Sam Fisher’, the frontman of the legendary Splinter Cell series, arguably the most iconic stealth shooter ever made.</p>



<p>In response, the team at Cyanide simply wrote, ‘Sam Fisher stays in the shadows.’</p>



<p>It got a bit close to the wire when someone asked them to comment in French, so Ubisoft could ‘understand properly,’ and the social team wrote:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Styx has also openly challenged the likes of Agent 47 and Big Boss, which is ambitious.</p>







<p>Have you played Styx: Blades of Greed? Is the game good enough to warrant the arrogance from the developer’s social media team? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>1441552</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A dataminer has seemingly found links to the next game in the series in the God of War: Ragnarok files, which mention Athena and an Egyptian cat. </p>



<p>Since the announcement of the God of War <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trilogy Remake</a> and the insider talks about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/santa-monica-developing-more-than-just-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Santa Monica’s other game</a>, fans have been eagerly waiting for the next announcement. Many think it will be God of War in Egypt; however, we haven’t received confirmation for that yet. Now, some details about the next God of War game have surfaced online. </p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-ragnarok-sequel-appears-to-have-references-to-athena-and-egypt">God of War Ragnarok Sequel Appears to Have References to Athena and Egypt</h2>



<p>A new post on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWarRagnarok/comments/1r986bw/found_athena_cutscene_and_atreus_in_his_travels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GodofWarRagnarok</a> subreddit discusses the datamine related to the next game. It seems this user found hidden content in God of War 2018 that turned out to be the beginning of Ragnarok (Atreus killing the bear, finding Tyr). Now, the user has found hidden content in Ragnarok’s files that could be part of the next game. </p>



<p>The datamined content includes a cutscene featuring Athena discussing Atreus and Odin. The Greek Goddess of Wisdom is apparently also referenced as the ‘Robed One’ in this cutscene. Athena’s dialogues are “To lefkó fídi tha se fáei,” which is Greek for “The white snake will eat you,” and “One failed us. One rejected us,” probably referencing Odin failing the ones from the higher plane and Atreus rejecting the mask.</p>



<p>There’s also a cutscene for Atreus, where he talks to a character called ‘Mau’. Mau is also a cat in Egyptian, and “one of the manifestations of the Sun God Ra.” The Mau character is like Groot from the MCU: he only says ‘I am Groot’. Mau only says ‘mau’, but Atreus seems to understand what he means. Check out the conversations below: </p>



<h4 id="h-athena-cutscene">Athena Cutscene: </h4>



<ul>
<li>Robed Figure: “<strong><em>To lefkó fídi tha se fáei</em></strong>.”</li>



<li>Robed Figure: “<strong><em>One failed us. One rejected us</em></strong>.”</li>



<li>Athena: “<strong><em>We have a problem</em></strong>.”</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-atreus-and-mau-cutscene">Atreus and Mau Cutscene: </h4>



<ul>
<li>Atreus: “<em><strong>Wake up. I think we’re close</strong></em>.”</li>



<li>Mau: “<strong><em>Mau?</em></strong>“</li>



<li>Atreus: “<strong><em>Hey, you insisted on coming along. C’mon, let’s have a look</em></strong>.”</li>



<li>Mau: “<strong><em>Mau</em></strong>.”</li>



<li>Atreus: “<strong><em>I hope you’re right. Sounds like we found it</em></strong>.”</li>
</ul>







<p>Readers should take this information with a grain of salt and wait for official confirmation from Santa Monica to know for sure. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hurricane Map Condition In ARC Raiders Shrouded Sky, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hurricane-map-condition-in-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-explained/</link>
            <guid>1441540</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Shrouded Sky is bringing a lot of new content to ARC Raiders, but one of the highlights is undoubtedly the Hurricane map Condition. These are a key part of what keeps ARC Raiders feeling fresh and exciting, as some of them can fundamentally change how a map is played. </p>







<p>Some of the Map Conditions can be minor, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bird City</a>, but it seems like the Hurricanes are set to make some big changes when they roll through the maps. If you’re wondering what’s on the way with the Hurricanes, as well as what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> maps they’re playable on, then you’re in the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-maps-are-hurricanes-on-in-arc-raiders">What Maps Are Hurricanes On In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t get swept away! Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, it hasn’t been officially announced which maps the new Hurricane Map Condition will be playable on, but the teaser trailer provides a few clues.</strong></p>



<p>During the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition" id="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a>, the iconic Spaceport tower is clearly visible, indicating that the Hurricane will be playable on that map, but the rest of the footage is notably dark and unclear. Whilst that might replicate the visibility issues during the Hurricane, it makes it harder to figure out what maps are being played on. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders Shrouded Sky Release Date &amp; Start Times—All Content, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>However, from what little can be seen, it appears that Dam Battlegrounds will be another playable map that features the new Map Condition, and maybe even The Blue Gate. They seem to be safe guesses, as both maps feature prominent overground areas, and a Hurricane hitting Buried City might be thematically inappropriate, whilst Stella Montis would simply be unfeasible.</p>



<p>Once <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/embark-studios/" id="96820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embark Studios</a> officially reveals which maps the Hurricane Map Condition will be playable on, Insider Gaming will be sure to update this article with more certain clarity.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-changes-will-the-hurricane-map-condition-make-in-arc-raiders">What Changes Will The Hurricane Map Condition Make In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to extract? Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Hurricane Map Condition will make numerous changes to ARC Raiders, with the key ones being impacted visibility and flying debris that can damage shields. </strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/">ARC Raiders Event Tracker—Every Map Condition Schedule</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s every change coming to ARC Raiders during the Hurricane Map Condition:</p>







<h3 id="h-wind">Wind</h3>



<p>Perhaps the most prominent feature of the Hurricane Map Condition is that raiders will have to battle unrelenting winds as they explore topside. They’re not just for show, however, as they’ll directly hinder movement and the trajectory of thrown items like grenades. Even smoke, gas, and jumping will be impacted by the Hurricane, so it’s important to plan your movements carefully.</p>



<h3 id="h-debris">Debris</h3>



<p>The winds don’t just impact raiders, though, as they’ll also kick up debris from the surface, which spells bad news for your shield. When hit by debris, your shield will glitch and degrade, both making you more visible to other raiders and lowering your chances of surviving many gunfights. It seems that when navigating the Hurricanes, it might be best to take off your shield, though you’ll be far more susceptible to a raider ambush.</p>



<h3 id="h-visibility">Visibility</h3>



<p>Clouds hang low during the Hurricanes, making topside almost unrecognisable. Vision will be limited, as will be your hearing, thanks to the howls of the winds. However, it doesn’t have to be all bad news, as you’re more than welcome to use it to your advantage too—just don’t walk headfirst into an obscured ARC.</p>



<h3 id="h-first-wave-caches">First Wave Caches</h3>



<p>Everyone’s always on the lookout for loot in ARC Raiders, and it looks like the Hurricanes will unearth some forgotten treasures. First Wave Caches can be found during the Hurricanes, as these First Wave relics have resurfaced due to the powerful winds. It seems like good loot can be found in these, so it might be worth weathering the storm after all. </p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem copies are in the wild, and Capcom has now promised to take action against the people posting any gameplay videos. </p>



<p>Capcom’s Resident Evil Requiem is one of the developer’s biggest releases of the year, and they are committed to preserving the experience for fans. While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-will-have-3-playable-characters-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks</a> prior to official reveals and announcements typically reveal only limited details about the game, the physical copies being shared earlier are spoiling content for players.</p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-spoilers-are-already-online">Resident Evil Requiem Spoilers Are Already Online</h2>



<p>Capcom released a new statement on the BIO_OFFICIAL <a href="https://x.com/BIO_OFFICIAL/status/2024787173917249896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) regarding actions against individuals who spoil content from Resident Evil Requiem. The developers acknowledged that a significant number of gameplay videos have surfaced, which they believe were obtained illegally. They have requested that players who have access to the content or the game refrain from posting it online.</p>



<p>The developers have stated that posting these videos is not only a copyright infringement but also an offense against their customers. As a result, they will take firm action, such as deleting these videos and issuing warnings to users who engage in this activity. The developers aim to deliver a story that intertwines mystery and tension, providing a thrilling gaming experience that challenges players with unknown threats. They don’t want this experience to be spoiled for their audience.</p>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 20, 2026, Quordle is the #1488 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 20.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>
