            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-game-of-the-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When it comes to video games, 2024 wasn’t just another year. It truly was a standout year for games over the last decade. Yes, we’ve heard that sentiment before, but this time it felt different. This year brought a wave of incredible experiences, with something for everyone. From the smallest indie gems to blockbuster AAA titles, the gaming landscape was full of great titles.</p>



<p>Games like Helldivers 2, Balatro, Black Myth: Wukong, and STALKER 2 dominated conversations at various points throughout the year. But one game managed to capture the hearts of the Insider Gaming community above all others. That game, and the Insider Gaming Community’s 2024 Game of the Year, is Astro Bot. </p>



<p>In a tightly-contested vote on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>, the race came down to two favorites: Astro Bot and Balatro. In the end, Astro Bot edged out the poker-themed roguelike, claiming 37% of the vote compared to Balatro’s 33%.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-makes-astro-bot-so-special">What Makes Astro Bot So Special?</h3>



<p>This isn’t just another <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/astro-bot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">3D platformer</a>; it’s a love letter to PlayStation’s legacy. With stunning visuals steeped in nostalgia, Astro Bot takes you on a journey through PlayStation’s storied history. Its level designs are masterfully varied, ensuring that no two stages ever feel the same.</p>



<p>From a gameplay perspective, it’s pure fun and, arguably, the most enjoyable 3D platforming experience on PlayStation since the early days of Crash Bandicoot or Spyro. The game is packed with inventive mechanics, each one thoughtfully designed to keep things fresh. Whether you’re wielding Aloy’s bow or transforming into a sponge to soak up water and grow in size, every moment feels like a perfect fit for the worlds Team Asobi created. Importantly, nothing is overused, so the game always feels engaging and never overstays its welcome.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-return-to-gaming-s-roots">A Return to Gaming’s Roots</h3>



<p>But what truly sets Astro Bot apart is the way it makes you feel. It’s a throwback to the golden age of gaming—a traditional 3D platformer without the clutter of microtransactions or overwhelming bloat. It’s just long enough to satisfy, but never so drawn out that it becomes a slog. Playing Astro Bot feels like revisiting the essence of what made so many of us fall in love with video games in the first place. Even the game’s soundtrack evokes a feeling of yesteryear while still feeling fresh and modern.</p>



<p>Do you agree with Astro Bot as the Game of the Year, or is there another 2024 standout that stole your heart? Let us know down below, and join the conversation in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/half-life-3-has-moved-to-its-next-stage-of-playtesting/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The highly anticipated Half-Life 3 has moved to its next round of playtesting, it has been claimed.</p>



<p>That’s according to Gabe Follower, who has a history of leaking similar information on previous Valve titles, most notably Deadlock last year.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP9JgtJPzbI&amp;ab_channel=GabeFollower" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gabe Follower</a>, his sources have revealed that HLX (Half-Life 3) started playtests for Family and Friends of Valve developers in the past few months. </p>



<p>While the information doesn’t give us much information into what Half-Life 3 entails, it does tell us that the project is now at a fundamental stage of development and could see the game delayed further if it does not resonate well with the new playtests. </p>



<p>Previously, Valve delayed Half Life Alyx, its VR game, for one year to re-write the story. Deadlock, Valve’s upcoming team-based multiplayer shooter, also saw several delays due to feedback during these sessions. </p>



<p>The playtests do tell us that Half-Life 3 could be nearing its announcement soon, though, presumably sometime during 2025. If not, well, it’s entirely possible that the game could leak online due to the game now being accessed by more people.</p>



<p>As for when Half-Life 3 will be released, it remains to be seen, but Gabe Follower’s claims suggest that the game is progressing well.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Half-Life 3? Let us know down below and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/our-path-of-exile-2-class-tier-list-in-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-path-of-exile-2-class-tier-list-in-early-access.1071168/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/our-path-of-exile-2-class-tier-list-in-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Path of Exile 2 has six classes available, with another six coming as the game progresses. There will be 12 classes and 36 ascendancies in due time, making it a genuinely expansive game with countless hours of playtime available. But for now, you’re limited to a few starting classes. Here’s the thing, though. They rock! At least in our opinion. </p>



<p>So we decided to rank them all with a Path of Exile 2 class tier list for Early Access!</p>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-s-best-classes-ranked-this-is-totally-our-opinion">Path of Exile 2’s Best Classes Ranked (This is Totally Our Opinion!)</h2>



<p>First and foremost, let’s get this out of the way. Yes, you will have your own tier list, and we’d love to hear which classes you place in S-Tier in the comments below. Do you disagree with us? Let us know! We love discussing our favorite games, especially when you bring them to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>



<h3 id="h-s-tier-classes">S-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>The <strong>Mercenary </strong>is the big new class available in Path of Exile 2, and after playing through the entire campaign with one, I can attest to its strength. You can turn the crossbow into a close-quarters shotgun and lob grenades with reckless abandon. It’s a fun, powerful class capable of downing most bosses in the game.</p>



<p>Following that, we have the <strong>Witch </strong>with its powerful summons and the <strong>Monk </strong>with its creative abilities and fast, hard-hitting martial arts capable of making quick work of most enemies.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Mercenary</strong></li>



<li><strong>Witch</strong></li>



<li><strong>Monk</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-a-tier-classes">A-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>You can solo the entirety of Path of Exile 2 with the <strong>Ranger</strong>, so long as you have the proper equipment. A powerful bow will take you far. As for the <strong>Sorceress</strong>, the right build and an occasional helping hand in defeating some of the more challenging bosses in the game, which you can ask for in the global chat, push both classes into A-Tier.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ranger</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sorceress</strong></li>
</ul>







<h3 id="h-b-tier-classes">B-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>From firsthand experience, the <strong>Warrior</strong> has the potential to be potent against mobs and ranged bosses, but it’s a slow class to start with. If you have the patience to stick with the brute force of a club-wielding monster, you’ll find a powerful class capable of tanking enemies, but one that excels with a group, like a Sorceress or Ranger.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Warrior</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>No matter when you dive into Path of Exile 2, chances are you want to know about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-path-of-exile-2-become-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game going free-to-play</a>, right? Then, you can finally convince your friends to play!</p>

<p>The biggest Nintendo Switch games arriving in 2025 are sure to occupy your free time, and we’ve handpicked the best exclusives and some interesting third-party titles to look out for.</p>



<p>My Nintendo Switch hasn’t seen as much action in 2024—dare I say, it’s gathered a bit of dust. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-princess-peach-showtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Princess Peach Showtime</a>, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-vs-donkey-kong-princess-peach-showtime-sold-over-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario vs. Donkey Kong</a> haven’t scratched the itch, and there seems to be a bigger emphasis on remakes and remasters. Talk of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> continues to intensify, and it feels like a necessary step to bring more impressive exclusives and power-sapping third-party games.</p>



<p>2025 is ignoring this notion for now though, because it has some juicy Nintendo Switch games lined up. Forgotten sequels and big franchise sequels are also lined up, so let’s take a look.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-games-coming-in-2025">Nintendo Switch Games Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>Nintendo Directs and other presentations are almost certain to deliver shock announcements. Expect surprises and shadow drops throughout 2025, but for now, these games we know are pretty much locked in for 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Darn those Space Pirates. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>A torrid development period stunted <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-announced-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4</a>‘s progress. With the success of Metroid Prime Remastered in the distance now, the Nintendo community is clamoring for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Its reintroduction and long-awaited gameplay debut in 2024 reminded everyone why it’s so hyped. Samus is back with her trusty weapons, battling more Metroids and Space Pirates, all to another funky soundtrack. This could be Nintendo’s biggest ace up its sleeve, so here’s hoping it meets its announced 2025 release window.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Pokémon is the gift that keeps giving. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-releasing-worldwide-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> is the follow-up to 2022’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and it seems to be an entirely new story. The island of Hokkaido is replaced by a more populated and livelier Lumiose City. A single trailer is all we have, and even though it’s quite vague—we’re interested. I love Arceus, and it’s mostly what I’m looking for in a modern Pokémon game. But its sometimes empty and barren world—and lack of Trainer battles—left a gaping hole. Here’s hoping Pokemon Legends: Z-A can deliver, and bring an improved performance compared to the technical mishaps of Scarlet and Violet.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Puzzle galore. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>It feels like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-pre-orders-are-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> makes many of our fun 2025 lists—because Donkey Kong is fun. So much so, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a simple remaster, adding new content, but keeping the authentic feel of the Wii original. You’re assured of platforming paradise with more than a hint of a challenge. We’re ready for its bongo beats and banana stylings and it’s one of the first major games to hit the Switch in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A whole world to see. Credit to Monolith Soft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Xenoblade Chronicles has been a tremendously successful franchise for Nintendo. So much so spin-offs have sprouted from the main franchise, and the Wiiu was treated to Xenoblade Chronicles X in 2015. Like Donkey Kong: Country Returns—and countless other Wii and WiiU games, Nintendo has wanted to bring X to the Switch and is finally doing so with Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition. It’s an intense, JRPG encouraging you to explore its vast world, do important work for the BLADE organization, and fight waves of human enemies and titanic wild foes.</p>



<h3 id="h-civilization-7">Civilization 7</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What are you looking at? Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’m not partial to Civ games—or strategy titles in general—but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Civilization 7</a> is a massive third-party entry on this list, with the series <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-civilization-series-has-sold-33-million-copies-since-it-debuted-in-1991#:~:text=In%20total%2C%20there%20have%20been%2066%20versions%20of,were%20copies%20of%20Civilization%205%20plus%20the%20expansions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">estimated to have sold well over 30 million copies</a>. The traditional fare of world-building through different periods of human history is all here. You’re posed with events and decisions guaranteed to affect your world’s version of reality and history, and it’s important your thinking cap is on when deciding the fate of the human race!</p>



<h3 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Another round of horror awaits. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Little Nightmares saga is not for the faint-hearted. It inspires a new type of unsettling horror that low-budget jumpscare titles can only dream of. Little Nightmares features a new story, fresh, poor unwitting children, and the acclaimed addition of co-op. The second character can be computer-controlled, or you can invite a friend along to lap up the terror with you. It’s an IP going from strength to strength, and I’m expecting bad dreams to abound as a direct result of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’m hopeful of a Nintendo Switch 2 announcement in 2025, and if it happens, what games do you want to see? A new 3D Mario game? The next Zelda? Let us know your gaming desires.</p>
