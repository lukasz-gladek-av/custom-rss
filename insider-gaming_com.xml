<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has a release date for the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>On Thursday, it was announced that the latest game in the long-running Ubisoft series will come to Nintendo’s latest console on December 2. Its launch marks the first time a current Assassin’s Creed game will release on Nintendo Hardware. </p>



<p>“Experience Feudal Japan as shinobi Naoe or samurai Yasuke while enjoying cross-progression and touchscreen support on all menus,” the announcement reads.</p>



<p>The game will cost $59.99 and will come with all post-launch updates included. The recently released Claws of Awaji DLC, which adds roughly 10 hours of content for players, will come to the platform early next year. </p>

<p>Earlier rumors suggested a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-release-date-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 5 release</a> date for the game. That would’ve seen the game release on Friday of the same week as opposed to Tuesday. Turns out, however, Ubisoft wanted the game out a few days earlier.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Counter-Strike 2 fans worldwide are ruing a recent change made by Valve that has drastically impacted the CS skins market. In an update to how players can obtain and trade Counter-Strike skins, Valve has made it so that players can offer up five Covert-quality skins for a <strong>guaranteed knife </strong>or <strong>pair of gloves</strong>. Before the update, these were some of the most valuable items on the market.</p>



<p>This tweak to the pre-existing trade-up system has meant that items once considered rare and expensive have crashed in value, slicing some players’ inventories a considerable amount.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-did-valve-destroy-the-skins-market">Why Did Valve Destroy The Skins Market?</h2>



<p>Valve has long had a tentative relationship with the wider skins market. The nature of the market has lent itself to some dubious practices rising in recent years, especially around the concepts of skin gambling and off-platform trading.</p>



<p>The most valuable Counter-Strike skins can run up price tags in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and private collectors have parted ways with that much without thinking about it. That might be about to change, thanks to an update made by Valve that caused the skins market value to shatter, dropping by $2 billion overnight.</p>



<p>Valve has made these changes to shift market dynamics, rebalance the economy, make high-tier items much more attainable, and potentially even <strong>democratize </strong>rare cosmetics. Covert skins will now have their prices skyrocket as knife and glove prices, some of the highest in the game, will deflate.</p>



<p>Overnight, some of the most valuable knife and glove prices in Counter-Strike 2 dropped by as much as 40%. The hit caused the overall market cap for Counter-Strike skins to collapse in on itself. Before the change, the skins market was estimated to be worth as much as <strong>$5 billion</strong>.</p>



<p>For some, it’s a critical change that has drastic financial implications, especially for those who were HODLing their skins and weathering the market. For others, it’s a healthy correction that could make the cosmetic market in Counter-Strike 2 a little more accessible.</p>



<p>From a competitive perspective, this could have a knock-on impact on sponsorships, special events, and streamers opening cases and such to keep their community engaged.</p>



<p>Do you think this change was worth the hit, or should Valve rethink this action? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 surpassed PlayStation 3’s lifetime sales in the US in September 2025. </p>



<p>The PlayStation 5 has been a smash hit for Sony, with the console still accounting for a significant share of hardware sales. This is why the developers keep working on the console and its iterations, releasing slim versions and mid-gen upgrades for the consoles. Thanks to their efforts, the console has now crossed PlayStation 3’s sales record. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-playstation-5-now-sits-above-ps3-and-ps4-in-us-sales">The PlayStation 5 Now Sits Above PS3 and PS4 in US Sales</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poor-old-playstation-3-the-ps5-has-just-overtaken-its-lifetime-sales-in-the-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the new information about PlayStation 5 beating PS3 comes from a senior director at Circana, Mat Piscatella. Piscatella’s recent post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3ry7dpojc2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BlueSky</a> reveals that, based on US Video Game data through September 2025, the PlayStation 5 has now surpassed the PlayStation 3 in lifetime installed base. The analyst also revealed that PS5 has been ahead of PS4 on a time-aligned basis in the US for a very long time, and as of September, it is ahead by 4.6%. </p>







<h2 id="h-ghost-of-yotei-s-sales-performance-was-basically-flat-to-that-of-ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Yotei’s Sales Performance Was “Basically Flat to that of Ghost of Tsushima”</h2>



<p>Talking about sales, Mat Piscatella also shared some facts about Sony PlayStation’s latest game release, Ghost of Yotei. Piscatella revealed that with just one week in the market, “the US sales performance of Ghost of Yotei was basically flat to that of Ghost of Tsushima. It did great.” </p>



<p>The analyst added that Ghost of Tsushima launched in 2020, when the PS4’s installed base was significantly higher than the PS5’s installed base today. Additionally, there was a lot of stuff happening at the time that “significantly boosted gaming.” So, “anyone with ‘concern’ about this title should be looked at with a side eye,” concluded Piscatella. </p>

<p>The console wars are quickly becoming a thing of the past—if they’re not dead already. But Xbox’s President coming out and saying that Xbox exclusives, and the idea in general, are becoming antiquated, shows the direction the industry is moving towards.</p>



<p>Xbox’s strategies and ideologies are a shadow of what they were 20, 10, or even five years ago. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a> was dominating the gaming landscape in the mid-00s to late-00s, and had a myriad of exclusive franchises at its disposal: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-virtuos-studio-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo</a>, Gears of War, Forza, and others. Now, almost all of these have appeared on PlayStation at some point or another, and Sarah Bond thinks this is what people want.</p>

<p>Now, you could argue that we’ve all wanted to be able to play every game on the same console for decades, as it would save a lot of money. But business is business at the end of the day. With the gaming business, in particular, changing, Xbox President Sarah Bond’s words (via <a href="https://mashable.com/article/interview-president-xbox-sarah-bond-rog-xbox-ally-future-console-exclusives?_gl=1*63mw61*_up*MQ..*_ga*NzIwODYzMTIzLjE3NjEyMjcyNzQ.*_ga_8TEVGCYPY5*czE3NjEyMjcyNzckbzEkZzAkdDE3NjEyMjcyNzckajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mashable</a>) sound as prophetic as ever:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’re really seeing people evolve way past that. The biggest games in the world are available everywhere. You look at&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>, you look at&nbsp;Minecraft, you look at&nbsp;Fortnite, you look at&nbsp;Roblox. That’s actually what’s really driving community in gaming. That’s where people gather, and they have experiences. And the idea of locking it to one store or one device is antiquated for most people. You want to be able to play with your friends anywhere, regardless of what they’re on. And we’re really leaning into that with this experience.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is true and accurate to a certain degree. The lines between PlayStation and Xbox are as blurred as they’ve ever been. On the other hand, we can confidently predict you’ll never see Mario or Zelda anywhere near a PlayStation or Xbox console.</p>



<p>Still, there’s been a definite changing of the guard in recent years, and while Sony can still afford to release exclusives for PS5 users, it’s becoming more clear and obvious that Microsoft and Xbox’s goal posts are moving by the day.</p>



<p>Do you agree with Xbox’s President on exclusives? Is a day coming when there will be no exclusives, maybe apart from on a Nintendo device?
