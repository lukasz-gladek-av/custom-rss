<p>A long-time <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> employee has taken to social media to claim that he has been placed on an unpaid disciplinary suspension for comments regarding the recent return-to-office mandates.</p>







<p>Posting on LinkedIn, David Michaud-Cromp, who has worked at Ubisoft for more than 13 years, says the company notified him that he would receive a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension.</p>



<p>According to Michaud-Cromp, the suspension, which is set to start tomorrow, was issued in response to public comments he made about Ubisoft’s return-to-office policy and an “alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.”</p>



<p>Following the announcement of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-forcing-full-return-office-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5-day return-to-office mandate</a>, which Insider Gaming understands has proven to be an extremely unpopular move with employees, David took to LinkedIn to say:</p>



<p>“So… Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office… because they “believe in collaboration”… but c’mon, we’re not completely stupid… we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office…”</p>



<p>Michaud-Cromp alleges that these comments led to the three-day suspension.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment, and should one be received, we will update this article.</p>
