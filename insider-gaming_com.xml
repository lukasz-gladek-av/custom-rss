<p>A new ESRB rating suggests that Resident Evil 6 may soon be coming to current-generation consoles.</p>



<p>Spotted by X (formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/the_marmolade/status/1881276390076789246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Andrew Marmo</a>, the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40367/resident-evil-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ESRB rating</a> rates Resident Evil 6 for the Xbox Series S|X, with fans speculating that the game could come to the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>The rating reads, “This is a survival-horror game in which players assume the roles of several characters attempting to stop a viral outbreak. From a third-person perspective, players explore environments, solve puzzles, and battle zombies and mutated creatures. Players use pistols, machine guns, knives, and explosives to kill enemies. Combat is highlighted by cries of pain, realistic gunfire, and large blood-splatter effects. Some attacks result in dismemberment and/or decapitation.”</p>



<p>It continues, “Cutscenes depict further instances of violence and/or blood and gore: a zombie shot in the head, exposing bits of brain; a zombie stabbed in the head, close-up; characters killed by rotating fan blades and chainsaw-like blades. One mutated female boss is depicted nude, though without any discernible details (i.e., no nipples or genitalia). During the boss battle, this character can be seen caressing her breasts, gyrating and straddling another character. The word “f**k” appears in the game.”</p>



<p>Despite a rocky start to sales when the game first launched in 2012 due to a mixed reception, Resident Evil 6 has sold 13.8 million units as of September 2024. </p>



<p>As for when the next mainline entry into the Resident Evil franchise releases remains to be seen, but the last mainline entry was Resident Evil Village in 2021. </p>

<p>The App Store has been a great home for TikTok and many other apps over the years. However, TikTok users, and newcomers, are having difficulty with the social media platform on their phones. Let’s clear up any questions you have.</p>



<p>TikTok’s consistent and never-ending success will go down as one of the great stories. The social media platform has accrued billions (probably trillions) of views and continues to be downloaded every day. Its success is being tested by Joe Biden though. The 46th President of the United States <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/president-joe-biden-signs-bill-to-ban-tiktok-in-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed a bill to ban TikTok in the United States</a>.</p>



<p>It’s left TikTok and App Store users confused and could have dire consequences for the platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-download-tiktok-from-the-app-store-in-the-us">Can You Download TikTok From The App Store in the US?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Seems like a lifetime ago. Credit to TikTok</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>TikTok cannot be downloaded from the App Store in the US as Apple has pulled the platform from its storefront.</strong></p>



<p>Even though <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-tiktok-back-up-who-brought-it-back-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok is back up</a>, you can only access it if <strong>you previously have it installed</strong>. Otherwise, United States-based Apple and Android users who don’t have TikTok installed can’t download it.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-tiktok-will-be-back-in-the-app-store">Do We Know When TikTok Will Be Back in The App Store?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, we don’t know when TikTok is coming back to the App Store as neither Apple, Donald Trump nor owner ByteDance has given a timeframe for its possible return.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re outside of the US, you’re fine, and TikTok is working as normal. I’m sorry to say that if you’re based in the US, you can’t download TikTok until something is done to remedy the situation. <strong>Donald Trump’s new tenure as president may include a partnership with TikTok, so there’s a possibility it won’t be gone from the store forever</strong>.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for further updates on TikTok’s status in the App Store.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-isn-t-tiktok-in-the-app-store">Why Isn’t TikTok in The App Store?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-tiktok-be-banned-us-and-when/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok was officially banned in the US</a> on January 19—<strong>this meant Apple had to pull the app from its App Store.</strong></p>



<p>It didn’t take long for the social media app to come back online. But despite Donald Trump’s best intentions to resume TikTok access, the legal regulations of Biden’s bill mean companies have to obey until further notice.</p>



<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apple’s support page</a> has a full rundown of why this is, and why they’ve pulled it.</p>



<p>“TikTok and ByteDance Ltd. apps are no longer available in the United States, and visitors to the United States might have limited access to features,” says Apple on their page, and explains, “Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. Pursuant to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries — including <strong>TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and others — will no longer be available for download or updates on the App Store for users in the United States starting January 19, 2025</strong>.”</p>



<p>You’ll have to make do with Facebook, X, Instagram, Snapchat, and other social media apps for now. Again, work is going on to fully restore TikTok, and bring it back to all storefronts. We’ll keep you updated as we learn more.</p>



<hr>



<p>Did you have the foresight to keep TikTok installed on your phone? Or are you one of the unlucky ones locked out of TikTok for good?</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-snap-taken-down-in-u-s-due-to-governments-tiktok-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Snap has also been banned</a> due to the TikTok legislature. Plus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bytedance-ban-takedown-mobile-legends-bang-bang/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</a> fans are furious as it’s also succumbed to the bill as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-reveals-new-roadmap-for-one-year-anniversary/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>PocketPair is celebrating the first anniversary of its critter-based adventure, Palworld, and the developers have just released a new roadmap as part of the celebration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palword’s future roadmap has much to offer players, with new features like co-op cross-play and world transfers for pals coming soon. The developers also plan to introduce new final boss and ending scenarios and new ways to strengthen and enhance the existing pals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, Palworld’s new roadmap also teases new collaborations and content. Players should expect more collaborations with other games in the future, along with their already-announced partnership with Terraria. The developers also aim to introduce new pals and technologies for players to try.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Palworld roadmap will focus on several different improvements. Players can expect improvements in world object placement, base Pals, optimisation, and UX.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the roadmap, Palworld developers have also released two more things. First is the <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1880978523315191821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">original soundtrack</a>, which can now be found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-ywFLxwu-k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. Second, they are hosting a global popularity poll for Pals. Players can <span>now visit their&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.pocketpair.jp/en/202501" target="_blank">website</a>&nbsp;to vote for their favourite among 180 pals and&nbsp;</span>their favourite faction leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pocketpair recently released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-developer-releases-overdungeon-for-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overdungeon on the Switch</a>. Also, learn more about their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-feybreak-update-introduces-meowmeow-from-terraria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terraria collaboration</a>, which was added during the Feybreak update.

<p>TikTok’s final days in the US were counting down to zero. Long ago, it was announced the popular social media phenomenon was set to be banned in the United States. However, a last-minute change allows TikTok to work in the US again, and we know why.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/president-joe-biden-signs-bill-to-ban-tiktok-in-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Joe Biden signed a bill in April 2024</a> that would end TikTok’s usability in the US. January 19 saw the ban finally take effect, and as Biden planned, TikTok was no longer allowed in the US. The change would impact millions of users, and content creators, and make wholesale changes to the social media landscape.</p>



<p>This was the plan until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tiktok-is-already-starting-to-come-back-online-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok quickly came back online in the US</a>. Many wonder how the app is online despite President Biden’s decree, so let’s explain.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-brought-tiktok-back-in-the-us">Who Brought TikTok Back in The US?</h2>



<p><strong>Future president Donald Trump is the reason TikTok is back in the United States.</strong></p>



<p>The former—and now forthcoming American leader—has made his TikTok thoughts clear. He doesn’t feel it should be banned and feels its profitability is too valuable to lose.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-tiktok-working-again">Why is TikTok Working Again?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>People need their quick-clip fix. Credit to TikTok</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>On January 19, Donald Trump indicated he would declare an executive order on Monday, January 20, to “extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect.”</strong></p>



<p>Trump posted a stern statement on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Truth Social</a>, asking companies to “not let TikTok stay dark!” He also made clear his intentions for Tikok, and how the <strong>social media platform’s existence in the US would be saved</strong>.</p>



<p>“I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security. The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113855616848696050" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said Trump in his post</a>.</p>



<p>He adds that he wants the “United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture.”&nbsp;This will “save TikTok” and “keep it in good hands.” Trump has proposed a joint venture between the US and TikTok and believes it’s “worth hundreds of billions of dollars – maybe trillions,” to the US.</p>



<p>Donald Trump officially becomes president again on January 20, and if the figure has his way, TikTok will likely remain online in the US for good. A joint venture allowing the US to benefit from TikTok seems to be better than no TikTok at all, and the turnaround could be a shrewd move and win over some of the United States public.</p>

<p>It’s not only TikTok that’s been hit by the ban. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-snap-taken-down-in-u-s-due-to-governments-tiktok-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Snap was also down due to the TikTok Ban</a>, along with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bytedance-ban-takedown-mobile-legends-bang-bang/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</a>.</p>

<p>This weekend’s round of Call of Duty League matches unfolded in a typical fashion, with the teams that you’d expect walking away with their heads held high. Toronto Ultra is the only organisation to remain unbeaten during the Major I qualifiers, and Atlanta FaZe is still trying to claw its way up the standings after a miserable season opening.</p>



<p>One team that shone this weekend was OpTic Texas, which now sits on a 5-1 record for the stage after punishing LA Thieves and the Vegas Falcons this weekend. The match against LAT was something special.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-the-record-you-want">Not The Record You Want</h2>



<p>The OpTic Texas v. LA Thieves fixture was nothing short of chaotic, opening with OpTic 100-clubbing LAT in a round of Hardpoint on Hacienda. During this match, LAT’s Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst secured a record he’s probably not too proud of. He became the first player in Call of Duty League history to land less than 1000 damage on a single round of HP.</p>



<p>By the time the dust had settled, he’d produced a kill-death ratio of 6 – 19, marking his place in history with one of the worst performances since the CDL debuted in 2020. </p>



<p>He took it in jest, though:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Map 1. 6 kills, 750 dmg. 10 miles ran.</span></p></article></div>







<p>As the match unfolded, it looked as though the LA Thieves found their footing and secured wins in the first round of Search and the game of Control, but OpTic Texas held firm. The second Hardpoint, which took place on Skyline, was a relatively easy win for OpTic, and during game five, something monumental occurred.</p>



<p>From a 5 – 1 lead, LAT crumbled, being reverse-swept by OpTic Texas. In the final round, Kenny clutched a 1v2 finish that was nothing short of spectacular, netting the win and the much-needed COD points that almost guarantee a top seed for the team at Major I.</p>



<p>We’ve got one more regular weekend of CDL action before Major I arrives. It’s the first CDL Major to take place in Europe, and it’ll unravel in Madrid from January 30 to February 2.</p>



<p>I’ll be on location for the whole weekend with Insider Gaming – so keep an eye open for the hottest coverage from the CDL.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/world-series-of-warzone-players-winnings/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/world-series-of-warzone-players-haven%E2%80%99t-received-their-winnings-four-months-later.1086687/</guid>

<p>The World Series of Warzone Global Finals unravelled in Las Vegas in September 2024, with hundreds of thousands of people tuning in to catch the battle royale action unfold. As the biggest tournament in the Warzone space, it naturally attracts the most prolific competitors, and it bears a $950,000 prize pool.</p>



<p>Recently, a claim surfaced on social media from Biffle, the Team Falcons player who was part of the trio that won the Global Finals. The group scooped a $300,000 prize, but according to Biffle, ‘around 20 people’ (including him) still haven’t been paid more than four months later.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-debt-owed">A Debt Owed</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/DiazBiffle/status/1881038922114879847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Biffle wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Its been 4 months since WSOW and there is probably around 20 people that haven’t been paid out that I know of (including my $100,000). No one is answering the email that was provided to us for WSOW support. Completely unacceptable and unprofessional.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Biffle, Soka, and Shifty claimed the $300,000 prize at the World Series of Warzone Global Finals just two months after winning the top prize in the Warzone category at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh.</p>



<p>For a while, there have been concerns regarding Activision’s stance on battle royale-based esports events, and for a few months, it has seemed like the scene is wavering and perhaps preparing to fade away. Presently, nobody has any idea what this year’s competitive ecosystem looks like for the World Series of Warzone.</p>



<p>Biffle has gone public with his concerns, and rightly so. To be missing out on a $100,000 payment is ludicrous, and it shows a lack of integrity that could forever mar Activision’s competitive Warzone ecosystem.</p>



<p>In a follow-up comment, UnRationaL, who secured the second-place spot behind Biffle’s team, said that he’s still waiting on a $53,000 payment.</p>



<p>There are no indications that the Call of Duty League teams have their payments held for so long when they win a Major or COD Champs, so why is Warzone being forgotten about by Activision and Microsoft?</p>
