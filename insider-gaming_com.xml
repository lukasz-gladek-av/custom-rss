<p>The Legend of Zelda movie—in collaboration with Nintendo and Sony—has been given a 2027 release date. It’s been a couple of years since the movie’s announcement, and now we finally have a key detail to indicate it’s moving along.</p>



<p>Hooray for Hyrule as Zelda fans can rejoice! The Legend of Zelda is one of the most famous video-game franchises in history—and there’s simply no debate. If we backtrack to Nov. 7, 2023, we can fondly remember <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-is-finally-getting-a-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda movie being announced</a> and sending the gaming community into hysterics. </p>



<p>It’s been fairly quiet on this front for nearly two years. Doubts started to creep in that it wasn’t happening, but you can sheathe your Master Sword for now.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda Movie is set for a <strong>March 26, 2027</strong>, release date. The news came from a surprising source—the newly launched <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-new-mobile-companion-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Today app</a>.</p>



<p>We don’t have a shot from the app itself, but you can see this message from popular X user <a href="https://x.com/Wario64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a> showcasing the announcement. The official screenshot says: “The live-action film of The Legend of Zelda will be released worldwide on March 26, 2027.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>The Legend of Zelda live-action film releasing on March 26, 2027 (via Nintendo Today!)</span></p></article></div>



<p>Nothing else has been revealed for now. We have no indication of the actors or actresses involved, and we’re not sure if this is a brand-new story, or where (or <em>when</em>) it’s set.</p>



<p>But the shock announcement is the perfect way to sell the idea of the Nintendo Today app. It’s all happening on the Zelda front as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/store-listing-says-new-3d-mario-legend-of-zelda-remake-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new remake is rumored</a>.</p>

<p>The First Berserker Khazan is a Soulslike requiring utmost precision. Any imperfections, frame drops, or performance-related issues can spell disaster. When the subject of Denuvo is brought up alongside The First Berserker Khazan, panic is bound to ensue.</p>



<p>Denuvo is anti-tamper software with the main purpose of preventing vide-game pirating. Developers and publishers use it to stop thieves from illegally downloading games for free. Its intentions are positive, but it can have disastrous consequences for the game in question. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-trophy-list-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is one of 2025’s biggest PC releases, and the Denuvo question has reared its head.</p>



<p>If The First Berserker Khazan uses the software measure, it might be a problem, so let’s find out.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-denuvo-used-in-the-first-berserker-khazan">Is Denuvo Used in The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Now’s not the time for framerate drops. Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The First Berserker Khazan does use Denuvo, as its Steam page clearly states: “Incorporates 3rd-party DRM: Denuvo Anti-tamper.”</strong></p>



<p>If you go to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2680010/The_First_Berserker_Khazan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan’s Steam page</a>, a tab on the right-hand side of the screen shows the Denuvo integration. It doesn’t look like anyone is going to backtrack on this decision either. </p>



<p>The First Berserker Khazan uses Denuvo, meaning players will do well to pirate the action title. On the other hand, it means your gameplay is in danger could be affected.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-denuvo-do-to-the-first-berserker-khazan">What Does Denuvo do to The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<p><strong>Denuvo can cause performance issues, frame-rate stuttering, and various other technological issues in The First Berserker Khazan.</strong></p>



<p>In short, Khazan is one of the worst games to be affected by Denuvo. All it takes is for one for interruption or mishap to throw you out of your rhythm and you watch as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-nerfs-hardest-bosses-in-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardest bosses</a> tear you to pieces.</p>



<p>Make sure your settings are set to enhance performance as best as you can!</p>



<hr>



<p>How do you feel about Denuvo being used in games? Again, DRM means well, but is it worth the impact it can have on gameplay?</p>

<p>In one of this year’s most dark discoveries, brand-new hit life simulator Inzoi lets you run over children. While the game is designed to mimic most aspects of day-to-day life, players are understandably baffled by the inclusion.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-inzoi-come-out-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a> has steadily gained momentum and hype throughout 2025. Eventually, it superseded Hollow Knight Silksong to become the most-<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-most-wanted-wishlist-game-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wishlisted title on Steam</a>. Despite a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-inzoi-have-denuvo-denuvo-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Denuvo</a> roadblock on the way, the new rival to The Sims has gotten off to a hot start. It allows you to escape your real life to live a more perfect existence through Inzoi.</p>



<p>However, Inzoi possibly offers a bit too much freedom as you can quite literally control a car and careen into children.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-run-over-children-in-inzoi-s-life-simulator">You Can Run Over Children in Inzoi’s Life Simulator</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s stick to the road, yeah? Credit to Inzoi Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>An NSFW post appeared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inZOI/comments/1jldd0w/i_dont_think_that_krafton_realizes_that_you_can/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-players-surprised-to-discover-you-can-run-over-children-despite-teen-rating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inzoi subreddit</a> on March 27. It initially contained a description saying: “You can drive into the elementary school and run over…unalive the children.”</p>



<p>Underneath the message is a video of the action itself. Amazingly, it’s exactly as the user describes: It’s a car driving into a small group of kids, and the force sends one of the children flying and ragdolling uncontrollably.</p>



<p>The action reportedly kills the child, and this discovery has understandably shocked everyone. Many comments suggest the developer (or the assistance of publisher Krafton) will cause this type of action to be removed.</p>



<p>“They stated they wouldn’t be fond of violent mods in the game and then accidentally added one themselves,” said one user, whereas someone else commented: “They’ll probably fix it soon. Steam doesn’t allow you to depict children being harmed in such graphic ways, according to their content rules, so they’ll patch it out fast enough.”</p>



<p><strong>Warning: You can check the video for yourself below, but it might be uncomfortable for some.</strong></p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rapidsave.com_-9xsxumx7pare1.mp4" playsinline=""></video></figure>



<p>We’re yet to hear an official response from Krafton on the video. Do you think this type of content should be allowed in Inzoi? Or is it a life-simulator living up to its intention? We’re interested to hear your thoughts on this down below and in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1777/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>It’s been a long time since many fan-favorite PlayStation franchises have been seen. This has a lot to do with Japan Studio’s closure in 2021 and Shuhei Yoshida’s departure as president of SIE Worldwide Studios.</p>



<p>Sony is fixated on delivering high-energy, big-time blockbuster games for PlayStation owners. Examples of this strategy include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/guerrilla-games-1-million-players-horizon-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-ghost-of-tsushima-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Tsushima (and Ghost of Yotei)</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-showrunners-address-spores-returning-for-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yuri-lowenthal-spider-man-3-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/returnal-developer-housemarque-teases-mystery-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Returnal</a>. However, it means a less-driven approach toward AA game development.</p>



<p>The gap between indie titles and AAA giants is larger than ever, and part of this is due to Shuhei Yoshida stepping down as SIE Worldwide Studios’ president, which in turn caused Japan Studio to close.</p>



<h2 id="h-sony-playstation-no-longer-wanted-aa-games-on-ps4-or-ps5">Sony PlayStation No Longer Wanted AA Games on PS4 or PS5</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The studio had a Knack for games. Credit to Japan Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a translated interview with <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001799.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AV Watch</a>, Yoshida explained: “I was in charge of the first party, so I was asked to make a game that was powerful enough to sell hardware. When you make something like that, the company pushes you a lot. The company wanted such things, and while we had to make them, the scale of development and the sales required were getting bigger and bigger.”</p>



<p>He added that company creators were coming up with great ideas, and while they were “very creative and interesting,” they were ultimately deemed AA. He said that “Japan Studio ceased to exist” soon after he stepped down as president—an event brought on by PlayStation’s corporate restructuring.</p>



<p>“At that time, the JAPAN studio was a team that was good at making AA, and it was a studio. In that case, it probably doesn’t match what the company and first party are looking for,” explained Yoshida.</p>



<p>Japan Studio was part of the most lauded titles in PlayStation’s catalog: Everybody’s Golf, Ape Escape, LocoRoco, Knack, Patapon, Gravity Rush, and many more. While other studios might pick up these franchises—like Bandai Namco has done with the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-everybodys-golf-hot-shots-announced-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everybody’s Golf Hot Shots</a> title—some of these games are now consigned to history.</p>
