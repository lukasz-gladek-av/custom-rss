<p>A new report reveals that Netflix considered acquiring Electronic Arts, Disney, and Fox, but none of those deals came to fruition. </p>



<p>Netflix is the new big dog in town, ever since it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the company would acquire Warner Bros. for $82.7 billion in 2026, likely giving it access to studios like NetherRealm, Rocksteady, TT Games, and Avalanche. New details reveal they have considered buying other major companies, including EA and Disney. </p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-debated-pursuing-ea-disney-and-fox">Netflix ‘Debated Pursuing’ EA, Disney, and Fox</h2>



<p>A new Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-07/netflix-co-ceo-ted-sarandos-wooed-trump-personally-ahead-of-warner-bid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> about Netflix CEO wooing Trump ahead of Warner Bros.’ bid says the company considered acquisitions of EA, Disney, and Fox. It first talks about how Netflix is an “unlikely bidder”, as co-founder and chairman, Reed Hastings, avoids major deals to build things “from scratch”. The company’s management “debated pursuing just about every major asset put up for sale, including&nbsp;Electronic Arts Inc.&nbsp;and&nbsp;Fox.” They also considered acquiring Disney at one point. </p>



<p>However, the “executives could never coalesce behind a deal.” Additionally, the execs didn’t want to “hurt their stock price by overpaying for an asset that traded at a much lower multiple.” Netflix’s co-CEO Greg Peters also stated, ahead of the acquisition of Warner Bros., that “One should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers, they don’t have an amazing track record,” which led people to think Netflix was not interested in the deal. </p>

Additionally, Paramount has made a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hostile offer</a> to acquire Warner Bros.

<p>The Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 release date carries on Epic’s new mission to let everyone relive the early years by experiencing older content again from top to bottom. Key content for Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 has been revealed, showing you what you can look forward to for several weeks.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 celebrates the battle royale’s Christmas period from SEVEN years ago. The game has changed dramatically over the last seven years, and while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-dark-voyager-quest-rewards-chapter-7-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</a> begins the next significant milestone in the game’s history, it’s time for a Holiday throwback.</p>



<p>OG Chapter 1 Season 7 brings back some banging skins and some beloved POIs and weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 releases on December 11, exactly two weeks out from Christmas Day!</strong></p>



<p>It’s time to put in some real work. Alongside Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 is OG Chapter 1 Season 7. It’s a testament to Epic to keep so many areas of the game in operation at once. But the nostalgic return to bygone Fortnite eras has been a huge dub in the community.</p>



<p>The OG Chapter 1 Season 7’s tagline was “You Better Watch Out,” and Insider Gaming will tell you why.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[First Player to Escape from Tarkov Gets Unique ‘Streamer Item’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/first-player-escape-tarkov-streamer-item/</link>
            <guid>1376179</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tigz, who was documented last week as being the first person in the world to successfully escape from Tarkov, has been awarded a unique streamer item by Battlestate Games. These items are used to represent the respect that Battlestate Games has for the content creators who pour their lives into pulling Escape from Tarkov into the limelight time and again.</p>



<p>There are dozens of streamer items in the game, but the latest one belongs to Tigz, and it’s a tongue-in-cheek reference to the failed runs that prevented him from getting out of Tarkov without too many issues.</p>



<h2 id="h-tigz-has-a-streamer-item">Tigz Has a Streamer Item</h2>



<p>Tigz has a unique streamer item that’s reminiscent of his time spent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/">escaping through Terminal</a>, the final map in Battlestate Games’ tough extraction shooter. In his first attempt, which was watched by tens of thousands of people, Tigz fell short of the ending after failing to find a splint to patch an injury that ultimately led to his death.</p>



<p>That forced him to try again, numerous times.</p>



<p>To honor and recognize that moment, Battlestate Games created a unique <strong>splint </strong>for Tigz’s streamer item – <strong>Tigzresq</strong>. It’s a <strong>67-inch </strong>splint in a red and black design that may or may not be practical. <span>Streamer items&nbsp;<strong>are rarely</strong></span><strong> </strong>practical, but if any will have an honest, in-game use, it’s the Tigzresq.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another streamer item with a practical use is Gingy’s keychain, which does what you’d imagine and holds keys. There’s also WillerZ’s wallet, the RatCola, sprats, and a jar of mayo, amongst other things.</p>



<p>Whenever someone becomes big for streaming Escape from Tarkov, their streamer item is never too far behind. Fans of TheBurntPeanut, who recently won awards at The Streamer Awards, are clamouring for a unique item in Escape from Tarkov, given the amount of time the VTuber (sorry, PTuber) has spent in the game in recent years.</p>



<p>If you had a streamer item in Escape from Tarkov, what would it be? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
