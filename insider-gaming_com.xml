<p>Microsoft had another big quarter on paper. Xbox, however, did not.</p>



<p>In its second quarter fiscal year 2026 (FY26 Q2) earnings report, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q2/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft announced</a> a 17% year-over-over jump in revenue to <strong>$81.3 billion</strong>, with growth once again driven by cloud and AI. Microsoft Cloud revenue hit <strong>$51.5 billion</strong>, Azure jumped <strong>39%</strong>, and most of the company’s major business lines continued to trend in the right direction.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a> was the clear exception.</p>







<h2 id="h-xbox-revenue-fell-across-the-board">Xbox Revenue Fell Across The Board</h2>



<p>Within Microsoft’s report, the company said that Xbox content and services revenue <strong>fell 5% year over year</strong>. Microsoft didn’t disclose specifics on the Xbox content regarding the revenue for services like Xbox Game Pass, but did say that the decline can be attributed to last year benefiting from “strong first-party content performance”. Still, the slowdown is hard to overlook as Xbox content growth continues to cool, at least for the time being. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-tops-ps5-to-lead-hardware-sales-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hardware</a> was an even bigger concern.</p>



<p>Microsoft confirmed that <strong>Xbox hardware revenue dropped 32%</strong> during the quarter. As usual, the company did not provide console sales numbers or much added context, but the direction is clear. Xbox console sales continue to slide, even as Microsoft positions the brand as more of a service-driven ecosystem than a traditional hardware platform.</p>







<p>Recent quarterly data shows how quickly things have changed. Xbox content and services revenue <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-revenue-q1-2026-drop-113m-year-over-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted strong gains throughout much of FY25</a>, including multiple quarters of double-digit growth. That momentum has now faded, with FY26 Q2 marking a shift into negative territory.</p>



<p>Despite the Xbox decline for the quarter, other parts of the earnings helped soften the impact. <strong>Windows OEM and Devices revenue grew 1%</strong>, while <strong>search and news advertising rose 10%</strong>, underlining just how much Xbox is lagging behind Microsoft’s other consumer-facing businesses.</p>



<p>For Microsoft, the overall earnings picture remains strong. For Xbox, the concerns are piling up. With hardware revenue falling sharply as the Xbox Series X|S ages out and content growth seemingly slowing, Microsoft’s long-term plan for the platform is becoming a bit murkier. </p>

<p>Amazon’s continued distance from traditional gaming has seemingly continue. According to a new report, the head of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/amazon-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Game Studios</a> is leaving the company.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3mdisznjdh22x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, Christoph Hartmann, Amazon Games vice president, is leaving after roughly eight years. It’s currently unknown where Hartmann is going or when he plans on wrapping up with the Seattle-based company. </p>







<p>He’s also yet to make any public comment on the matter, as of writing.</p>



<p>Under Hartmann’s leadership since 2018, Amazon Game Studios published games like Crucible, Lost Ark, New World, King of Meat, and others. Most recently, New World announced that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-aeternum-to-be-taken-offline-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set to go offline at the end</a> of January 2027. Right now, the studio has two Tomb Raider games in development along with a number of unannounced projects. Though, the status of those unannounced games remains unknown amid all the turnover.</p>



<p>Schreier added that Hartmann’s leaving comes as “Amazon continues its retreat from the PC and console video-game space in favor of its cloud gaming service Luna.”</p>







<p>Prior to joining Amazon, Hartmann spent 18 years with Take-Two Interactive. He even helped co-found 2K Games in the early 2000s after Take-Two acquired Visual Concepts. </p>
