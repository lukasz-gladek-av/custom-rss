            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>T1 Esports has confirmed the departure of Lee ‘Gumayusi’ Min-hyeong, closing the book on a seven-year chapter that saw the team secure three consecutive League of Legends World Championship titles, including the 2025 win that came mere days ago.</p>



<p>While Choi ‘Zeus’ Woo-je’s controversial exit in 2024 left T1 fans stunned, Gumayusi’s decision to depart feels different, given that it has come very early in the off-season and coincides with the expiration of his contract with T1.</p>



<h2 id="h-gumayusi-goes-into-the-open">Gumayusi Goes Into the Open</h2>



<p>T1’s recent announcement regarding Gumayusi’s departure from the roster was loaded with gratitude and respect for all the player has given the organization over the last few years. It was confirmed that the choice to leave the team was ‘his alone.’</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="ko" dir="ltr"><p>𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐲𝐨𝐮, 𝐆𝐮𝐦𝐚𝐲𝐮𝐬𝐢</p><p>'Gumayusi' 이민형 선수가 T1을 떠나 새로운 도전을 시작하게 되었습니다.<br>함께한 시간 동안 들어 올린 트로피와 'Gumayusi' 선수가 남긴 발자취는 팀과 팬들의 마음에 오래도록 빛날 것입니다.<br>T1은 'Gumayusi' 선수의 헌신과 희생, 그리고 눈부신 활약에 대해… <a href="https://t.co/zhiC6v7Qqu">pic.twitter.com/zhiC6v7Qqu</a></p></div>— T1 LoL (@T1LoL) <a href="https://twitter.com/T1LoL/status/1990389461771816974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Despite his MVP-winning performance at Worlds 2025, Gumayusi had a trying 2025 leading up to the monumental win. Earlier this season, the competitor was <strong>benched</strong>, and T1 only just managed to scrape up a qualification to Worlds. The tough year and cracks showing in the foundations might have pushed Gumayusi to seek pastures new.</p>



<p>Speculation is now swirling like wildfire in the League of Legends esports space. Gumayusi’s next home could be under the Hanwha Life banner, or it could be assuming a spot with Gen.G’s roster, changes pending.</p>



<p>In social circles, rumors have already begun circulating about Gumayusi’s replacement. T1 appears to be wasting no time in filling that spot, and suggestions have emerged that Kim ‘Peyz’ Su-hwan could join the squad in place of Gumayusi.</p>



<p>Wherever he winds up, Gumayusi will be an asset to every roster he sits within.</p>



<p>Where do you think Gumayusi is headed? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what your pick would be.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rebecca-heineman-passed-away-interplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rebecca-heineman-co-founder-of-interplay-has-passed-away.1356505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Yesterday, the unfortunate news broke that Rebecca Heineman, co-founder of Interplay, Logicware, Contraband Entertainment, and Olde Sküül, and the first national United States esports champion, had passed away. Following a battle with aggressive lung cancer, Heineman was recently hospitalized and given days to live.</p>



<p>As a pioneer in the games industry for women in development, video game archival, and lifetime creator of some of the most influential video games, Heineman leaves behind a stunning legacy.</p>







<h2 id="h-generational-run">Generational Run</h2>



<p>In 1980, Rebecca Heineman traveled to Los Angeles to attend an enormous Space Invaders championship event, hosted on the Atari 2600. Not expecting to get anywhere close to the top spot, Heinemen unexpectedly won the entire event, going on to later win a second championship in New York.</p>



<p>That made Heineman the United States’ first national esports champion.</p>



<p>As young as 16, Heineman was diving deep into coding, creating games and software at a time when concepts were just being framed. She co-founded Interplay Productions in 1983, a legendary studio that would go on to create Baldur’s Gate, The Bard’s Tale, Wasteland, and, probably most importantly, <strong>Fallout</strong>.</p>



<p>Heineman was rumored to be one of the last people in possession of the source code for the original Fallout game, released in 1997.</p>



<p>Her career took her through some of the most prolific companies in gaming, from Electronic Arts and Ubisoft to Microsoft and Sony, and she was a stalwart advocate for LGBTQ+ representation in the industry.</p>



<p>In a post on a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebecca-ann-heineman-fight-aggressive-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GoFundMe page</a> set up to help with medical costs, Heineman explained her story:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>How did this start? I noticed when I was at PAX prime that I was out of breath climbing a single flight of stairs. When I got back to Dallas, I went to the emergency room and they found I had 2300ml of fluid in my lung cavity (see photos). They drained another 1600ml a week later. After cat scans, X-rays, and blood tests they finally found that the cancer is in my lungs and liver.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yesterday, a final post was shared, along with a last image:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s time. According to my doctors. All further treatments are pointless. So, please donate so my kids can create a funeral worthy of my keyboard, Pixelbreaker! So I can make a worthy entrance for reuniting with my one true love, Jennell Jaquays.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Heineman, who predominantly went by the nickname ‘Burger’ for two decades, leaves behind five children.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-switch-2-claimed-insider/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-6-could-come-to-switch-2-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1356499/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p> In a recent post on social media, a rumor has once again surfaced that Grand Theft Auto 6 could arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 <strong>after </strong>it has launched on other major platforms. This rumor was partially backed up by NateTheHate, who confirmed hearing that Rockstar was ‘doing tests to bring it to Switch 2’.</p>



<p>If Rockstar Games could optimize the hell out of Grand Theft Auto 6, it could be the biggest game to ever land on a Nintendo platform, alongside the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-gta-6-coming-to-switch-2">Is GTA 6 Coming to Switch 2?</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, user ‘Nash Weedle’ published a claim that GTA 6 is actively in the works for Nintendo Switch 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can CONFIRM that a GTA VI port for SWITCH 2 is in the works. I haven’t said much about it; I had to be cautious until now. I can also comment that: – The game’s delay isn’t due to this version. – It doesn’t seem like it will be a launch title.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nash has a decent track record when it comes to Nintendo leaks and insider tidbits.</p>



<p>NateTheHate, another notable insider, <a href="https://xcancel.com/NateTheHate2/status/1990491837182980193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was summoned</a> to the post to offer his two cents, and he confirmed that Rockstar Games was at least <strong>testing </strong>bringing GTA 6 to Switch 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I said a while ago that R* was doing tests to bring it to Switch 2; but tests don’t always equal release. I know an effort has been made to see if they can bring it to the platform. I don’t know the current state of that effort.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It wouldn’t be the first Grand Theft Auto game to wind up on a Nintendo platform, but it would by far be the biggest. In recent years, the remastered GTA Trilogy landed on Switch, but Grand Theft Auto 5 always eluded the platform.</p>



<p>It’s believed that GTA 6 could <strong>technically </strong>run on the Switch 2, but with some major performance downgrades, such as a lower frame rate, reduced visual fidelity, and tapered resolution. It certainly wouldn’t offer anything close to the performance of a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X, for example.</p>



<p>If GTA 6 comes to Nintendo Switch 2, could you see yourself buying it? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In an interview with CNBC, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick had some comments regarding the console/PC debate. In fact, it seems he’s taken a side in the whole debacle.</p>







<p>The divide between PC and console gaming has been a rather long one. Exclusives on one, better quality on the other, it all seems to go back and forth. Take-Two, known for publishing the Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K, has been on both fronts. Every month, it seems the company finds itself on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling list for consoles</a> for its catalog of sports games. While it’ll take a while for the company to see a bigger pay day with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6 delayed</a>, it seems the CEO has some thoughts on the console/PC divide.</p>



<h2 id="h-zelnick-says-business-is-moving-towards-open-to-pc-in-recent-interview">Zelnick Says “Business is Moving Towards Open” to PC in Recent Interview</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick sat down with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNBC’s Squawk Box</a> for an interview on gaming. While on the topic of console gaming, Zelnick stated,</p>



<p>“<strong>I think it’s moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed</strong>,” says Zelnick. “<strong>But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen — that’s never going away.</strong>”</p>



<p>His comments do come at a convenient time, as Valve announced the upcoming console, the Steam Machine, which can play Steam games on your TV. Similarly, Xbox and Microsoft have veered a bit towards PC gamers, as recent statements from figures in the company indicate a change in tone from consoles. Weirdly, Take-Two’s biggest upcoming release, Grand Theft Auto 6, has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-will-gta-6-release-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not been announced for PC</a>. Its last entry, Grand Theft Auto 5, didn’t see a PC release until two years after launching in 2013. In any case, it seems the company may be gearing to open up with PC gaming more than ever.</p>







<p>What do you think of Zelnick’s comments? Do you think PC is the way to go? Or is console better? Do you think GTA 6 is going to PC?

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill Townfall Release Date Possibly Leaked]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a storefront leak, Silent Hill Townfall is coming in early 2026. Furthermore, even before we’ve seen gameplay, we know when it’s releasing.</p>







<p>Announced all the way back in 2022, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-transmission-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill Townfall</a> is a collaboration between Konami and Annapurna Interactive. Not much is known about the project outside of a cryptic announcement video from the Silent Hill Transmission presentation. Many had a bad feeling the project wouldn’t see the light of day, as the series hadn’t been doing well, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/entire-annapurna-interactive-team-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Annapurna layoffs</a>. However, right at the prime of the franchise, with Silent Hill 2 Remake and Silent Hill f being massive successes, it seems it’s not too far off. </p>



<h2 id="h-silent-hill-townfall-possibly-releasing-march-26-2026-according-to-storefront-leak">Silent Hill Townfall Possibly Releasing March 26, 2026, According to Storefront Leak</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SILENT HILL: TOWNFALL | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ccYsjz_EtQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The leak in question comes from e-shop Liverpool Mexico, which showed Silent Hill Townfall and a release date of March 26, 2026. Unfortunately, the listing in question has since been deleted, though <a href="https://cdaction.pl/newsy/silent-hill-townfall-z-nieodlegla-premiera-meksykanski-sklep-potwierdza-plotki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polish outlet CD Action</a> managed to screenshot it beforehand. Prominent Silent Hill figure <a href="https://x.com/Rashmunchel/status/1990457427565715645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rachel Ashmun</a> also credited the listing on Twitter/X, lending a bit more leverage to it.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that Konami and Annapurna have not released anything official yet regarding Silent Hill Townfall, so take the leak with a grain of salt. Still, the timing does come at a mighty convenient time. On November 20th, Xbox is holding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-partner-preview-confirmed-for-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partner Preview</a> at 10 am PT/1 pm EST. One of the games heavily rumored, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and even leaked</a>, for the presentation is Silent Hill 2 Remake. The title, helmed by Bloober Team, is a timed PlayStation exclusive that, if true, will come to Xbox Series X|S on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-store-leaks-silent-hill-2-xbox-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 21st</a>. Perhaps we may get a double feature for Silent Hill then? We’ll have to wait and see!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sandfall Interactive’s Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has broken a very impressive record following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025 nominations</a>. The game, nominated for Game of the Year, leads a stellar list of other contenders, including Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and Hollow Knight Silksong.</p>







<p>Releasing earlier this year, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 blew many out of the water. Not only did it look gorgeous for an indie game, but the turn-based RPG combat felt reminiscent of classic Final Fantasy and Persona. It quickly became <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-now-2025s-highest-rated-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025’s best-reviewed title</a> for a time before <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a> overtook it a month ago. Still, it was pretty clear the game would make an appearance at The Game Awards in big categories. However, its nominations prove it’s showing up in a huge way, more than any other year.</p>



<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-record-12-nominations-at-the-game-awards-2025">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Gets Record 12 Nominations at The Game Awards 2025</h2>

<p>The Game Awards 2025 announced its nominees today (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can find the whole list here</a>) and it had some bombshells. Perhaps the biggest of all was Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The indie title managed to snag a record-breaking 12 nominations, including three in one category. Previously, the record holders were 2020’s The Last of Us Part 2 and 2023’s God of War: Ragnarok, which each had 11 nominations.

<p>The Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.2.0 patch notes have released ahead of its November 18th release. The notes include a new map and mode, aim assist features, and plenty of bug fixes.</p>







<p>The update plans to add a ton of stuff and fixes to Battlefield 6. In terms of new content, a Southern California-inspired map, called Eastwood, will be available. Included with the map is a new limited-time mode focused on destruction aptly called Sabotage, as well as two new weapons: the M357 Sidearm and DB-12 Shotgun. </p>



<p>As for fixes, the biggest change addressed in the Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.2.0 patch notes is to the Aim Assist. According to the developers, it has reverted the tuning back to how it was during the Open Beta. Other fixes include weapon accuracy, gadget improvements, and smoother responses for controllers. </p>
