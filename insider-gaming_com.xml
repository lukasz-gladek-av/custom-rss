<p>Ubisoft isn’t finished with Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which dropped last year to a positive reception and a few controversies, particularly those concerning historical inaccuracies. It became a talking point within the Japanese government, amongst other things, which was pretty insane to see.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, February 17, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/ubisoft/" id="26">Ubisoft</a> will release title update 1.1.8 for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, kick-starting a special, limited-time parkour challenge, and adding a feature that many think should have been there the entire time.</p>



<p>Yes, that’s the ability to <strong>jump</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-manual-jump-coming-to-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Manual Jump Coming to Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<p>Forced automatic parkour will be a thing of the past in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows/" id="1478">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> with update 1.1.8. Ubisoft is encouraging those still playing the game to participate in a social-driven parkour challenge, creating an unedited shot that they can share to showcase their freerunning abilities in Feudal Japan.</p>



<p>There are prizes up for grabs, but only the cleanest routes will be in with a chance of winning.</p>



<p>To facilitate the challenge, Ubisoft has added <strong>manual jumping </strong>to Assassin’s Creed Shadows. That now means that, at the press of a button, you can <strong>jump</strong>. How’s about that for an update?</p>



<p>If you want to enable manual jumping, you’ll need to hop into <strong>Advanced Options </strong>in the gameplay settings menu and switch the feature <strong>on</strong>. Otherwise, you’ll still be locked in a creative box by automatic parkour.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Ubisoft is adding a detailed statistics page <strong>and </strong>new ‘visual feedback’ for crit hits landed in combat.</p>



<p>Next month, Claws of Awaji, the game’s major expansion, will be released on Nintendo Switch 2. Then, on March 20, the game’s first anniversary rolls around, and Ubisoft has promised something of a small celebration.</p>



<p>Tomorrow’s update will drop at 14:00 UTC and will measure up to 15.77 GB for Xbox users, and as little as 1.7 GB for PS5 users.</p>







<p>Are you looking forward to making some sweet parkour content in Assassin’s Creed Shadows with <strong>manual jumping? </strong>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>1437679</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a> brings a new MyGM draft format, additional playable GMs, expanded match types, and more, as a deeper level of control takes center stage.</p>



<p>WWE 2K has released a new <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/mygm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report, </a>giving players an in-depth look at the changes coming to the popular game mode. Major changes include more match types for players to select, a longer season mode than ever before, and new choices for the authority figure on your show.</p>







<h2 id="h-default-seasons-are-now-50-weeks-in-wwe-2k26-mygm">Default Seasons Are Now 50 Weeks in WWE 2K26 MyGM</h2>



<p>WWE 2K26 features 50-week seasons by default in MyGM. Also, starting budgets have increased and now range from $3 million to $7 million. Everyone’s budget is $5 million by default. </p>



<p>It is expected that higher budgets will increase the average roster size per brand by up to 35 Superstars. There’s also a new difficulty setting, Immortal, for experienced players looking for a new challenge.</p>







<h2 id="h-players-can-choose-to-double-book-stars">Players Can Choose to Double-Book Stars</h2>



<p>Another new feature is the ability to double-book wrestlers in both promos and matches on a single show. This means players will need to manage their roster members’ stamina more closely and pay closer attention to the show’s format, but it adds more realism.</p>



<p>Speaking of promos, invasion promises are new to WWE 2K26. Players can now send a star to attack the opposing brand when playing against friends. A good promo will earn you fans; a bad promo will make your brand look bad and could cost you fans.</p>



<p>As for match types, players can now book wrestlers for a variety of options, including the new 3 Stages of Hell. There’s also now support for 5-way, 6-way, and 8-way matches.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-legendary-gms-are-added-in-this-year-s-game">New Legendary GMs Are Added in This Year’s Game</h2>



<p>This year, MyGM Mode added new playable general managers, including the legendary Bobby “The Brain” Heenan, Stacy Keibler, and the Anonymous General Manager from 2011. They join Eric Bischoff, Adam Pearce, Mick Foley, and Ava.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why.

<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The talk of the Pokémon&nbsp;world has been the elusive Pikachu Illustrator card in Logan Paul’s possession, or should that be rectified, formerly, in his possession. The world’s most expensive Pokémon&nbsp;card is now even more valuable, and the identity behind the buyer is fascinating.</p>



<p>Logan Paul once sported his outrageously expensive Pikachu Illustrator card around his neck as he walked down the ramp for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wwe/" id="1631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wrestlemania</a>. Dubbed ‘The most coveted card in the world,” the PSA Grade 10 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Illustrator card is as rare as a Pokémon card gets, and it changed hands for an extraordinary sum in 2026.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A once-in-a-lifetime purchase. Credit to Logan Paul</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>AJ Scaramucci is now the owner of the world’s most expensive Pokémon card after buying the Pikachu Illustrator card from Logan Paul for $16.492 million in an auction.</strong></p>



<p>Monday, February 16, 2026, will go down in history as one of the most extraordinary auctions ever.</p>

</ul>



<p><a href="https://goldin.co/item/logan-paul-personally-owned-1998-pokemon-japanese-corocoro-promo-raretua0w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goldin</a> has recognized that Paul’s Pikachu Illustrator PSA 10 card (with gold chain and all!) was sold for exactly <strong>$16,492,000</strong>—including Buyer’s Premium. </p>



<p>AJ Scaramucci is the lucky bidder who has claimed this incredible collector’s item, and Guinness World Records has said it’s the most expensive trading card ever sold at any auction.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>AJ Scaramucci reveals he’s starting a “planetary treasure hunt” after spending $16.49M on the Pikachu Illustrator</p><p>“My ambition for the card is just a small story.

<h2 id="h-who-is-aj-scaramucci">Who Is AJ Scaramucci?</h2>



<p><strong>AJ Scaramucci is a wealthy venture capitalist, and you might know the name as he is the son of former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci.</strong></p>



<p>After winning the card, Scaramucci told Paul he wanted to collect even more unique items:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m on a quest to buy a T-Rex dinosaur fossil, I’m going to buy the Declaration of Independence, and I’m not stopping there. This was only the beginning.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>You can’t knock the man’s ambitions! It remains to be seen if Scaramucci manages to obtain any of his other targets. The guarantee is that he now owns the only PSA 10-graded Pikachu Illustrator card in the world—the only one of the 39 to 41 cards printed.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-did-logan-paul-buy-his-pokemon-card-for">How Much Did Logan Paul Buy His Pokémon Card For?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A record broken. Credit to Logan Paul</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It seems like peanuts now, but Logan Paul had originally set the record for the most expensive Pokémon card trading purchase when he bought the Pikachu Illustrator card for $5.275 million in 2021.</strong></p>



<p>Not bad profit, all things considered. Paul has made about $10 million profit from selling the card, and the Guinness World Record you can see above now goes to AJ Scaramucci.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>If Scaramucci is true to his word about collecting, then this record is likely to be broken again, and no one else will ever get to own this particular Pikachu Illustrator. If you have other ideas, you’d better get saving.</p>



<p>Is any collector’s card worth this much money? Or has AJ Scaramucci got himself an item that anyone would do anything for?

<p>One of the most well-received games of 2025 could be heading to Xbox Game Pass. A post on social media on Monday talked about the future of additions to Xbox Game Pass this year, with a not-so-subtle tease of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</p>



<p><strong>“We’ve got quite the release slate lined up for Xbox Game Pass so far, this is going to be a huge year,”</strong> <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/2023442179625259508?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the “email” reads.</a> <strong>“Oh, and speaking of upcoming releases… well, I shouldn’t say too much, but if you’re getting quite hungry for a fun adventure, all I can say is that something big is about to be deliverance’d to Xbox Game Pass…”</strong></p>







<p>While not specifically naming the game, using the term “deliverance’d” is a dead giveaway for what’s to come. Xbox is getting ready to announce the next wave of games for the service, which could see it come sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>The original Kingdom Come: Deliverance is already available on the subscription service for those with an Ultimate, PC, or Premium membership.</p>
