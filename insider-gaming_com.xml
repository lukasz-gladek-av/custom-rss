<p>WWE 2K26 is just about two months away, and players will have some new matches to enjoy when they load up the game.</p>



<p>In addition to learning that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CM Punk will be the featured superstar</a> in the game’s Showcase mode, sources have told Insider Gaming what to expect from match types this year.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-are-the-new-wwe-2k26-match-types">What Are The New WWE 2K26 Match Types?</h2>



<p>In total, there are four new match types coming to this year’s game. One of which, Insider Gaming understands, has been in the works for quite some time.</p>



<p>The first new type is the I Quit match. The match hasn’t been seen since WWE 2K14, but is making a return after 13 years (the game launched in October 2013).</p>



<p>Another match returning after 13 years is the Inferno Match. In it, players can win by setting their opponent on fire. As you perform heavier moves, the flames will get larger. The last returning match is the 3 Stages of Hell. A match type that hasn’t been seen since the days of Smackdown vs. Raw, this match has players select three different stipulations for a 2-out-of-3 falls match.</p>







<p>As far as the new match coming, the Dumpster Match is making its debut in the WWE 2K series. While it’s unsure, at this point, exactly how it’ll work, it’s possible that it’ll be akin to the casket match. Exact details on the match are expected to come in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>One last bit regarding a match type that debuted last year, Intergender Matches are returning to the game. It’s also been said that they will even be a part of MyFACTION.</p>
