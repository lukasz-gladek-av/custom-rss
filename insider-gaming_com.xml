<p>Hasbro has provided confirmation that the highly anticipated GI Joe game featuring Snake Eyes has not been cancelled. </p>



<p>Atomic Arcade’s GI Joe Snake Eyes title is something that players have heard close to nothing about since its announcement. We have only heard that the game moved to pre-production in 2023, and there was a listing in 2024 that hinted at an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gi-joe-could-be-an-open-world-game-according-to-recent-job-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world setting</a>. No other update since then, but it seems the title has survived. </p>







<h2 id="h-atomic-arcade-reportedly-shut-down-but-gi-joe-snake-eyes-is-not-cancelled">Atomic Arcade Reportedly Shut Down, But GI Joe Snake Eyes is Not Cancelled</h2>



<p>The confirmation that GI Joe Snake Eyes is not cancelled comes from a Hasbro statement to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-shut-down-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-makers-atomic-arcade/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wccftech</a>. Hasbro has stated that the game is not cancelled, but the development team is in the process of determining the way forward for the title. No decisions are final as of now, and updates will be provided as soon as they can. Interested readers can check out the full statement below: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<em>The Snake Eyes game is&nbsp;not cancelled. The team is currently taking time to evaluate the path forward for the game. While decisions haven’t been finalized, we’re committed to providing updates as soon as we’re able</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The statement came in response to the original report, which discussed a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dominicbraun_opentowork-ugcPost-7429184369929539585-DIod?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAADh_g-QBx3rdrvALH0qxv35Q0muLbIQKclU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> post by Atomic Arcade’s gameplay programmer, Dominic Braun. Braun’s post states that he was “affected by Hasbro’s and Wizards of the Coast’s decision to close Atomic Arcade.” Hasbro has not provided clarity on whether Atomic Arcade has been shut down. </p>

<p>A LinkedIn update reveals that PlayStation’s God of War 2018 and its sequel, God of War: Ragnarok, have generated over $1.4 billion in revenue. </p>



<p>God of War is easily one of the most popular franchises on Sony PlayStation, as was evident at the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play event</a>, where both announcements from the franchise stole the show. Now, we have received some numbers on how the recent games in the series have performed. </p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-2018-and-ragnarok-have-made-over-a-billion">God of War 2018 and Ragnarok Have Made Over a Billion</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/god-of-war-reboot-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a>, a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richfleider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> update by the Senior Managing Producer for Art at Santa Monica Studios, Rich Fleider, reveals that God of War 2018 and Ragnarok have easily crossed a billion dollars in sales. The update on their profile states, “God of War (2018) &amp; God of War: Ragnarök (Sony PlayStation) – Record-breaking Metacritic scores &amp; $1.4B+ combined sales.” Fleider was responsible for the studio’s largest art team, 70+ internal artists + 100s of external partners worldwide.</p>



<p>Both God of War (2018) and God of War Ragnarok have been released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam. The 2018 title marked a significant shift for fans, as their beloved character Kratos returned on a new console while exploring a brand new mythos: Norse mythology. The sequel, Ragnarok, built upon the original game’s foundation, offering players an even deeper narrative and introducing additional gameplay elements.</p>

            <guid>1438279</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Pokémon franchise is set for arguably the biggest year ever, with the 30th anniversary celebrations coming alongside major releases, significant changes to the competitive scene, and there’s likely to be even more on the horizon.</p>



<p>After the success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a/" id="2273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> last year, a boom in the TCG hobby, and two releases already confirmed for the year ahead with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-champions/" id="2457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Champions</a>, 2026 is set to be a big one, and Pokémon EUIC displayed the very best that the franchise has to offer.</p>



<p>Across four action-packed days in London for Pokémon EUIC, here are the main takeaways I learned from the event.</p>







<h3 id="h-pokemon-s-growth-shows-no-signs-of-stopping">Pokémon’s Growth Shows No Signs of Stopping</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The boom continues. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pokémon’s boom in the past decade, following the release of Pokémon Go, has been well-documented, and excitement for the franchise has reached fever-pitch levels heading into the 30th anniversary. However, it’s clear that this isn’t the height of the peak.</p>



<p>The attendance at Pokémon EUIC was over 17,000, including over 7,000 competitors, numbers that dwarf the Pokémon World Championships attendance from London 2022. Around a third of ExCel London was taken over by Pokémon, and there’s still plenty of room to grow.</p>



<p>With the VGC format moving to Pokémon Champions, lowering the barrier of entry as the title will also be available on mobile devices, and the Pokémon games venturing into new genres, Pikachu and the gang are here to stay.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokopia-could-be-the-next-pokemon-go-like-hit">Pokopia Could Be The Next Pokémon Go-Like Hit</h3>



<p>The release of Pokopia is now just a few weeks away, and the latest entry in the Pokémon franchise blew me away in my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview/" id="176556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a>, showing it can have the same sort of momentum that Pokémon Go did a decade ago.</p>



<p>Pokémon Go was a title that spread like wildfire across the world, bringing new fans into the Pokémon franchise, and Pokopia has the ability to do the same. With an Animal Crossing-like approach and a clear cozy vibe, new gamers could be attracted, and diehard fans will also be thrilled with the experience.</p>



<p>The Pokémon Company has not been afraid to venture into new genres and try out new things in recent years, and fans can reap the benefits.</p>



<h3 id="h-lego-pokemon-sets-are-incredible">LEGO Pokémon Sets Are Incredible</h3>



<p>Ever since the first reveal of the debut <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-pokemon-scavenger-hunt-codes/" id="169235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Pokémon</a> sets, it was clear that they were going to make waves, but having now seen the sets in person, they completely blew my socks off.</p>



<p>There are no stickers on the sets, with the eyes and any other accents all printed directly to the bricks, showing a more premium approach to the set. Of course, with the high prices of LEGO, fans will expect the very best, and this is exactly what they are getting.</p>



<p>It’s not long now until the LEGO Pokémon sets will arrive in the hands of fans worldwide, and I can’t wait to see what other sets are on the horizon this year.</p>



<h3 id="h-competitive-pokemon-is-much-tougher-than-i-imagined">Competitive Pokémon is Much Tougher Than I Imagined</h3>



<p>I’ve always been more of a collector in the world of Pokémon, both in the games, hunting down everything needed to fill out my Pokédex and in the world of the TCG, and I truly had no idea just how tough the competitive scene truly is.</p>



<p>The tactical approaches in the VGC scene were far beyond what I could envision, with competitors always trying to be two steps ahead, and my head was spinning with the knowledge those in the TCG had. Add in the quick reactions of those playing UNITE and Go, and it was incredible to witness.</p>



<p>Esports continues to grow and will have greater prominence in the years to come, and Pokémon will certainly have a big part to play.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-world-championships-is-a-bucket-list-addition">Pokémon World Championships Is A Bucket List Addition</h3>



<p>The one major thought that stuck with me throughout the weekend at EUIC and since I returned home is that I need to attend a World Championship, and I’ve got my eyes on San Francisco in August.</p>



<p>I loved every single second of Pokémon EUIC, and attending such a huge event has immediately led to attending Worlds jumping into my bucket list.</p>



<p>I highly recommend that any Pokémon fan look to attend one of the major events, and to keep an eye out for Pokémon Play! Schedules, to meet other members of the community and have an experience you’ll remember for the rest of your lives.</p>







<p>There’s no denying there’s a lot of negativity often spread around Pokémon, particularly on the TCG side of things, and the difficulty getting your hands on sealed product, but there was zero sign of this at EUIC.</p>



<p>Instead, the weekend was filled with moments that show the very best of the Pokémon community. One parent of a competitor in the Junior TCG category told me about how other parents rallied to help create a replacement deck after an initial one was lost, ensuring they wouldn’t have to exit the tournament. While the original deck was found, the new deck, including cards from a variety of languages, showed the very best of the community.</p>



<p>Throughout the entire event, everyone I spoke to was welcoming, there was absolutely no gatekeeping, and every attendee was there to share their love of the Pokémon franchise.</p>
