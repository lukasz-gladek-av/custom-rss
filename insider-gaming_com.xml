<p>Welcome everyone to Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast for January 31, 2025. In this week’s episode: Xbox is doubling down on multiplatform releases, Battlefield doesn’t want to screw up again, and the layoffs continue across the games industry.</p>



<p>Mike, Grant, and Albert also play quick gaming trivia that Grant may or may not have been prepared for. Oh, and Tom Henderson joins to talk about the latest gaming rumors and speculation regarding Ubisoft (again), the next God of War game being set in Egypt, and even Marvel Rivals’ developers hiding fake characters in the game in order to catch leakers.</p>

<p>The news <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-sims-re-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirms reports</a> from earlier this week that EA was set to announce the release of both games on Friday.</p>

<p>The games will be available to purchase in three different bundles: The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle, The Sims: Legacy Collection, and The Sims 2: Legacy Collection.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-the-sims-25th-birthday-bundle-includes">What The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle Includes</h2>

<h2 id="h-your-old-saves-work">Your Old Saves Work</h2>



<p>If you happen to still play The Sims 1/2 or just happen to have an old save file, EA says that players will be able to bring their old saves into the newly released versions of the game. Both titles will also support original mods, but EA did make it clear that they haven’t all been tested to guarantee they work.</p>



<p>“It’ll be up to individual Mod creators to ensure Mods work with the new version,” EA said.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date%E2%80%94release-time-platforms-editions-and-price.1097145/</guid>

<p>2025 is going to be supersized thanks to the presence of a new Monster Hunter game. Capcom is back with Monster Hunter Wilds, and the monster-slaying sequel has a release date, along with information on its platforms, price, and many more mammoth details.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is looking to outdo the enormous success of 2018’s Monster Hunter World. The franchise has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-series-hits-100-million-in-cumulative-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold millions</a> upon millions of copies and has a worldwide fanbase. It might be because it’s Capcom, or possibly because slaying oversized creatures after a minutes-long struggle is exhilarating—and few do it better.</p>



<p>It’s probably safe to say Monster Hunter Wilds is one of 2025’s biggest games, and I wanna dive into the good stuff.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-release-date">Monster Hunter Wilds Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’re a bit big. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds has a February 28 release date.</strong></p>



<p>This means it’s coming into direction competition with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a>, but they’re very different games with unique audiences. <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is one of February 2025’s biggest launches, and its January 28 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> can’t come soon enough!</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-release-time">Monster Hunter Wilds Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>It’s unlikely Monster Hunter Wilds will release simultaneously for everyone, so expect a worldwide midnight launch on release day.</strong></p>



<p>This means New Zealand gets its hands on Monster Hunter first, with America, and other regions, needing to wait a bit longer. The footage and what we’ve seen suggests any extra wait is worth it. Just be sure to <strong>stay off social media for spoilers</strong> as you never know who’s going to leak what details!</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-platforms">Monster Hunter Wilds Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>It’s a full-on current-gen release for Monster Hunter Wilds with PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC launches.</strong></p>



<p>A game with the scale of Monster Hunter Wilds was always going to suggest the PS4 and Xbox One were missing out. It’s sad, given the impact of the two consoles, but they’re quickly becoming outdated and unable to run more modern games with great efficiency. </p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch is also another notable (but expected) omission—but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> could get a port down the line.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-price-amp-editions">Monster Hunter Wilds Price &amp; Editions</h2>



<p><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds Standard Edition is £69.99 and £64.99, whereas you’re looking at $89.99 and £79.99 for the Deluxe Edition, and $109.99 and £99.99 for the luxury of the Premium Deluxe Edition.</strong></p>



<p>These are the recommended retail prices and digital figures. If you’re buying a physical edition of Monster Hunter Wilds, online and in-store retailers should have offers and various discounts to bring this eye-watering cost done.</p>



<hr>



<p>How much are you looking forward to hacking and slashing away at monsters? Is there any realm where Capcom fails to deliver on the enormous expectations and hype?</p>



<p>If you can’t wait for Monster Hunter Wilds, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-how-to-join-dates-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Beta</a> might be something you need to check out and get involved with.</p>
