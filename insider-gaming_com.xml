<p>Ubisoft’s major financial update for FY24-25 is here, and it has made clear a few tantalising details about the company. One of the most interesting tidbits was the lifetime earnings of Ubisoft’s brands and live service titles. It was revealed that as a standalone game, Rainbow Six Siege has almost made more money than every other Ubisoft franchise.</p>



<p>That’s a <strong>lot </strong>of dollars.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impressive-performance">Impressive Performance</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege was released in 2016 as Ubisoft’s flagship competitive shooter. It has since become one of the most beloved FPS games on the market, giving way to a thriving esports ecosystem, amongst other things. It is one of the best definitions of the live-service operating model in the gaming world – and it’s still expanding.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5kn4pUVx6Vtb1Hir4vpqvq/fe35b53a1514635b0257418d1409d9e1/Ubisoft_FY25_H1_Earnings_PR_vFinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the recent financial report</a> published by Ubisoft, it was revealed that since 2016, Rainbow Six Siege has made a whopping €3.5 billion ($3.8 billion). It sits just behind <strong>the entire Assassin’s Creed series </strong>at €4 billion ($4.3 billion) and has beat the Far Cry series, which has made just €2 billion ($2.1 billion).</p>



<p>Elsewhere, several franchises have just topped €1 billion in consumer spending:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Division</li>



<li>Ghost Recon</li>



<li>Just Dance</li>
</ul>



<p>That means that if Rainbow Six Siege were to somehow secure €500 million in sales <strong>right now</strong>, it would single-handedly beat the consumer spending for every other Ubisoft franchise ever created, regardless of how long they’ve been on the market or how many games they’ve seen added to their lineup.</p>



<p>Ubisoft further confirmed that Rainbow Six Siege boasts a whopping 30 million unique active users, many of which will be contributing to the ongoing financial stability of the game.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has confirmed one of the reasons for the delay of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. In its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/investors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent earnings call</a> on Wednesday, the studio was asked about Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ delay, and whether there is a possibility of another one to later in 2025.</p>



<p>Chief Corporate Finance Officer Frédérick Duguet reiterated that the game has been feature complete, and that the delay was done to add more polish to the game as opposed to anything else.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-nightingale-developer-inflexion-games-is-laying-off-staff">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nightingale-developer-inflexion-games-is-laying-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightingale Developer Inflexion Games Is Laying Off Staff</a></h6>



<p>“We wanted to make sure that the delivery of the experience is impeccable on day one, so that was the purpose of the decision,” he said. “So we have a good visibility for the game to be delivered with a great experience by mid-February, and with great quality.”</p>



<p>He again said that the company is confident in a February release with a “great experience” and “great quality”. </p>



<p>As far as any specific reasons for the delay, Duguet said that the response to Star Wars Outlaws played a part in delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>“On the back of what we saw with Star Wars Outlaws, we need to really make sure that we come with an impeccable player experience on day one,”  he said. “Of course there are always some bugs, but we’ve been focusing, and we’re continuing to focus on, making sure that the day one experience will be well optimized.”</p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws released on August 30, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-sales-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">struggled to reach one million copies</a> sold in the time frame that Ubisoft had hoped. </p>



<p>Regarding the price for delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Ubisoft said that it added roughly $21.7 million to development costs. The company also announced in September that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-to-get-rid-of-traditional-season-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abandoning the traditional Season Pass</a> model for the game.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has held a company call to update shareholders on the first-half performance of FY 2024. This call was pitted with negativity, with the firm’s leadership expressing a downturn in the portfolio that has led to drops as significant as -28.9% year-on-year. </p>



<p>While playtime and MAU counts are <strong>up</strong>, spending is down, and the recent poor performance of Star Wars: Outlaws has caused further internal issues at a time when things are already critical. However, the company’s CEO, Yves Guillemot, has reassured everyone that despite XDefiant’s woes, games-as-a-service remains a core strategy moving forward.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-much-to-say">Not Much to Say</h2>



<p>In one question lobbied at Ubisoft’s CEO during the recent financial call, the radio silence around XDefiant was noted. One analyst questioned why Ubisoft wasn’t talking about XDefiant and asked if it was an example of games-as-a-service not panning out for the firm.</p>



<p>To that, Yves Guillemot said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>XDefiant is behind our expectations but the games-as-a-service strategy remains core.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>XDefiant was released in May 2024 as a live-service first-person shooter, and it’s due to kick off its third season of content in the coming months. Unfortunately for Ubisoft, the shooter has been plagued with issues since it dropped, and despite it being free and readily available, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the player count has dwindled</a> and gamers have lost interest.</p>



<p>And now, games like Black Ops 6 have stripped XDefiant’s audience to the bare bones.</p>



<p>In the recent earnings call, Ubisoft confirmed that sales were down 19.6% year-on-year, and back-cat net bookings were down by as much as 28.9%. Despite the drop in sales, playtime is up 9% and MAUs across Ubisoft’s suite of games sit at around 37 million, which marks a 3% increase YoY.</p>



<p>Yves Guillemot continued to reassure shareholders:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Despite recent setbacks, we are continuing to deeply transform Ubisoft in order to restore the level of creativity and innovation that built Ubisoft’s success while delivering stronger execution and predictability.</p>



<p>To succeed, we must redouble our focus on execution and reinforce a player-centric mindset in everything we do. For example, we are improving the quality of Star Wars Outlaws, including actively addressing player feedback through title updates as we get ready for the Steam launch, the first story pack, and the upcoming holiday season. </p>



<p>We are also taking the additional time to ensure that the upcoming very ambitious opus in our flagship franchise, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, is a highly polished, exceptional experience on day one and that it resonates strongly with players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ubisoft has been in several tricky spots over the last few months, dealing with strikes, concerns of historical inaccuracies in the upcoming Assassin’s Creed Shadows (which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may have contributed to delays</a>), and suffering with the weight of layoffs and tightening purse strings.</p>
