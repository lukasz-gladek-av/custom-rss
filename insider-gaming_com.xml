            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Valve is getting closer to pulling back the curtain and releasing its next SteamVR headset to the world. According to one Chinese analyst group, the next headset has reportedly entered mass production. </p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/valves-next-headset-reportedly-enters-mass-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UploadVR</a>, XR Research Institute claims that a production of 400,000-600,000 headsets is happening for the device that has been codenamed “Deckard”. There’s even the belief that the headset, which is expected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steams-new-vr-headset-might-have-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to be called the Valve Frame</a>, could be announced and released before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Adding to the legitimacy of the claim, Valve insider Brad Lynch says that Deckard DV1 and DV2 models recently appeared in the SteamVR Beta. According to Lynch, <strong>“DV units are the final stages before the model (PV) that consumers will buy.”</strong></p>



<p>No other details regarding pricing or specs are currently known. What is expected, however, is that the headset will launch alongside the new “Roy” controllers being developed for the device.</p>



<p>The SteamVR headset isn’t the only piece of tech Valve has been working on. During the summer, what appears to be Valve’s next attempt at a console, Valve Fremont, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared for the first time</a> on the benchmarking website Geekbench. The appearance on the site suggests a device featuring a six-core/12 thread processor running at 3.2 GHz with 8GB of DDR5 memory and a custom AMD RX 7600 GPU. Those specs, however, can always change between now and when the device officially launches. </p>



<p>What do you think of a new SteamVR headset coming from Valve as soon as this year? When do you think it’ll be officially announced?

<p>During a new interview, the VP general manager of Dice and Criterion spoke about not using generative AI in Battlefield 6. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 finally launches today, October 10, on all platforms. Ahead of the release, the developers have revealed several details about the title through interviews, with the lead producer recently stating that the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-should-be-ready-for-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">servers should be ready for launch</a>. Now, another person from the development team has spoken about generative AI and BF6. </p>



<h2 id="h-generative-ai-is-very-seducing-but-won-t-be-used-in-battlefield-6">Generative AI is ‘Very Seducing’ But Won’t be Used in Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>During a new interview with the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBC</a>, the VP general manager of Dice and Criterion, Rebecka Coutaz, spoke about Battlefield 6 and generative AI. Coutaz first stated that players will not see GenAI in BF6; however, it was used in the preparatory stages to provide “more time and more space to be creative.” The VP added that GenAI “is very seducing”, but at the moment there is no way to incorporate it into the daily work that the developer does. </p>



<p>Coutaz discussed GenAI further, stating that they can “break the magic with AI,” enabling them to be more innovative and creative. According to the VP, GenAI is “not anything to be scared of in our industry”. The gaming industry is “an environment at the bleeding edge of technology,” where teams are accustomed to change. The only challenge is how they can productively incorporate them into their workflows, which helps them take their games to the next level.  </p>



<p>In other news, the Battlefield 6 community is already making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-community-is-already-making-star-wars-ships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars ships</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty maps</a>. Additionally, players on PlayStation can earn more XP than those on Xbox or PC. What are your thoughts on Battlefield 6 not using generative AI?

            <title><![CDATA[PS6 To Release In 2027, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps6-to-release-in-2027-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1321765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The release of the PlayStation 6 (PS6) is only two years away. That, according to a known gaming hardware leaker.</p>



<p>After a recent video featuring PlayStation’s Mark Cerny and AMD’s Jack Huynh was posted, discussing the future of technology between the two parties, questions began to mount about when the next PlayStation console would be released. On the discussion forum <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/from-project-amethyst-to-the-future-of-play-amd-and-sony-interactive-entertainment%E2%80%99s-shared-vision.1688947/page-4#post-270885018">NeoGAF</a>, a user mentioned 2027 being “on the table” for the new system. That led to KeplerL2, who’s been accurate with hardware information in the past, to chime in.</p>



<p><strong>“Not just on the table,”</strong> they said, <strong>“it’s the plan unless any unexpected delays happen.”</strong></p>



<p>A 2027 release date shouldn’t surprise too many people. Rumors have long suggested that Sony’s next-gen console is expected in either late 2027 or early 2028. As far as what to expect from the system, there have been claims that Sony is planning to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-console-and-new-ps6-handheld-canis-specs-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release a standard</a> PS6 along <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-handheld-console-will-be-dockable-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a dockable</a> PS6 handheld. </p>



<p>Rumored specs for the PS6 include 40-48 RDNA 5 compute units, 160W TBP, 8 x Zen 6 Cores, a 160- or 192-bit memory bus, and backwards compatibility with PS5 and PS4 games, among others.</p>



<p>As with any claim like this, please take the information with a grain of salt until Insider Gaming can independently verify the plans or Sony confirms them itself.</p>



<p>Do you believe the release of the PS6 will happen sometime in 2027, or will it be later? Leave your thoughts down in the comments below, and&nbsp;join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t normally associate Battlefield 6 with Star Wars. This is the case, though, as a fascinating video has shown how easy it is to use Battlefield 6’s Portal tools to create Star Wars Star Destroyers to engulf the sky.</p>



<p>The force is with Battlefield 6 players. Well, it’s with those who have the imagination to use it. We’ve already reported on people <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remaking classic Call of Duty maps</a> within hours of the game’s launch. If you thought to yourself, ‘How do you better this?’ the answer is simple: Make Star Destroyers, of course.</p>



<h2 id="h-people-are-making-star-destroyers-in-battlefield-6-portal-mode">People Are Making Star Destroyers in Battlefield 6 Portal Mode</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re going to see a lot of crazy creations. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even if you’ve never watched a Star Wars movie, chances are you’ve seen the mammoth Star Destroyers, which are comically large, and their construction is used for a sole purpose: Occupying space.</p>



<p>We’ve seen Star Destroyers for decades in Star Wars movies, and they’ve been a prominent presence in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnitemares-2025-twitch-drops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>. It’s time for the behemoth-like vehicles to enter the fray in Battlefield 6—as shown by <a href="https://x.com/Matavatar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Matavatar</a>.</p>



<p>As you can see in the video below, using basic Battlefield 6 Portal assets, you can easily make a Star Destroyer. It feels on brand with what Portal is going for, but it remains to be seen if the content is allowed to remain.</p>



<p>Disney is infamously hard on copyright and licensing infringements, and this could be considered such. Hopefully, this isn’t the case, and we can have custom Battlefield Star Wars maps!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What wild and wacky creations have you seen in Battlefield 6 so far? Is there anything on his level or scale?
