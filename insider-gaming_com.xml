<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-last-caretaker/" id="3556">The Last Caretaker</a> is currently unfolding in early access and impressing gamers worldwide. It’s an ambitious, emotional game that presents players with the utmost freedom, sending them into a world devastated by rising oceans and tasking them with preserving the remnants of humanity, hundreds of years after they’ve left the planet.</p>



<p>Channel37, the game’s developer, has just unveiled the bulk of The Final Frontier, the game’s second major update since it was released in December 2025 in early access. It’s fairly accurate to say this update is <strong>huge</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-ways-to-sail-new-places-to-sail-to">New Ways to Sail, New Places to Sail To</h2>



<p>The Final Frontier has just been released, marking the arrival of the second major expansion to The Last Caretaker. Despite the name, it’s just the beginning for this open-world sandbox, which we recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/reviews/the-last-caretaker-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awarded a 9/10 in our full review</a>.</p>



<p>The update starts with new ways to explore the game. Players are tasked with finding a new location, ‘Rocky Islands’, which leads to them unlocking the CS-17 Courier Skimmer, a <strong>Jet Ski</strong>-type craft. This is contained within a whole new biome that itself contains more quests to uncover.</p>



<p>Additionally, Channel37 has added ‘The Maze’, a tricky facility that’s not hard to find, but is hard to escape from once you’re lost within. That, too, contains more quest lines to discover.</p>



<p>The order of the day with The Final Frontier is deeper customization, and with that in mind, players can tweak their all-important vessel with 37 paint styles, all of which are free to find around the world. Additionally, new tools, such as the ‘deep ocean floor sonar’, have been added.</p>



<p>Channel37 has introduced a stack of quality-of-life improvements and adjustments with The Final Frontier, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Better building visualization and snapping</li>



<li>New dismantling visuals per material</li>



<li>Animation and usability improvements</li>



<li>Improved underwater visibility</li>



<li>More data logs to find</li>



<li>New achievements</li>



<li>Performance and stability upgrades across physics, rendering, buoyancy, cables, and UI</li>
</ul>



<p>The Final Frontier is totally free to download and explore, and it represents the second in a very long line of updates planned for The Last Caretaker.</p>
