<p>Talking about the most unexpected collaborations, a Borderlands 4 x PGA Tour 2K25 crossover is happening tomorrow. </p>



<p>Borderlands 4 has had a highly successful launch, becoming the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-was-the-best-selling-game-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game</a> in its first month. However, to keep the hype going, the developers will keep adding more content and doing some crossovers as well. And the first crossover has been announced —it’s with another 2K title. </p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-x-pga-tour-2k25-post-teases-new-content-for-the-game">Borderlands 4 x PGA Tour 2K25 Post Teases New Content for the Game</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/borderlands-4-confirms-pga-tour-2k25-crossover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameRant</a>, the official confirmation about the Borderlands 4 and PGA Tour 2K25 crossover comes from the latter’s official <a href="https://x.com/PGATOUR2K/status/1982858198425235500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The official post, however, doesn’t provide any concrete information about the content of this crossover. The only thing confirmed is the release date for the collaboration, set for Wednesday, October 29, 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even though no information about the crossover has been revealed, players can make some predictions based on the image in the announcement post. First things first, it seems like PGA Tour 2K25 players will get their hands on a Psycho skin. On top of that, the character is seen holding a golf club, which includes some form of cybernetic enhancement. Lastly, if the background is a hint, then a new golf course inspired by Kairos might be on the cards as well.</p>



<p>However, this is just speculation based on the teaser image; none of the details have been officially confirmed by the developers. </p>



<p>In other news, a new Borderlands 4 Vault Hunter has been revealed as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-borderlands-4-vault-hunter-revealed-as-part-of-first-dlc-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of the first DLC</a>. Additionally, NBA 2K26 has become the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game</a> in the United States.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts (EA) employees are reportedly frustrated and even mocking the company internally over its push to use more AI in its development and other areas of work.</p>



<p>According to a new report from Business Insider, higher-ups at EA have<strong> “spent the past year urging its nearly 15,000&nbsp;employees to use AI for just about everything.”</strong> This includes anything from code to concept art to even <strong>“scripting conversations with direct reports about sensitive topics such as pay and promotions.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-employees-are-worried-about-their-jobs">Employees Are Worried About Their Jobs</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Employees who spoke anonymously</a> to the outlet say that they are encouraged to use the in-house chatbot called “ReefGPT”, despite it producing “flawed code and other so-called hallucinations that they need to correct.” Those on the creative side, like character and level design, say that they are expected to train the AI software on their own created work. It’s led to a belief and frustration that these decisions will ultimately lead to the company no longer needing that type of talent, with layoffs to come.</p>



<p>Even one former employee, a senior QA staffer at Respawn, believes that AI was at least partly to blame for his job loss this year. He told the outlet that AI was <strong>“able to perform a key part of his job — reviewing and summarizing feedback from hundreds of play testers.”</strong></p>



<p>This mandate within EA to use AI has even led to mocking among employees. One meme sent within the company Slack, according to Business Insider, depicts the following:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>A meme posted last month to a Slack channel for employees at Electronic Arts shows a cartoon man asking a trio of CEOs what they want. They answer in unison: “AI!” Then the man asks, “AI to do what?” The CEOs reply, “We don’t know!” The man follows, “When do we want it?” The CEOs cheer again: “Right now!” Dozens of the video-game company’s staff responded with crying laughing emojis.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>EA declined to comment to Business Insider for the story. They also haven’t responded to Insider Gaming’s request for comment. Should any public statement be made, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Black Ops 7 Vault Edition is the most premium way to experience and enjoy the newest Call of Duty release. We’ve got answers to all the crucial questions regarding its price, where and how to buy, and what you’re getting for your hard-earned dollars.</p>



<p>Treyarch is back with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. It represents the second year in a row where we’ve gotten a Black Ops release. Everyone’s looking forward to no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-skill-based-matchmaking-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skill-based matchmaking</a>, and there’s an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extensive roadmap of season one content</a> already announced.</p>



<p>If you’re already buying the new Call of Duty title, you should consider whether BLOPS 7’s Vault Edition is right for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-black-ops-7-vault-edition">How Much is Black Ops 7 Vault Edition?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More Blackcell beckons. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 7’s most expensive version—the Vault Edition—costs $99.99 or £99.99.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve bought or seen previous Vault Editions, you’ll be somewhat pleased to see there’s no price increase. That said, it’s still a hefty wad of bills required to buy the priciest Call of Duty edition.</p>



<p>Should the cross-gen edition not meet your criteria, consider spending a bit more for the Vault Edition. Read on for reasons why you should consider doing this.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-black-ops-7-vault-edition">Everything Included In Black Ops 7 Vault Edition</h2>

<p><strong>The Vault Edition comes with a plethora of bonuses from the BlackCell Pass to new Skins, Mastercrafts, and Unlock Tokens in Black Ops 7.</strong></p>



<p>We’ve seen Ultimate Editions that don’t really justify their price tag. To be fair, Black Ops 7’s Vault Edition does come loaded with handy consumables and longevity benefits that reward you for playing the game.</p>



<p>Let’s check out the full extent of Vault Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>4 Operator Skins:
<ul>
<li>Harper</li>



<li>Karma</li>



<li>Reaper EWR-3</li>



<li>T.E.D.D.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>5 Mastercraft Weapons</li>



<li>8 Ultra Rarity GobbleGums</li>



<li>BlackCell Season One Battle Pass:
<ul>
<li>20 Tier Skips</li>



<li>1,100 CP</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Cross-Gen Bundle (PS4 &amp; PS5)</li>



<li>Mastercraft Collection</li>



<li>Operator Collection</li>



<li>Permanent Black Ops 7 Unlock Token</li>



<li>Ultra GobbleGum Pack for Zombies</li>
</ul>



<p>We said it didn’t skimp on the special items! You’re covered across Zombies and online multiplayer with a variety of one-time consumables. </p>



<p>Plus, while BLOPS 7 is cutting down on the over-the-top content and skins, you’ve still got some mindbending Mastercrafts to look forward to through the Vault Edition.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-black-ops-7-vault-edition">How to Get Black Ops 7 Vault Edition</h2>



<p><strong>The best way to get the Vault Edition is by accessing the platform of your choice through the Black Ops 7 site and pre-ordering it before launch to ensure you’ve got your copy locked in.</strong></p>



<p>Again, let’s cut the chatter for now, and let you know the best way to approach this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/gb/en/store/games/blackops7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 official website</a>.</li>



<li>Click <strong>Pre-Order Black Ops 7 </strong>in the top-right corner of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down, and make sure <strong>Vault Edition</strong> is selected.</li>



<li>Choose one of the five platforms available:
<ul>
<li>Xbox</li>



<li>Xbox PC</li>



<li>PlayStation</li>



<li>Battle.net</li>



<li>Steam</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>



<p>Note: The Vault Edition is a <strong>digital-only</strong> purchase. If you like your physical media, you’re out of luck with the Vault Edition.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for advice on whether to buy the Vault Edition, you can always discuss this with people in the comments or head on over to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>
