            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>PlayStation State of Play from February 12 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">littered with announcements and trailers</a>, but nothing from Bungie about their upcoming PVP extraction shooter, Marathon. Marathon was one of a few prolific titles that weren’t featured, leaving fans confused as to why Bungie’s first big project post-Destiny wasn’t shown.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-was-marathon-not-at-state-of-play">Why Was Marathon Not At State of Play?</h2>



<p>According to Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb, Marathon wasn’t shown because Bungie is probably going to hold their own showcase event for it, likely in April of this year. During yesterday’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72WmrtMEfm8&amp;t=1980s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Mess Decides show</a>, Grubb said that this decision falls right into the Bungie playbook.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Marathon wasn’t here because they’re probably going to do their own thing. Bungie does their own thing usually for Destiny. They’re going to adopt that same ‘we’re going to talk to our audience’ strategy this year as well. I think April [is] when we probably hear from them about Marathon. And it would be its own thing separate from a State of Play.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The new Marathon game, not to be confused with the older Marathon trilogy from made by Bungie in the 1990s, was revealed in 2023. Considering the success Bungie has found with Halo and Destiny, and given their recent acquisition by PlayStation, expectations for Marathon are quite high.</p>



<p>Marathon is already going through the ringer during its development process. In 2024, the game’s director Christopher Barrett was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-director-fired-at-bungie-over-inappropriate-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly fired due to inappropriate conduct</a> towards several female employees. Barrett has denied these claims and has since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-marathon-director-sues-sony-and-bungie-denies-conduct-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a lawsuit</a> against Bungie. The last official update regarding the game itself came <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this past October</a>, from new game director and former director for VALORANT, Joe Ziegler. Ziegler says there have been some “aggressive” changes to gameplay over the past couple years following several playtests. He also said that different parts of the game are at different stages of development.</p>



<p>Can Bungie’s Marathon live up to the hype? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon.1133/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>The first Elden Ring Nightreign network test session has come and gone, and it resulted in for frustration than fun for many users. Due to what FromSoftware called “congestion”, many couldn’t take part in the first session</p>



<p>The issues ultimately led to the PlayStation Servers going down for maintenance during the test. Afterwards, FromSoftware took to social media to apologize for the issues.</p>



<p>“We apologize for the inconvenience caused by the game server issues,” the <a href="https://xcancel.com/ELDENRING/status/1890404327560208502#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media post</a> said. “Work is currently ongoing to improve the stability of the Network Test.”</p>



<p>The developer then added that they are considering an extra test session to make up for the problems with the initial run. As of publishing, there are still four more Elden Ring Nightreign Network Test sessions scheduled for the weekend. </p>



<p>Those times are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>February 14: 7pm-10pm PT / 10pm-1am ET</li>



<li>February 15: 11am-2pm PT / 2pm-5pm ET</li>



<li>February 16: 3am-6am PT / 6am-9am ET</li>



<li>February 16: 7pm-10pm PT / 10pm-1am ET</li>
