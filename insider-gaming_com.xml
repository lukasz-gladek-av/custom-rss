<p>The Classic Themes, released on the PS5s for PlayStation’s 30th Anniversary, will be gone on January 30, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, you read that right. Today might be the last time you will see and hear the classic tune and appearance you experienced every time you booted up your PlayStation 5. However, everything is not lost, as the console maker revealed they are working “behind the scenes to bring these special designs back in the months ahead.” However, that doesn’t mean that there are “plans to create additional themes in the future.” They are just celebrating the legacy of PlayStation hardware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those wondering, for a limited time, players could choose between multiple different themes for their PlayStation 5: 30th Anniversary, PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, or PlayStation 4. These themes add special effects inspired by the console generation to the homepage and during the boot-up process, creating a nostalgic impact every time you switch on your console or scroll through the games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Themes were introduced on PlayStation consoles during the PS3 and PS4 eras, and players could change the backgrounds, sounds, and icon appearances for their home screens on the fly. However, since the PS5, PlayStation has decided to use dynamic game images as backgrounds and completely dropped the idea of themes. It was nice to have them back for some time, and players hope they return soon.</p>

<p>The voice cast for Sniper Elite Resistance isn’t massive, but one voice sticks out above the rest, and that’s Harry Hawker. His name has drawn attention and it’s time to reveal who has lent their talents to the 2025 Sniper Elite protagonist.</p>



<p>I covered a lot of juicy details in my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance review</a>. It was a fair assessment of a series I’m quite fond of, and one I will continue to play. I’ve predominantly been accustomed to the presence of Karl Fairburne over the years, but it’s the part-time persona of Harry Hawker who takes the lead in Sniper Elite Resistance.</p>



<p>His performance is headline-grabbing, and it’s time to remove the hood from the voice actor—kind of.</p>

<p><strong>The available information tells us it’s likely Klemens Koehring reprising his role as Harry Hawker for Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>I say “likely,” because I have scoured the internet and gone to the furthest reaches of the Earth to find conclusive proof it’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2182668/?ref_=fn_all_nme_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Klemens Koehring</a>. There’s nothing definitive, but all signs point to the talented voice actor—a multi-lingual extraordinaire who’s given his talents to various video games, TV, and movies.</p>



<p>Crucially, <strong>Klemens Koehring voiced Harry Hawker in Sniper Elite 4</strong>—confirmed by the game’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6528142/?ref_=nm_flmg_knf_c_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDB page</a>. I can certify Klemens is a voice actor in Sniper Elite Resistance (more on this soon) and Harry Hawker would make the most sense.</p>



<p>I’ve said the performance has garnered attention, and that’s because of the character’s distinctness and uncanny resemblance to Jason Statham. It’s been a topic of discussion for Resistance, but any press is better than none!</p>



<p>If it turns out Klemens Koehring isn’t the voice actor for Harry Hawker and is simply part of the project, we’ll be sure to update this guide and correct it.</p>

<p>The voice actor pool is a small one for Sniper Elite Resistance, and it includes <strong>Klemens Koehring</strong>, along with other talents such as <strong>Atilla Akinci</strong> and <strong>James Goode</strong>.</p>



<p>Atilla Akinci has voiced characters in Greedfall 2, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty. Whereas James Goode has provided voiceover work for Diablo 4, Final Fantasy 14, and also Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty.</p>



<p>There’s a wealth of talent in Sniper Elite Resistance, and it deserves to be recognized. As you can see, only names are listed, not their roles, making it slightly more difficult to declare Klemens’ role.</p>
