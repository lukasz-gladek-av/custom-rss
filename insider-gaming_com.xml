<p>If you like games, you’ve probably heard the name Hollow Knight: Silksong at some point. Its disappearance into the seemingly abyss following its 2019 announcement was curious. Thankfully, it resurfaced in 2025, it’s coming out this year, and we’re here to let you know if you need to play the first game beforehand.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-hollow-knight-silksong-a-sequel-or-prequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong is a direct sequel to 2017’s Hollow Knight</a>. The Knight has stepped aside in the new game so that Hornet can take center stage. If you’re a newcomer to the series, this all might sound more foreign than if I’d written this in an alien-like language. </p>



<p>This guide is to help you if you’re not well-versed in the Hollow Knight world. You should be excited for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong</a>, and you should have all the details ahead of its long-awaited release.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-i-play-hollow-knight-before-hollow-knight-silksong">Should I Play Hollow Knight Before Hollow Knight: Silksong?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’re having fun either way. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It is not essential or a requirement for you to play Hollow Knight before Silksong, but I recommend you do so, as it will help you to appreciate Silksong’s improvements and new content.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://hollowknightsilksong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Silksong</a> puts you in the shoes of Hornet—a prevalent character in Hollow Knight. By playing the original, you get to understand Hornet’s roots better, how she ties into the world, and why we’re suddenly controlling her instead of The Knight.</p>



<p>Team Cherry has said that Silksong will be a good introduction for new players. It’s a different world with fresh mechanics, but Silksong still has basic tutorials and pointers on how to get started. There will be plenty of first-time players and consumers of Hollow Knight media likely following the hype train.</p>



<p>What I will say is that Silksong was originally planned as DLC for Hollow Knight. So you get the sense that this is a genuine continuation of the world that came before. All things considered, <strong>I recommend you sink a few hours into Hollow Knight before Silksong</strong> to become acquainted with the world, movement mechanics, and the vibe of the franchise.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-worth-playing-in-2025">Is Hollow Knight Worth Playing in 2025?</h2>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight is 100% still worth playing in 2025, as it’s considered one of the all-time great indie games and is still incredibly fun to play nearly 10 years later.</strong></p>



<p>To reiterate, Silksong is a new chapter in Hollow Knight. New abilities, new bosses, new biomes, and much more. Playing Hollow Knight means you get to enjoy and appreciate the foundation laid down before Silksong; you get to experience boss fights you would miss out on otherwise, and even small details, such as backgrounds and the soundtrack, need to be enjoyed and savored.</p>



<p>When you think of the Metroidvania genre, or find anyone’s ‘best Metroidvania games of all time’ list, Hollow Knight will be on it. Do yourself a favour and find time to play it—even if it’s only after Silksong.</p>



<hr>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> is the ideal place to share your favorite Hollow Knight memories, stories, and theories. I recommend you go there to help out newcomers and open up deep conversations with long-time fans.</p>



<p>You should also read about whether <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-physical-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong will have a physical release</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-hollow-knight-silksong-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if it has Early Access</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-platforms-ps5-xbox-pc-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all platforms</a> the game’s coming to.</p>

<p>2025 is the turn of Hornet in Hollow Knight: Silksong. A new character and setting have raised questions about Hollow Knight: Silksong and its sequel or prequel status, and we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is real, Hollow Knight: Silksong is happening, and Hollow Knight: Silksong releases September 4. The original game feels like a lifetime ago. I’m grateful we’re getting Silksong at all. One of the biggest changes this time around is the main character. The Knight has been replaced by Hornet—a recurring presence throughout the OG Hollow Knight.</p>



<p>This guide is here to let you know if Hornet’s adventure is a prequel or if she’s the new face around the place.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-silksong-a-sequel-to-the-original-game">Is Hollow Knight: Silksong a Sequel to The Original Game?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hornet has some sting. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Cherry has declared Hollow Knight: Silksong to be a fully fledged sequel and is a brand-new story set after the events of Hollow Knight.</strong></p>



<p>You actually need to go as far back as Silksong’s reveal announcement for this answer. The original article appears to have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190408202952/http://teamcherry.com.au/hollow-knight-silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">archived</a>, but on 14 Feb. 2019, Team Cherry declared that Silksong was in development and that: “<strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong is the epic sequel to Hollow Knight.</strong>“</p>



<p>So, we’ve known Silksong is a proper sequel since the beginning! Silksong started as DLC, but Team Cherry’s vision for the content quickly grew to the point that it made more sense to create a new game entirely. It explains <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why Hollow Knight: Silksong took so long to release</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-knight-appear-in-hollow-knight-silksong">Will The Knight Appear in Hollow Knight: Silksong?</h2>



<p><strong>There has been no official mention of The Knight appearing in Hollow Knight: Silksong—but this doesn’t mean it won’t.</strong></p>



<p><strong>*SPOILER ALERT: You have been warned.*</strong></p>



<p>2017’s Hollow Knight has multiple endings, and pretty much all of them end with The Knight sacrificing himself or becoming one with The Void. Team Cherry has said before that each ending is considered “canon,” so it’s fully open to interpretation what has truly happened to The Knight.</p>



<p>The Knight will easily go down as an all-time character for its design and heroism in 2017’s Hollow Knight.</p>



<p>You’d think a The Knight appearance would be kept a surprise. My guess is that we <em>will </em>see The Knight in Hollow Knight: Silksong in some Void capacity. It would also be fun if DLC or a special bonus skin could be unlocked that changes Hornet into The Knight!</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you hoping to see The Knight appear in any capacity? Does Silksong need to be careful with the story, given the importance of its predecessor? Let me know all your thoughts and more through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p>IG has plenty of other Silksong guides and content: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-physical-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Will Hollow Knight: Silksong have a physical release?</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-hollow-knight-silksong-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">does Hollow Knight: Silksong have Early Access?</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if it’s coming to Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[What Does C9 Mean in Marvel Rivals?]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals continues to be one of the most popular games around, and ranked mode can throw up plenty of engagement in chat. If you’ve seen a C9 message and don’t know what it means, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<p>The Netease title continues to go from strength to strength, with Marvel Rivals developers regularly interacting with the community to explain controversial topics, like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-explain-matchmaking-system-after-player-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">matchmaking system</a>, and to provide content updates.</p>



<p>With fast-paced action, players will often use abbreviations and slang to communicate in chat, and the C9 term is a common sight. To help you understand, we’ve got a full explanation.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-c9-mean-in-marvel-rivals">What Does C9 Mean in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A confusing message. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>C9 in Marvel Rivals is a short, taunting message used when a team neglects to capture a control point or objective, when it’s readily available to capture with ease, and loses a round or match as a result.</strong></p>



<p>The term refers to Esports team <a href="https://cloud9.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cloud9</a>, with the meme stretching back to an Overwatch tournament in 2017, where the team lost several rounds due to abandoning the objective on multiple occasions in a single match against the Afreeca Freecs Blue.</p>



<p>Given that Marvel Rivals and Overwatch share a lot of similarities, it’s not too surprising to see the term make its way into Marvel Rivals, particularly in Ranked mode.</p>



<p>Messages containing C9 will most likely be shared by opponents at the end of a round or the match, mocking mistakes made by your team. Common situations where this can occur are neglecting to capture an objective when it’s there for the taking, particularly if pushing for kills on enemy players outside the zone.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-respond-to-c9-messages-in-marvel-rivals">How to Respond to C9 Messages in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p><strong>Don’t respond with trash talk to any C9 messages sent in Marvel Rivals, as it could lead to temporary or permanent bans from the game. Instead, ignore them.</strong></p>



<p>The C9 term can help you improve, however, as it’s a sure indicator that your team made a big mistake in the match. If you’ve seen this message in chat, go back and watch the replay to see where the mistake happened and what you could do better to improve.</p>



<p>Using replays in this way is a great way to improve your performance in Marvel Rivals, particularly in ranked matches, and was one of the biggest tips that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-sentinels-aramori-confident-more-women-will-make-marvel-rivals-esports-breakthrough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sentinels pro Aramori gave Insider Gaming in an exclusive interview</a>.</p>
