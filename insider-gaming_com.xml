<p>Cloak &amp; Dagger is the most picked hero during Marvel Rivals Season 1.5 across both competitive and quick play. But the duo’s massive popularity isn’t deterring the balance team at NetEase from giving them a significant buff to their direct healing ability.</p>



<p>An already incredibly pick rate for Cloak &amp; Dagger could skyrocket even more after this next Marvel Rivals balance update.</p>



<h2 id="h-cloak-amp-dagger-will-get-buffed-in-marvel-rivals-season-1-5-balance-update">Cloak &amp; Dagger Will Get Buffed in Marvel Rivals Season 1.5 Balance Update</h2>



<p>As part of a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250311/41667_1217797.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“mid-season balance update for Season 1.5,”</a> Cloak &amp; Dagger is receiving a strong buff to the direct healing power of Dagger’s Lightforce Dagger. <strong>The direct healing effect from Lightforce Dagger on hit allies is increasing from 10 to 16</strong>. To balance this, the “spell field healing amount” that heals another nearby ally is being reduced from 18 to 16. </p>



<p>While this does mean Cloak &amp; Dagger’s ability to heal a wider group with their primary fire is slightly decreased, the amount of direct healing done to one target is getting a huge boost. Cloak &amp; Dagger’s full “clip” of 12 Lightforce Daggers will provide 192 points of healing to one ally instead of 120. Given that Dagger’s Light Explosion and Dagger Storm abilities are more geared towards healing a larger group anyway, these changes to Lightforce Dagger are a huge improvement.</p>

<p>According to Marvel Rivals pick data websites <a href="https://rivalsmeta.com/characters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsMeta</a> and <a href="http://While this does mean Cloak &amp; Dagger's ability to heal a wider group with their primary fire is slightly decreased, the amount of direct healing done to one target is getting a huge boost.

Given that Dagger's Light Explosion and Dagger Storm abilities are more geared towards healing a larger group anyway, these changes Lightforce Dagger are a huge improvement." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsTracker</a>, Cloak &amp; Dagger is the most picked hero in both competitive and quick play. Both sites claim Cloak &amp; Dagger has a 50.44% pick rate in competitive play. The next highest is Invisible Woman at 44.39%, and then it’s a big drop down to number three: Rocket Raccoon at 28.99%. RivalsMeta tracks far fewer matches for quick play matches, but lists Cloak &amp; Dagger as the second most picked hero in that mode behind Invisible Woman.</p>



<p>Human Torch and Iron Man will also receive changes in the mid-season balance update for Season 1.5. Human Torch’s primary Fire Cluster projectile speed and count are increasing, and his Supernova ultimate is getting a damage increase but with an increased energy cost. The direct damage of Iron Man’s primary Repulsor Blast is getting decreased, but the damage dealt by the pulse is increasing.</p>

<p>The SAG-AFTRA strike involving video game performance actors is set to continue after the latest negotiations have failed to result in a new deal. In an <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/member-message-video-game-strike-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update posted</a> on its official website Tuesday night, the union’s chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland for the video game strike says there has been progress in some areas, but it’s not enough to curb the concerns the union has about “A.I. Abuse”.</p>



<p>“Though progress has been made and agreements have been reached on certain provisions since we launched our strike last year, the last proposal the bargaining group made is still filled with alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to A.I. abuse,” the statement reads. “The union recently submitted a counter to this proposal that diligently addresses all of the loopholes and would result in a contract that offers the minimum protections our members need in order to maintain sustainable careers as video game performers.”</p>



<p>The statement continues to say that the “bargaining group” wants to paint a picture than a deal is close. Crabtree-Ireland says that it’s not the case and it’s part of a hope to have union members “turn on each other”.</p>



<p>“They want to use all past performances and any performance they can source from outside the contract&nbsp;without&nbsp;any of the protections being bargained at all,” Crabtree-Ireland wrote. “You could be told nothing about your replica being used, offered nothing in the way of payment, and you could do nothing about it. They want to be able to make your replica continue to work, as you, during a future strike, whether you like it or not. And once you’ve given your specific consent for how your replica can be used, they refuse to tell you what they&nbsp;actually&nbsp;did with it.”</p>



<p>In response to the latest statement from the union, representatives on behalf of the studios provided a statement to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. </p>



<p>“”We have proposed a deal that includes wage increases of over 15 percent for SAG-AFTRA represented performers in video games, as well as enhanced health and safety protections, industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor’s performance in other games,” spokesperson Audrey Cooling said. “We have made meaningful progress and are eager to return to the bargaining table to reach a deal.”</p>



<p>The current video game actor strike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began in July 2024</a>.  Despite it continuing, however, the union says that “more than 160 games” have signed interim and independent agreements to allow them to work wit SAG-AFTRA members.</p>



<p>“Those agreements contain the protections we have been asking the bargaining group for — terms that are clearly feasible and acceptable to a great number of game companies of all sizes, even as the bargaining companies resist,” the union says.</p>
