            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-stepping-down-replacement-named.1277805/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Longtime CEO of Bungie, Pete Parsons, is stepping down from his position as of today. The news came right in the midst of Gamescom, but a replacement has been named, fortunately. </p>



<p>Parsons, who joined the studio in 2003, has worked on several of the studio’s major titles, like Halo 2 and Destiny. Becoming CEO of the company in 2016, he helped launch Destiny 2 and worked with PlayStation on the studio’s controversial acquisition in 2022. For many, he has been the face of the company for quite a while, so the news is quite shocking.</p>



<h2 id="h-justin-truman-now-ceo-of-bungie-replacing-pete-parsons">Justin Truman Now CEO of Bungie, Replacing Pete Parsons</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are proud to announce that Justin Truman will be stepping up as Bungie’s new Studio Head as Pete Parsons retires from his position to pass the torch to a new generation of leaders.<a href="https://t.co/VSBMccZiXZ">https://t.co/VSBMccZiXZ</a></p>— Bungie (@Bungie) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1958622787813122374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on Bungie’s official website, memos from both Parsons and new CEO Justin Truman were posted. Parsons spoke on his leave, saying,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“After more than two decades of helping build this incredible studio, establishing the Bungie Foundation, and growing inspiring communities around our work, I have decided to pass the torch,” Parsons said. “This journey has been the honor of a lifetime. I am deeply proud of the worlds we’ve built together and the millions of players who call them home – and most of all I am privileged by the opportunity to work alongside the incredible minds at Bungie.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>New Bungie CEO, Justin Truman, also spoke on the matter in the post previously mentioned, stating,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I am committed to supporting and working alongside every member of the team here as we continue pouring our hearts and souls into these worlds,” says Truman. Worlds that we love, and that we hope have been worth your time and your passion. Because ultimately those worlds only exist, and thrive, with you in them.&nbsp;We are hard at work right now doing that – both with Marathon and Destiny. We’re currently heads down, but we’ll have more to show you in both of these worlds later this year.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Truman, who joined Bungie in 2010 to work on Halo Reach as an engineer, has spearheaded much of Destiny 2’s community efforts. In the game, he worked as the Gameplay Experience Director. It seems like the Bungie CEO change isn’t going to delay Marathon or Destiny, as far as we know. While Destiny 2 is still going strong with new expansions, Marathon has had some tough times getting out of the gate. Still, the multiplayer FPS plans to release before the fiscal year ends, though exact details are not clear.</p>



<p>Are you surprised by Parsons’ decision to leave Bungie? Do you think Truman is the best choice for CEO? Let us know in the comments and on the forums</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After eight years, Escape From Tarkov is finally leaving beta as the release date for Version 1.0 has been announced.</p>



<p>In a trailer posted online, Battlestate Games revealed that Escape From Tarkov 1.0 will launch on <strong>November 15, 2025</strong>. The release comes over eight years after it first entered beta and 13 years after initial development began. </p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-escape-from-tarkov-1-0">What to Expect From Escape From Tarkov 1.0</h2>



<p>While no details of what will be in 1.0 were given with the announcement, past reveals should give players an idea of what to expect. First thing’s first, Escape From Tarkov 1.0 is expected to include a dedicated storyline that will see you actually attempt to, as the name suggests, escape from Tarkov. Escaping will then see your character reset, starting things fresh. </p>



<p>In addition to the storyline, elements such as clans and more factions are also slated to be added. Lastly, a vast amount of gameplay updates and changes to mechanics, maps, weapons, and more should come.</p>



<p>Currently, you can buy Escape From Tarkov on PC for $50 for the Standard Edition for the game. There are three other editions, including a $250 “Unheard” Edition that gives access to future DLC, Escape From Tarkov: Arena, and the game’s PvE mode. </p>



<p>Are you excited to finally see what Escape From Tarkov version 1.0 looks like when it launches in November?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-actors-gta-5-leads-advice-get-ready-for-it/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98just-get-ready-for-it%E2%80%99-gta-5-leads-give-advice-to-gta-6-actors.1277679/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I made my way to the ROG super-sized booth at Gamescom, and who did I bump into but Shawn Fonteno and Ned Luke, otherwise known as Franklin Clinton and Michael de Santa from 2013’s Grand Theft Auto 5. The pair were there with ROG and were promoting the new ROG Xbox Ally X, but I pulled them aside for a brief chat, diving quickly into the topic of Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>Amidst their impressions of the trailers and what they’re most excited for, I asked Ned and Shawn if they’d imparted any GTA-related wisdom on the actors in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-it-ll-probably-last-another-10-15-20-years">‘It’ll Probably Last Another 10, 15, 20 Years’</h2>



<p>Even now, the actors behind Lucia and Jason in Grand Theft Auto 6 haven’t been confirmed, <strong>but people have their suspicions</strong>. When I ran into Shawn Fonteno and Ned Luke at Gamescom, I knew I had an opportunity to delve into the topic with some of the most in-the-know people: the most recent lead actors in the Grand Theft Auto franchise.</p>



<p>With that in mind, I asked Shawn if he’d had the opportunity to impart his wisdom and experience on the new generation of actors in GTA 6:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If I knew who they were, I would. I tell them in interviews to get ready, you know? (They’re) fitting to go on a great ride, it’ll probably last another 10, 15, 20 years or something. Just get ready for it, it’s an experience that me, Ned, Steven, the whole GTA 5 cast, we’re still riding this wave.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Either Fonteno was playing coy with me, or he genuinely doesn’t know who is behind Lucia and Jason in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>What Ned and Shawn said makes complete sense, though. In 2013, Grand Theft Auto hit the shelves and never saw any additional story content or expansions released. They stepped into the booth roughly between 2010 and 2013, and then as soon as the game came out, they never looked back.</p>



<p>And yet here they are, 12 years later, still beloved parts of a thriving GTA community.</p>



<p>That’s what Ned alluded to:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You can’t imagine what it’s like. We love our fans, they’re awesome, they’re very loyal. The thing that’s great about our fans is that they appreciate us, and they don’t really know that we appreciate them more than they appreciate us. If we didn’t have the fans, we’d have nothing. We’re lucky to have that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will be released in May 2026. Until then, millions of fans worldwide will continue to explore the story portrayed by Shawn Fonteno, Ned Luke, and Steven Ogg (Trevor Philips) more than a decade ago.</p>



<p>Let me know who you think the actors in GTA 6 are on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-world-map-techland-diverse/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-dying-light-the-beast-has-%E2%80%98the-most-diverse-world%E2%80%99-techland-has-ever-created.1277643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dying Light: The Beast will be released next month, and right now, it’s my most highly anticipated game of the year. I had the pleasure of catching up with the game’s director, Nathan Lemaire, at Gamescom, and we took a deep dive into all things Dying Light: The Beast. When we spoke, I was hot off an hour-long session of The Beast and <strong>full of burning questions</strong>.</p>



<p>One thing I was eager to discuss was the world. When Dying Light: The Beast was revealed, one of the concerns amongst fans was the ‘smaller scale’ of the game. As it turns out, The Beast has a <strong>pretty damn impressive world</strong> ripe for exploration.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-the-map-in-dying-light-the-beast">How Big is the Map in Dying Light: The Beast?</h2>



<p>I tried my best to scope out the largest portion of the map possible when I played Dying Light: The Beast this week at Gamescom. I am very happy to confirm that it’s a fair size, and even if it’s not <strong>the biggest </strong>map in the series, it has the potential to be the best <strong>by far</strong>. There are stacks crammed into Castor Woods, making it a world rich with potential.</p>



<p>When I interviewed Nathan Lemaire behind the scenes at Gamescom, that game world was a topic we covered, and Nathan filled me with excitement for the exploration opportunities ahead:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We wanted to come back to something that is more grounded, but we also wanted to explore some new settings. With Castor Woods, we have created probably<strong> the most diverse world we have ever created </strong>for this franchise, mostly because you’ve got the Old Town, then an industrial biome, some farmland, or swampy areas, a village…</p>



<p>What’s cool is that it creates a renewed experience across each biome.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But just how full is the map in Dying Light: The Beast? That’s something else I needed to know:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One thing that I like to repeat is that Castor Woods hides many secrets. We have lots of little things for players (to find).</p>



<p>We have things that are hidden, like there are some maps that players can find that lead to secret locations, and they will find interesting things there.</p>



<p>We have a lot of collectibles that expand the lore, some trivia about Castor Woods and the people there; it’s really full of little things like this.</p>
