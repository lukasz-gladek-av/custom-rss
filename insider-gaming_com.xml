<p>In the early 2000s, Sony faced a new competitor to its PlayStation business when Microsoft launched the original Xbox. With that new competition sparked a genuine concern from Sony that led to them getting exclusive release rights to the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) games of the era for the PlayStation 2.</p>



<p>Chris Deering, the former president of PlayStation Europe, recently spoke to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/stories-from-30-years-of-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz,</a> and shed some light as to why  PlayStation wanted an exclusive agreement for GTA 3, GTA: Vice City, and GTA: San Andreas.</p>



<p>“We were worried when we saw Xbox coming,” Deering said. “We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields, like Sky TV with sports. Just as Christmas was approaching when Xbox would launch, a few of us went out to our favourite third-party publishers and developers, and we asked them, ‘How would you like a special deal if you keep your next generation game on PlayStation exclusive for a two-year period?’ And one of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn’t clear that Grand Theft Auto 3 was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top down game.”</p>



<p>Deering added that PlayStation was “lucky” with the deal because of how it paid off for the company. </p>



<p>“It was very lucky for us,” he said. “And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid.”</p>







<p>The games ultimately saw a release on Xbox, but not before they became the best-selling games in the history of PS2. San Andreas became the best-selling PS2 game ever while the other two games, Vice City and GTA 3, became the third- and fifth-best selling games.</p>



<p>GTA 3 and Vice City released on Xbox on November 4, 2003 while San Andreas came to Xbox in June 2005.</p>

<p>Riot Games continues to tout the growth of its VALORANT esports scene, now having completed two seasons of its international partnership league. Like it does with League of Legends, Riot has completely run VALORANT esports all by itself since the game launched in 2020.</p>



<p>Prior to the start of the 2025 VALORANT Champions Tour season, Riot has announced the end-of-year results for its 2024 campaign, revealing yet another massive chunk of change brought in by player spending.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-here-comes-the-money">Here comes the money</h2>



<p>According to Riot, the company shared $44.3 million from digital goods with the partnered teams competing in VCT 2024, up from <a href="https://valorantesports.com/en-US/news/vct-2023-eoy-letter-to-the-community" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$33 million in 2023</a>. With 44 teams competing across the four leagues last year, that averages out to just about $1 million per team. Since Riot takes 50 percent of the revenue from digital goods, that means that players spent roughly $88.6 million in total on VCT-themed digital goods.</p>



<p>The digital goods in question refer to two primary items: VCT partner team capsules and the Champions bundle. At the start of the year, Riot introduced VCT partner team capsules, which both teams and fans were highly anticipating. Each team had a bundle with a team-specific Classic pistol skin, a player card designed by the team itself, a logo gun buddy (charm), and a logo spray. New capsules are expected to be released near the start of the 2025 season.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The other main draw for digital goods is the yearly Champions bundle, which includes unique weapon skins and accessories celebrating the VALORANT world championship. This year, for the first time, all partnered teams received a share of Champions bundle revenue, not just the 16 teams that qualified for the event.</p>



<p>Between digital goods, stipends, and prize pool winnings, Riot claims to have given out $78.4 million across the 44 partnered teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is there a specific VALORANT team bundle you want to buy next year? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The talks surrounding a potential buyout at Ubisoft continue to pick up steam. After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-considering-buyout-with-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports first surfaced</a> in October of a buyout to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-buyouts-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take Ubisoft private</a>, the Guillemot family have continued to have discussions with potential partners.</p>



<p>In a new report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a>, Ubisoft’s owners have continued discussions with Tencent and other investors regarding a buyout of one of the world’s largest game studios. According to the report, the Guillemot family has made it known to potential buyers that it wants to retain control of the company.</p>



<p>It was added that Tencent hasn’t decided whether to increase its in the company or not. However, part of talks with the Chinese company involve preventing “any potential hostile takeover of Ubisoft by other investor.”</p>



<h6 id="h-related-exclusive-yves-guillemot-s-internal-memo-about-xdefiant-closure-and-the-future-of-ubisoft">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-about-xdefiant-closure-and-the-future-of-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXCLUSIVE – Yves Guillemot’s Internal Memo About XDefiant Closure and The Future of Ubisoft</a></h6>



<p>Tencent is the second-largest stockholder in Ubisoft, owning 10% of the company. A reason for a delay in a decision stems from the company wanting a “greater say on future board decisions including cash flow distribution”. The report claims that the Guillemot family hasn’t agreed to that provision.</p>



<p>In response to the report, an Ubisoft spokesperson told Reuters, “We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options.”</p>



<p>Tencent declined to comment on the report.</p>



<p>When the latest update first broke, stock trading for the company was temporarily suspended. However, upon resuming, share prices jumped 13% as of publishing. </p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced the cancellation</a> of its free-to-play Call of Duty competitor XDefiant. Insider Gaming was the first to report on the game’s shutdown.</p>
