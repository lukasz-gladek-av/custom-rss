            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report discusses the Xbox Cloud Gaming ad-supported tier launching in 2026 and how it will work. </p>



<p>For those unaware, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-preparing-free-xbox-cloud-service-with-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report from last year</a> mentioned a free Xbox Cloud Gaming platform supported by ads which doesn’t require a Game Pass subscription. It seems this tier might be released in 2026, as teaser images of the service have already started surfacing online, suggesting an ad-based playtime model. </p>











<p>For those unaware, an image surfaced last week for Xbox Cloud Gaming, which stated “1 hour of ad-supported playtime per session”. The messages shown in the image appear to be an error, and a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xbox-cloud-gaming-will-get-an-ad-supported-tier-this-year-rumors-coalesce-after-ad-support-notices-appear-prematurely" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a> report explains how this service will work. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The report stated that the ads will not apply to all Xbox Cloud Gaming tiers; instead, they will apply to a separate tier. Players who use Xbox Cloud Gaming with ads will be able to stream Xbox Games they purchased digitally, but will not have access to Game Pass titles. </p>



<p>The upcoming ad-supported Xbox Cloud Gaming tier will remove the requirement to have purchased at least one tier of Game Pass to access cloud gaming titles. Additionally, the exact release date for when the service drops hasn’t been revealed; however, Jez Corden has been told it is releasing “this year.” Maybe we could get an official reveal at the upcoming Xbox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-games-confirmed-for-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Developer Direct</a></p>



<p>The amount of playtime they will receive and the duration of ads they will have to watch were not revealed. However, the report from last year stated that Microsoft was testing “a limit of one hour for sessions, with up to five hours free a month.” These details are subject to change when the service officially drops. </p>







<p>In other news, the next Xbox will reportedly feature “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-will-reportedly-feature-full-bore-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-bore Windows</a>.” Do you think the Xbox Cloud Gaming ad-supported tier will be released in 2026?

<p>Rockstar North, a developer of GTA 6, has been hit by reports of an explosion, with police and fire services on the scene in Edinburgh responding.</p>



<p>The offices, located in Scotland, are currently cordoned off by police following reports of an explosion at around 5 AM GMT, with early suggestions, yet to be confirmed, stating a boiler was the cause.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/police-have-cordoned-off-rockstar-north-after-explosion-reportedly-caused-by-malfunctioning-boiler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, <a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-fire-crews-rush-ongoing-33257244.amp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EdinburghLive stated</a> that Scottish Fire &amp; Rescue have been on the scene for over two hours since reports of the incident came in, with a statement provided to the outlet that said the team “mobilised three pumps and four of our specialist appliances.”</p>



<p>A spokesperson told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0lx7x5d81lo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBC</a> that firefighters were called out to deal with structural damage at the building and crews were stood down at 9:21 AM GMT.</p>



<p>No deaths or injuries have been reported, and, while the cause is yet to be publicly confirmed, local outlets have stated it was a suspected boiler explosion.</p>



<p>Rockstar North is, of course, one of the developers working on the highly-anticipated sixth instalment of the Grand Theft Auto series, and the company has not commented on the incident.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/code-veronica-reveal-up-next-not-resident-evil-5-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>1409806</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A notable Resident Evil insider has stated that the RE5 Remake will not be announced in 2026; instead, Code Veronica Remake will be revealed.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Resident Evil 5’s voice actor made a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-5-voice-actor-hints-at-possible-30th-anniversary-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptic post</a> last week, leading the community to speculate that Resident Evil 5 Remake will be revealed on the franchise’s 30th Anniversary. However, it seems this won’t be the case, and a remake of an older title could be shown instead. The insider has also discussed reasons why this might be the case. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-code-veronica-reveal-reportedly-coming-in-2026">Resident Evil Code Veronica Reveal Reportedly Coming in 2026</h2>



<p>The latest bit of information comes from DuskGolem, who accurately leaked Resident Evil Requiem’s reveal and that Leon Kennedy would be part of the game. In the insider’s latest <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012597154825515449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter), they debunk the community’s theories that Resident Evil 5 Remake will be announced this year and reaffirm their claim that Code Veronica Remake will be revealed. </p>



<p>Late last year, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-remakes-scheduled-for-2027-2028-respectively-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that Code Veronica and Zero Remakes were scheduled to release in 2027 and 2028, respectively, with the former being revealed in 2026.</p>



<p>Another <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012675455250235692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> by the insider also discusses the probable reasons Code Veronica and Zero Remakes took priority over others. The first reason is surveys, where fans have apparently voted for these two titles to be remade. The second reason is that several devs at Capcom worked on the original RE Zero and have ideas to improve it. The third reason is seemingly scope and scale, where RE5 and RE6 are considerably bigger titles. </p>



<p>As always, readers should take this information with a grain of salt, as the information doesn’t come from an official source. </p>

<p>Bungie’s release date trailer for Marathon has leaked online, revealing a March 5, 2026, release. </p>



<p>After delays, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-artist-satisfied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagiarism controversy</a>, and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">art director leaving</a> just months before the release window, it seems Bungie is finally set on the Marathon release date. As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-march-2026-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> by Sony back in November 2025, Marathon will release this year in March, as a new leaked trailer confirms. </p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-releases-on-march-5-leaked-trailer-confirms">Marathon Releases on March 5, Leaked Trailer Confirms</h2>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qgvybm/marathon_release_date_trailer_leaked_5th_march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, Marathon’s release date trailer has leaked online, revealing new details. The trailer starts like most of their newer videos, blending gameplay and cinematics. Towards the end of the video, we finally get a release date revealed: “Coming March 5, 2026.” Pre-orders will begin when the trailer is officially dropped, and the Deluxe Edition will feature a ‘Midnight Decay Bundle’, two weapon skins, and additional content. </p>



<p>Leading up to the release, Marathon developers have provided extensive details about the upcoming Extraction Shooter. We already know about the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-devs-reveal-pricing-battle-pass-details-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pricing, battle pass details, improvements</a> across the board, and more. Additionally, just last week, we received details on the archetypes, abilities, and customisations you can do with Marathon’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-devs-reveal-details-on-runner-shells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Runner Shells</a>. There is no confirmation yet on when the trailer for the release date will officially drop. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Marathon is an upcoming FPS, PvPvE survival extraction title from Bungie, which takes players to the world of Tau Ceti IV, where you get to play as bio-cybernetic Runners. The goals are to scavenge zones for valuable items while indulging in fast-paced PvPvE combat. The game also focuses heavily on customisation, allowing players to craft unique playstyles using existing runner shells. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Former Assassin’s Creed Boss is Suing Ubisoft for $1.3 Million in Damages]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-million-damages/</link>
            <guid>1409779</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Former Assassin’s Creed boss Marc-Alexis Côté has filed a claim with the Superior Court of Quebec for $1.3 million in damages against Ubisoft.</p>



<p>The file comes months after Ubisoft announced that Marc-Alexis Côté <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/head-of-assassins-creed-has-left-ubisoft-after-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left the company voluntarily</a>, a claim which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-confirms-ubisoft-asked-him/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Côté later denied</a>, stating that he was “asked to step aside” from the company. </p>







<p>In a lengthy LinkedIn post, Côté said, “Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it. The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.”</p>



<p>He later continued, “But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside.”</p>



<p>The new report from <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CBC Radio Canada</a> states that Côté is now taking Ubisoft to court, claiming $1.3 million in severance pay and moral damages.</p>



<p>According to the report, Côté was told during a management meeting in late summer 2025 that Ubisoft’s new subsidiary with Tencent was looking to find a “Head of Franchise”, which was a position not offered to Côté. Instead, Côté was offered the position of “Dead of Production”, which would have seen him reporting to someone else.</p>



<p>The lawsuit states that in September, the position to lead a “Creative House” with abstract outlines was offered. After lengthy negotiations, Ubisoft reportedly asked him to make a decision on the changes, to which Côté formally demanded that the company pay him severance.</p>







<p>In response, Ubisoft reportedly told him not to show up for work as planned on October 13, and to continue his reflection period until the company responds to its formal notice. The next day, Ubisoft announced via a press release and internal emails that Côté was leaving his position voluntarily to&nbsp;<q>explore new opportunities</q>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment, but did not receive one prior to publication. Should one be received, we will update the article.</p>
