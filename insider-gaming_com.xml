<p>A reliable insider has revealed that the announcement for Starfield’s PS5 port will not arrive until 2026. </p>



<p>Starfield’s PS5 port is something players have been hearing about since the first lot Xbox titles made it over. We have already heard rumours about the space-adventure title releasing for PS5 in 2026, and now new rumours about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 port</a> have surfaced as well. However, it seems none of this will be officially announced this year. </p>

<p>NateTheHate was recently asked on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1980100112702660639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), whether he had any new information to share about Starfield’s PS5 launch. The insider replied stating “believe the announcement will be in 2026 unless plans change.” The insider had previously confirmed that the game is indeed releasing for the PlayStation 5, and the “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-is-coming-to-ps5-its-once-again-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intent</a>” of releasing the port should be announced in 2025. However, now it seems that players won’t see an announcement until next year. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-spring-2026-new-expansion/">report</a> from another source had stated earlier this year that Starfield and it’s new expansion should release for PS5 by Spring 2026. Moreover, a Starfield port for PS5 has never been ruled out by Microsoft. When Phil Spencer was asked about this specific topic, he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that “here’s no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place that it will find players where we would have business success for us.”</p>



<p>In other news, Bethesda teased Starfield ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terran Armada</a>‘ in an anniversary post. Additionaly, the developers have mentioned the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-next-starfield-dlc-still-cant-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next DLC three times</a>, but haven’t confirmed any details.
