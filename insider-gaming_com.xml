<p>In a post on social media, Rust’s COO, Alistair McFarlane, called out Delta Force’s development team for stealing assets from his game. In a new trailer that surfaced to promote an event in Delta Force, developed by TiMi Studio Group, an explosive asset was seen front and centre.</p>



<p>This was revealed by McFarlane as being ripped straight from Rust. He backed up his claim with receipts and later revealed that the Delta Force team had ‘reached out to apologize’.</p>



<h2 id="h-blatant-theft">Blatant Theft</h2>



<p>In a recent post on socials, Facepunch Studios’ COO, Alistair McFarlane, uploaded a screencap from a newly shared Delta Force trailer, which is several minutes long. He’d noticed that a brick of C4 and some circuitry seemed familiar. That’s because it was ripped from his own game, Rust.</p>



<p>The follow-up post from McFarlane showed exactly where that asset was, stating that it was ‘made full in-house’, and he even name-dropped the artist who created the explosive asset.</p>

<p>Several hours after posting the image and references, McFarlane responded with confirmation that Delta Force’s development team had reached out to apologize, and he stressed that the ‘matter is resolved.’</p>



<p>However, gamers in the comment section of these posts didn’t want Delta Force’s team to get off lightly, and tried suggesting that a mechanical spider seen in the opening of the trailer was a ‘Tick’ enemy from ARC Raiders, developed by Embark Studios.</p>



<p>It’s not, but it’s <strong>close</strong>.</p>



<p>The trailer uploaded by Delta Force was made to promote the game’s new season, which went live as the trailer dropped earlier today. Rust and Delta Force are two totally different games, but that’s besides the point.</p>



<p>Do you think TiMi Studio Group should be let off so lightly? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>In December 2025, 9 games will leave PlayStation Plus, including big titles like Battlefield 2042, Forspoken, and more. </p>



<p>PlayStation Plus is a subscription service known for providing online multiplayer access and a library of games for players to try. The library differs for the tier players are subscribed to, with three tiers to choose from: Essential, Extra, and Deluxe. We already saw the PS Plus Game Catalog add <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-game-catalog-new-games-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nine new games</a> this month, and now a similar number will be removed next month. </p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-plus-will-be-removing-9-games-in-december-2025">PlayStation Plus Will Be Removing 9 Games in December 2025</h2>



<p>If you head over to the PS Plus page on your PlayStation 5 console, you will see that the Last Chance to Play section has been updated with several new titles. Battlefield 2042 is one of them, as expected, since we have seen all Battlefield titles leave the library every month since the release of Battlefield 6. Other big names are Forspoken, Grand Theft Auto III, and Sonic Frontiers, which I’m sure have many fans.</p>



<p>Interested readers can check out the complete list of games that will be leaving PlayStation Plus in December 2025 below: </p>



<ul>
<li>Battlefield 2042</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto III</li>



<li>Arcade Paradise VR</li>



<li>Sonic Frontiers</li>



<li>Forspoken</li>



<li>Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge </li>



<li>Firefighting Simulator: The Squad</li>



<li>Surviving Mars</li>



<li>Star Trek: The Bridge</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you have never tried any of these games, I would definitely advise you to give some of them a shot before they are removed from the library. GTA III is a classic, Sonic Frontiers is a fun time, and Forspoken could be interesting to some as well. Each of their main stories requires around 20 or fewer gameplay hours and offers tons of side activities as well. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-playstation-plus-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption</a> will be coming to PlayStation Plus Game Catalog in December 2025. Additionally, PS Plus users can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-coming-to-playstation-plus-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download GTA 5 this month</a>.
