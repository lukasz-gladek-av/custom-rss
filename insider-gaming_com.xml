<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger is an action-packed adventure through time and space, with plenty to offer, but as it lands in a period stacked of new releases, questions about the game length are understandable.</p>



<p>With hundreds of Digimon to collect, a gripping story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and plenty of optional content to explore, prepare to sink many hours into Time Stranger.</p>



<p>For a full breakdown of exactly how many hours you can expect to put into Digimon Story: Time Stranger, for both a generic run and a completionist run, you’ll find all the details in our game length guide here.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-digimon-story-time-stranger">How Many Hours to Beat Digimon Story: Time Stranger?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to do. Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It will take around 40 hours to complete the main story of Digimon Story: Time Stranger, though that time is extended by side quests and difficulty level.</strong></p>



<p>Time Stranger features a host of side-quests to tick off, which add hours to the duration of the game, and it will take even longer if you want to tackle the longer side quests, like defeating all of the opponents in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-paradise-colosseum-great-omni-carnival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradise Colosseum</a>.</p>



<p>The length of the game also depends on the difficulty setting you’re playing on, and whether you can defeat bosses in a single attempt or need to retry several times. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-digimon-story-time-stranger-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Digimon Story: Time Stranger Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>A full completionist run in Digimon Story: Time Stranger will take an additional 100 hours on top of the main story.</strong></p>



<p>This is due to the vast number of tasks that need to be ticked off to boast 100% completion, including obtaining all Digimon, collecting all Digimon Cards, and defeating opponents in the Paradise Colosseum.</p>



<p>There are a whopping 471 Digimon in the game, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-dlc-season-pass-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more to be added in DLC</a>, and 451 cards to collect. Along the way, there’s also a hefty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-achievements-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">list of achievements and trophies</a> to earn.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, side quests can take a significant amount of time on their own, especially completing the Colosseum. With some battles only unlocking once specific requirements are met, this pumps up the required amount of time to play by a large amount.</p>

<p>FIFA 23, the last FIFA game by EA, will shut down its servers on October 30, 2025. </p>



<p>For those who don’t know, the agreement with Electronic Arts and FIFA came to an end a couple of years ago, with the former <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-officially-unveils-ea-sports-fc-to-replace-fifa-soccer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiling</a> EA Sports FC to replace the franchise. The EA FC series began after FIFA 23, making that the last FIFA game that EA created. </p>



<h2 id="h-fifa-23-servers-are-shutting-down-on-october-30">FIFA 23 Servers Are Shutting Down on October 30 </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/ea-sports-fifa-era-is-officially-coming-to-an-end-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FGZ</a>, confirmation that FIFA 23 will shut down its servers was announced on the EA Service Updates <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/legal/service-updates/a-h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page</a>. If you scroll down to ‘F’, the new update states that online services will no longer be available for Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5. Players will still be able to play the game offline; however, no online updates, online co-op, Ultimate Team, Pro Clubs, or any other online features will be available to the player. </p>



<p>The era for new EA FIFA games had already ended when the deal between the two parties ended. However, players now have a few days left to play the last EA FIFA game online, until the next one becomes available. Regarding the next one, 2K Games could potentially be developing the next mainline FIFA video game. EA has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-developers-arent-afraid-of-potential-fifa-2k-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that even if the rumors are true, they welcome the competition and “know how tough it is to make a football game.”</p>



<p>In other news, the first new FIFA game after the breakup with EA has officially been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-new-fifa-game-post-ea-breakup-announced-and-its-not-what-players-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>, and it’s not the game fans likely expected. Additionally, read about Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-addresses-rumors-surround-fifa-and-2k-sports/">addressing the rumors</a> surrounding a possible partnership between FIFA and 2K Sports.

<p>Excitement levels for the Fortnitemares event in Fortnite continue to rise, and further teasers have been shared by Epic Games showing the big collabs fans can expect.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s annual Halloween event has become a fan-favorite, with previous years including collabs with Saw, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, among others, and Epic Games is going big again.</p>



<p>The event, which is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-fortnitemares-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to kick off this week</a>, is yet to have full official details shared, but we know have confirmation of three major collabs.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnitemares-collabs-2025">Fortnitemares Collabs 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Peely-good collabs. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Official teasers were <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1975685374996312433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on Reddit</a> by the Fortnite team, showcasing promo art featuring Ghostface, Scooby-Doo, and R.E.P.O alongside recognisable Fortnite characters and items.</p>



<p>The Scooby-Doo Mystery Crew are depicted surrounded by thorns, likely a nod towards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doja-cat-is-coming-to-fortnite-as-fortnitemares-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doja Cat’s Mother of Thorns skin</a>, alongside a terrified Loot Llama, while Ghostface was shown with the reflection of a terrified Peely on his knife.</p>



<p>Finally, characters from R.E.P.O were shown with long arms and legs in order to fit the Fortnite style, a terrifying look in itself, running away from a zombie.</p>



<p>The build-up to Fortnitemares has already seen the return of several horror-themed outfits to the Item Shop, including Ash Williams, Leatherface, and there’s still more expected to be revealed in the coming days, including a Terrifier collab.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether any skins will be available for free through the event or if they are merely appearing in the Item Shop for purchase.</p>



<p>Usually, Fortnite makes some cosmetic items available to earn for free during Fortnitemares, although last year’s content did not include any free outfits.</p>



<p>What collabs do you want to see in Fortnitemares? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The PowerWash Simulator 2 release date is set for October 23, just two weeks following the announcement of the release date. It is releasing on all current-generation consoles and PC and will be included in </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-confirmed-for-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions</strong></a><strong> on day one.</strong></p>



<p>As a continuation of the first game, you will be cleaning all kinds of different buildings and all kinds of various objects covered in some nasty gunk across a total of 38 levels at launch. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-revealed-with-new-announcement-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">There are some new tools</a> you can use for the job, as well as the ability to take stuff to your shop, clean it, and decorate the headquarters with the newly cleaned items.</p>



<p>Friends will be able to join you in the fun as well. While online co-op was available in the original game, there is an added bonus of splitscreen local multiplayer this time.
