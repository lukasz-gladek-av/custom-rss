<p>Off The Grid, an all-new battle royale game splitting opinions everywhere has already held a massive tournament. Yesterday, 60 of North America’s most popular streamers dived into Off The Grid to win a portion of a $600,000 prize pool. It’s almost unheard of that a game so early in the development cycle hosts such a large tournament, but that’s crypto money for you, I guess.</p>



<p>By the time the dust had settled, a diverse roster of squads had picked up some sizeable prizes in Off The Grid’s All-Stars Invitational. The winners included retired Call of Duty pro players, Fortnite streamers, and the single biggest names in content creation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-backed-by-the-blockchain">Backed by the Blockchain</h2>



<p>Off The Grid has been splitting the community down the middle since it surfaced several weeks ago.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that Off The Grid is backed by blockchain technology and has heavy investment from cryptocurrency-focused firms, and that has been a sticking point with players everywhere. It’s a solid game, but the connection with crypto has been a hard pill for many to swallow, and that’s why the game is struggling to gain traction.</p>



<p>If it wasn’t for the developer stuffing the scene with money and prolific events like the All-Stars Invitational, Off The Grid would likely be passing under the radar.</p>



<p>During the recent tournament, 60 players entered the running in teams of three, with each game (of six) boasting a prize worth $60,000 for the top team, $20,000 for second place, and $10,000 for third-placed teams. Gunzilla, the game’s developer, has wasted no time enticing players to the platform with daily tournaments and cash prizes all over the place.</p>



<p>Here’s how it all went down, winners-wise:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Game 1</strong>: Team IceManIsaac</li>



<li><strong>Game 2: </strong>Team IceManIsaac</li>



<li><strong>Game 3: </strong>Team Holly</li>



<li><strong>Game 4: </strong>Team Huskerrs</li>



<li><strong>Game 5: </strong>Team IceManIsaac</li>



<li><strong>Game 6: </strong>Team IceManIsaac</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s a trend there, I think.</p>



<p>Team IceManIsaac was represented by the man himself, Skullface, and Aydan, some of the best battle players and champions in the world. Aydan has long been a superstar streamer in the Warzone space, and Skullface has claimed wins in the World Series of Warzone, so they’re well-placed to dominate any battle royale game like Off The Grid.</p>

<p>Black Ops 6 Ranked Play has been added to the game in record time, and to the chagrin of competitive players worldwide, it’s already packed full of cheaters. On social media, clips have surfaced from pro players and streamers revealing them being matched against stacked hackers disrupting the game for everyone else – as always.</p>



<p>It took one day for cheaters to throw Black Ops 6 Ranked Play off the rails.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-time">Every Time</h2>



<p>Every time Activision’s studios release a ranked mode in a Call of Duty game, it’s infested with hackers.</p>



<p>For those not in the know, Ranked Play is a competitive ecosystem with more restrictions, a tighter map and mode rotation, and more rewards than regular, non-ranked multiplayer playlists. Players relish the opportunity to dive into Ranked Play as it allows them to unlock exclusive operator skins, calling cards, and more.</p>



<p>It’s also a breeding ground for cheaters, for some reason. Typically, the highest echelons of the Ranked Play leaderboard are reserved exclusively for cheaters, who year in, year out fly under the radar of Team RICOCHET’s anti-cheat mechanics.</p>



<p>It’s getting better, but it’s <strong>far </strong>from being perfect.</p>



<p>Chris ‘Parasite’ Duarte, one of Call of Duty’s first world champions, posted on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS</strong> EVERY GAME WHERE IS THE ANTI CHEAT TREYARCH</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last season’s CDL world champion, Dashy, posted a video of him slamming teams full of cheaters in Ranked Play, and Simp, one of the best Call of Duty players in the world, was sharing comments on Twitter about the trademarks of BO6 cheaters.</p>



<p>It seems like Ranked Play in Black Ops 6 is already cooked, and it’s another year back-to-back that cheaters have completely ruined the mode.</p>
