<p>Fortnite’s regular slew of updates continues, and fresh off the back of another Fortnitemares event, the final part of Chapter 6 will begin after a special live event to mark the start of The Simpsons mini-season.</p>



<p>Following on from the Star Wars-themed mini-season earlier this year, The Simpsons will drop with a special Springfield map to explore, including various POIs, alongside a new Battle Pass, weapons, and more content.</p>



<p>A special live event is planned in Fortnite to mark the start of The Simpsons mini-season, and we’ve got all the details on what time you need to be in the game to catch it.</p>

<p><strong>Epic Games has confirmed the live event for Fortnite ahead of The Simpsons mini-season will take place on Saturday, November 1.</strong></p>



<p>The long-awaited, and heavily rumoured, Simpsons-themed season will bring down the curtain on Chapter 6, with one month of themed content before the jump into Chapter 7 in December.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1982818597702713829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games’ tweet</a> confirming the live event announced that the alien duo Kang and Kodos will have a “special announcement” for players to watch in-game, which will likely be followed by a period of downtime before The Simpsons mini-season kicks off properly.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-is-the-fortnite-live-event">What Time is The Fortnite Live Event?</h2>



<p><strong>The live event ahead of The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite will begin at 11 AM ET, Epic Games has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>Expect the servers to be extremely busy, as they always are for the live events, and enter the game in advance of that time to secure your spot. At this stage, it’s unclear whether PvP will be turned off for the duration of the event to allow players to tune into the action without the threat of elimination.</p>



<p>In the table below, we’ve highlighted the start time of the Fortnite live event in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Fortnite Live Event Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">8 AM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">11 AM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3 PM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Nov. 2</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>A new report says a new Xbox Partner Preview is scheduled for November and will focus heavily on Xbox Play Anywhere games. </p>



<p>Xbox has been in the news recently due to fresh details about its next-gen consoles. The president has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-president-confirms-series-x-s-successors-are-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the successors to the Series X/S consoles are in development, and a new report also says that games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-insomniacs-spider-man-will-be-playable-on-next-xbox-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War and Insomniac’s Spider-Man will be playable</a> on them.

Moreover, third-party titles from Microsoft’s publishing partners are going to be a focus of this event, and “will feature almost entirely (if not actually entirely)&nbsp;Xbox Play Anywhere&nbsp;titles.” </p>



<p>The report also mentions other upcoming events where Xbox will have a presence. The first event is this month itself, with IGN hosting the ID@Xbox showcase on October 28, 2025.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-ranked-season-2-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-season-2-ranked%E2%80%94release-date-start-time-rewards.1335826/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A has sucked in trainers from across the world, and Season 2 of Ranked is now right around the corner with a fresh batch of rewards to claim.</p>



<p>The first Pokémon release on Nintendo Switch 2, albeit still available on the original console, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-week-sales-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached some impressive sales milestones</a>, and the four-player PvP offerings have sucked plenty in for the grind.</p>



<p>If you’re ready to dive back into Ranked in pursuit of the next batch of rewards in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Earn the right. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Season 2 of Ranked in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A begins on November 4, immediately following the conclusion of Season 1 Ranked.</strong></p>



<p>It may seem like it has come around swiftly, with it only being a few weeks since the release of Legends: Z-A, but it appears, at least initially, that Ranked seasons in the title will transition rather quickly.</p>



<p>Based on the information we have from Season 1, each season in Ranked will last for around four weeks. However, this may be extended later in the game’s lifespan, depending on what else Game Freak have cooking.</p>







<p><strong>Although not officially announced, we expect Season 2 of Ranked in <strong>Pokémon</strong></strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A to begin at 6 AM UTC on November 4—the same time that Season 1 began.</strong></p>



<p>The table below shows a breakdown of when you can expect Season 2 of Ranked in Legends: Z-A to begin in your time zone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Season 2 Ranked Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Nov. 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Nov. 4</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>The biggest reward available in Legends: Z-A’s Season 2 of Ranked is Delphoxite, which is required to unlock Mega Delphox in the game.</strong></p>



<p>Just like Greninjite in Season 1, Delphoxite is exclusively available in Ranked play during Season 2, meaning you’ll have to delve into online play against players around the world to unlock the reward.</p>



<p>It’s yet to be confirmed, but we expect the requirements to be the same as earning Greninjite in Season 1, meaning you’ll have to reach at least Rank K to obtain the item.</p>



<p>Other rewards include Rare Candies, EXP. Candies, and items will also be distributed as rewards for reaching the various levels of ranked, but full details will be shared upon release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox players will be able to access PlayStation exclusives like God of War and Insomniac’s Spider-Man series on the next console, the latest reports state.</p>



<p>The next-gen era for Microsoft and Sony is on the horizon, despite the fact that many developers continue to support last-gen consoles like the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and there looks to be a titanic shift in terms of exclusive titles.</p>



<p>Xbox has already manoeuvred away from first-party exclusives, bringing the likes of Starfield, Forza Horizon 5, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo to PlayStation</a>, while Sony has eased slightly, as indicated by the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox earlier this year.</p>



<p>There are still some big exceptions, notably on PlayStation’s side with the likes of God of War, Insomniac’s Spider-Man, and Ghost of Tsushima, but that’s set to change in the new era.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-exclusives-coming-to-xbox-in-new-era">PlayStation Exclusives Coming to Xbox in New Era</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming to Xbox? Image via Sony</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Central’s Jez Cordon</a>, Microsoft’s plans for the next era of Xbox will bring the console more in line with PC, including the addition of various storefronts onto the console. Here’s what he wrote on the matter:</p>



<p>“You will be able to run PlayStation’s PC titles like God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, and Spider-Man on the next Xbox, purchased via Steam or Epic Games. You will be able to play&nbsp;World of Warcraft&nbsp;on the next Xbox, via Battle.net. You’ll also be able to install practically any game that runs on Windows, giving you access to decades upon decades of content all on a single device.”</p>



<p>Some steps toward that goal have already been taken with the ROG Ally X, which includes support for the likes of Steam and Epic Games Store, and the next Xbox console will have similar support.</p>



<p>With the addition of Steam and Epic storefronts onto the console, the door will be opened for titles that were previously PlayStation console exclusives, like God of War and Spider-Man, onto the Xbox platform—even though it won’t be a direct release and will lack established Xbox features, like Gamerscore and Achievements, for example.</p>



<p>The blurring of the waters in regards to exclusives has been difficult for players to get their head around, with the term exclusive now being looser than ever, but, in general, it’s good news for consumers.</p>
