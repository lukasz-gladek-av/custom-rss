<p>Sonic Rumble is making its way to PC and mobile devices in early November.</p>



<p>The party royale game, which capitalizes on Fall Guys’ success, has been in development for quite some time. Gameplay consists of players choosing their favorite Sonic characters and duking it out with others in fun and interesting mini-games. Despite positive feedback from early playtests, Sonic Rumble was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rumble-delayed-yet-again-by-sega/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met with multiple delays</a>. Earlier this month, however, it was announced that the game would release in November. Now, we finally have the official release date, as well as a cool new trailer to debut it.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/ZSF2uZ7W5Ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a short YouTube video</a>, SEGA and Sonic Team officially reveal the release date for Sonic Rumble: <strong>November 5th</strong>. The game will launch on Steam, Google Play, and the Apple App Store, with pre-registration available now. Currently, there are no announced plans to bring the game to consoles like Nintendo Switch 2. Regardless, given its successful playtests, it may very well happen. Plus, given the popularity of similar titles like Fall Guys and the Sonic brand, it’ll likely gain some attention.</p>



<p>The last update for Sonic Rumble <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rumble-pc-mobile-launch-november-2025/">provided some insight</a> as to what the full release will look and play like. With the playtests, the development team took the feedback from fans and fine-tuned many elements. For example, the progression and rewards system is now more streamlined, as well as an overhaul of the game’s user interface and onboarding. In addition, many new features like skills and joinable Crews with friends add more to the competitive side of the title. While it has taken a while for it to arrive, Sonic Rumble will finally see the light of day, and it won’t be long until we get to see how it goes.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-865-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-thursday-october-23.1332079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Today’s NYT Connections puzzle is a mighty forgiving one, but that doesn’t mean you don’t still want some handy hints to make things <strong>even easier</strong>. It’s almost the weekend, and, understandably, you might want to give your brain a bit of a rest today.</p>



<p>With that being said, I’ve got the latest NYT Connections hints and solutions for you below, so that you can get the fastest answers possible for today’s puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-23">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 23)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #865:</p>



<ul>
<li>DOGGY</li>



<li>FINE</li>



<li>PRIZE</li>



<li>SWAG</li>



<li>STONE</li>



<li>KITTY</li>



<li>BALL</li>



<li>DUCKY</li>



<li>BIRDIE</li>



<li>GO</li>



<li>SWELL</li>



<li>PURSE</li>



<li>MIXED</li>



<li>POT</li>



<li>PUCK</li>



<li>DANDY</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words all describe things going delightfully well, in a retro kind of way.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each of these can refer to a collection of winnings, often in games or competitions.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>You’ll find one of these in curling, another in badminton, and the rest in other Olympic sports.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word completes a common phrase ending in “bag.” Think dogs, surprises, and party favors.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 23.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-23-865">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 23 (#865)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– DANDY, DUCKY, FINE, SWELL</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – KITTY, POT, PRIZE, PURSE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BALL, BIRDIE, PUCK, STONE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – DOGGY, GO, MIXED, SWAG</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
