<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is getting a COD Next all about it in late September. After getting its gameplay reveal at Gamescom Opening Night Live, Activision has announced when we’ll see more. Fortunately, it won’t be long before we see more Multiplayer.</p>



<p>Releasing on November 14th, 2025, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/">brings the series back</a> to the Mason family, specifically David Mason. In 2035, he and his crew are taken into a warped reality thanks to Black Ops 2’s Raul Menendez. Going off of Black Ops 6 ‘s success last year, Raven and Treyarch aren’t pulling punches, as the new COD Next is weeks away.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It’s been announced that the next COD Next will livestream on September 30th, 2025. No exact timing or platforms are available as of writing. In it, fans will get a look at Black Ops 7’s Multiplayer, which <a href="https://youtu.be/r9Z15Z-f2Ys?feature=shared&amp;t=126">was teased</a> in the trailer above. COD Next also plans to have famous content creators try out the new Multiplayer and Zombies modes live. Then, on October 2nd, a beta will occur for fans to finally get their hands on it at home. </p>



<p>Despite releasing a bit later than most Call of Duty’s do, Black Ops 7 looks to be another fun futuristic take on the series. While the co-op campaign might turn some solo players off, there’s no doubt that it’ll sell quite well. Even more so, it will launch Day One on Xbox Game Pass, meaning more people than ever can play. All that said, COD Next is an event many should keep tabs on, especially since Multiplayer is the series’ bread and butter. </p>

<p>Microsoft is bringing Starfield to the Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>In a post on social media on Tuesday, known leaker Nate The Hate said that Starfield will be making its way to Nintendo’s latest console along with the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>“Indiana Jones &amp; the Great Circle won’t be the only Bethesda game coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026,” <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1957886310896796027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. “See that planet? You can go there. Aside from landing on PS5… Starfield is planned for release on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was confirmed</a> for Nintendo Switch 2 during Gamescom Opening Night Live on Tuesday. No set date was announced for the game on the system aside from it being next year.</p>



<p>Going back to Starfield, right now the only information is from Nate The Hate’s initial tweet. It’s unknown if the game will launce with the Shattered Space expansion or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-spring-2026-new-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even the anticipated second</a> expansion. A new expansion, if rumors are to be believed, is expected to come in Spring 2026. </p>



<p>A potential release on the Switch 2 isn’t the only Starfield news to be making the rounds. Recently, a data mine suggested that real-time <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-datamine-suggests-a-new-ship-feature-is-on-the-way" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interplanetary travel could be coming</a> in a future update.</p>

<p>Game Science has dropped a tease at an expansion to the story of Black Myth: Wukong, confirming the Journey to the West is not over.</p>



<p>The title, which was released last year and is finally joining Xbox on August 20, was a breakout success for the studio, with many expecting DLC would be announced at Gamescom.</p>



<p>Instead, the finale of Gamescom Opening Night Live was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-zhongkui-revealed-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer for Black Myth: Zhong Kui</a>, a brand-new title from Game Science that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-black-myth-zhong-kui-a-sequel-to-black-myth-wukong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t a sequel to Black Myth: Wukong</a>—but more could be on the horizon.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-myth-wukong-journey-will-continue">Black Myth: Wukong Journey Will Continue</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to wait. Image via Game Science</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a> for Black Myth: Zhong Kui, a series of questions and answers were shared about the development of the new title, with one stand-out entry concerning the decision to develop a brand-new game and not create a sequel for Black Myth: Wukong.</p>



<p>Explaining the decision, Game Science stated the aspiration to “take a tentative first step” to “build more game experiences,” “challenge ourselves with bolder features,” and “bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design.”</p>



<p>The key detail concerning Wukong, however, came right at the end with a message that said: “And to all friends who love Black Myth: Wukong, the westward journey won’t end here.”</p>



<p>It’s not clear whether the story from Wukong will continue in a new title as a direct sequel, or whether DLC is planned for the original title.</p>



<p>If the plan is for a direct sequel, that would likely come after the release of Black Myth: Zhong Kui, which itself is a long way off, considering development is in very early stages and “even Yocar himself has absolutely no idea” when a release will be.</p>



<p>Do you want to see DLC released for Black Myth: Wukong, or are you happy to wait for a direct sequel? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3347/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
