<p>Having inventory of extra PC RAM is going to be as valuable as having a stockpile of gold bars if trends continue at their current pace. Due to a claimed memory shortage across the industry, RAM prices have shot up exponentially over recent weeks. </p>



<p>It’s gotten to the point where buying a couple sticks of memory can cost more than a new GPU or even a fully priced video game console. </p>







<p>But how bad is the pricing situation, actually? Looking at storefronts like Newegg, and it paints a pretty dire picture for enthusiasts of all levels. Whether you just want one stick of 16GB or even 64GB for your new build, you better be ready to spend more than ever. Prices of memory have risen by as much as 250% since the beginning of November.</p>



<p>Below you can see just how much costs have gone up for consumers for anything from 16GB (2 x 8GB) to 64GB (2 x 32GB). And this specifically focuses on the current DDR5 generation of RAM.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>PC Memory</th><th>November 1 Price</th><th>November 26 Price</th><th>Percentage Increase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>16GB T-Force</td><td>$77.99</td><td>$177.99</td><td>128.2%</td></tr><tr><td>16GB Kingston Fury </td><td>$62.99</td><td>$149.99</td><td>138.1%</td></tr><tr><td>32GB T-Force</td><td>$96.99</td><td>$339.99</td><td>250.5%</td></tr><tr><td>32GB G.Skill Flare X5</td><td>$97.99</td><td>$269.99</td><td>175.5%</td></tr><tr><td>32GB Corsair Vengeance </td><td>$142.99</td><td>$406.99</td><td>184.6%</td></tr><tr><td>32GB G.Skill Trident Z5 NEO</td><td>$104.99</td><td>$279.99</td><td>166.7%</td></tr><tr><td>64GB Corsair Vengeance</td><td>$239.99</td><td>$839.99</td><td>250%</td></tr><tr><td>64GB G.Skill Trident Z5 NEO</td><td>$204.99</td><td>$629.99</td><td>207.3%</td></tr><tr><td>64GB G.Skill Flare X5</td><td>$204.99</td><td>$569.99</td><td>178%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As the data shows, the availability of memory has turned the market into a chaotic place. It’s even gotten so bad that some stores are starting to sell the components at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1p55n8k/taken_at_microcenter_on_1123/?utm_source=embedv2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“Market Price”</a>. That’s something usually saved for Lobster and other seafood. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to a number of RAM manufacturers about when they think the prices could come down. Every single person who spoke gave a similar answer of uncertainty. That’s because of the fact that, often times, when there’s a shortage, it could take months and even years to catch back up to meet the demand. It’s the truest form of going day-by-day and week-by-week there is.</p>

<p>These price increases while seemingly sudden and extreme, shouldn’t come as a surprise for those who’ve been following what’s happening. For those who are unaware, however, there’s a big reason why RAM costs have gone up the way they have: AI.</p>



<p>As AI infrastructure continues to expand worldwide, the components needed like memory and storage are being bought up. And these companies are willing to pay higher prices for more product. That means there’s just not enough to keep up with average consumer demand. And it seems to be a problem that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/ai-fuels-memory-chip-shortage-that-could-hit-phones-and-cars.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">may only get worse</a> and more expansive before it gets better. </p>



<p><strong>“It could be very bad for PCs, laptops, consumer electronics and automotive, which depend on cheap memory chips,”</strong> TriOrient’s vice president of research, Dan Nystedt, told CNBC.</p>
