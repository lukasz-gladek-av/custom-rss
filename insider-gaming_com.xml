<h2 id="h-the-last-pc-you-ll-buy">The Last PC You‚Äôll Buy</h2>



<p>During CES 2025, ASUS ROG unveiled the <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-rog-g700-gaming-desktop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2025 G700 desktop</a>, uncovering a PC with unparalleled gaming power.</p>

<p>If you want to tweak, expand, or upgrade (yeah, right) the G700 desktop, you can do so with ease. One of the selling points of the G700 is that it boasts tool-less entry and standard-sized components that make maintenance a breeze.</p>



<p>If you‚Äôre concerned about the heat that‚Äôll be generated by the top-of-the-range CPU, GPU, and the 1000W PSU, fear not. The team has promised hyper-efficient cooling that can be customised to suit either an air-cooled or water-cooled preference, as well as dust filters and a unique airflow path. </p>

<p>Samsung has lifted the lid on a staggering piece of gaming technology at CES 2025 ‚Äì the Odyssey OLED G60SF. It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs first 500Hz monitor, and it‚Äôs a stunning OLED device with the lowest response time in the business at just 0.03ms. It‚Äôs a new bar for high-end monitor manufacturers to aim for, and it‚Äôs set to change gaming experiences worldwide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-evolution">The Evolution</h2>



<p>Samsung‚Äôs Odyssey range has long been known as a pinnacle of technology, but the latest devices revealed during CES 2025 are borderline ridiculous.</p>



<p>The G60SF is set to shatter expectations, delivering a world-first 500Hz experience in 4K. It‚Äôs a VESA DisplayHDR TrueBlack 400-certified unit, which means the depth of contrast and colour will be unparalleled. It‚Äôs a 27-inch monitor that‚Äôll blow your hair back, and it comes with HDR10+ capabilities.</p>



<p>Alongside the new G60SF, Samsung also revealed the Odyssey 3D, a glasses-free 3D display that utilises light field display technology to give you an immersive experience, the likes of which are currently unseen in the industry. It‚Äôs a hyper-ergonomic monitor with stacks of adjustment options, plus a 4K resolution and 1 ms response time to boot.</p>



<p>Also, Samsung took the opportunity to show off the Odyssey G7. This all-new, 40-inch display boasts a 21:9 resolution over a super-sized, widescreen profile. It‚Äôs the industry‚Äôs first 40-inch gaming monitor, and it‚Äôs enormous. If you want to cut down the number of screens you‚Äôre using, why not opt for one giant display with the Odyssey G7?</p>



<p>The price point for the 500Hz OLED G60SF is yet to be revealed, but you can bet your last dollar it‚Äôll be a pretty penny. It‚Äôs one of the most innovative and incredible monitors I‚Äôve ever seen, so you can be sure it‚Äôll break the bank.</p>

<p>Recently, a slew of leaks and reveals surfaced online from the Marvel Rivals universe. Since being released on December 6, Marvel Rivals has established itself as a powerhouse title, maintaining a solid player base and refusing to stop growing, soaring up the charts as players dive in to experience the free-to-play, Marvel-backed shooter.</p>



<p>The most recent reveal showcased Reed Richards‚Äô ‚ÄòThe Maker‚Äô skin, which will arrive with the introduction of the Fantastic Four on January 10. In a series of leaks, the Invisible Woman was detailed further, with her Malice skin being revealed alongside gameplay snippets.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-fantastic">That‚Äôs Fantastic</h2>



<p>In a leak posted online by Rivals_Leaks, a promotional image of Malice and The Maker was revealed. These skins, which are tied to Sue Storm and Reed Richards respectively, are now half-confirmed. Following the leak, NetEase posted a short clip showcasing The Maker, the skin for Mr. Fantastic that‚Äôll arrive when the team enters the game on January 10:</p>

<p>Malice is yet to be unveiled in the same fashion, but NetEase did show the full promotional image at the end of the short trailer above. However, Sue Storm‚Äôs character was shown fighting bots while wearing the skin in a quick leak, also posted on socials by Rivals_Leaks (originally from RivalsLeaks):</p>











<p>The Fantastic Four will be the latest in a long line of iconic characters to make their way into Marvel Rivals. The game has a stunning lineup of characters and given how expansive the Marvel universe is, there‚Äôs a roster to pick from that‚Äôll keep NetEase busy for quite some time.</p>

<p>WWE 2K25 has been teased by 2K and WWE during RAW‚Äôs first show on Netflix. The grandiose event, which was backed by a star-studded cast featuring John Cena, Roman Reigns, The Rock, and CM Punk, served as the official welcome for WWE on Netflix.</p>



<p>More information will be revealed by 2K on January 28, but the game can already be wishlisted on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-grand-reveal">Grand Reveal</h2>



<p>The upcoming reveal of WWE 2K25 has fans energised, and it comes just days after WWE 2K23 was finally taken offline, leaving just WWE 2K24 in a fully playable state.</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs the statement offered by 2K in the wake of the tease:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>WWE 2K returns bigger, bolder, and better than ever in a breakthrough year for the franchise! WWE 2K25 is preparing to charge down the ramp with all the authenticity and action fans love from the best in sports entertainment.</p>



<p>Discover game-changing features, iconic Superstars, and more details on&nbsp;<strong>January 28th, 2025.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The expectation is that WWE 2K25 will follow a similar release pattern to last year‚Äôs instalment, dropping in April 2025 ‚Äì but that‚Äôs speculation and nothing more. </p>



<p>Following the teasers, Xbox took to social media to reveal the first screenshots of the game:</p>











<p>This tells us that at least CM Punk, Damien Priest, Liv Morgan, and Cody Rhodes will appear in the game, but that‚Äôs hardly a revelation in itself. What fans are most curious about is who will feature as the cover star for WWE 2K25. Last year, it was Cody Rhodes, and the year before that, John Cena took centre stage. </p>



<p>Given that all the recent talk is centred around John Cena‚Äôs epic retirement tour, could the superstar make yet another appearance on the cover of a WWE game? </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-chinese-military-blacklist/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-united-states-just-added-tencent-to-a-%E2%80%98chinese-military-blacklist%E2%80%99.1075680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-chinese-military-blacklist/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been reported that the United States has added Tencent Holdings Ltd. to a blacklist identifying companies as having ties to the Chinese military. This story was shared by Bloomberg, and as the revelation broke online, Tencent‚Äôs shares declined. Tencent was joined by CATL, a tech manufacturer linked with Tesla.</p>



<p>Tencent is China‚Äôs most valuable company and has a reach that covers some of the biggest video game companies on the planet, such as Epic Games, Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Riot Games, and SuperCell.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pentagon-warning">Pentagon Warning</h2>



<p>The ‚Äòblacklist‚Äô, backed by the Pentagon, indicates whether a company is inherently linked to China‚Äôs military or the nation‚Äôs ‚Äòdefence industrial base‚Äô. In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg‚Äôs recent report</a>, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs unclear whether either company deals regularly with the PLA. Beyond direct ties to the government, US officials have pointed to laws that require Chinese companies to share information with Beijing on matters deemed relevant to national security.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tencent‚Äôs stock value took a dive as the Pentagon‚Äôs designation hit the airwaves. It was followed up by a statement from Tencent‚Äôs representatives:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was suggested <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9q78wn9g8zo">by the BBC</a> that the Pentagon had been ‚Äòpressured‚Äô to add more Chinese companies to the blacklist, which is how CATL, a company that contributes to the manufacture of electric cars, ended up on the list.</p>



<p>Historically, companies have challenged the Pentagon‚Äôs decisions regarding this damning blacklist. For instance, DJI and Hesai Technologies took the intelligence agency to court but at the time of publishing, both remain on the list. In 2021, Xiaomi successfully petitioned for a removal from the blacklist.</p>



<p>The Department of Defense-backed list now features a whopping 134 Chinese companies, and that number is growing.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/no-z2-steam-deck-2-says-valve/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98there-will-be-no-z2-steam-deck%E2%80%99-valve-denies-recent-steam-deck-2-rumours.1075674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-z2-steam-deck-2-says-valve/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, rumours started circulating online regarding a Steam Deck 2, powered by AMD‚Äôs Ryzen Z2 processor, revealed just hours ago. The source of this speculation came from VideoCardz.com, which was the first site to share slides containing tech specs for the new processors, one of which mentioned that Valve‚Äôs Steam Deck would be a recipient of the Z2.</p>



<p>However, a Valve employee has taken to social media to declare that there is not and ‚Äòwill be no Z2 Steam Deck‚Äô, clearing the air and setting the story straight.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-for-now">For Now?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lf36y66ggs2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, Valve employee Pierre-Loup Griffais wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There is (not) and will be no Z2 Steam Deck. Guessing the slide was meant to say the series is meant for products like that, not announcing anything specific.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The slide in question also mentioned the Legion Go and Asus ROG Ally, which already feature AMD‚Äôs Z1 processor range. It‚Äôs easy to see how the assumption could have been made that it would be <strong>the next Steam Deck </strong>that would house the Ryzen Z2, but that‚Äôs not the case.</p>



<p>In a report by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, it was highlighted that AMD wouldn‚Äôt confirm either way whether the Z2 would be implemented in a Steam Deck 2 unit, nor would it mention <strong>any </strong>definite home for the new hardware ‚Äì Lenovo, Asus, MSI, or whatever else. These conversations took place at CES, the ultimate stage for tech announcements. </p>



<p>With all that being said, there <strong>is </strong>a Steam Deck 2 on the horizon ‚Äì Valve has made it clear that it intends to produce one at some point, such as the natural lifecycle of any gaming device. Only time will tell what hardware powers the device, though. For now, it doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôll go hand-in-hand with an AMD Ryzen Z2 processor.</p>

<p>Nvidia has officially unveiled its next-gen GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards at CES 2025. The reveal came during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k82RwXqZHY8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company‚Äôs CES keynote</a> from CEO Jensen Huang, and marks the first new GPU launch in over two years for the company</p>



<p>In total, the Nvidia announced four new graphics cards: RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070.</p>



<p>Available starting in January, the new Blackwell lineup of graphics cards range from $549 to $1,999. The flagship Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 will run $1,999. Following that is the RTX 5080 at $999; the RTX 5070 Ti at $749; and the RTX 5070 at $549. According to Huang, the RTX 5070 will give consumers performance equal to that of the last-gen RTX 4090 ‚Äúthanks to AI‚Äù.</p>



<p>One thing to note is that when it comes to size, the RTX 5090 Founders Edition card is coming in much smaller than the last-gen 4090. This new card is just a two-slot card, allowing it to fit in smaller form-factor systems.</p>
