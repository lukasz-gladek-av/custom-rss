            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>TT Games is back with a bang with the upcoming release of LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, telling the story of decades of the Caped Crusader’s history, and multiplayer details have already been announced.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Revealed at Gamescom</a> with a 2026 release window, eyebrows have been raised following news that LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight seemingly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-will-feature-only-7-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only has seven playable characters</a>, which would be a huge change given previous titles have featured hundreds of minifigures to choose from.</p>



<p>Multiplayer has been a core feature in TT Games’ LEGO franchise for years, with no major changes to the format so far. Here, we’ve got all the details on whether that approach is being adjusted with the new LEGO Batman title.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-have-online-multiplayer">Will LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight Have Online Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Switch up. Image via TT Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will not support online multiplayer or co-op, it has been confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>In an <a href="https://legogamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/43979623023123-LEGO-Batman-Legacy-of-the-Dark-Knight-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ post</a> about the game, it was announced that online co-op will not be available, continuing the trend from other LEGO titles from TT Games.</p>



<p>The most recent release, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, also did not feature online co-op. While there has been a desire from players for the feature to be added, it will not be available in LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight.</p>



<p>It remains be seen whether any future LEGO games from TT Games change this trend, though it doesn’t seem likely currently.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-have-split-screen-co-op">Will LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight Have Split-Screen Co-Op?</h2>



<p><strong>While LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight does not have online co-op support, two-player couch co-op has been confirmed as a feature.</strong></p>



<p>Couch co-op is a staple of TT Games’ LEGO titles, and, while couch co-op is becoming increasingly rarer in modern gaming, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will not be removing the feature.</p>



<p>Only two players are supported at a single time, however, which makes sense given that a fair amount of screen space is required to truly enjoy the LEGO experience.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for the next couch co-op title to play with a friend, partner, or other relative, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight could tick the boxes.</p>

<p>Excitement levels continue to rise for Hollow Knight: Silksong ahead of release, and a flood of new gameplay from a demo has made its way online, leading to the question of whether it can be downloaded.</p>



<p>In our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/">hands-on preview</a>, we made it clear that the hype for Hollow Knight: Silksong is well placed, and the assessment from others who have gotten a chance to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-demo-confirmed-by-xbox-for-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play at Gamescom</a> is similar. Now, though, players around the world want their own chance to play.</p>



<p>The guide below details everything we know about the Hollow Knight: Silksong demo, including whether you can add it to your library to try out.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-available-to-download">Is The Hollow Knight: Silksong Demo Available to Download?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Worth the wait. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is not currently a Hollow Knight: Silksong demo available to download, and all gameplay footage currently emerging is from Gamescom.</strong></p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is playable on both Xbox and Nintendo Switch platforms at Gamescom in Cologne, but it is exclusively available at the event for the time being. Therefore, it cannot be downloaded.</p>



<p>The demo is also the same stage of the game that was first playable at E3 2019 six years ago, which, though it may be surprising, could mean it takes place very early in the game.</p>



<p>Fans around the world will need to wait at least a little while longer to get a taste of the game, as currently the only details we know about the playable demo is it’s availability at Gamescom. </p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-a-hollow-knight-silksong-demo">Will There Be A Hollow Knight: Silksong Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>No announcements have been made regarding a Hollow Knight: Silksong demo, but there could be one provided before launch.</strong></p>



<p>A big Hollow Knight: Silksong announcement is coming today via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGeJwsUP9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, which could reveal the release date or details about a demo, early access, or other details.</p>



<p>If there is a demo, expect it to be available across all platforms, though given the hype for the game, it could release without one. </p>



<p>For now, though, there isn’t a way to play Hollow Knight: Silksong early, but keep an eye on Insider Gaming for more coverage and news as it breaks.</p>



<p>Is Hollow Knight: Silksong going to be a Game of the Year contender? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/world-of-tanks-heat-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/world-of-tanks-heat-hands-on-preview-a-surprisingly-fun-hero-shooter-but-with-tanks.1276770/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WarGaming’s World of Tanks: HEAT might have turned a few heads when it was first announced during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live, but after getting hands-on with the game in a behind-the-scenes opportunity, I’m pleased to say it’s awesome!</p>



<p>For full disclosure and context, I have played a few hundred hours of World of Tanks and World of Tanks: Blitz, so I am pretty familiar with WarGaming titles and the mechanics behind tank combat in their games (important for later). Unfortunately, my hands-on opportunity was limited to around 15 minutes against AI bots, which, for a multiplayer title, is never great. Still, I managed to gain a good understanding of where the developers want to take HEAT and why they picked this particular direction.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-meets-tanks">Call of Duty Meets Tanks</h2>



<p>I don’t think anyone was crazily surprised to see yet another free-to-play multiplayer shooter announced during Gamescom, but WarGaming’s World of War: HEAT has something fairly unique going for it – Tanks. Sticking with the World of Tanks has been criticised by the community that has been testing the game under the codename Project Cold War, but honestly, after getting hands-on with the game, it makes sense. While I understand that the World of Tanks brand is catered to a specific audience that prefers accuracy, HEAT offers the brand a chance to tap into a wider and more accessible audience.</p>



<p>The only way I can logically describe HEAT is that it’s similar to Call of Duty in terms of accessibility and gameplay loop. If you view the Tanks as Weapons (which I suppose they are), things make a lot more sense. In HEAT, your Tank can be fully customized just like a weapon in Call of Duty with paint jobs, charms, and even a 100-point system for different upgrades (similar to Battlefield 6’s 100-point system for firearms). </p>



<p>The Call of Duty similarities don’t end there, either, with HEAT offering players various game modes, including Domination, Kill Confirmed, and Search and Destroy.</p>



<p>However, one layer of complexity that’s still maintained in the game from the classic World of Tanks title is that players still have to learn Tanks’ weak spots and vulnerabilities in their armor. However, to make the game more accessible to players, the crosshairs are similar to those in World of Tanks Arcade mode, where they indicate the armor’s penetration points, but this time in a handy x-ray-like vision.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-a-hero-shooter">A Hero Shooter?</h2>



<p>The game’s setting in an alternative WW2 universe gives the developers the chance to be a little bit more creative with the tanks and their accessories, allowing for some tanks to have Gatling guns, missiles, and so on attached to the vehicle. </p>



<p>In HEAT, the ‘heroes’ are the Tank drivers, who, at launch, only have two tanks assigned to them. The developers tell me that on launch, each character will have an initial tank unlocked, with the second tank being unlocked through progression, or, of course, paid premium features to make the progression faster. They also tell me that this is just for the initial launch of the game, and that more tanks per character will come at a later date.</p>



<p>Other additions to tanks outside of the customization options are a boosting feature, which allows you to get from point A to point B quickly, or flank around enemies to hit their weak spots. At one point, I needed to unleash my inner ‘Fury’ and boost around an enemy and hit the tanks weapon spot from behind.</p>



<p>Just like in other hero shooters, Tanks also have abilities, which charge up over time, allowing for some hectic moments with weapons, shields, and more, which can change the course of a match in a matter of moments.</p>



<h2 id="h-genuinely-great">Genuinely Great</h2>



<p>It isn’t often that I walk away from a game demo, especially at a convention where you’re tired and playing on an unfamiliar setup, but overall, I think that WarGaming does have something special on their hands with HEAT.</p>



<p>The potential to grow the game beyond what I played with other progression options, expansions, and even Esports, which the developers say they currently don’t have planned, but is something they will do if there’s a demand, is exciting.</p>



<p>As for the release date, the developers tell me that while an exact release date isn’t planned, they are aiming to release World of War Tanks: HEAT in 2026 on the PC (and Steam Deck!), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. I did ask about Nintendo Switch 2, but currently, they are focused only on these platforms and will reevaluate when the game launches.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to World of Tanks: HEAT?</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals continues to grow bigger and better, and Season 4 is now rapidly approaching. We’ve got all the details on when it’s expected to drop and what could feature.</p>



<p>Following the drop of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-3-5-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3.5</a>, which introduced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-blade-guide-release-date-stats-abilities-team-up-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blade as a playable character</a>, the game has been transitioning toward Season 4, which takes place after the defeat of Knull and Hela, who became the Queen in Black.</p>



<p>If you’re anxiously awaiting the drop of the new season, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-date-amp-time">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Release Date &amp; Time</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New battles. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Although yet to be officially confirmed, Season 4 in Marvel Rivals is expected to begin on September 12, with several hints suggesting this is the case.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, that would mark the four-week point since the start of Season 3.5, which is the Marvel Rivals schedule for new season drops, and the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250819/41548_1254783.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ancient Powers Awaken event</a> is due to end on September 12.</p>



<p>The end date for the event should line up perfectly with the start of the new season, though the rewards will be available to earn permanently if you purchase the Premium Pass. The end time has been confirmed to be <strong>September 12th at 2am PT.</strong></p>



<p>In the table below, we’ve detailed what time the release will be in your timezone. However, remember that end of season patches come alongside downtime, so you’ll need to wait a little while longer for servers to open.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Release Date &amp; Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">02:00, September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">04:00, September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">05:00, September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">09:00, September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)</td><td data-align="center">19:00, September 12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-in-marvel-rivals-season-4">What’s Coming in Marvel Rivals Season 4?</h2>



<p><strong>Full details of exactly what is coming in Marvel Rivals Season 4 are yet to be shared, but we know it will feature a new character, new maps, and a new Season Pass.</strong></p>



<p>Following several leaks at launch, we know a long list of characters that have been found in datamines, but developers are keeping their cards close to their chests. However, there have been some teases during Season 3.5 on what may be coming.</p>



<p>In the game’s lore, Hela was defeated by Blade with Dracula’s sword and escaped to a mysterious Eighth City, expected to be the ancient city of K’un-Lun, and met a shadowy figure by the name of Dizang. Artwork for the character, who has glowing eyes and horns, has led many to speculate that one of the new heroes will be Daredevil.</p>



<p>The lore text also mentions that Hela is likely to be pursued by “one of her kin” for her actions and, with Loki and Thor already in the game, that could open the door to Angela.</p>



<p>If the pair are to feature, it could be Angela that appears first, as Dizang has previously been a possessed version of Daredevil who leads The Hand, and he could therefore take the role as Season 4’s main antagonist, before being rescued and restored to a normal state for the second half of the season.</p>



<p>This is all merely speculation at this stage, however, but it won’t be too much longer until we have an official reveal.</p>
