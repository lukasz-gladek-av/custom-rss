<p>New data reveals that Game of the Year nominee Balatro has generated approximately $4.4 million on its mobile version.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/royal-kingdom-records-450k-in-first-four-days-to-beat-royal-matchs-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PocketPair</a>, which obtained the data via <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AppMagic</a>, revealed the new data. According to the data, Balatro generated $1 million in its first week, and following a spending surge last week, that number quickly rose to $4.4 million.</p>



<p>It is unclear why the surge in purchases increased, but the game was nominated for several awards last week, which almost certainly attributed to its rise in popularity. The game received several awards at different events, including five at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-all-nominees-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards 2024</a>, including Game of the Year and Best Mobile Game.</p>



<p>Balatro was first released on February 20, 2024, and saw huge success on launch, generating $1 million in its first eight hours of release. It sold 250,000 units in its first three days and 500,000 copies in its first ten days. In August 2024, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-hits-2-million-units-sold-major-gameplay-update-coming-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that the game had sold two million copies</a>. The game received universal acclaim according to review aggregator Metacritic.</p>



<p>In August 2024, Balatro announced its first major crossover with some of the most popular games, including The Witcher 3, Among Us, Vampire Surivors, and Dave the Diver. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kai-cenat-beats-twitch-sub-record-%E2%80%93-but-he-had-to-hang-someone-along-the-way.1046229/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kai-cenat-twitch-sub-record-hanging/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kai Cenat has beaten his subscriber world record, racking up more than 580,000 concurrent Twitch subscribers during his Mafiathon 2 superstream. He has easily stormed past all previously set records, and since November 2, his channel has been live 24 hours a day. There’s no sign of the subathon slowing down.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the superstar streamer found himself in hot water following a bit on his broadcast that saw him and his friends ‘hang’ someone, prompting Kai to be concerned about getting banned from Twitch for what was later revealed to be a planned prank.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-did-kai-hang-someone">Did Kai Hang Someone?</h2>



<p>On social media, clips of the event are being circulated like wildfire, showing a topless man hanging from a high bar on Kai Cenat’s stream. A rope is pulled and the man, whose hands are bound, hangs for a few seconds, kicking his legs, until he’s brought down from the noose.</p>



<p>He’s then tended to by a medical team.</p>



<p>At first blush, Kai and his team seemed to be shocked and perplexed about the event. They’d strolled out into Kai’s garden not knowing what to expect, then they found a man willing to be hoisted <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2311951387?t=4h29m49s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">up in a noose live on stream</a> – for clout and content, of course.</p>



<p>As a preface, it was revealed that the man being hung was Max Major, a YouTube ‘magician’ with a professional penchant for tricks like this. Later on, Kai shared a video, in which Major explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>What you don’t know is that was all according to my plan. See, at the start of my performance, I said that tonight was all about choices. But not just the choices that you made tonight, but the choices that you made since the day that we met. </em></p>



<p><em>Since the first time we met, you pushed me, you challenged me, and you wanted to see me fail. And I thought tonight, I’ll give you exactly what you asked for.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>By that point, Kai had already beaten his Twitch subscriber record, but the stunt was able to push him even further and put him in a high-ranking position on various social media platforms as a trending topic.</p>

<p>PlayStation veteran&nbsp;Shuhei Yoshida is leaving PlayStation in January. His retirement comes after more than 30 years with Sony, spending his time with PlayStation since its beginnings in 1993.</p>



<p>Yoshida, who made the announcement on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official PlayStation Blog</a>, is set to leave PlayStation on January 15, 2025.</p>



<p>“I’ve been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation,” he said. “And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on.</p>



<p>“You know, the company’s been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yoshida has spent the last while as Head of Indies Initiative for Sony. Prior to that, he was President of SIE Worldwide Studis from 2008 to 2019.</p>



<p>While he’s been a part of large moments in PlayStation history, one may stand out to fans the most. In 2013, while Sony was unveiling the PlayStation 4 (PS4) at E3 2013, Sony took a jab at Microsoft’s disastrous Xbox One reveal earlier the same day. In short tutorial video, Yoshida and former Vice President of Publisher and Developer Relations Adam Boyes showed fans how they can share used games on the PS4.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>At the time of publishing, Sony hasn’t made any official announcement regarding who will take over for Yoshida as Head of Indies Initiative.</p>



<p>When making his decision to leave, Yoshida said that he believes PlayStation “is in really good hands” moving forward.</p>



<p>“I thought, okay, this is my time,” he said.</p>
