<p>After being in development for quite some time, Phantom Blade Zero will finally get a release date this year. The news comes from Future Games Show, which held a “Deep Dive” with the team. Alongside new gameplay, we got some new details on the combat and style.</p>



<p>Phantom Blade Zero follows an elite assassin tasked with finding the killer of The Order’s patriarch. It mixes the gameplay of Soulsborne titles and RPGs to craft an intricate combat system. Since its big reveal in 2023, fans have been hungry for more of the game, and Future Games Show delivered some promising news.</p>

<p>In the deep dive at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpPmmXxffiQ">Future Games Show</a>, director Soulframe Liang showed off new gameplay of Phantom Blade Zero. In addition, we saw cool new weapons, over 30 in fact, and wicked action combat. However, the most notable comment was about the game’s release. At the end of the presentation, Liang said that, before the year ends, we will know when the game will come out. Whether the date is concrete or a release window remains to be seen.</p>



<p>The game has been played by critics from various sites not too long ago back in July. For many, the wuxia-inspired combat system and stunning visuals left a positive mark. Following the success of other Chinese games like Black Myth: Wukong and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Phantom Blade Zero could be the next big one, if done right.</p>
