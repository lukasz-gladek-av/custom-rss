<p>Use these Roblox Doom By Fate monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards and get ahead of the competition.</p>



<p>If you’re afraid of the dark, then this game is definitely not for you. Quite clearly inspired by Dead By Daylight, Doom By Fate is a popular survival horror <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monsterverze-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game where players are thrown into short rounds in a dark place with a deadly killer on the loose. The main objective of the game is to survive through the night without getting killed, but that’s easier said than done. Although players have the option to jump and sprint, getting away from the killer is no easy task.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Surviving in a limited space when there’s a murderous killer on the loose is hard enough, but throw in the fact that you also have to complete objectives, and you have quite the challenge on your hands. Considering this, it’s essential for the players to try and coordinate to have the higest chance of surviving through the round. As expected, the killer’s job is simply to eliminate all of the players before the timer runs out. With a variety of playable survivor characters to unlock, Doom By Fate encourages grinding, as a lot of cash is required to make most purchases. This is where Doom By Fate codes can come to your rescue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-expired-doom-by-fate-codes">Expired Doom By Fate Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Doom By Fate, as the game only came out recently. It’s currently in Alpha, so more codes and content updates are likely on the horizon. The moment any of the active codes expire, they will promptly be moved to this section of the page. Moreover, players are urged to use the active codes and reap the rewards before they eventually expire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many Roblox games nowadays demand that players join the game’s <a href="https://www.roblox.com/communities/35983705/what-is-what-is#!/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Roblox developer group</a> and like the game before unlocking the code redemption feature for them, and Doom By Fate falls into that category too. Once that’s done, however, redeeming codes is a simple process that requires next to no effort. Here’s a step-by-step guide:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Doom By Fate.</li>



<li>Click on the Settings button at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.</li>



<li>Hit the Enter key to claim your rewards.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Considering that the game is still in alpha, it’s not surprising that there’s only one active code at the moment. However, the sheer amount of popularity that game has received means that more codes are surely on the horizon. New codes are released through the game’s socials and Discord server, so tracking both of those might be a good idea. A better idea though, would be to simply bookmark this page and check in every so often, as we update this article with new codes as soon as they drop.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Servers Down For Chapter 7 Launch]]></title>

<p>Fortner servers are down ahead of the launch of Chapter 7, following the huge end-of-chapter event that marked an end to the previous chapter.</p>



<p>The Zero Point live event was stacked with collabs, including the likes of Godzilla, Hatsune Miku, and Homer Simpson, and servers immediately went offline after the conclusion of the event in preparation for Chapter 7’s launch.</p>



<p>Taking the Fortnite servers down immediately was an unexpected move by many, considering the usual start time of downtime for new content is at 2 AM ET, but Epic Games announced the downtime in advance of the event to give players a heads up.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-downtime-end">When Will Fortnite Downtime End?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big drop. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Posting on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1994771674793996483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a> ahead of the event, Epic Games stated that downtime would commence immediately after the event’s conclusion, and in-game, a precise countdown was shared.</p>



<p>Fittingly for Chapter 7, downtime will last four seven hours, and there is a live countdown available in-game. That downtime is a similar length to what was witnessed prior to the launch of Chapter 6, though there could still be server issues when the season commences.</p>



<p>A host of players complained on social media of being disconnected during the live event, which had over 10 million active players watching the action, and server instability may be present when Chapter 7 first kicks off.</p>



<p>It will be late in the evening in the United States, however, and the middle of the night for Europe, which may reduce the flood of players heading into the game immediately when servers return.</p>



<p>During downtime, several prominent content creators will be publishing footage from an early access Chapter 7 launch event, similar to what was seen ahead of The Simpsons mini-season.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Linus Tech Tips Thinks the Steam Machine Price Will be Around $700]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-machine-price-analysis/</link>
            <guid>1368124</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new video posted to their YouTube channel, Linus Tech Tips has broken down the cost of the hardware that will be added to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-machine-everything-to-know-about-valves-new-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a> to get a sense of how much the console be priced. Spoiler alert… It’s likely to be much more than people thought online.</p>



<p>According to Linus Tech Tips, the parts at their historical low price will cost around $602, but that number has increased significantly in recent months by a whopping 50%, bringing the price to around $900.</p>



<p>As Linus Tech Tips rightfully pointed out, though, these prices are for name brands, and they think the cost can be reduced to around $813 at retail. However, Valve does have a direct-to-consumer model, meaning that it doesn’t need the traditional retailer margins of around 10%.</p>



<p>The question is then, how much profit does Valve want per console? Traditionally, console manufacturers have subsidised or even taken a loss on their consoles, while subscription models and software are their profit centres. </p>



<h2 id="h-steam-machine-will-cost-700">Steam Machine Will Cost $700?</h2>



<p>The conclusions led Linus Tech Tips to believe that the Steam Machine will cost approximately $699, if the hardware prices remain at the prices they do today. Linus Tech Tips then went on to say $800 at most if the hardware market continues to climb at the unprecedented rate it has been going. That could be a hard sell when the <a href="https://amzn.to/48iMmlb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5 is only $399</a> at the moment.</p>



<p>And remember… This is for a model with a 500GB SSD… Not 1TB / 2TB.</p>



<p>You can watch Linus Tech Tips’ full analysis and breakdown below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Personally, though, I think that the Steam Machine might be a little pricier. I would think that $799-849 would be the 512GB version, with a 2TB costing $999. But then and again, maybe I am just a little loopy when it comes to pricing. </p>
