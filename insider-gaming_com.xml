<p>Another union is forming at Blizzard as developers from the company’s story and franchise development (SFD) team have voted in favor of union representation. Announced via the Communication Workers of America (CWA) website, the vote came “either by signing a union authorization card or indicating that they wanted union representation via an online portal.”</p>



<p>All workers will be members of CWA Local 9510 in Orange County, California with Microsoft already recognizing their union.</p>



<p>The union <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzards-story-and-franchise-development-workers-form-latest-video-game-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will cover those who work</a> on Blizzard’s in-house cinematics, animation, and narrative team who create game trailers, promotional videos, in-game cutscenes, and other narrative content for Blizzard franchises. It becomes the first group of its kind to form a union in the North American game industry.</p>



<p><strong>“After more than a decade working at Blizzard, I’ve seen all the highs and lows. For years, Blizzard has been a place where people could build their careers and stay for decades, but that stability’s been fading,”</strong>&nbsp;Bucky Fisk, a principal editor and member of the organizing committee, said via release.&nbsp;<strong>“With a union, we’re able to preserve what makes this place special, secure real transparency in how decisions are made, and make sure policies are applied fairly to everyone.”</strong></p>



<p>The new union joins the <strong>“nearly 3,000 workers at Microsoft-owned studios who have organized with CWA to build better standards across the video game industry.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“These workers are setting the standard for animation, cinematics, and storytelling across the video game industry, creating the breathtaking cutscenes, trailers, and other narrative content that fans have come to love across all Blizzard franchises. We are excited to have them join our union family,”&nbsp;</strong>CWA Local 9510 president Jason Justice said.</p>



<p>As of publishing, neither Activision-Blizzard nor Microsoft have made an official comment on the union.</p>

<p>Resident Evil fans get ready because the next look at Resident Evil Requiem will be coming during Gamescom Opening Night Live.</p>



<p>First claimed by regular Resident Evil leaker <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955312103188992041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dusk Golem</a>, there will be a “new showing” of the game during the show with a media embargo with more details on August 20.</p>



<p><strong>“[Then] it’ll be at Tokyo Game Show next month, too,”</strong> he said.</p>



<p>The Gamescom Opening Night Live appearance was then <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1955252938232021272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed by Geoff Keighley</a>.</p>



<p>Aside from the appearance at Gamescom, Dusk Golem also gave a bit more details on what players can expect from the game. Specifically, the role that Leon will have.</p>



<p><strong>“As far as I know, part of RE9’s whole “Long Awaited Endings &amp; New Beginnings” stuff is supposed be Leon’s last major role in the timeline (sure he’ll still pop up in CG movies &amp; earlier timeline stuff), so you got that to look forward to with Resident Evil Requiem then,”</strong> <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955309595418890576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said.</a></p>



<p>Gamescom Opening Night Live takes place on <strong>August 19 at 11am PT / 2pm ET / 7pm BST / 8pm CEST</strong>. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of everything Gamescom LIVE from Cologne, Germany.</p>



<p>During his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-returns-to-survival-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-off preview of the game</a> back in June, Insider Gaming’s Albert Perkins said that, <strong>“I could feel my shoulders tensing up as she peeked around the corner of each room and made her way down the dark, narrow hallway. And I mean – DARK to the point that the darkness nearly swallowed her into the abyss. Capcom does survival horror right, and this game will do its job of scaring the hell out of you early and often, I guarantee it.”</strong></p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is scheduled to release on February 27, 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p>



<p>What do you think the story holds in Resident Evil Requiem for Leon, and what are you hoping to see at Opening Night Live from the game? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>The next Minecraft Live date has been revealed, and it seems to have happened a bit earlier than planned. </p>



<p>In an FAQ section on the studio’s Spanish website, Mojang has confirmed that the next Minecraft Live event will take place on September 22 at 1pm ET.  As for publishing, the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/es-es/live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spanish site remains</a> but the English version of the site still lists March’s date.</p>



<p>It had been indexed on Google for a short time, as well, but that was removed.</p>



<p>The last Minecraft Live event took place back on March 22. That showcase featured a look at the Minecraft Movie ahead of its launch, game drops, a look at the game’s Vibrant Visuals update, and more. You can catch up on all that via the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-live-2025-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official recap</a>. </p>



<p>Neither Microsoft nor Mojang have confirmed the next Minecraft Live date. However, with it appearing on official websites, it appears to be only a matter of time before it’s made official.</p>



<p>What are you hoping to see announced at the next Minecraft Live in September? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>
