<p>NVIDIA is offering a free GPU to the best Fortnite players in the world during an upcoming tournament in the game, amid the growing shortage of the gear.</p>



<p>The price of GPU and RAM has skyrocketed in recent months amid growing shortages, driven by the increased use of AI, pricing many out of the components. However, the door has been opened for a limited number of players to claim an NVIDIA GPU in Fortnite.</p>

<p>On December 21 and 22nd, with the precise date depending on your region, Fortnite is hosting the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/competitive/events/s39_nvidia?lang=en-US&amp;region=NAE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NVIDIA GeForce RTX Cup</a>, a solo tournament where players can face off to secure grand prizes, including an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU for the “top competitors.”</p>



<p>While earning the GPU requires being one of the best Fortnite players in your region, the shortage and growing price of components makes playing in the Fortnite tournament potentially an easier option than splashing out on the market.</p>



<p>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU starts at $999.99 on the NVIDIA website, with prices on the secondary market being even higher.</p>



<p>Participation in the tournament also opens the door to earning a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rare-fortnite-cosmetic-finally-returns-after-seven-year-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rare cosmetic that has not been available in Fortnite for seven years</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-fortnite-rust-bucket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust Bucket Back Bling</a>, which will be distributed to all players who earn at least eight points during the tournament.</p>



<p>There are restrictions to competing, however, as players need to have participated in at least 14 tournaments in the past 180 days to be eligible.</p>
