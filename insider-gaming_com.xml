<p>The Call of Duty League has published the full spread of competitive settings ahead of the 2025 season. On social media, the unveiling caused some issues with fans worldwide, especially concerning the mapset that has been lined up for the CDL 2025 season. It’s not amazing, and many fans are clinging to the hope that a resurgence of old maps will make their way into the pool.</p>

<h2 id="h-cdl-2025-season-settings-unveiled">CDL 2025 Season Settings Unveiled</h2>



<p>The map list for the 2025 season of the Call of Duty League isn’t amazing, and many are wondering why Control is still a thing.</p>



<p>Here’s the spread:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hardpoint: </strong>Protocol, Red Card, Rewind, Skyline, Vault</li>



<li><strong>Search and Destroy: </strong>Protocol, Red Card, Rewind, Skyline, Vault</li>



<li><strong>Control: </strong>Protocol, Vault</li>
</ul>



<p>Having just two maps for Control is a bit of a nightmare, and it’s yet another year that fans are clamouring and asking for a different mode to fill the competitive slot. For the longest time, people have asked for something like CTF or Blitz to make a return to the Call of Duty esports scene, to no avail.</p>



<p>The settings put forward by the Call of Duty League <a href="https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/competitive-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a recent guide</a> are mostly typical and nothing has changed from last season, but it’s in the restricted items that things start getting interesting. During the pre-season window, we’ve seen plenty of GAs get lobbied around, but the official rules from Activision are something else.</p>



<p>As usual, the need to keep things as balanced as possible is front and centre, and with that in mind, almost every perk and streak is eliminated. Only the RC-XD and Hellstorm missiles remain in the scorestreak selection.</p>

<p>As you play, you’ll encounter various stats and mechanics that, at first glance, don’t make much sense. If you’re a casual Call of Duty player, why should you care about bullet velocity in Black Ops 6? You likely don’t. But to maximize your gameplay and shoot for the meta, you’ll want to learn more about this often-misunderstood stat.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-exactly-is-bullet-velocity-in-bo6">What Exactly Is Bullet Velocity in BO6?</h2>



<p>Bullet velocity in Black Ops 6 is the stat that influences damage dropoff. When you fire a round from your weapon, the bullet flies a certain distance across the map before it becomes useless. If you land your shot, it will deal significantly less damage, or you will fail to land the strike outright. But if you increase bullet velocity (see how below!), you’ll find your shots dealing damage from greater distances.</p>



<p>Two key playstyles warrant tweaking bullet velocity, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-quickscoping-sniper-loadout-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the sniper</a> and the assault player. A sniper rifle already features excellent bullet velocity, but it’s still hindered by range. By increasing velocity, you increase your effective range. The same goes for an assault rifle, like the XM4, which excels at mid-range encounters but can more than hold its own and dominate at range with the right attachments!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-increase-bullet-velocity-in-black-ops-6">How to Increase Bullet Velocity in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The only surefire way to improve bullet velocity in Black Ops 6 is via attachments. Every weapon in the game features a handful of attachments designed to increase velocity, and they’re mostly found within the barrel and ammunition attachment categories, namely:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>5.56 NATO Overpressured Rounds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gain-Twist Barrel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll unlock a weapon’s Gain-Twist Barrel relatively early on, likely after a handful of rounds with the gun, and that’s an easy way to improve velocity in the early game. Eventually, you’ll want to upgrade to the Reinforced Barrel, though.</p>



<p>What’s your favorite weapon in Black Ops 6 to date? You won’t find me using anything but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AK-74</a> most rounds, and my wife swaps between the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4 build</a> and whatever her favorite sniper rifle is at the moment.
