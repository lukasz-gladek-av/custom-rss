<p>Use these Roblox Midnight Chasers monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash and more.</p>



<p>Midnight Chasers is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-catch-a-monster-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that immerses players in an exhilarating street racing experience where speed and skill determine a player’s success. Unlike most Roblox games, in Midnight Chasers, gamers drive supercars, hypercars, bikes or regular cars — weaving through traffic, cutting across highways, or just cruising and showing off their ride. The main objective of the game is to create the ultimate racing machine and test your driving prowess against friends or other players in high-speed competitions.</p>







<p>The more races you win, the better rewards you earn, which will help make your vehicle collection even more impressive. Because there’s a wide selection of vehicles, Midnight Chasers offers replay value. Thus, progression in Midnight Chasers revolves around collecting and using the game’s main currency: Cash. It’s the main resource within the game and allow players to purchase new vehicles and upgrades that can be used to enhance their racing capabilities. Thus, while these currencies can be earned during regular gameplay, redeeming codes will help give players a leg up.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-midnight-chasers-codes">How To Get More Midnight Chasers Codes</h2>



<p>Midnight Chasers codes can usually be found on the game’s official Discord server, on the Roblox game page, and sometimes on the creator/developer’s social media pages. That includes Midnight In-Dev’s X account, as the team drops codes during game milestones and updates. However, keeping tabs on the various sources can be time-consuming, especially when there is no notification system in place when the codes expire.</p>



<p>Thus, we suggest bookmarking this guide in your browser, as we refresh it as soon as new Midnight Chasers codes are released and remove expired codes once they are no longer valid.</p>

            <guid>1378036</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another day, another dollar, right? Or in this case, another day, another round of much-needed NYT Connections hints and solutions. Today’s puzzle is waiting for you, and I’m assuming that you’re keeping up that all-important streak as we head towards the most exciting day of the year.</p>



<p>If you’re pressed for solving today’s NYT Connections puzzle and need the best hints and solutions around, simply read on.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-10">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 10)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #913:</p>



<ul>
<li>WHY</li>



<li>YES</li>



<li>DEAR</li>



<li>SWEET</li>



<li>YEAR</li>



<li>COPY</li>



<li>SUCKER</li>



<li>DUMMY</li>



<li>FAKE</li>



<li>GRACIOUS</li>



<li>YELLOW</li>



<li>CANDY</li>



<li>MERCY</li>



<li>LOLLY</li>



<li>DUPE</li>



<li>HEAVENS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Exclamations of politeness or astonishment</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Something not real or original</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Sweet treats and the people who fall for them</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Words that start with the same letter</em>, <em>kind of</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 10:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-10-913">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 10 (#913)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– DEAR, GRACIOUS, HEAVENS, MERCY</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COPY, DUMMY, DUPE, FAKE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CANDY, LOLLY, SUCKER, SWEET</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – WHY, YEAR, YELLOW, YES</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
