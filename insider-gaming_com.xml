            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>September is a huge month for sports games with several big titles on the horizon, with NBA 2K26 among those poised for launch, and we’ve got the details on whether Game Pass subscribers have access to the game.</p>



<p>Releasing fully on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-release-date-explained-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 5</a>, though it’s available from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 29 for those with early access</a>, NBA 2K26 is the latest entry in the long-running franchise and is always among the most popular games every year.</p>



<p>With September stacked full of big releases, a Game Pass subscription can save you some money, and we’ve got details on whether the service includes NBA 2K26.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-nba-2k26-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play NBA 2K26 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not yet. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, NBA 2K26 will not be available to play with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on September 5th.</strong></p>



<p>NBA 2K26 is not an Xbox first-party title, which would see it immediately made available through the service. Unlike rivals EA Sports, there’s no free trial period with a Game Pass subscription either.</p>



<p>Although the first wave of titles launching on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a> in September is yet to be announced, NBA 2K26 is a huge release and, if it were to be on the service, we’d have been told by now. On top of this, the Xbox Store page would have a button that states the title would be ‘Coming to Game Pass’ alongside the purchase option.</p>



<p>With no such announcement and no Game Pass badge on the store page, the game will definitely not be on the service at launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-nba-2k26-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will NBA 2K26 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>NBA 2K26 could come to the Xbox Game Pass service in the future, although no official word has confirmed this.</strong></p>



<p>2K has a close relationship with Xbox, with a free-play weekend for Game Pass subscribers for NBA 2K25 last year, while NBA 2K24 had a six-month stint on the service previously. </p>



<p>Other 2K titles, like Borderlands, have also regularly appeared on the Game Pass service, and the cycle of sports games usually sees them move to the service in the final few months of their lifespan before the latest release is dropped.</p>



<p>Therefore, if NBA 2K26 is to come to the service, don’t expect it to occur before 2026, unless a free-play weekend or a similar incentive is announced later in the year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Hollow Knight: Silksong on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-switch-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-hollow-knight-silksong-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2.1283904/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The launch of Hollow Knight: Silksong is the type of gaming event that doesn’t come around very often. If you’re excited to get your hands on the sequel and you own a Nintendo Switch 1 or 2 console, let’s check if you can buy Silksong.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is a long time coming—and that’s one of the biggest understatements of 2025. It’s been in development for years, its rabid fanbase is desperate for the sequel, and by the end of its run, the original Hollow Knight had launched on multiple platforms. </p>



<p>With exclusivity, consoles, and hardware up in the air more than ever, you might be wondering if Hollow Knight: Silksong is on the Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, both, or worst-case, neither!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-nintendo-switch-1">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on Nintendo Switch 1?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to Switch things up. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong is still coming out for the original Nintendo Switch 1 console, despite its aging hardware.</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo is remaining steadfast in its desire to support the Switch 1. Its 150 million-plus lifetime sales suggest there’s plenty of potential for any game to succeed on it. Not everyone upgrades to the new gen right away—which is understandable given the console’s considerable price tag.</p>



<p>This is why <a href="https://hollowknightsilksong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> deserves a Nintendo Switch 1 release. It may not run as smoothly as it will on other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-platforms-ps5-xbox-pc-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platforms—such as the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC</a>, for instance—but you should be able to enjoy the fruits of Team Cherry’s years of hard labor and toil.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 owners also get to play Hollow Knight: Silksong when it launches on September 4.</strong></p>



<p>It’s going to become a common theme moving forward. The Switch 2 will be the de facto home for Nintendo players. It’ll eventually become a case of wondering if the game is also coming to the first Switch instead of the Switch 2. We’ve already seen the likes of Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza skip out on the first Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>This is only the beginning, I can assure you. On the other hand, the Switch 1 has plenty of life left, so don’t worry about missing out on big third-party games anytime soon! Enjoy Hornet and her adventure across Hallownest&nbsp;on both Nintendo Switch consoles and see what the hype is all about.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With September stacked full of huge releases, knowing the amount of time it will take to complete games like Cronos: The New Dawn is important for you to plan effectively, so we’ve got the details on the game length.</p>



<p>Launching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 5</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn impressed in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a>, but it lands in a packed release schedule that also includes the likes of Hollow Knight: Silksong and Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>If you’re planning to play multiple new releases in September, we’ve got everything you need to know on the game length of Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-cronos-the-new-dawn">How Many Hours to Beat Cronos: The New Dawn?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dark journey. Image via Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Cronos: The New Dawn will take around 18 hours to beat, according to the developer themselves.</strong></p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/cronos-the-new-dawn-developers-reveal-that-it-will-take-around-18-hours-to-beat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech Radar</a> in April, game directors Wojciech Piejko and Jacek Zięba stated that the game was being completed by play tests in 18 hours. However, it was added that it could change as the team was still “balancing everything.”</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether the game length has extended or shortened since, but it should give players a decent indication of how long it will take to progress through the main story. Depending on how you play, it could take up to 20 hours or as little as 16.</p>



<p>If you want to uncover every secret hidden in the game, it will naturally take you longer until you reach the end, but it’s all down to your playstyle.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-cronos-the-new-dawn-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Cronos: The New Dawn Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>The length of a full completionist run in Cronos: The New Dawn has not been stated, although players are encouraged to play through the main story at least twice.</strong></p>



<p>Replaying the game unlocks new skins, access to a higher difficulty option in New Game+, experimenting with the upgrade system, or trying out different approaches. Crucially, the developers have stated the game needs to be played “at least twice to understand most of it.”</p>



<p>Two playthroughs would total around 36 hours, giving you plenty of time to sink into the title, and it’s clear that replayability is a crucial feature.</p>



<p>How many times do you think you’ll play through Cronos: The New Dawn? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-is-about-to-get-even-harder-in-new-update/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You might think the last thing a FromSoftware game needs is the option to make a game harder. Elden Ring Nightreign is getting just this with the new Deep of Night setting, which ups the difficulty across the board.</p>



<p>FromSoftware’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-all-elden-ring-nightreign-remembrances/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is a unique twist on traditional Elden Ring. It factors in battle royale elements, and there’s an emphasis on speed and succinctness. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-set-of-everdark-sovereigns-arrive-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everdark Sovereigns</a> have been thrust into the game over time, and now a new update is preparing to make Nightreign harder than ever. Yay.</p>



<h2 id="h-deep-of-night-mode-to-make-elden-ring-nightreign-more-difficult">‘Deep of Night’ Mode to Make Elden Ring Nightreign More Difficult</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Beating the first night took long enough. Credit to FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’re a sadist who loves Souls games and finding new ways to challenge yourself, you’re in luck. <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-high-difficulty-expedition-mode-deep-of-night-has-appeared?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=ER-NIGHTREIGN-ChaosMode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bandai Namco</a> has shed light on Deep of Night: “The enemies that appear are stronger than usual.”</p>



<p>The new game mode option arrives on September 11, giving you plenty of time to prepare. Bandai Namco describes the new setting as a “High-difficulty challenge mode&nbsp;designed for seasoned players who have navigated through the Night many times.”</p>



<p>In short, if you’ve mastered Nightreign and can beat all the nights and all the bosses upside down with a blindfold on, you’re probably the person that Deep of Night caters to. The setting also adds new Relics and Gear exclusive to Deep of Night.</p>



<p>A previously hinted-at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-could-be-getting-an-endless-ranked-mode-datamine-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Endless option</a> also accompanies the update. This allows you to keep going until you die, and will really test your ability.</p>



<p>Does Deep of Night sound like your sort of thing? Is making Elden Ring Nightreign harder high up on your wishlist? You know what to do; let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-xbox-game-pass/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>September’s stacked release schedule will certainly put a strain on the wallets of gamers worldwide, so it’s natural to wonder if titles like Cronos: The New Dawn will launch on Game Pass.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 5</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn lands in a packed period of releases alongside the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, but our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a> at Gamescom certainly caught our eye.</p>



<p>If you’ve not pre-ordered Cronos: The New Dawn yet and want to know if you can save money with a Game Pass subscription, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-cronos-the-new-dawn-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Cronos: The New Dawn on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Terrifying. Image via Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Cronos: The New Dawn will not be available to play with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on September 5th.</strong></p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is not a first-party Xbox title, which would mean automatic inclusion in the service, and there hasn’t been any announcement of the title being added to the catalog.</p>



<p>Although we’re still waiting for the first wave of <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a> titles for September to be announced, big releases like Cronos are usually announced well in advance. The biggest indicator is the Xbox Store, which would have a ‘Coming to Game Pass’ badge by the purchase button.</p>



<p>As we’ve had no news to suggest otherwise, and the Xbox Store itself doesn’t advertise a Game Pass drop, don’t expect to see this title drop in the catalog.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-cronos-the-new-dawn-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Cronos: The New Dawn Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no indication of whether Cronos: The New Dawn will eventually come to the Game Pass service, though it cannot be ruled out entirely.</strong></p>



<p>Bloober Team’s Layers of Fear was previously available in Xbox’s now retired Games with Gold service in March 2019, showing that the developer does have a previous relationship with Microsoft. On top of this, The Medium was also included in Game Pass in the past, so there’s certainly a track record that could be followed.</p>



<p>Naturally, though, any potential release for Cronos: The New Dawn on Game Pass would come later down the line, with the initial intention of maximizing sales. Eventually, it could open the door for a new audience to enjoy the game in future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta was a huge success for EA and Battlefield Studios. A lot was learned about the next mainline BF game. If you think you can’t play Battlefield 6 again until October, think again—Battlefield Labs has returned.</p>



<p>Before the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-record-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open beta</a>, there was Battlefield Labs. EA’s new initiative is to incorporate player feedback more than ever before. We all complained vociferously about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-road-to-battlefield-6-pass-all-exclusive-bf6-rewards-how-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2042</a>‘s shortcomings, and it looks promising as EA clearly doesn’t want to make the same mistake twice.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-sign-up-for-battlefield-6-labs">You Can Sign Up For Battlefield 6 Labs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Start playing again right now. Image Via Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Battlefield Communications <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page</a> announced on August 29 that “Battlefield Labs Resumes.”</p>



<p>The community update explained that you can register your interest again—and we have an in-depth guide on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> so you can play and test BF6.</p>



<p>It also explained: “The end of the Open Beta now provides us with the opportunity to return to Battlefield Labs play sessions. This time around, these sessions may occur at more varied intervals as we target finalizing the launch balance and features of Battlefield 6.”</p>



<p>A significant amount of new content is being added to Battlefield Labs that was previously unplayable. The Portal function is being added to Labs—albeit a basic and stripped-back version—and the announced Server Browser functionality is also included in the latest round of testing.</p>



<p>The development team is also using this test to “Determine the official setting for Hardcore mode, and we look forward to working with players to define it.”</p>







<hr>



<p>Don’t expect the Battlefield news to stop between now and release. The new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-pc-trailer-reveals-most-advanced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 PC Trailer</a> blew our minds, and even the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-battlefield-6-camos-have-leaked-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first Battlefield 6 Camos have leaked</a>.</p>



<p>Let us know how excited you are for Battlefield 6 through the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>, featuring gaming conversations every day.</p>
