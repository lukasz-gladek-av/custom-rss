<p>SEGA has provided a new release window of Spring 2025 for Sonic Rumble, along with details about new game modes and other features.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sonic Rumble’s new release window was announced in a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000111/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on its website. Along with the Spring 2025 window, the developers have provided details about new game modes and features such as Quick Rumble, Rival Rank, and the “Crews” feature. The developers have also provided a road map for the game that gives players details about what to expect until release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In update 1.1.1, the developers added 12 new stages, new co-op battles, a Special Rumble, friend invitations, and 12 new languages. The game then received the new Quick Play mode with update 1.1.2. Now, update 1.2.0 will introduce a competitive game mode, new ‘Crews’ feature, and skills for each game character.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-new-sonic-rumble-game-modes-and-features">New Sonic Rumble Game Modes and Features</h2>



<p>Sonic Rumble’s Quick Rumble is a quick-play mode that allows players to hop in and play a bite-sized one-round challenge. Rival Rank is a fresh competitive mode enabling players to showcase their skills and earn extra rewards at a new stage. The ‘Crews’ feature, on the other hand, allows players to take on the competition as a group and earn even more rewards.</p>



<p>The developers have stated they will pack Sonic Rumble with new content features before it arrives this Spring. They will also add specific abilities for each character from the Sonic Universe to make them feel truly unique, such as Amy’s Piko Piko Hammer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Delta Force is laying down the law as an FPS not to be messed with, and its controller support keeps cropping up in combat. Mouse and keyboard players need not worry, but let’s see if Delta Force has a controller as a trusted ally.</p>



<p>The gaming market is never short of shooters—third-person, first-person, or otherwise. Black Ops 6 and Warzone remain popular despite dwindling numbers, Marvel Rivals is dominating the hero shooter genre, and Fortnite has infinite lives. Gray Zone Warfare was an example of an indie shooter trying to break out and match the extraction success of Escape From Tarkov—but Delta Force is a force in its own right.</p>



<p>The first-person shooter title has received new fans courtesy of its free <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Hawk Down Campaign DLC</a>. We’ll clear up any confusion about controller support for Team Jade’s shooter.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-delta-force-have-controller-support">Does Delta Force Have Controller Support?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Trickier than it needs to be. Credit to Team Jade</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Delta Force officially doesn’t have controller support on PC yet, meaning you either have to use keyboard and mouse or unsupported controller support.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, Delta Force doesn’t let you use a controller right now. If you want to use a controller with Delta Force, you need to enable <strong>Steam Input</strong>. This allows you to connect a controller, but the controls might be a bit funky and unstable. You might experience input issues you wouldn’t have with proper native support.</p>



<p>For now, you’re better off using a keyboard and mouse. This might not be forever though as updates have been provided concerning controller support.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-controller-support-coming-to-delta-force">When is Controller Support Coming to Delta Force?</h2>



<p><strong>The developer has confirmed controller support is coming to Delta Force in Q1 2025.</strong></p>



<p>On Dec. 5, 2024, a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2507950/discussions/0/4638240954399129918/?ctp=2#c4638240954399140782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam General Discussion thread for Delta Force</a> discussed the topic of “No controller support?” User Philx.v posed this question about Delta Force. The question wasn’t left for the community to discuss amongst itself though.</p>



<p>A Team Jade dev commented on the query: “Thank you for playing Delta Force! We’re working on adding controller support and are aiming to introduce this feature to the game by Q1 2025.” It’s looking likely that <strong>March 2025</strong> will see the addition of controller support, but this is subject to change.</p>



<p>It was rumored the support would coincide with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-console-release-window-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console launch of Delta Force</a>. However, the Delta Force console release date—as of writing—has been postponed. But it is coming, so keep those dual analog sticks warm while you wait.</p>
