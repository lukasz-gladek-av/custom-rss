<p>Valve provided some insight on their scheduling via their 2025 second half announcement. The Fests are centered around “a rotating category of games,” with dates set well in advance for developers to have time to plan their participation. Back in 2021, Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3002196778013479574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> that daily wishlist additions jumped 421% during the 2020 Next Fest, resulting in a an increase of 292% in “converting wishlists” sales. While gaming sales number in general were incredibly inflated during the first year of COVID, this still demonstrates how important Steam Sales and Fests are to selling games.</p>
