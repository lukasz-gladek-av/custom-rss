<p>It has been confirmed that Black Ops 6 will appear at the Esports World Cup in 2025. This is the first game to be locked in for the multi-million-dollar event, which is set to run between July and August 2025. This year’s Esports World Cup was the first iteration of the event, and it was a roaring success, by all account ts.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-locked-in">Locked In</h2>



<p>This year’s Esports World Cup saw everything represented, from League of Legends to Counter-Strike 2, and from Rainbow Six Siege to Rocket League. While Call of Duty was a late addition to the monumental tournament, Activision has more than made up for that delay this year by making Black Ops 6 <strong>the first confirmed game </strong>for the Esports World Cup 2025.</p>



<p>In August, Atlanta FaZe stormed the stage and secured the $600,000 prize pool, beating an unlikely 100 Thieves team in an intense grand final in Riyadh. The tournament didn’t pull in as strong a viewership as the Call of Duty League, but it made for a nice change of pace in the off-season, and it allowed for a much more diverse roster of teams to compete</p>



<p>It’ll likely be the same format this year, with Challengers-grade teams mixing up with CDL squads in a Pro-Am setting. </p>



<p>As the months move by, we’ll see many more games surface in the line-up for the 2025 Esports World Cup. If the inaugural event was a showstopper, the event’s organisers will be pulling out all the stops to make sure that the second year is even bigger.</p>

<p>HBO has confirmed a release window for season 2 of The Last Of Us. According to the network itself, the current target is Spring 2025 for second season of the popular show.</p>



<p>In addition to the confirmation of a release window, a new short teaser was released for the show. You can watch that at the end of the story.</p>



<p>The Last of Us Season 2 will follow the events of the second game in the franchise. That said, there will be some additions to the show in the form of backstory. In September, series creator and head of Naughty Dog Neil Druckmann said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-two-backstory-important/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the show will dive further</a> into areas that they couldn’t do for the game.</p>



<p>“And there’s stuff in this season that I’m really excited about — stuff that we hinted at — one scene in particular comes to mind that I think fans of the game will eat up, because it really kind of tells you a lot of backstory of this important character that there wasn’t really a way for us to even do that in the game,” he said. </p>



<p>It was also has been said that the story of the second game will likely be told over multiple seasons meaning that the show should at least get a third season.</p>



<p>“We don’t think that we’re going to be able to tell the story even within two [more] seasons because we’re taking our time and [going] down interesting pathways which we did a little bit in season one too,” Showrunner Crag Mazin told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-showrunner-season-two-casting-abby-1235560553/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. </p>



<p>“We feel like it’s almost assuredly going to be the case that – as long as people keep watching and we can keep making more television – season three will be significantly larger. And indeed, the story may require season four.”</p>

<p>During the Q3 2024 <a href="https://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/news/?news=300823" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings report</a>, Shift Up revealed that a PC release for Stellar Blade is being considered for 2025. The developers stated, “Considering recent trends such as Steam’s expanding market share in the AAA game sector and the global success of Black Myth Wukong, we expect the performance on PC to exceed consoles.”</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is an action-adventure title developed by South Korean developer Shift Up. It was released in April 2024 and has been exclusive to the PS5 since then. However, after the latest developments, players can finally play Stellar Blade on PC in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stellar Blade follows the journey of 7th Airborne Squad member EVE, who arrives on a desolate, abandoned Earth to save Humankind from the Naytiba. However, while battling these evil forces, Eve also puts together the mysteries of human civilisation, which makes her realise that her mission isn’t as simple as it seems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game features intense and fast-paced third-person combat, where players use basic attacks, Beta skills, ranged attacks, and Burst skills to take down the Naytiba. You also get to explore a unique, post-apocalyptic world that consists of crumbling buildings, vast wastelands, deserts, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arc Raiders, the upcoming extraction shooter from Embark Studios, has just revealed its gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new Arc Raiders gameplay trailer features early tech test gameplay recorded in October 2024. The footage shown in this trailer is still a work in progress and “does not represent the final quality” of the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Arc Raiders gameplay reveal shows us what it feels like to be a part of the game’s universe, which is set in a distant future on Earth. In the gameplay trailer, we follow the mission of three raiders who are trying to complete a quest in the Buried City. Players begin in Speranza Piazza, a haven in the rust belt that protects civilisations from the Arc machines on the surface.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, this haven always needs resources, and Raiders venture out to bring these vital materials from the surface. The journey is treacherous, as the Raiders have to deal with the deadly Arc Machines that occupy the surface and be vigilant of rival Raiders who might be looking to steal their loot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Arc Raiders gameplay trailer reveals that players can access multiple surface regions through a network of tunnels from the Piazza. This mission takes players to Calabretta, Buried City. Here, players glimpse the post-apocalyptic universe created for the title while the Raiders explore the deeper city to retrieve a seed vault from a research facility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this mission, the Raiders loot different types of resources while plotting a course for medical supplies at the pharmacy. While exploring, they see a red flare in the wild, which signifies a Raider being knocked down. However, there’s no way of knowing what happened without scoping out the location.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The players in the Arc Raiders gameplay trailer then proceed to the research facility, where they are greeted with bullets from the drone-like Arc machines. During this segment, we see the shooter mechanics as the Raiders shoot down several machines and fight other rival Raiders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The end of the Arc Raiders trailer explains that sometimes an aggressive approach might be the only way; however, there will be many other times when stealth might be the way to go. The Rust Belt is a land of opportunities and secrets to uncover, and players get to shape the Raiders they want to be in this world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sure, you could sell your harvest wholesale using a combine harvester, load up a trailer, and then drive the load across town to sell. You’ll make a few thousand dollars per harvest, and adequate money compounds over time. But if you’d rather keep your harvest at home to earn more money, take advantage of production chains. They’ll earn you top dollar but require more time and investment. For now, here’s a look at all of the products in Farming Simulator 25!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-product-you-can-craft-in-farming-simulator-25">Every Product You Can Craft in Farming Simulator 25</h2>



<p>I completely understand the desire to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-crops-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">harvest your yield</a> and immediately rid yourself of the trouble. You dump the whole lot in a truck and drive it off to make a quick buck. Then, you repeat the process. But if you plan ahead, you can make significantly more money in Farming Simulator 25 by investing in production chains that allow you to craft canned goods, cereal, olive oil, and furniture. I mean, you can even build a cat tree toy. What?!</p>

<h2 id="h-how-do-production-chains-work-in-farming-simulator-25">How Do Production Chains Work in Farming Simulator 25?</h2>



<p>As its name implies, the production chain mechanic requires a chain of goods, materials, and machines to process raw items into tangible, physical goods that you may sell to corporations or businesses around the map. First, you’ll likely prioritize crops, as every map begins with a few fields. As such, I recommend prioritizing canned goods, as they’ll initially provide a more straightforward production chain.</p>



<p>That said, you must invest copious amounts of money. Not only must you buy seeds, prep the fields, and perform the usual harvesting processes to gather your vegetables, but you also require a factory. With a factory, depending on its type, you can turn crops and animal products, like milk or eggs, into processed goods that earn more money. There are numerous factory types in the game, some specifically for crops and others for forestry, for example.</p>



<p>You can buy a pre-built factory somewhere on the map or place one yourself using the game’s build mode. Either way, expect to pay an arm and a leg.</p>



<p>What’s your first production chain in Farming Simulator 25 going to be? Let us know in the comments, or start a thread in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a> to discuss strategy and crop rotations with other fans!</p>

<p>If you don’t want to invest too much money, whether it’s in your video games or your production chains, then you’re likely wondering about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/farming-simulator-25-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Farming Simulator 25 on Xbox Game Pass</a>, right?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cod-league-2025-skins-revealed-activision/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cod-league-2025-skins-revealed-by-activision.1033992/</guid>

<p>Activision has lifted the lid on the Call of Duty League 2025 season Operator skins, and they’re… Well, they’re not good. They’re pretty basic and almost nothing seems to have influenced their design beyond basic colour schemes, but at least Boston Breach has a demonic face mask.</p>



<p>The smattering of skins hasn’t impressed COD League fans worldwide, but they’ll of course sell because Call of Duty players love to represent their favourite team in-game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cod-league-skins-confirmed">COD League Skins Confirmed</h2>



<p>All 12 COD League skins have been revealed by Activision, but they’re not very innovative. That’s a surprise considering how inventive teams have been with other Operator skins in Black Ops 6 thus far, and the Season One Battle Pass continues that trend in earnest.</p>



<p>Here are the teams competing in the Call of Duty League 2025 season:</p>



<ul>
<li>Atlanta FaZe</li>



<li>Boston Breach</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Cloud9 New York</li>



<li>LA Guerrillas</li>



<li>LA Thieves</li>



<li>Miami Heretics</li>



<li>Minnesota Rokkr</li>



<li>OpTic Texas</li>



<li>Seattle Surge</li>



<li>Toronto Ultra</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>
</ul>



<p>The design follows the ‘backwards-cap-and-goggles’ aesthetic that has been present in the Call of Duty League skin circle for years. It’s about time something changed, but at least the team branding is on point. </p>



<p>Some of the flashier skins have been reserved for Boston Breach and OpTic Texas, while the LAG and C9 skins have a full-body colour change on deck – everyone else is just wearing a standard black outfit.</p>



<p>Traditionally, teams have very little input in the design of these skins. They can choose colours, the locations of said colours, and usually the design of the central flash that makes up the skin’s core identity, but that’s it. They’re not going to have Rokkr’s skin wearing a horned helmet or have the Royal Ravens’ skin boast a set of wings now, are they?</p>



<p>The COD League skins will be released later in Season One.</p>
