<p>The Resident Evil Movie’s director has stated that it “adheres more to the tone” of RE4. </p>



<p>We have yet to see an official trailer for the upcoming Resident Evil Movie, but new information about the adaptation seems to emerge periodically. Last time, we learned the movie’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-leak-reveals-link-to-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">link to the game series</a>. Now, the director has revealed that the upcoming RE movie will be aligned with the tone of RE4. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-movie-is-much-bigger-in-scale-than-the-director-s-previous-movies">Resident Evil Movie is Much Bigger in Scale than the Director’s Previous Movies</h2>



<p>Resident Evil Movie’s director, Zach Creggor, was recently interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnKTQ2Xenbs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Double Toasted</a> (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-2026-movie-zach-cregger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>) and was asked questions about the adaptation. When discussing the approach, Cregger explained that the upcoming movie is “true to the experience of the games.” The journey the audience would have as a viewer in this movie is similar to a player of these games, where we follow “one protagonist from point A to point B as they just descend deeper and deeper and deeper into Hell.”</p>



<p>Cregger elaborates that he has played “thousands and thousands of hours of Resident Evil,” which has made him well-versed with the franchise’s pacing. He understands that it is “inherently cinematic” and is “really pumped” about the story they are building in this world. The Resident Evil movie features an original story and is very much in line with Cregger’s sensibility and his “sense of tone”. Moreover, “it is just a much bigger scale than Weapons and certainly Barbarian”. </p>



<p>Cregger adds that fans of the Resident Evil movie franchise might not be prepared for what he has planned, but fans of the games “are probably going to be stoked.” </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-movie-s-tone-and-inspiration-from-games">Resident Evil Movie’s Tone and Inspiration From Games</h2>



<p>The upcoming Resident Evil movie is more closely tied to the world of the games, the director states. Cregger explains that the upcoming Resident Evil movie probably “lives more” in the world of RE2 and RE3, but it “adheres more to the tone” of RE4. He explains that the game franchise has always been malleable, with every new game featuring different settings and tones. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-movie-is-being-shot-in-prague-and-shooting-begins-mid-october">Resident Evil Movie is Being Shot in Prague, and Shooting Begins Mid-October</h2>



<p>Zach Cregger has revealed that shooting for the Resident Evil Movie begins in mid-October and is expected to wrap up by January 2026. The movie is being shot in Prague, and when asked why that location, the director explained that it has a rebate that allows them to make this movie with the budget they have. Moreover, it has a talented crew, great stages, and a lot of resources; “it is the right place for it”. </p>



<p>In other news, the director of the Resident Evil movie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-director-wont-focus-on-lore-people-are-going-to-come-for-me-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not be “completely obedient</a>” with the series’ lore. Additionally, the upcoming adaptation will feel “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-movie-fresh-edgy-weird/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh, edgy, and weird</a>“. What are your thoughts on the Resident Evil movie following the tone of RE4?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/reaper-actual-blockchain-developer-why-interview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reaper-actual-has-blockchain-features-and-i-spoke-to-the-developer-to-figure-out-why%E2%80%94interview.1287585/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Reaper Actual is an upcoming open-world first-person shooter with persistence. It will one day accommodate hundreds of players on a single server, boast a breathing ecosystem featuring the evolution of time, weather, and factions, and it’s going to be free to play. If that doesn’t sound good enough, consider that it’s designed to be accessible, no matter your skill level.</p>



<p>Well, the first impressions of Reaper Actual are often derailed slightly when prospective fans learn that the game has blockchain and NFT elements built into it. This was a huge concern for me, but since talking to the team at Distinct Possibility Studios at Gamescom, I caught up with them once again to dispel any worries about the NFT mechanics in Reaper Actual.</p>



<p>I’m happy to say that, once I learned how it all works, I’m satisfied it’s not going to be a problem.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview, if you’d rather see it that way:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Reaper Actual's PvPvE(vE) World Explored with Matt Higby - Developer Spotlight" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f-vRol-pTgk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-getting-into-the-blockchain-with-reaper-actual">Getting Into the Blockchain with Reaper Actual</h2>



<p>Reaper Actual takes elements from open-world shooters, arcade games like Call of Duty, and extraction shooters like Escape from Tarkov. It’s from developers that formerly worked on the likes of PlanetSide and H1Z1, and it’s being designed as an open-ended and ever-evolving game with a rolling meta and customization features out the wazoo.</p>



<p>It’s surprising to some to learn that Reaper Actual also has elements that place the game on the blockchain. I don’t <strong>fully </strong>understand that world, but I know enough to appreciate that, for some gamers, that’s a <strong>huge </strong>red flag.</p>



<p>I sat down with Distinct Possibility Studios co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Matthew Higby, to learn how these NFT mechanics work in Reaper Actual.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The things that you’ll be able to buy, sell… Bases are a good example. You’ll be able to buy a base which will be a unique unit at an address in the game world. You can think of that like an elevator in a high-rise building or the entrance to a bunker facility — multiple people can have bases within that same location, but each one is like a unique fingerprint.</p>



<p>Not only is it unique in terms of what the base by default is, but it also contains all of the upgrades that you do to it as a player over time.</p>



<p>If you levelled up your base to be able to make really good sniper rifles and that represents some number of hours and some number of credits and investments to level your base up, if you decided to sell that base, you could just rip out all those upgrades if you wanted to and get your credits back, but you could just package up the base with the upgrades you’ve installed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Higby’s words, it’s ‘an increase to ownership’ in Reaper Actual, giving players a kind of <strong>financial control </strong>over their bases that they invest time and effort in to build up. While we discussed <strong>bases</strong>, I also learned that <strong>Reapers</strong>, the game’s character models, will be available to list as NFTs after being upgraded and evolved by players.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Another thing you’ll be able to mint and sell are Reapers. As I mentioned, they’re permutationally unique characters that exist within the game. They have a combination of things that can make them situationally attractive for different roles and missions.</p>



<p>Between all of this and their biography, their name, their look, they have a pretty unique combination of things, and it’s just a very easy way to convey that, to allow people to trade those things. It’s with the functionality that you get with an NFT, where it’s just all contained in one cryptographic asset.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-but-are-nfts-optional-in-reaper-actual">But Are NFTs Optional in Reaper Actual?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>As I dove down the rabbit hole with Matt, I learned how <strong>practical </strong>the blockchain mechanics are in Reaper Actual. Players can spend hours building up a base to then sell it to someone who would rather purchase one ready-made than grind themselves to get it. It’s a real estate market in that respect.</p>



<p>Matt explained further:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It makes it feel like it’s something that’s yours, and that’s how we’re trying to lean into NFTs. One of the things that they get maligned on, and people have opinions on all sides of the map about this stuff, is that they tend to be viewed only as this speculative vehicle and the reason they’re in the game is because people want to be doing money stuff with them, or whatever.</p>



<p>In reality, a lot of these mechanics can be utility-granting and utility-oriented, right?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Practical is one thing, but what about optional? Not everyone enjoys the concept of NFTs, and in the gaming world, the term has long been seen as the boogeyman. I asked Matt if you could play Reaper Actual just fine without investing in the blockchain side of things.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Totally, yeah. We’re going to be running the game on Steam, we’re going to be running on Epic, and those environments, it’s going to be completely devoid of the Web3 mechanics. All of the functionality is going to be exactly the same.</p>



<p>There will still be permutationally unique Reapers, you’ll still be able to upgrade and sell your house, you’ll just be using it with a different kind of currency.</p>



<p>What I hope that we can do is show that these blockchain mechanics can be a force for good and not just for greed, and that there’s actually a sort of value that gets unlocked by using them. One thing that is guaranteed to be true about this game is that it’s unlike any other game you’ve played before.</p>



<p>If people really like the feeling of playing one of these peristent world games, then maybe they’ll decide to take the extra step and go try it on the Web3 service if they feel like it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team at Distinct Possibility Studios wants to offer the NFT mechanics to those who want them, but it’s not at all critical to the overarching game <strong>experience</strong>.</p>



<p>Everything else that I learned in my deep dive with Matt Higby was more than enough to fill me with serious interest in Reaper Actual, and with an intended release window of Q1 2026, it’s only a matter of time before we can all dive in.</p>



<p>Do you think Reaper Actual is your kind of game? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals Season 4 leaks have arrived, revealing the new season’s heroes, battle pass, skins, team-ups, a new game mode, and more. </p>



<p>As we draw closer to Marvel Rivals season 4, more leaks and rumors have started circulating. A recent claim stated Marvel Rivals could finally be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-debut-could-finally-be-happening-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making its debut on PS4</a>. New leaks regarding Marvel Rivals Season 4 have surfaced online, revealing details about the upcoming content expected in the next season.  </p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-4-leaked-heroes">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Leaked Heroes</h2>



<p>The leaked information about Marvel Rivals Season 4 originated from a Russian Discord channel, via XOXLEAK on <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1962964070581338220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) and Dylbobz on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92EIFCUXkrI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. Their new post states that the season name is called Heart of the Dragon, the launch hero will be Angela, and the second hero is Daredevil. Angela has some kind of temporary flying mechanic and has a melee-based skillset with a “bow or perhaps a spear”. Daredevil has an Asian-styled design and opposes Angela, “embodying the Dragon and the Tiger.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>POSSIBLE Season 4 leak:</p><p>Launch Hero: ANGELA</p><p>Angela has some kind of fly mechanic (temporary), looks to be a melee hero but it seems she has a Bow or perhaps a Spear. </p><p>Battle Pass:<br>"FRUIT OF IMORTALITY"<br>Skins: <br>– Moon Knight (Mecha Knight from what if)<br>– Phoenix (presumably… <a href="https://t.co/2G4m37DfOT">pic.twitter.com/2G4m37DfOT</a></p></div>— X0XLEAK (@X0X_LEAK) <a href="https://twitter.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1962960946340548810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-4-battle-pass-and-skin-leaks">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Battle Pass and Skin Leaks</h2>



<p>Coming to Marvel Rivals Season 4 Battle Pass, it is reportedly called “Fruits of Immortality”. It will feature skins like Moon Knight Mecha Knight from Marvel’s What If…? series, a new Phoenix skin which is “presumably Dark Phoenix”, and a Phoenix Force Loki skin which is Red and has feathers. There is seemingly a new Ultron Wasteland skin to look forward to as well. </p>



<h2 id="h-new-game-mode-and-team-ups">New Game Mode and Team Ups </h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 4 is reportedly arriving with a new quick-play game mode that allows players to select the same heroes multiple times. Regarding Team-Ups, Human Torch, Black Panther, and Psylocke are the first ones; Venom and Captain America are the second ones. </p>



<p>Regardless, the information doesn’t come from the usual source; therefore, readers should take it with a massive grain of salt. All will be confirmed when the new season trailer arrives this week. </p>

<p>If you’re brave enough to tackle the terrors of Bloober Team’s new Cronos: The New Dawn IP, I can tell you first-hand that the trophy list isn’t easy. This guide has every known achievement, as well as all the hidden and secret trophies you normally have to venture into the game to find out.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> isn’t for the faint-hearted. It’s a survival-horror game with an emphasis on psychological torment, as well as physical endangerment—thanks to the game’s litany of disfigured, slimy menaces. I had an endless sense of unease playing the game, but it was worth it. I also happened to scoop up a ton of trophies and achievements on the way.</p>



<p>If you want to see the Cronos: The New Dawn trophy list for yourself, you’ve come to the right place.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-and-trophies-are-in-cronos-the-new-dawn">How Many Achievements And Trophies Are In Cronos: The New Dawn?</h2>



<p><strong>There is a grand total of 48 PlayStation Trophies and 47 Xbox Achievements for you to pursue in Cronos: The New Dawn.</strong></p>



<p>Granted, a lot of Cronos is <em>you </em>being hunted and chased down. If you’re hankering for the game’s full set of extra accomplishments, though, you need to keep the entire list in mind. You can’t get every trophy and achievement on your first playthrough, as it’s impossible. </p>



<p>Getting the Platinum Trophy requires at least one more run—there is no Platinum Trophy for Xbox users, be warned.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s hopefully the start of something special for Bloober Team and Cronos: The New Dawn. It’s an incredible new IP with all the makings of a new series. I enjoyed it, but let me know how you get on with it through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
