<p>One of 2025’s biggest and most important titles is a remake—Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. It’s a full remake of MGS3, and the review embargo will tell us if it’s lived up to the original game’s legend, or if it’s fallen flat on its face in Tselinoyarsk mud.</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid is an all-time franchise. Its stories still stand the test of time, and there are gameplay ideas that had they not been done previously would be unthinkable in 2025—although looking at the back of the game case would be slightly problematic in the digital era. I don’t think there’s a finer example of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-boss-fights-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MGS than Snake Eater</a>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater remake</a> is a fitting first reimagining. Even though Hideo Kojima isn’t at the helm of the project, we still expect this to be a hit. So let’s check out its review embargo details.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Fans will hang onto the word of reviews. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Several sources have quoted August 22 as the game’s review embargo date, with a release time of 12:01 AM PT.</strong></p>



<p>Many outlets and critics already seem to have gotten their hands on Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. You can see from Destin Legarie’s <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> page that this is the case.</p>



<p>Destin is quoted as saying: “I’ve played Metal Gear Solid Delta on PS5 and PC. Embargoed for Friday, August 22nd, 2025 as 12:01am PT. Coverage beyond me fanboying will be live at embargo.”</p>

<p><strong>Expectations for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater are sky-high, and I expect the reviews to follow suit with a Metacritic score in the region of 90-95.</strong></p>



<p>A telltale sign that Konami is confident about Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is that review copies are already out weeks in advance. The other sign is the review embargo date being a week before launch. Companies only do this if they’re confident about their product.</p>



<p>I would suggest Konami is more than happy with the state of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. This is great news when you consider 2004’s original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater has a <strong>91/100 rating</strong> on Metacritic. As long as the remake builds upon existing greatness and adds some modern-day quality of life changes, it’s hard to see the score dropping below 91.</p>



<p>Using my reasoning, I don’t think a <strong>92 or 93</strong> score is out of the question.</p>



<hr>



<p>The wait for the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review embargo will be more excruciating than Naked Snake using CQC to battle a crab. Let me know what score you think the Snake Eater remake is going to score. Be sure to check out the Insider Gaming forum for more MGS discussions.</p>

<p><strong>August 28 is the official release date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, which will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>With the release window now rapidly approaching, there should be no delays for Snake Eater, and excitement levels are rising ahead of the remake of the classic from over 20 years ago. If things go well, this could provide the spark for other Metal Gear Solid games to receive the remaster treatment.</p>



<p>The remaster will stay true to the original story, with graphics enhancements and a better frame rate than the original. There’s also a remake of Snake vs Monkeys for those on PlayStation and PC, while Xbox players will be able to enjoy a brand-new creation, Snake vs Bomberman.</p>







<p><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be available from 4pm PT on August 28, according to the PlayStation Store listing.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/JP0101-PPSA15304_00-SNAKEEATERDELUXE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PS Store listing</a> provides the details we are using for this guide, although the timings are subject to change and, on occasion, they will be tweaked closer to launch. We’ll keep a close eye on any changes and update this guide accordingly, if required.</p>

<p>Peak’s popularity continues to rise with almost two million sales last week during a sale on Steam, according to new data.</p>



<p>The title received a significant update recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-adds-cannibalism-in-its-latest-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adding cannibalism</a> to the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peaks-first-major-update-adds-a-new-biome-items-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alongside a new biome</a>, complete with new items and mysteries to solve.</p>



<p>A 38% discount on Steam then went live on August 11, which is still running, propelling Peak to staggering numbers with almost two million sales in the week alone, putting the game on the cusp of 10 million sales overall.</p>



<h2 id="h-peak-approaches-10-million-sales-mark">Peak Approaches 10 Million Sales Mark</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Huge boost. Image via Alinea Analytics</figcaption></figure>



<p>New data published by <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/peak-sold-18-million-copies-last" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a> revealed the impressive numbers, with 1.8 million sales last week, pushing the title to 9.7 million copies sold overall. With the sale price still available, the 10 million mark should be surpassed this week.</p>



<p>Sales have pushed revenue to over $55 million, it’s added, and should Peak pass the 10 million sales mark, it will become the second budget indie title to hit the milestone in 2025, following on from R.E.P.O (16.8 million sales). Last week, revenues are reported to have been $6.9 million.</p>



<p>Those numbers gave Peak the accolade of being the highest-selling title on Steam last week (August 11 to 17), with charts showing the huge rebound in sales numbers for the title, which had seen week-by-week sales steadily decrease since release.</p>



<p>Impressively, Peak sold over 550,000 copies on the weekend alone, while the launch of the Mesa Update on August 11 also brought legacy players back to the game, resulting in a boost to concurrent players.</p>



<p>Is Peak one of the best games to release in 2025? Should it be a Game of the Year contender? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3332/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
