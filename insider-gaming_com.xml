<p>A day after its release, Netflix’s Splinter Cell Deathwatch has been renewed for a second season.</p>



<p>The animated series, developed by John Wick’s Derek Kolstad, takes the iconic Splinter Cell in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-trailer-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a whole new direction</a>. The show continues the story of the game’s protagonist, Sam Fisher, with The Wolverine’s Liev Schreiber donning the night vision goggles. The Netflix animated series released yesterday and received decent scores across the board. Now, at IGN Fan Fest, creator Derek Kolstad revealed that things are already in motion for a new season.</p>

<p>In a message from Derek Kolstad at <a href="https://youtu.be/MWjJW1d4KGQ?si=h2mYex9FfEIVjHvi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN Fan Fest</a>, the creator revealed that season two of Splinter Cell: Deathwatch has been greenlit. Furthermore, the show is already full into production, though it’s too soon to say when fans can expect to return to the world. In the message, the John Wick creator states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>”We’ve got a Season Two coming your way,” Kolstad <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/splinter-cell-deathwatch-exclusive-season-2-announcement-ign-fall-fan-fest-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said to IGN</a>. “We don’t [have a release date yet]. And being new to animation, I know how long it takes. But we are fully into preproduction and everyone is super excited about where we go next.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was also announced that the show’s second season will offer a much larger-scale story. Even still, Kolstad promises that the action will continue to be as big and bold as before. The first season ended pretty climactically, so fans are anxious to know how things will go after. While it may not be for a while, at least we now know it won’t be long before we see Sam Fisher again, though not in game form.</p>

<p>Are the starters in Pokémon Legends: Z-A shiny-locked? For those looking to fill out their shiny dex in the new entry, getting a quick start on your first companion would be a nice boon.</p>



<p>The jingle and animation that made its debut in Pokémon Legends: Arceus have returned to help players know for sure when a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-shiny-charm-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shiny Pokémon</a> has appeared, but what about getting the shiny forms of Tepig, Totodile, and Chikorita?</p>



<p>Here is your answer to whether or not starters are shiny-locked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Your first version of Chikorita will never be shiny. Image via The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, no, your starter Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Z-A can not be shiny. All three of the options to start the game are indeed shiny-locked.</strong></p>



<p>However, just because your initial Pokémon selection will not be able to be shiny, that doesn’t mean you’ll never have a chance to get those creatures in a shiny form. Much like in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, there will be opportunities to catch more Tepig, Totodile, and Chickorita out in the wild.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because the usual breeding mechanic you would see in the main games isn’t in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pre-order-bonus-redeem-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, your only option for getting shiny starters is by catching them in the wild or by having a friend trade you their shiny that they caught in the wild, but good luck having that good of a friend.</p>



<p>In many ways, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-character-customization-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is a continuation of the features in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and not connected to the mainline games.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-legendaries-mythics-and-gift-pokemon-shiny-locked-in-pokemon-legends-z-a">Are Legendaries, Mythics, and Gift Pokémon Shiny-Locked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A?</h2>



<p><strong>Like the starters, legendary, mythic, and gift Pokémon are also shiny-locked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</strong></p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22967325315&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAC1RXL2gbv06knnCyBaLlfQOyzPWM&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjL3HBhCgARIsAPUg7a6-J2Pf2xDLAF_SdagMvszXCw9WFdvgiF7BL1yhoYFq_PYwHG7xvWQaAh7sEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, there are several special Pokémon that are encountered through the story and special requests. The legendaries of Pokémon X and Y in Xerneas, Yveltal, Zygarde, and Mewtwo are all shiny-locked, as are the mythicals Diancie, Hoopa, and Volcanion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokémon that you receive as a gift, which include the original Kalos region starters Chespin, Fennekin, and Froakie, will also never be shiny when received through the gifting method, but these Pokémon can also be found in the wild later in the game, similar to the current starters.</p>



<p>Completing the shiny dex in Pokémon Legends: Z-A requires many of the same methods that Arceus had before. The lack of breeding and the various shiny-locked situations will limit your chances somewhat, but you already know going in that shiny hunting is something that is going to take a lot of time regardless.</p>
