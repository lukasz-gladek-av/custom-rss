<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/farming-simulator-25-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Farming Simulator 25</a> allows players to create and develop their very own farms, with a plethora of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-animals-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animals</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/products-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">products</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-crops-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crops</a> to choose from. Raising animals and harvesting crops is a rewarding experience, and many love the realism and progression Farming Simulator offers.</p>



<p>You’ll need to put in the hours though, as farm work isn’t easy. Speaking of which, if you’re wondering how many are online dedicating their time to their virtual farm, here’s the Farming Simulator 25 player count.</p>



<h2 id="h-farming-simulator-25-player-count">Farming Simulator 25 player count</h2>



<p>Farming Simulator 25 has <strong>44,265 live players on Steam</strong> at the time of writing (November 13, 2024), and an <strong>all-time peak player count of 126,761</strong> on Valve’s platform, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2300320/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. The all-time peak was reached on its release date of November 12, 2024, which saw players flocking to start their farming journey.</p>



<p>These numbers are only for players enjoying the game via Steam on PC, and as the game is available through other platforms on PC and also consoles, the player count is likely much higher than what’s found on SteamDB.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-there-a-player-count-for-farming-simulator-25-on-consoles">Is there a player count for Farming Simulator 25 on consoles?</h2>



<p>Farming Simulator 25 is also <strong>available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles</strong>, but unfortunately, we <strong>do not have access to the player count numbers</strong> on these platforms. However, it’s safe to assume that the player count would be much higher if the player count was accumulated for all the platforms the game is available on.</p>



<p>The game also features cross-platform play and a multiplayer feature for up to 16 players on a dedicated server and up to 6 on console servers. The multiplayer feature is very popular for Farming Simulator and it’s likely one of the main reasons for its high player count, as people are hopping on to create a farm on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-fast-travel-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive maps</a> with friends.</p>



<p>If the devs, Giants Software, ever decide to release details on the Farming Simulator 25 player count or sales numbers across all of the platforms the game is available on, we’ll be sure to update this piece with all the relevant information.</p>

<p>The official FNCreate account on <a href="https://x.com/FNCreate/status/1856366599059427510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) has revealed that Fortnite’s First-Person Camera Mode device publishing will arrive on December 11, 2024. As the announcement hasn’t come from the main Fortnite account, the first-person mode will be reserved for Fortnite Creative and will not be included in the game’s standard battle royale mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s first-person mode has been rumoured to arrive for years, and players finally have an official date to look forward to. It will be interesting to see what kind of island creators come up with this new perspective, what kind of weapons will be compatible with this mode and other features. Hopefully, the implementation in creative mode will pave the way for the first-person to arrive in the standard battle royale mode, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite has confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/original-fortnite-map-returning-permanently-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the original map of the game will be returning permanently</a> from December 6, so players can enjoy Season 1 Chapter 1 whenever they wish. Also, Fortnite’s latest update is set to introduce new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-kicks-cosmetic-nike-jordan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nike and Jordan ‘Kicks’ cosmetics to the game</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>TiMi Studio Group and Capcom have just announced Monster Hunter Outlanders for iOS and Android devices. It is an upcoming open-world survival game set in the Monster Hunter universe. The developers did not provide a release date in the new announcement trailer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the Monster Hunter Outlanders announcement trailer footage, players can explore a massive open world featuring different types of biomes, such as jungles, swamps, deserts, and more. You will see some familiar monsters from previous instalments and maybe some new ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Monster Hunter Outlanders announcement trailer also revealed different types of traversal mechanics players can use in this world. Regarding traversal tools, we see the player character use a glider to cover large distances, a grapple to move more freely in jungles and a catapult that launches them in the air. We also get to see the character climb rocky surfaces and swim in some water bodies, so you won’t just be running around in this massive world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000226.000084968.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/timi-studio-group-and-capcom-announce-monster-hunter-outlanders-for-ios-android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>), Monster Hunter Outlanders will be a free-to-play title but will include in-app purchases. Players can enter the game solo or bring up to four players in their party. During your journey, you will find different types of characters; they can be recruited as allies and are also playable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game will also introduce a crafting function that makes exploring this open world easier. Moreover, players can use weapons they have seen in the previous Monster Hunter titles, as the developers have optimised the battle system to make it “as enjoyable as possible” while “retaining the gameplay experience” from previous games”. &nbsp;</p>

<p>New leaks have surfaced online claiming that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will soon feature collaborations between Halo, DOOM, and Gears of War.</p>



<p><span>The new leaks have surfaced from several Call of Duty data miners, including&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/CODWarfareForum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@CODWarfareForum</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://x.com/Vondyispog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vondyispog</a> on X (formerly Twitter), who general</span>ly have had a good track record of data mining leaks. Such details were soon corroborated by leaker <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1856495650252411297" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shpeshal Nick</a>, who had apparently heard of such crossovers in January 2024.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve heard of such a collaboration, either. A couple of months ago, rumors circulated from data miners that a Call of Duty X Halo collaboration was intended for Modern Warfare 3, but it was pushed back for unknown reasons. </p>



<p>It is unclear when such collaborations will be available in Black Ops 6, but the recent update added data strings to the game, which could suggest that they’ll be added sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>In a recent report, it was claimed that Electronic Arts’ CEO, Andrew Wilson, is being considered for the role of CEO at Disney and could replace Bob Iger, who has been in the role (on and off) since 2005. In 2026, the figurehead’s contract will expire and Disney is looking for a suitable replacement – and Andrew Wilson is leading the pack.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-from-ea-to-disney">From EA To Disney</h2>



<p>Per a report from the Wall Street Journal, the head honcho at Electronic Arts is being sized up for the CEO position at Disney. It was claimed that several people are being considered for the role:</p>



<ul>
<li>Andrew Wilson, CEO at EA</li>



<li>Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN Chairman</li>



<li>Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, Disney Entertainment co-chairs</li>



<li>Josh D’Amaro, Disney Experiences Chairman</li>
</ul>



<p>Andrew Wilson has been climbing the ranks at Electronic Arts for almost a quarter of a century, having joined way back in 2000. He has been the CEO of the firm since 2013, through many of the company’s highest highs and lowest lows.</p>



<p>In recent years, Disney has been making bold pushes into the world of gaming. In February, the company bought <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/disney-buys-1-5-billion-stake-in-epic-games-will-create-expansive-universe-within-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games</a>, and a couple of years ago, the firm stressed that it wanted <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-every-6-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Star Wars game</a> on the market every six months. </p>



<p>In 2023, Bob Iger was advised to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2023/10/11/disney-execs-want-to-buy-ea-and-become-a-gaming-giant-19645298/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">invest heavily in gaming</a> and acquire a leading publisher or development office, and Electronic Arts was at the front of that discussion. For a while, there was a goal for Disney to become ‘a gaming giant’, but Iger wasn’t agreeable to the mission.</p>



<p>With Andrew Wilson at the helm, could we see Disney become an indomitable gaming powerhouse?</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 is one of the best-selling games ever made, and over the last decade, it has built an indelible impression on the gaming world. More than ten years later, the game’s cast still represents the brand to no end, appearing on stream and in-person at events that celebrate the franchise and the success of GTA 5.</p>



<p>Recently, Shawn Fonteno, the actor behind Franklin Clinton, one of GTA 5’s lead characters, appeared on-stream with Kai Cenat, and he divulged a few home truths about the development of Grand Theft Auto 5. In one segment, the actor revealed that he was inches away from quitting the role mid-production.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-was-facing-two-cases">‘I Was Facing Two Cases’</h2>



<p>On Kai Cenat’s recent stream, Shawn Fonteno revealed that his portrayal of Franklin Clinton in GTA 5 rang <strong>very </strong>close to home. Before he landed the role with Rockstar Games, he was gangbanging, had been shot several times, and was facing ‘serious time’ before Rockstar scooped him up and offered him the job as Franklin Clinton.</p>



<p>It wasn’t all smooth sailing though.</p>



<p>Fonteno revealed that early on in the game’s development, he tried to storm out of the production as nobody knew they were working on Grand Theft Auto. At one point, the game’s director had to pull him aside and instruct him to trust the process – but <a href="https://x.com/StreamersEra/status/1856511627404681461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it almost went a different way entirely</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They fought with me. I quit. I said, ‘I don’t want to do this shit, take this shit off of me’. They sat me down and the director said, ‘Just trust me’. They didn’t tell us it was Grand Theft Auto 5, they told us it was another game when we went there called Paradise, because they’re secretive.</p>



<p>We didn’t know we were working on GTA 5 until a whole year later.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He revealed that his character’s name, to maintain the cover, was ‘DaShawn.’</p>



<p>As the stream with Kai Cenat unravelled, <a href="https://x.com/scubaryan_/status/1856496398583099841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shawn Fonteno called his cousin</a>, Young Maylay, the voice of San Andreas’ Carl Johnson, and requested he do some of his most iconic lines. It was a peak point for GTA fans, as Maylay is notoriously averse to interviews and performing anything related to San Andreas as he feels that over the last 20 years, the game has been covered to death.</p>

<p>After its release back in 2017, Free Fire has still kept its stance as one of the biggest mobile Battle Royale games out there. The game also has a unique and big ranking system. Here are all the ranks in Free Fire.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-free-fire-ranks">All Free Fire Ranks</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the ranks in Free Fire:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong></li>



<li><strong>Heroic</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Grandmaster</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Bronze through Diamond ranks consist of tiers, which are listed below.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze </strong>(I, II, III)</li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong> (I, II, III)</li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong> (I, II, III, and IV)</li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong> (I, II, III, and IV)</li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong> (I, II, III, and IV)</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s final rank, Grandmaster, is only given to the top 300 on the leaderboard. This means that anyone who falls behind this number will lose the rank.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-earn-ranked-points-in-free-fire">How to Earn Ranked Points in Free Fire</h2>



<p>Free Fire uses Ranked Points to progress through the ranks in the game. To earn these points, players must play the Battle Royale’s Ranked mode and get kills and placement points.</p>



<p>Like every other Battle Royale game, trying to be the last one standing is the goal during each game. The longer you last in the game, the more Ranked Points you achieve. </p>



<p>Free Fire also has an additional mode called Clash Squad, which is a 4v4 game mode. When playing Clash Squad, players have to win four out of seven matches. The game’s Ranked mode is completely different from the regular Battle Royale, as players gain Stars instead of climbing ranks.</p>



<p>Both modes are unique in their own ways, but the regular Free Fire Battle Royale has the more traditional ranking system.</p>



<p>Will you be trying to hit Grandmaster in Free Fire?</p>

<p>With PUBG holding its ground within the realm of Battle Royales, many players have been choosing to explore the Ranked system within the game. Here is a list of all the PUBG: Battlegrounds ranks and how you can hit the final rank, Master.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-pubg-battlegrounds-ranks">All PUBG: Battlegrounds Ranks</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all PUBG ranks:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Each rank is split into five tiers, starting with V and ending with I. However, each season marks a new rank for players, meaning everyone starts out as Unranked.</p>



<p>PUBG ranks differ from PUBG Mobile, however, as the mobile Battle Royale has extra ranks and a bit different point system.</p>



<p>So, how do players rank up in PUBG?</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-in-pubg-and-hit-master">How to Rank Up in PUBG and Hit Master</h2>



<p>The goal of all competitive PUBG players is to hit Master, the final rank in the game. To complete this challenge, however, players will have to spend quite a bit of time in the game. </p>



<p>To rank up in PUBG, players will have to place in Ranked matches. Placement points and kills are the two best ways to climb the ladder when playing the Battle Royale, so attempting to get first in each match is the best way to move up in the ranks.</p>



<p>There is also a rank higher than Master called Grandmaster, which is given to the top 500 players on the Ranked leaderboard.</p>



<p>PUBG’s Ranked system also has Ranked Decay, which is a feature that slowly deteriorates one’s rank if they begin to not play the game. Rank Decay starts taking action after seven days of someone not playing Ranked.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-points-needed-for-each-rank">Points Needed for Each Rank</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the points needed to progress through the ranks in PUBG:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze:</strong> 0 – 1500</li>



<li><strong>Silver:</strong> 1500 – 1900</li>



<li><strong>Gold:</strong> 2000 – 2500</li>



<li><strong>Platinum:</strong> 2500 – 2999</li>



<li><strong>Diamond:</strong> 3000 – 3499</li>



<li><strong>Master:</strong> 3500+</li>
</ul>



<p>Will you be trying to hit Master in PUBG? </p>
