<p>Use these Roblox Drift 36 monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free cash and other rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Drift 36 is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-grow-a-garden-film-adaptation-story-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that drops players into the middle of a high-octane drifting and car racing circuit. Players are required to buy their first car upon launch, and from there, progress through the game to get the best automobiles available. With Roblox versions of highly sought-after vehicular brands like Porsche, Lamborghini and Koenigsegg on offer, car enthusiasts will have a fantastic time playing Drift 36.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having been released in the early months of 2025, Drift 36 has gradually gained traction over the course of the year and now boasts a fairly dedicated player base. Although simply participating in the various events the game offers is enough for players to keep upgrading their cars, using redeem codes to get some extra cash is never a bad idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ARC Raiders’ latest update brings the Duo Matchmaking table along with adjusted cosmetic prices and a free Raider Deck. </p>



<p>Embark Studios’ latest extraction shooter, ARC Raiders, has blown the competition out of the water, with the game hitting a concurrent peak of over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-reveals-arc-raiders-player-count-steam-majority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">700,000 players across all platforms</a>. As the game continues to break records, the developers have released a new update that adds a much-requested feature to the title, along with some additional changes. </p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-duo-matchmaking-was-being-silently-tested-since-the-beginning-of-this-week">ARC Raiders Duo Matchmaking Was Being Silently Tested Since the Beginning of this Week</h2>



<p>According to a new <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, ARC Raiders’ duo prioritised matchmaking has been silently tested since earlier this week. The developers first prioritise solo and squads to play separately. Post that, duos are prioritised to play with other duos, and the same applies to trios. The developers have also cautioned players that “this is not a 100% guaranteed system”, which means that they “may at times run into differing constellations of players other than your own.” </p>



<p>Along with the duo matchmaking for ARC Raiders, the developers are also making adjustments to store cosmetic prices based on feedback. They have reviewed the prices and “made adjustments to lower prices where applicable”. The new prices will be reflected from Thursday, November 13, at 10:30 CET. Moreover, Raiders who have already purchased at the old pricing will receive compensation for the difference, and their Raider Tokens will be refunded to their account within the coming week. </p>



<p>Lastly, one free Raider Deck is available to all players, and in the future, both free and premium decks will be offered. Players should note that gameplay items will be reserved for free decks as they help new raiders along the way and can be unlocked through progressions. Moreover, there will be no pay-to-win items in premium decks, and they will be based on cosmetics and convenience. </p>



<p>In other news, Embark Studios has defended ARC Raiders’ AI voices by saying ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-nexon-ceo-defends-ai-voices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every game company</a>‘ does it. Additionally, this game is the perfect extraction shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-perfect-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for gamers new to the genre</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A fresh duo of characters have arrived in Marvel Rivals, with Gambit the first to join the fray at the start of Season 5, and we’ve got all the details on who the voice actor is.</p>



<p>Season 5 in Marvel Rivals kicks off on November 14, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-trailer-officially-reveals-rogue-and-gambit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gambit and Rogue joining as playable characters</a> this season, and the trend of boasting an impressive voice cast in the game continues.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for all the details on who the voice actor of Gambit is in Marvel Rivals, or are wondering where you recognize the voice from, we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-voicing-gambit-in-marvel-rivals">Who is Voicing Gambit in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Familiar sound. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The voice actor for Gambit in Marvel Rivals is AJ Locascio, a familiar name for fans of the X-Men character.</strong></p>



<p>Locascio also voices Gambit in X-Men ’97 on Disney+, which continues the story set out in the animated series from the 1990s. However, he was not the voice actor for Gambit in the original series; that role was performed by Chris Potter.</p>



<p>Though X-Men ’97 was the first time Locascio filled the role of Remy LeBeau, he more than made it his own with a stellar performance of the fan-favorite character.</p>



<p>That made him a natural choice to fit the role of Gambit in Marvel Rivals and joins a host of other names who have portrayed a character elsewhere before reviving the role in Marvel Rivals, alongside the likes of Yuri Lewanthal, Laura Bailey, Nolan North, and Troy Baker.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-other-roles-does-aj-locascio-have">What Other Roles Does AJ Locascio Have?</h2>



<p><strong>AJ Locascio boasts a host of recognizable roles throughout his career, including the role of Marty McFly in Back to The Future: The Game, and Skjolder in God of War Ragnarok.</strong></p>



<p>Locascio’s career has also seen him play the role of Owen Grady in the Jurassic World: Evolution franchise, Han Solo in LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, and Jorund in Horizon Forbidden West.</p>



<p>He has also featured in other LEGO Star Wars animated titles, Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers, Doom Eternal, Voltron: Legendary Defender, and Dawn of the Croods.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>SEGA has announced an increase of 10% in the average monthly salary of all employees from April 2026, following significant wage increases in 2023.</p>



<p>The sweep of changes will come into effect from April 1, 2026, providing major boosts to existing employees and future additions to the company with a rise in base salary.</p>







<h2 id="h-sega-boosts-salaries-once-again">SEGA Boosts Salaries Once Again</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds is one of SEGA’s big releases this year. Image by Sega</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/release/251112_1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release in Japan</a>, SEGA announced a decision to “revise the salary levels of full-time employees” and a raise to the starting salary of new employees, “with the aim of creating an environment in which employees can work with peace of mind amid recent social changes such as rising prices.”</p>



<p>SEGA also outlined an intention of “recruiting and developing attractive human resources to strengthen its global competitiveness.”</p>



<p>As a result of the changes, which come into effect next year, the base salary of employees of SEGA in Japan will rise “by an average of approximately 10%.” In addition, the starting salary for university graduates will increase by 10% from 300,000 yen to 330,000 yen—an increase of around $193.</p>



<p>Alongside the wage structure rises, SEGA is also planning to establish “a compensation system that rewards employees according to their roles and contributions,” as well as expanding measures “that support working styles that allow each employee to live the life that suits them best.”</p>



<p>This includes the ‘Fami+ System’, which supports childcare and nursing care, and the ‘Job+ System’, which supports side jobs aimed at creating new innovations.</p>



<p>The boost in salary comes three years after a huge increase in 2023, which saw a rise of around 30% to base salaries at the company.</p>
