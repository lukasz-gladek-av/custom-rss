<p>We’re midway through another week and grinding hard for that weekend. Today? We start as we always do, with an NYT Connections puzzle. If you’ve just woken up or are halfway through your day and hitting today’s challenge, be sure to scroll down and check out today’s NYT Connections hints and answers.</p>



<p>I’ve got the best NYT Connections solutions you’re looking for today.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

<p>The Highguard website is experiencing issues and is currently unavailable. </p>



<p>Wildlight Entertainment’s latest shooter, Highguard, has not been experiencing the smoothest launch, with player counts dwindling as the days go by. The developers recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-has-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mass layoffs</a>, with “most of the team” affected. Now the website has been affected as well. </p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-website-unavailable">Highguard Website Unavailable </h2>



<p>At the time of writing, if you head over to the Highguard <a href="https://playhighguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/2023814755904090520" rel="nofollow">Wario64</a> on Twitter), you will see that the site is down and has been for some time. The error pop-up states “SITE UNAVAILABLE. This site is currently unavailable. Please contact <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5e2d2b2e2e312c2a1e3d313a3b2a36372c2a272a2931703d3133">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> for assistance.” No other information was revealed, and the developers have not provided any clarity yet. </p>



<p>Highguard developers recently released a big update for the title, in the hopes of bringing more players to the game. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-episode-2-adds-ranked-mode-new-heroes-and-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Episode 2 </a>features new heroes, a ranked 3v3 competitive playlist where players can climb through 7 ranks, a new map, and additional quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes. However, this addition has not helped bring up the concurrent numbers.</p>



<p>Several factors could have led to Highguard’s failure, including the Game Awards 2025 finale moment, the social media blackout, and more. Interested readers can check out a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-failed-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full guide</a> on it here. </p>







<p>In other news, a tech artist who worked on Highguard has reflected on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/laid-off-highguard-tech-artist-reflects-on-games-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the highs and lows of the game’s development and launch</a>.

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-game-length/</link>
            <guid>1438483</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil Requiem’s game length could stop you from buying the game—don’t lie, it’s because you’re too scared. If you are legitimately concerned about how long Capcom’s latest entry is, this guide should provide clarity.</p>



<p>Previous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil/" id="259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> games have always had a decent length to them, with some being way longer than others. The RE speedruns are legendary, with players mopping up the main story in one brief sitting. If this is putting you off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, let’s take a look at what you can expect.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-resident-evil-requiem">How Many Hours To Beat Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Say Grace. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There have been conflicting reports about Resident Evil Requiem’s game length, but based on sources, you should expect around 10-16 hours of main-game content, with completionist save files expected to clock in around 30-40 hours.</strong></p>



<p>Reports have been circling about the game’s length, but truth be told, no one has an <em>exact </em>bearing on Requiem’s game length yet.</p>



<p>Three voices have managed to give a ballpark region for the game’s runtime: The director, the producer, and long-time leaker Dusk Golem.</p>



<p>Initially, it was suggested by the game’s producer that Requiem would be comparable to Resident Evil 4 in terms of game length. Everyone’s mileage varies, but the fourth main game is up there with one of the longest runtimes for main content. It’s amazing how much extra time is added for having crazy chainsaw people cut Leon’s head off.</p>

</ul>



<p>This gave everyone hope that Resident Evil 9 would also be a meaty adventure. Since then, the game’s director has come out and said the horror title’s length is hard to gauge. Finally, Dusk Golem—who provided details on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-review-embargo-date/" id="177337" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem’s review embargo date</a>—gave information on what they knew:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve heard myself it’s longer than Village, but a bit shorter than RE:4.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Village’s game length (particularly for a first-time playthrough) is around the 10-hour mark. So, even if Requiem finds a healthy middle ground, the first playthrough should be around 12-14 hours, with a wider margin of 10-16 hours capturing everything—not too shabby.</p>



<p>Obviously, the details are more hit and miss than the original Resident Evil’s dialogue. The expected game length mark shouldn’t be too far short if it is.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(2/3)-The producer claims the game is "roughly" the length of RE:4, though the director stepped in to say that estimating game time is hard, so to just expect a "Resident Evil" amount of content.<br>-Separately, I've heard myself it's longer than Village, but a bit shorter than RE:4</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2020691307052859637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<h2 id="h-how-does-resident-evil-9-compare-to-other-resident-evil-games">How Does Resident Evil 9 Compare To Other Resident Evil Games?</h2>



<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem’s game length sounds like it’s more in keeping with recent Resident Evil games, rather than the earlier entries, which were very short in comparison.</strong></p>



<p>You get indie horror games nowadays that are longer than the original Resident Evil trilogy entries! Resi 4 really advanced the series and gave players a long and winding adventure. It’s been fairly consistent ever since.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HowLongToBeat</a> (which aggregates playthrough from hundreds and thousands of players), here’s the average playtime for every mainline Resident Evil game—and we’re using the remakes where applicable.</p>

<p>WWE 2K26 is bringing plenty of changes to the popular Universe Mode.</p>



<p>The latest <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/universe-and-community-creations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report</a> feature on WWE 2K26 showcased the wide variety of changes coming to Universe Mode. The name of the game is control in WWE 2K26, and this year’s Universe Mode provides even more options for players to meticulously manipulate the in-game sandbox while also allowing for set-it-and-forget-it options for those who just want to kick back and watch a simulated Universe.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-re-a-wizard-wwe">You’re a Wizard, WWE</h2>



<p>This year’s WWE Universe Mode features a new Universe Wizard that lets players choose which weekly shows and PLEs to feature, assign Superstars to each show and their champions, and set the calendar start month. Players can choose an existing show, such as WWE Monday Night Raw. However, they can also either import a show they downloaded or start from scratch with a brand-new creation.</p>



<p>Players can edit details for default shows like Raw and SmackDown, including rosters, championships, and divisions. Each show supports up to eight titles across men’s and women’s divisions, including tag team and intergender titles, plus two Money in the Bank briefcases.</p>

<h2 id="h-more-customization-options-in-universe-mode-for-wwe-2k26">More Customization Options in Universe Mode for WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>WWE 2K26 expands Universe mode with new match setup options, including enhanced settings and sliders. Players can now adjust matchmaking sliders to fine-tune match card sorting, scoring, and bonuses for title matches, rivalries, and match types. </p>



<p>For those who want to start from scratch, there are settings to remove all default rivalry options and start with a blank canvas.</p>











<p>Promo options are also updated. This year, players have even more control over the outcome of Universe Mode promos. When challenging a rival to a match, the challenger can now directly select the match stipulations. Players can take the direction of their promos in new avenues, including babyface and heel turns.</p>



<p>There are also customization options for wrestlers’ attire for weekly shows, pay-per-view events, and WrestleMania. Once again, allowing even more customization options.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-bigfoot-coming-soon/</link>
            <guid>1438453</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda/" id="419">Bethesda Game Studios</a> has unveiled the next <strong>cryptid </strong>coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout-76/" id="438">Fallout 76</a>, and it’s none other than the infamous <strong>Bigfoot</strong>. The mythical manbeast will find his way into Appalachia and the world of Fallout 76 from March 3rd, with the arrival of the Backwoods update and an all-new season.</p>



<p>The Fallout 76 cryptid range has expanded over the years to accommodate the likes of the Wendigo, the Grafton Monster, and, of course, Mothman.</p>











<p>In a very short teaser trailer posted on social media, Bethesda Game Studios shared a found footage perspective of someone filming the elusive Bigfoot. The shady, conspiracy-laden character has appeared in all kinds of media, usually as an easter egg in games, but now, he’s coming to Fallout 76, and he’s going to be very real.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Backwoods update is the next major patch to hit Fallout 76, and from what we know, it looks like it’s going to be themed around the great outdoors, hunting, and spotting Bigfoot. The creature will most likely form a new mini-boss character, much like the Sheepsquatch, one of the game’s more ferocious and terrifying cryptids.</p>



<p>Fallout 76 remains immensely popular following the conclusion of the second season of the Fallout television show. Bethesda Game Studios has big things in store for the post-apocalyptic MMORPG, and in the next bout of updates, it will focus on making the base offering much more attractive.</p>
