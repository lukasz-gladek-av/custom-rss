<p>Amazon’s Mass Effect series won’t be an adaptation of the original Commander Shepherd trilogy, confirms BioWare and EA. Even more so, it’ll be an original story set after Mass Effect 3.</p>



<p>The Mass Effect series has rightly become the premier narrative-driven game and a must-play for any gamer. Despite an okay third entry, the first two games are some of the best RPGs on the market, even after almost two decades. The last entry in the series, Mass Effect Andromeda, didn’t meet fan expectations, so any new project is welcome. Last year, Amazon announced that it would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mass-effect-tv-series-officially-in-development-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be making a Mass Effect TV series</a> for Prime Video. Now, we know a bit more about the direction they are going, and it’s an interesting one.</p>



<h2 id="h-mass-effect-tv-show-set-after-the-original-trilogy">Mass Effect TV Show Set After The Original Trilogy</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As part of N7 Day, celebrating the USS Normandy in the game, <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new blog was posted</a> on the official Mass Effect site. Series executive producer Mike Gamble spoke at length about the future of the series. While no updates on the new Mass Effect were shared outside of that it’s in production, the Amazon show was talked about. In the piece, he states,</p>



<p>“<strong>The writers room is going strong, and we’ve got a lot figured out about how it fits within the Mass Effect canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game</strong>,” Gamble says in the blog. “<strong>The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe’s timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won’t be a retread of Commander Shepard’s story – because after all … that’s YOUR story, isn’t it?</strong>”</p>



<p>As Gamble said, the show is <strong>now in the writing stage</strong> and will, surprisingly, <strong>not adapt the original trilogy</strong>. This means that, more than likely, Commander Shepard and the Normandy crew will not be in attendance. However, despite being an original story, it will take place <strong>after the events of Mass Effect 3</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As to what ending may be canon is unknown, but it’ll be interesting to see how it goes. Mass Effect is a space opera, so it does translate well into a show akin to Battlestar Galactica and Star Trek. As a fan, I’m excited to see what’s in store, especially since it’ll be a brand new adventure.</p>

<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana sees it battle alongside the Civilization games for city-building supremacy, and if you’re wondering what review scores Anno 117: Pax Romana will get, you should note the potential review embargo date down in your diary.</p>



<p>The Anno series is usually revered for its more complex approach to the act of building cities and empires. Its real-time mechanics force you to think and act accordingly. Dawdling can be devastating for your prospects, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-gameplay-of-image-of-anno-117-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> asks you to think faster and more fervently than ever!</p>



<p>If you’re desperate to see if Anno 117 has captured the beauty and the boldness of the Roman Empire, then read on for review embargo details.</p>

<p><strong>It’s not official, but one main source has claimed that the Anno 117: Pax Romana review embargo date is November 10.</strong></p>



<p>Whereas many games are leaving it until the last minute for review dates—even as late as the day before or the day of—Anno 117: Pax Romana’s is reportedly three days beforehand.</p>



<p>The possible date comes from X user <a href="https://x.com/compusemble" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Compusemble</a>, who deals exclusively with “PC gaming and PC tech.” A quick browse through their profile shows they’ve partnered with companies before to test out games.</p>



<p>On October 10, they gave “Thanks to EA for the game code” to test out the specs and performance for Battlefield 6. </p>



<p>A November 5 message said this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I will be playing Anno 117: Pax Romana early thanks to Ubisoft. Will be testing the game on the 5090 and 4060. <strong>Embargo date is November 10</strong>. #ubisoftpartner”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A time isn’t specified, but if you are looking and waiting for Anno 117: Pax Romana reviews, you have a date. If this changes, or the date comes and goes and there are no reviews, we’ll update this article in a heartbeat.</p>

<h2 id="h-previous-anno-reviews-scores">Previous Anno Reviews Scores</h2>
