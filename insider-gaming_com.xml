The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/savvy-games-group-acquire-mobile-legends-moonton/</link>
            <guid>1436107</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ByteDance, the parent company of the sensational (and at times, controversial) social video app, TikTok, is preparing to make one hell of a transaction. In recent reports, it was claimed that the final stages of selling <strong>Moonton </strong>to Saudi Arabia’s Savvy Games Group were closing in.</p>



<p>The deal, worth as much as <strong>$7</strong> <strong>billion,</strong> would see Savvy acquire one of the biggest mobile games in the business, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. It’s a billion-dollar game with almost 110 million monthly users, and by viewership, it’s the number one mobile esports game ever made.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-savvy-games-group-buying-moonton">Is Savvy Games Group Buying Moonton?</h2>



<p>Per a recent report <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bytedance-talks-sell-gaming-unit-moonton-more-than-6-billion-sources-say-2026-02-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Reuters</a>, ByteDance is preparing to sell <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/moonton/" id="2766">Moonton</a> for something between $6 billion and $7 billion, and the buyer is none other than Savvy Games Group. Moonton, which is based in Shanghai, is responsible for the creation of Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, a free-to-play MOBA that has been around for almost a decade.</p>



<p>The report, published on February 13th by Reuters, suggests that the deal would contribute to ByteDance’s <strong>major retreat</strong> from the gaming space. It was back in 2021 that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tiktok/" id="1219">ByteDance</a> acquired Moonton, paying around $4 billion.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mobile-legends/" id="1640">Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</a> is said to have around 110 million monthly active users and, in the last decade, has racked up 1.5 billion unique installations. It’s one of the highest-earning mobile games ever made, and it’s the bedrock of a mobile esports ecosystem that draws in tens of millions of viewers a year.</p>



<p>With Saudi Arabia getting deeper into both the gaming and esports industries, the deal makes perfect sense, especially with the recent growth of the mobile esports space.</p>



<p>Do you see Savvy parting ways with $7 billion to secure Moonton? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>YAPYAP sold half 1 million games in its first week on the market.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/yapyap/" id="3501">YAPYAP,</a> a co-op horror game where players use microphones to cast magic spells and wreak havoc in enemy wizards’ towers, was released on Steam in early February 2026. Within a week of its release, the game had sold 500,000 copies. This is despite the game still smoothing out some rough edges.</p>



<h2 id="h-maison-bap-reacts-to-yapyap-s-major-milestone">Maison Bap Reacts to YAPYAP’s Major Milestone</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/maison-bap/" id="3502">Maison Bap</a>, the game’s publisher and developer, shared a message of gratitude upon reaching the milestone. They noted that over the coming weeks, they will continue to fix bugs and polish the game. They will then focus on additional content once all edges are smoothed.</p>



<p>“We also know many of you are eager to hear about future updates, but before jumping into new features and content, we want to make sure the game is fully stable and smooth for everyone. Once that’s locked in, we’ll start planning the fun stuff,” the team said in a message that was shared on Steam on February 9.</p>



<p>The game is still on a small introductory discount. It is currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3834090/YAPYAP/">Steam for $7.99.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega </a>says <span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/sonic-rumble/" target="_blank">Sonic Rumble</a>&nbsp;underperformed and that, overall, the value of the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/angry-birds/" target="_blank">Angry Birds</a>&nbsp;developer&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/rovio-entertainment/" target="_blank">Rovio&nbsp;</a>was written down, resulting in an impairment loss of more than</span> $200 million.</p>



<p>Sega Sammy Holdings Inc., Sega’s parent company, recently <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_q3_presentation_e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported its Q3 earnings</a> for fiscal year 2026. Noted in the earnings that, as it pertained to Rovio’s business, there was a recognized impairment loss of approximately 31.3 billion yen. As of this writing, that amounts to about $205 million.</p>



<p>Sega completed<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/angry-birds-acquisition/" id="6935"> its acquisition of Rovio</a> in August 2023.</p>







<h2 id="h-factors-surrounding-rovio-s-underperforming-quarter">Factors Surrounding Rovio’s Underperforming Quarter</h2>



<p>In the Q3 presentation, Sega attributes Rovio’s performance falling short of initial expectations to “rapid changes in the market environment and other factors.” One of those factors was the collaborative mobile title Sonic Rumble, which struggled to meet key performance indicators.</p>



<p>Moving forward, Sega plans to reverse this momentum by focusing specifically on Angry Birds and Sega IPs, including Sonic, for future games. They also see the release of the third Angry Birds movie, set for December, as another factor driving hopeful increased traction for the brand.</p>







<h2>The Future of Sonic</h2>



<p>Sonic Rumble, which is also available for free on Steam, may have underperformed, but the blue blur always bounces back. It’s Sonic’s 35th anniversary this year. So far, no official game releases have been scheduled in celebration, but the Sonic Team has put out a new audio drama in the Sonic universe. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-unveils-noir-sonic-audio-drama-the-chaotix-casefiles/" id="171225">here</a>.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the filings, Sega announced plans to make mainstay IPs a focus not just in mobile releases but also in traditional console releases. Read more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-plans-four-major-mainstay-ip-releases-in-next-fiscal-year/" id="176620">here</a>.</p>
