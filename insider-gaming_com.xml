<p>It’s time to be directed by Xbox once again. The fourth annual Xbox Developer Direct is here for 2026, and with Microsoft celebrating the 25th anniversary of Xbox, it’s certain to be a big show to kick off the year. </p>



<p>Xbox Developer Direct 2026 starts at 1pm ET/6pm GMT and airs on all official Xbox channels. This year’s event has three games advertised so far. </p>







<p>Players will get their first look at gameplay for Forza Horizon 6, a deeper dive into Fable, and new details for Game Freak’s—yes, <em>that </em>Game Freak—Beast of Reincarnation. There are also rumors of a surprise game or two making the rounds, but fans will just have to tune in and see if those turn out to be true. </p>



<p>To stop you from having to go elsewhere, though, you can watch it, in full, in the video below. And don’t forget to leave your thoughts on everything down in the comments and join the discussion with other games in the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 was the best-selling game of 2025 in the United States. The news was broken on January 22 by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczdusovdk2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana’s Mat Piscatella</a>. </p>







<p>DICE’s latest shooter might have slipped from the top spot back in November, but it managed to top the yearly charts instead. That means that in just under three months, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> had outsold every other title on the list.</p>



<p>NBA 2K26 remained firm at second place, whilst Borderlands 4 and Monster Hunter: Wilds switched positions to third and fourth respectively. Rounding out the top five was Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </p>



<p>Sports titles remain ever-popular in the US, with Madden NFL 26, EA Sports College Football 26, <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports FC 26</a>, MLB: The Show 25 and WWE 2K25 all featuring in the top 20. Interestingly, some titles on the list weren’t even released in 2025, with the likes of Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto 5 proving to remain top-sellers. </p>
