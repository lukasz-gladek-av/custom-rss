            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-9-new-gamemodes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/9-new-gamemodes-are-in-development-for-battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-post-launch-content.1348564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has found that at least 9 new gamemodes for Battlefield 6 are at various stages of development for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-amazon-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>‘s post-launch content.</p>



<p>Last month, we revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-more-game-modes-could-be-coming-to-battlefield-6-datamine-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six game modes were in development for Battlefield 6</a>; since the release of the game’s first season, more have been added to the game’s files. Two of the gamemodes that we previously reported on, Sabotage and Strikepoint have already been confirmed to be coming to the game, which leaves Raid, Payload, Squad Shootout, and Tank Hunt remaining for the original six.</p>



<h2 id="h-five-new-battlefield-6-gamemodes">Five New Battlefield 6 Gamemodes</h2>



<p>Yet, within the game files, Insider Gaming has also discovered five new gamemodes which are labelled at ‘Prototypes’ and are seemingly very early in development.</p>



<p>These gamemodes are: Convoy, Fantastic Four, Gunmaster, Touchdown, and Tug of War. The strings of the files are as follows:</p>



<p>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/zPrototypes/Convoy/Setup/MUT_Convoy Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/zPrototypes/FantasticFour/Setup/MUT_FantasticFour Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/zPrototypes/Gunmaster/Setup/MUT_GunMaster Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/zPrototypes/Touchdown/Presentation/GM_Touchdown_Presentation Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/zPrototypes/TugOfWar/Mode/MUT_TugOfWar</p>



<p>As mentioned in Insider Gaming’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-naval-combat-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous coverage on Naval Combat</a>, “Glacier” is the codename for Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>While some of these gamemodes may just be internal codenames, Gunmaster in particular is almost certainly a ‘Gun Game’ like gamemode where the players’ weapons change per kill. Traditionally, the player has to cycle through 20 different weapons and needs to knife and kill an enemy for the final kill in order to be victorious. </p>



<p>Tug of War likely refers to a Breakthrough-esuq gamemode, possible where players need to capture flags to progress through the map. If a flag is captured, the next flag will push the enemy team back, but can be retaken to continue the “tug of war” for victory.</p>



<p>As for what the other gamemodes could be is anyone’s guess, and we’d love to hear what you think they could be on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Where Are The Bosses in Fortnite x The Simpsons? How to Find Boss Locations, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-boss-locations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-are-the-bosses-in-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-how-to-find-boss-locations-explained.1348540/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite bosses are a feature that players have become well-versed with other the years, though The Simpsons mini-season shakes things up and makes them harder to locate.</p>



<p>The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite made a big change to bosses, which don’t have fixed spawn locations and only appear on your map when you are near them, making it harder to track them down when completing quests or on the hunt for loot.</p>



<p>For all the details on how to track down each of the bosses available in Fortnite during The Simpsons mini-season, check out our guide.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-witch-marge-in-fortnite-x-the-simpsons">How to Find Witch Marge in Fortnite x The Simpsons</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Haunting. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Witch Marge spawns randomly during The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite, though she is most commonly found in the Springfield Town Center POI.</strong></p>



<p>In this area, Witch Marge can be encountered in the woods between Springfield Town Square and Kamp Krusty, though she can also appear in the POI itself, and these aren’t the only locations where she can be found.</p>



<p>You should also check out the area south of Evergreen Terrace and hunt in the Springfield Slurpworks POI, both of which are areas where Mitch Marge also spawns regularly.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-evil-homer-in-fortnite-x-the-simpsons">How to Find Evil Homer in Fortnite x The Simpsons</h2>



<p><strong>Evil Homer does not have a fixed spawn during The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite, but, like Witch Marge, is often found in the Springfield Town Square POI near </strong>the courthouse<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>However, it’s not guaranteed he will spawn there, and you should check out other areas too if you’re on the hunt for him. Personally, I’ve found the east of Evergreen Terrace by Springfield Gorge to be a location where Evil Homer is often lurking.</p>



<p>Finally, the fields around Cletus’ Corn Hole are a common haunting ground for Evil Homer, so you should check this area too.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-krusty-the-clown-in-fortnite-x-the-simpsons">How to Find Krusty the Clown in Fortnite x The Simpsons</h2>



<p><strong>Like other bosses in The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite, Krusty the Clown does not have a fixed spawn location. However, he can commonly be encountered at the Springfield Slurpworks.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for any boss to take down, Springfield Town Square is an ideal landing spot, as all three bosses can often be found here, but there are other areas to check for Krusty, too.</p>



<p>Like Evil Homer, Cletus’ Corn Hole is a good hunting spot for Krusty, along with the small island found east of Donut District—although this location is quite out of the way off the beaten track.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#883)—Clues and Answers for Monday, November 10]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-10-883/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-883-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-monday-november-10.1348438/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a whole new week, and that means we can kickstart the next seven days by smashing today’s NYT Connections puzzle. Today’s trickery isn’t too tough to contend with, but that doesn’t mean you don’t want to walk away with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions, courtesy of Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>Read on to get the full list of NYT Connections hints and solutions for today’s puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-10">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 10)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #883:</p>



<ul>
<li>SINE</li>



<li>CLEAR</li>



<li>PRO</li>



<li>SQUARE</li>



<li>SAW</li>



<li>AB</li>



<li>I</li>



<li>TRIANGLE</li>



<li>BELL</li>



<li>CAME</li>



<li>DRUM</li>



<li>PAY</li>



<li>SUB</li>



<li>SETTLE</li>



<li>RATTLE</li>



<li>CONQUERED</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em><em>Strike up the band!</em> These make noise when hit, shaken, or rattled.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Financial closure.</em> These words all signal that what’s owed is no longer owed.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em><em>A swift conquest.</em> These four words form a legendary declaration of victory.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em><em>Prepositions from the past.</em> These short words helped Romans express direction, cause, and relation.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 10.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-10-883">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 10 (#883)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BELL, DRUM, RATTLE, TRIANGLE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CLEAR, PAY, SETTLE, SQUARE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CAME, CONQUERED, I, SAW</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – AB, PRO, SINE, SUB</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is a stunning, post-apocalyptic extraction shooter with immense potential. It has become one of 2025’s most successful games and is, by numbers, the best-received extraction shooter ever made. In this guide, we’re looking at a portion of the game’s post-launch support model and determining when the next ARC Raiders season and Raider Deck are set to arrive.</p>



<p>If you’re waiting for more free rewards in ARC Raiders via the Raider Deck, read on to find out when it’s coming to the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-new-raider-deck-coming-to-arc-raiders">When is the New Raider Deck Coming to ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>The next Raider Deck will unlock in ARC Raiders in December alongside the Cold Snap update</strong>. This update is set to bring a new map condition called Snowfall, introduce a special event called Flickering Flames, close the Expedition window, <strong>and </strong>introduce new quests.</p>



<p>This supersized update will be free to download and enjoy, with Embark Studios delivering on the promise to support this game for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>If the Raider Deck is anything like the current Raider Deck, it’ll be something special for players to chase.</p>



<p>To level up through the Raider Deck, you need to complete Feats to unlock ‘blue’ credits, which can then be applied to the pages bursting with rewards in the Raider Deck tab on the main menu. You’ll need to unlock a certain amount on one page before unlocking the next page, but it takes no time at all, as Feats are constantly refreshing as you complete them.</p>



<p>In the Raider Deck, you’ll find everything from hairstyles to outfits, and from boxes full of loot to Raider Credits. There’s a lot to unlock, which is brilliant, considering you’re not paying a penny for what’s contained in the Raider Deck.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re hoping for in the next Raider Deck in ARC Raiders.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Peaks Again, 10 Days After Launch, and Beats Some Insanely Popular Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-peaks-10-days-later-beats-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-peaks-again-10-days-after-launch-and-beats-some-insanely-popular-games.1348426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite ARC Raiders having been on the market for more than <strong>ten days</strong>, the game is still surpassing expectations and climbing on certain platforms. Hours ago, the post-apocalyptic extraction shooter managed to secure a new record on Steam, climbing to a peak of 462,488 players, beating the previous high of 416,517.</p>



<p>The constantly climbing peak is indicative of the quality of this game. The smash hit from Embark Studios continues to turn heads worldwide, and millions of players are flooding the accessible, welcoming platform.</p>







<p>ARC Raiders isn’t your typical extraction shooter. For starters, it’s a third-person shooter with heavy social aspects, and it’s designed to ideally be treated as a PvE game in <strong>many ways</strong>. It has been soaring up the charts since dropping on October 30, and it shows absolutely no signs of slowing down.</p>



<p>Yesterday, the game hit a peak user count of 416,517 on Steam, but in recent hours, that peak has climbed further to 462,488 players. It’s bucking trends, but this multiplayer-only shooter is getting stronger over time, rather than the player count inevitably dying out.</p>



<p>In terms of the record books, ARC Raiders has now beaten Helldivers 2, Sons of the Forest, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, GTA 5, and Starfield. It’s on the cusp of topping Call of Duty, Fallout 4, and Terraria.</p>



<p>This is likely because ARC Raiders still isn’t completely understood by the wider gaming community, and as these users are having their eyes opened to the game’s potential, they’re finding their way into the game.</p>



<p>Embark Studios recently revealed a stunning roadmap for ARC Raiders that promises to keep the game stoked for the time being, but the team has suggested it wants to support ARC Raiders for <strong>a decade</strong>, which is almost unheard of in this business.</p>
