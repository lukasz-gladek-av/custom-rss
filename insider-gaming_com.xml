<p>In order to cut costs, you have to spend money. Unity revealed on Thursday that it had to spend $205 million as part of its restructuring efforts — which included mass layoffs — throughout 2024.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001810806/16c99346-58d4-4022-924d-7cfefa4f7054.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to the company</a>, the money was spent mostly on “incremental” separation costs for the employees being let go. This included $127 million worth of “incremental stock-based compensation”. </p>

<p>“Of the incremental employee separation costs, $15 million are within cost of revenue, $46 million are within research and development, $52 million are within sales and marketing, and $92 million are within general and administrative,” Unity said.</p>



<p>The company added that in they also had $45 million in restructuring costs related to office closures.</p>



<p>In January 2024, Unity announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-is-laying-off-25-of-its-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans to let go 25%</a> of its workforce. The decision was made to allow the company to “focus on our core business and drive our long-term success and profitability”, according to CEO Jim Whitehurst.</p>



<p>The layoffs and changes came after Unity announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-to-charge-game-devs-per-game-install/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial change</a> to its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-apologizes-again-announces-major-changes-to-runtime-fee-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">runtime fees</a>. A change that was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-is-cancelling-controversial-runtime-fee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimately reversed</a> after backlash.</p>



<p>As part of its earnings call, Unity revealed that it’ had $1.4 billion’s year-over-year revenue for the quarter fell to $446.5 million from $544.2. That’s despite operating expenses falling from $520.3 million to $461.6 million. Overall, the company reported a net loss  of $124.5 million for the third quarter.</p>

<p>During the QA Section of Bandai Namco’s latest earnings call, it was revealed that most of the sales for Dragon Ball Sparking Zero came from Europe and North America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-saw-outstanding-sales-and-bandai-namco-says-roughly-90-percent-of-that-was-from-european-and-north-american-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>, Bandai Namco <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/financialstatements/pdf/20241106_qa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that Dragon Ball Sparking Zero “has been a hit mainly overseas, with sales in Europe and the US accounting for about 90% of the game’s sales” (as translated by Google). The publishers changed their global marketing structure for Japan and North America at the start of this fiscal year. They formed different strategies for approach according to the region they were targeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bandai Namco explained that Sparking Zero’s marketing primarily focused on social media for most regions. However, for specific areas, they also hosted on-ground events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is a direct instalment to the iconic Budokai Tenkaichi series, which was dormant for over a decade. The developers have put real thought into the title’s gameplay, and combining that with its spectacular visuals and varying game modes; it has become a recipe for success.&nbsp;</p>

It also sold over 3 million copies within the first 24 hours. The overall popularity of the title has also <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/financialstatements/pdf/en_20241106_Presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">significantly impacted</a> their “Toys and Hobby” businesses, helping them beat “previous forecasts.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has stated that he is “not really worried” about GTA 6 running on the Xbox Series S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the latest Take-Two <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/06/take-two-interactive-software-ttwo-q2-2025-earning/?irclickid=wQIV77RNJxyKWsB3AWwmhXdXUkCTkgySWUGN2E0&amp;utm_campaign=mpid&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;irgwc=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a>, Zelnick was asked whether the team was concerned about GTA 6 facing problems on the Xbox Series S, as the title could potentially be one of the most advanced games to date. Zelnick replied that they would continue supporting platforms as long as consumers were on them. “Despite different levels of tech”, the team will “find a way to support platforms”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zelnick said he’s not worried about hardware advancements and doesn’t worry about things he has zero control over. He believes in the audience, and if the audience shows up for their properties, they “have to make sure to be on an array of platforms.” From the looks of it, GTA 6 should be fine on the Xbox Series S. </p>



<p>Zelnick also discussed PCs and how open formats will continue to grow. Take-Two believes the PC platform is “a more and more important part of the console business going forward,” which isn’t a problem to support. Zelnick concluded, “We make the tech work when we can make it work as long as the audience is big enough to make that worthwhile.” GTA 6 does not yet have a release window for PCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Take-Two has confirmed that GTA 6 and Borderlands 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-and-borderlands-4-will-not-release-close-to-each-other/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not release close to each other</a>. Also, Rockstar once thought ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-age-of-trump-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the age of Trump</a>’ would mess with GTA 6.

<p>New details have emerged on Nintendo’s lawsuit against PocketPair’s Palworld over alleged Pokémon Patent Infringement.</p>



<p>The news came from PocketPair earlier today, which revealed that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company is actively seeking 10 Million Yen (around $66,000 USD) in damages over alleged patent infringement.</p>



<p>According to Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, Palword developers PocketPair infringed on three different patents.</p>



<p><strong>Patent No. 7545191<br></strong>[Patent application date: July 30, 2024]<br>[Patent registration date: August 27, 2024]</p>



<p><strong>Patent No. 7493117<br></strong>[Patent application date: February 26, 2024]<br>[Patent registration date: May 22, 2024]</p>



<p><strong>Patent No. 7528390<br></strong>[Patent application date: March 5, 2024]<br>[Patent registration date: July 26, 2024]</p>



<p>The patent dates have caused some confusion online. Some question whether Nintendo can sue for patents that were applied for and registered after the release of Palworld, which was released on January 19, 2024. For those confused, Nintendo has done what’s called ‘Parent Patenting,’ essentially connecting the new patents to existing ones and making them valid.</p>



<p>PocketPair say that they “will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings” on the lawsuit. The claim states that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are requesting:</p>



<ul>
<li>Payment of 5 million yen plus late payment damages to The Pokémon Company</li>



<li>Payment of 5 million yen plus late payment damages to Nintendo Co., Ltd.</li>
</ul>
