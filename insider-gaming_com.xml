<p>It has only been a few weeks since Wuchang: Fallen Feathers was released, adding yet another Soulslike to the increasingly expansive array of titles in the niche. In that time, Wuchang has suffered, being plagued by stability issues at launch and facing the wrath of gamers in thousands of negative reviews.</p>



<p>In the latest debacle, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers’ 1.5 update has rendered fans furious as developer Leenzee ‘censors’ various aspects of the game, applies a nasty retcon, and skews some of the title’s more challenging sequences.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happened-with-wuchang-s-1-5-update">What Happened With Wuchang’s 1.5 Update?</h2>



<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers isn’t a terrible game, but it doesn’t do too much to differentiate itself from the slew of Soulslike games drowning out the industry these days. That’s <strong>one reason </strong>why it earned some negativity at launch, but the UE5-related performance issues (particularly on PC) didn’t help the situation.</p>



<p>Recently, Leenzee released the 1.5 patch for Wuchang, causing chaos and disappointing fans worldwide.</p>



<p>With a single line in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498329191821869869?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full 1.5 patch notes</a>, Leenzee made waves:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Added dialogs for some NPCs to complete some plots. We will further optimize the exhaustion animations in the future to improve the plot performance.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eagle-eyed Wuchang fans dove into the game after the 1.5 patch and discovered what that meant. Following the update, certain bosses can’t be killed and enter a state of ‘exhaustion’ after being defeated. Some have been reworked with new voice lines that alter the story, and other enemies in certain sequences (such as Ming Dynasty soldiers) won’t attack you at all.</p>



<p>This has caused one key chapter that was previously very difficult to become a breeze, further disappointing sadomasochistic Soulslike fans. </p>



<p>The situation was exacerbated by mods on the official Wuchang subreddit reportedly deleting posts complaining about the 1.5 patch. This has naturally caused the review stats for Wuchang to fall into the red once again.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, user Lance McDonald expressed concerns about <strong>why </strong>these changes were made:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>By the way, it isn’t the Chinese Government that forced these changes, WUCHANG is quite pro-government, it’s to please fringe groups of nationalists. I don’t really understand the details sadly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s relatively easy to predict that Wuchang: Fallen Feathers will start falling to the wayside now, and that this will forever be a mark on Leenzee’s reputation. This was the first outing for the studio, and it certainly isn’t how you’d want to make a name for yourself.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Introducing New Changes To Steam Store Pages]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Valve is getting set to launch new changes to store pages on Steam, improving the user experience in multiple ways.</p>



<p>First launching in Beta before being rolled out to the general public, Steam store pages will be expanded to up to 1200px wide, increasing the general viewer space. The main content column that users see when visiting a page will see it’s max width jump from 616px to 780px.</p>



<p><strong>“This improves the shopping experience in a number of ways, allowing for bigger screenshots and trailers, and allowing more room to describe your features in the written description area,”</strong> Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532106189043925406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in a post on its website</a>. <strong>“Of course the page will still scale down appropriately for smaller screens or smaller browser windows.”</strong></p>



<p>Speaking of the description area, Valve is also making changes there on Steam store pages. </p>



<p>While pages have supported .gif files for years, the company is expanding it to support .mp4 and .webm files. This will allow developers, Valve says, to better <strong>“show off your features, demonstrate specific game mechanics, or just add visual flavor to your store page.”</strong></p>



<p>These new file formats will have some restrictions such as being no more than 100MB in size and 12 seconds in length.</p>



<p><strong>“Don’t worry about specific compression or quality settings, as the Steamworks backend will transcode them into a good quality and light-weight video format that works well when displayed on desktop, Steam Deck, and in the Steam mobile app,”</strong> Valve says.</p>



<p>The updates to Steam store pages, Valve says, will only be in Beta for “a few weeks” if things go smooth. They want to give developers time to upload any new assets if wanted before making the change permanent and public for all users.</p>
