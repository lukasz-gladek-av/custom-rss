<p>In a post on social media, FuturLab’s CEO, Kirsty Rigden, revealed that the team is unable to support PowerWash Simulator VR going forward. This decision was made to support the job security of staff across the company, and instead of making layoffs, the team working on the VR version of the game has been ‘redeployed’ on other projects and roles.</p>



<p>This means that while the game remains available on storefronts, it will no longer receive any further updates, support, or DLC.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1878840388578169168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the post on Twitter</a> (X), Rigden wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am so sorry to let you know that we won’t be continuing support of PowerWash Simulator VR. We absolutely love and believe in VR, so this doesn’t mean that we won’t support it in the future but we aren’t able to continue with support right now.</p>



<p>We have been faced with a cross roads: we have a truly excellent and kind VR team who were working on a platform which costs us more than it makes, while also having a list of job opening that were looking to be filled on other projects.</p>



<p>We took the decision to redeploy our VR team into those other projects/roles. Whilst I would love to live in a world where we could support PowerWash Simulator on every platform going, I will always choose job security for my team.</p>



<p>While I know that you must be so disappointed, I also know that if you were in my position, you would have made the same decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’ve played a little PowerWash Simulator VR on the Meta Quest 3, and it’s a fantastic experience that’s possibly one of the most therapeutic things I’ve ever had the pleasure of enjoying. The base game was good enough, but VR enabled me to get up close with what I was cleaning – and it helped when it came to detecting those last spots of grime on unseen surfaces.</p>

<p>Sledgehammer Games, one of the key contributing studios at the heart of the Call of Duty franchise, has had a rocky time with the series over the last decade or so. The studio is best known for titles like Advanced Warfare, WWII, and Vanguard, which represents a real mixed bag of Call of Duty games.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, Sledgehammer’s Greg Reisdorf, who was with the firm for 15 years and rose to the role of Multiplayer Creative Director, revealed he has stepped down from the company.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-whatever-comes-next">Whatever Comes Next</h2>



<p>In the post on Twitter (X), Greg Reisdorf wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Friday was my last day at Sledgehammer Games after 15 years. I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunities and amazing developers I worked with.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then dove deep into the history of Sledgehammer Games, giving up various tidbits and treasures from his time at the company. He revealed he created the iconic sequence where Soap succumbs to his wounds in Modern Warfare 3 (2011). He also mentioned that Advanced Warfare ‘was a challenge – but we made it happen’.</p>



<p>Looking back, Reisdorf suggested that the ‘Pick 13’ loadout model ‘should not have happened’. That’s one of the most divisive topics in the Call of Duty community year on year.</p>



<p>Reisdorf also revealed that he was instrumental in revisiting the MW2 maps in Modern Warfare III (2023). It’s widely considered the worst Call of Duty game to emerge in recent years, but the fan service was nothing short of a treat, and Reisdorf was responsible for many of the easter eggs and smaller details or ‘nods’ for true COD fans.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/gregreisdorf/status/1878849641715753391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full thread of posts by Reisdorf</a> is a veritable treasure trove of memory lane snippets, perfect reading material for the average Call of Duty fan.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/chinese-game-time-limit-regulation-tencent-netease/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-and-netease-bow-to-china-%E2%80%98game-time-limit%E2%80%99-regulations.1081557/</guid>

<p>It was recently announced that Chinese regulators are once again enforcing a ‘game time limit’ across the country as the winter school holiday period approaches. The period, set to run between January 15 and February 14, will see millions of children out of school for a well-deserved break – but their gaming time has been slashed by the government.</p>



<p>It has been confirmed that both Tencent and NetEase, two of the largest gaming corporations on the planet, ‘have signalled their adherence’ to the regulations. In the month-long holiday period, youngsters will be permitted to play just 16 hours of video games.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-setting-the-terms">Setting the Terms</h2>



<p>In a report published by the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3294239/chinese-regulators-limit-game-playing-time-kids-15-hours-month-during-school-break?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=section">South China Morning Post</a> (and uncovered by Malaysia’s publication, <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2025/01/14/china-restricts-children-to-15-hours-of-gaming-hours-over-school-holidays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Star</a>), the strict regulations were detailed in full, including what publishers are doing to restrict access to games.</p>



<p>Tencent has agreed on a scheme that will see children (anyone aged under 18) permitted just 15 hours of play between January 13 and February 13. NetEase, the gaming giant behind the recent Marvel Rivals release, will allow 16 hours in the same window.</p>



<p>The regulators have stressed that one hour per day will be allowed on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. This was a concept first set up in 2021, with the Chinese government expressing concerns that young people were spending too much time neck-deep in video games.</p>



<p>When the rules were put in place, more than 200 gaming companies pledged to adhere to the regulations.</p>



<p>This might come as a surprise given that China is one of the biggest consumers of games and the wider gaming industry in the world. Last year, the nation released Black Myth: Wukong, one of the most successful games in years and a rampant performer. </p>



<p>In a scary quote taken from The Star’s report, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Tencent said that it has tightened its detection measures to better detect and punish transgressors during the upcoming holiday.</p>



<p>It has also created a ‘risky account database’ which flags adult accounts that may be borrowed by children, requiring facial recognition to verify users.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth stressing that anyone over the age of 18 is free to play as many games as they want.</p>

<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is set to be released this week, and it’s already turning heads in previews and early reviews. It’s shaping up to be something special, but for it to arrive, ‘Dynasty Warriors 10’ had to be cancelled.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, senior developers from Koei Tecmo revealed that they were working on a ‘numbered’ Dynasty Warriors game before Origins entered development, but it was ultimately cancelled.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-out-of-the-ashes">Out of the Ashes</h2>



<p>In the interview <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/804/G080402/20250107035/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with 4Gamer</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/koei-tecmo-canceled-a-new-dynasty-warriors-game-before-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SiliconEra</a>), Koei Tecmo’s Tomohiko Sho, Mitsuhiro Ohshima, Kazutoshi Sekiguchi, and Masatomo Ohba sat down to talk about Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the next game in the lengthy and storied series.</p>



<p>Opening the discussion, Ohba explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Before Origins, Ohshima and I were working on a so-called ‘phantom numbered title’ with a different concept. The title at that time was an expansion of the direction of ‘Dynasty Warriors 7’ with a stage clear system and many playable generals. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>When 4Gamer asked if that game was ultimately cancelled, Tomohiko Sho, Origins’ producer, confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yes. It’s not that what Ohba and Ohshima were making was bad, but as current consoles such as the PlayStation 5 appeared and we continued to verify it internally, we talked about whether we could use these specs to make ‘the best Musou that can be made now’. So, the new Dynasty Warriors we made is Origins.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(translation errors may exist)</em></p>



<p>The team went on to explain that the ideas created to power this unknown numbered title weren’t ‘wasted’, and that some of them have been incorporated into Dynasty Warriors: Origins. </p>



<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is set to be released on January 17. Will you be picking up a copy? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It wouldn’t be a VALORANT offseason for Cloud9 without just a little bit of drama. For the second season in a row, the team made more than one late roster move that caught fans off guard. Now though, the team looks to capitalize on the sophomore season of one of last year’s breakout stars in Francis “OXY” Hoang.</p>



<p>At VCT Americas’ Media Day, C9 coach Ian “Immi” Harding spoke to Insider Gaming about OXY’s year two expectations and the new additions to the roster. He also spoke about the necessary culture shift that C9 needs to reach the next level.</p>



<hr>



<p><em>The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</em></p>



<p><strong>IG: A breakout season for OXY last year. What are you hoping to see him do more of in 2025?</strong></p>



<p>This year we’ve been working on a lot of his teamplay, his comms, him actually saying what he wants to do in a round. He has a really good read on the game, but last year he was still getting used to using his own voice. Discipline as well; when we have those two-man advantages, we don’t want him throwing his life away because he wants to get the clip.</p>



<p>We’ve been working around him a lot, and he’s playing an overall better game right now.</p>



<figure><figcaption>v1c (left) and OXY (right) during VCT Spotlight Series Americas 2024. Photo by Tina Jo/Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>IG: Another new addition is v1c, who had a stellar campaign with Shopify. What about his game did you see that you think will impress on the tier one level?</strong></p>



<p>One of the things I feel we lacked last year was firepower and good attitudes. With him he has a great attitude, and great comms which I didn’t expect when trialing. He mid-rounds, he has great ideas, he always wants to help out the coaching staff, he watches VODs back.</p>



<p>But he can shoot. He can really shoot. Now we have shooters on this team. That was the big thing. For smokes players, it was [between] him and Zander, but we didn’t even get a chance to try out Zander. I think all the players that have come in are helping the coaching staff, whereas last year it wasn’t quite like that; we would bring some ideas and they would just get shut down.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>IG: Were there specific players that weren’t receptive to ideas and weren’t providing enough firepower?</strong></p>



<p>I don’t want to name names, but the team’s the team now. I just think our culture last year, which I can be to blame too as well for, wasn’t the best. And this year this is something we’ve really worked on; myself, Guglielmo “GUGLi” Carraro, and especially Mitchell “mitch” Semago coming in. The culture of the team is much, much stronger and in a better position.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Immi backstage during the 2024 season. Photo by Tina Jo/Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>[With mitch], it’s still early days, and we’re still learning a lot about each other, but it’s very good. He’s a similar caller to vanity; he can read the game really well. But the things he brings outside the game: he always wants to work on stuff, he wants to work on fundamentals, he wants to make sure we’re not losing ecos. We’re very in sync with that now. He’s bringing out the best of me and I hope I’m bringing out the good in him too.</p>



<p><strong>IG: It took more than a few dramatic steps to get to this roster you have now. Now that it’s together though, what makes it stand out compared to previous rosters?</strong></p>



<p>Everyone’s on the same page. We’re having practice days where we’re getting up at 9 am and we’re not finished until 7 pm just because we talk about everything and we’re making sure we’ve got everything right. Obviously a big factor is that we don’t have that much time, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-tejo-in-valorant-tips-and-tricks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now [a new] agent is coming in</a>.</p>



<p>They just want to win and they’re all young and they’re hungry. And going into the offseason that’s what I wanted: young, hungry players that wanted to win and a leader who would help me set the culture to the way it should be.</p>

<p>Rebel Wolves, which is represented by former CD Projekt Red talent, has revealed The Blood of Dawnwalker with a lengthy cinematic trailer and a short gameplay teaser. The trailer was released today, introducing this ‘brand-new role-playing saga’ that begins with this open-world single-player RPG.</p>



<p>The studio is led by Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, the creative mind who directed The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, which was released back in 2015. In some of the visual and audio elements of the trailer for The Blood of Dawnwalker, some Witcher-themed inspiration can be detected.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-treading-the-line">Treading the Line</h2>



<p>In the blurb that accompanied the new trailer, Rebel Wolves wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You play as Coen, a young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night. Use your skills and combine vampiric strength with human resolve as you take on a quest to save the ones you love. Face your foes – be they human, monster, or the ticking clock itself. </p>



<p>But remember – the real evil may bask in the sun’s light, and the most loyal of allies could lurk under the cover of night.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The trailer showcases brutal combat, with enemies being torn to pieces and even exploded by a gaggle of bloodthirsty and powerful vampires. There’s plenty of emotional, fountains of blood, and a glimpse at a wide, open world with impressive potential.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. The team neglected to provide any kind of a release window for the game, but a full gameplay reveal is schedule to take place this summer – potentially at Summer Games Fest.</p>
