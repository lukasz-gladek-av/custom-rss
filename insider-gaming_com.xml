<p>Paramount has officially acquired the rights to produce a Call of Duty movie. In an announcement on Tuesday, it was said that Paramount will create a live-action film based on the long-running franchise.</p>



<p>The news comes just days after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-seeking-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initial rumors began to circulate</a>.</p>



<p>Paramount CEO David Ellison said that, as a “lifelong fan” of Call of Duty, the opportunity for his company to develop a movie on the franchise is a “dream come true”.</p>



<p><strong>“Being entrusted by Activision and players worldwide to bring this extraordinary storytelling universe to the big screen is both an honor and a responsibility that we don’t take lightly,”</strong> he said. <strong>“We’re approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence that guided our work on&nbsp;Top Gun: Maverick, ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve.”</strong></p>



<p>Ellison added that he can “promise” that Paramount will be <strong>“resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy&nbsp;of&nbsp;this one-in-a-million brand.”</strong></p>



<p>Activision President Rob Kostic said that, with Paramount, the studio has found what he believes to be a “fantastic partner” to bring the series to the big screen.</p>



<p><strong>“The film will honor and expand upon what has made this franchise great in the first place, and we cannot wait to get started,”</strong> Kostic said. <strong>“Our shared goal is quite simple — to create an unforgettable blockbuster movie experience that our community loves, and one that also excites and inspires new fans&nbsp;of&nbsp;the franchise.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as who’ll write, direct, and star in the film, that information won’t be revealed for some time. Even a release date is far too off to be announced at this time. </p>



<p>The deal, according to sources at <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-skydance-1236504600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, is for just one movie. However, there are opportunities to expand further.</p>
