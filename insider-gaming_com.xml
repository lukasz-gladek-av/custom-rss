<p>A dataminer has uncovered that GTA 5 had a climbing feature that was tested and scrapped before launch. </p>



<p>Players have been eagerly awaiting more GTA 6 news since the game’s release date was announced, set for May 26, 2026. However, all we have learned since the last trailer is that the upcoming title will feature a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fair-price-80-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fair price</a>“. However, until we see some gameplay for GTA 6, players can read about new details on GTA 5’s scrapped features that have surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-gta-5-had-a-feature-called-handholds-which-was-tested-and-scrapped">GTA 5 Had a Feature Called ‘Handholds’, Which Was Tested and Scrapped </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/gta-5-climbing-parkour-gameplay-feature-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, the new details about GTA 5’s cancelled climbing feature come from Lucas7yoshi_RS on <a href="https://x.com/Lucas7yoshi_RS/status/1956065169005510657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). It seems that developers were testing a feature called “Handholds,” which was used to define “climbable” objects in the game. These included pipes, walls, poles, and more. The dataminer found a file called “handholds.xml”, but the file only contains test points. </p>



<p>The dataminer also points out a recent video from GTA content creator, whatever57010, which highlights “some oddly placed lightpoles”. The dataminer notes that several test points were also discovered near the same roof as the light poles. Moreover, the poles might have been there to test the climbing features; however, the GTA 5 developer may have forgotten to remove them afterward. Interested readers can check out these test points in the post embedded below: </p>

<p>While scouring through the files, the dataminer also found <a href="https://x.com/Lucas7yoshi_RS/status/1956135971965296873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">references</a> to NPC behaviour in GTA 5. For example, homeless NPCs would insult and ask for change from Michael and Franklin, but would only greet Trevor with a simple ‘hi’. Similarly, buff NPCs would insult Michael, calling him unfit, whereas Franklin would get a ‘hi’ from them. Moreover, firemen, medics, and posh NPCs only say hi to Michael. </p>

<p>An insider has claimed that there are three playable characters in Resident Evil Requiem; however, we have only seen one in action till now. </p>



<p>Ahead of the new gameplay trailer at Gamescom Opening Night Live, Resident Evil Requiem has been receiving a series of leaks daily. Recently, we learned that the upcoming game will feature ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-last-of-us-combat-and-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last of Us</a>‘ combat and vehicles. We also learned other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-story-details-leaked-by-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story details</a> about RE9. Now, the latest leak says there are more playable characters. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-will-reportedly-have-alyssa-as-a-playable-character-for-a-bit">Resident Evil Requiem Will Reportedly Have Alyssa as a Playable Character for a Bit</h2>



<p>The new leak about Resident Evil Requiem’s playable comes from none other than AestheticGame (Dusk Golem) on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955685571231445501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). In one of his previous posts, he stated that many diehard fans would feel that RE9 is “oddly like the Revelations games.” To which a fan asked whether the upcoming game will have four playable characters like Revelations did. Dusk Golem replied that players will be able to step into the shoes of Leon and Grace, and “a little Alyssa.” </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Leon &amp; Grace. A little Alyssa, but that's really it.</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955685571231445501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>As of now, players have only seen Grace Ashcroft as the playable character in Resident Evil Requiem, and we have yet to learn about any new ones. Dusk Golem has claimed and reiterated several times that Leon will be one of the main protagonists in the game, but Alyssa is a new name. For those who don’t know, Alyssa Ashcroft is Grace’s mother and is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-story-details-leaked-by-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> also the giant woman monster following her in the trailer. </p>



<p>As always, this information doesn’t come from an official source, so readers should take it with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>In other news, the next Resident Evil remakes are expected to&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-resident-evil-remakes-are-releasing-in-2027-2028-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrive in 2027/2028</a>.&nbsp;Also, the upcoming Resident Evil movie by Zach Cregger will feel “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-movie-fresh-edgy-weird/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh, edgy, and weird</a>“.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 developers have already made changes to the Rush mode, which was introduced during the second Open Beta weekend. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s Open Beta weekend 2 is now live, and it has instantly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-huge-player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought in a vast number of players</a>. Many players must be looking forward to the weekend, as they will have two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-gets-new-map-and-modes-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new modes and a new map</a> to try out. However, one of the modes released this weekend, Rush, has already received a fix from BF6 developers. </p>







<p>The latest post from Battlefield Comms on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956355268972867585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) states that new balancing changes have been made to Breakthrough and Rush. The defender respawn timers in both Breakthrough and Rush have been fixed to 12 seconds; previously, they were set within the 6-12 second range. Also, in Breakthrough, fewer players are needed to capture an objective. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Balance Changes to Breakthrough and Rush</p><p>We’ve just made some balancing changes: In Breakthrough, it now takes fewer players on an objective to speed up capture.

<p>A couple of hours ago, the Battlefield Comms account posted another update for Battlefield 6’s Rush mode. The Rush mode’s MCOM timer was reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to improve the balance between attacking and defending players. The developers will continue to monitor the game mode and make further balancing adjustments as needed. </p>

<p>Since open beta weekend 2 began, several players have raised concerns about Battlefield 6’s Rush Mode. Popular Battlefield content creator, Westie, has been voicing their opinions about BF6’s Rush mode on <a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1955978800648319332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>. According to them, there are massive balancing problems across each map, and there is no space between MCOM locations. Players on the r/Battlefield subreddit also have issues with the game mode being locked to 12v12 games. </p>



<p>The new timer changes do help, but players are asking for more balancing improvements for BF6’s Rush mode, including adding “<a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1956262080064921803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sufficient space</a>“, among other things. However, players should keep in mind that Battlefield 6 is still in beta, and the beta was intended to identify problems like these, which could be addressed before the full launch. </p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield and Call of Duty ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-and-call-of-duty-complement-each-other-says-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complement each other</a>‘, according to BF6 developers. Additionally, many Battlefield 6 players have experienced issues with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-dlss-dlaa-not-working-issue-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLSS and DLAA</a>. What are your thoughts on Battlefield 6 developers already making changes to the Rush mode?
