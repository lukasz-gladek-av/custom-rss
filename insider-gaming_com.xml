<p>Warhorse Studios has announced that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has sold two million units in its first two weeks.</p>



<p>The announcement was made on the developers X (formerly Twitter) page, where the developers said “A toast to you all for making #KCD2 a triumph!”</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 hit its highest concurrent player count on Steam last week at 256,206 players, far surpassing the original game that released in 2018.</p>



<p>On its success, Embracer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-ceo-says-teams-need-to-have-the-resources-to-make-games-after-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEO Lars Wingefors praised the games success</a> and said its a “reminder” to the company about creating “great products”.</p>



<p>“When you have right teams, this trust benefits everyone, including gamers, employees and shareholders. I am convinced that we will remain among the industry leaders in our core business verticals in the future.”</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s official review</a>, Grant Taylor-Hill called Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 a “masterpiece” that was tough to “find one major fault” with.</p>



<p>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is beautiful in every aspect,” he wrote. “It’s deeply authentic and riddled with emotion and catharsis, and the way the story comes together is just perfection.”</p>



<p>Last week, it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modding-coming-to-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhorse Studios will be bringing mod support to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. </p>



<p>“Bohemia is about to get even more exciting,”&nbsp;they said. “Official modding support is coming to [Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2] on Steamworks.” But as for when mod support will be released, remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launched on February 4, 2025 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

<p>Days Gone Remastered can be grabbed through a $10 upgrade if you already own the game digitally or physically; however, if you own the game from PlayStation Plus, you are not eligible for this offer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1iok0hw/days_gone_remastered_game_redemptions_via_ps_plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStationPlus</a> subreddit, the Days Gone Remastered’s fine print clearly states that “Game redemptions via PlayStation Plus are not eligible for upgrade”. PS Plus players must pay $49.99 to play the Days Gone Remastered, whereas digital or disc copy owners can upgrade for only $10. Many players in the subreddit have stated that they would happily upgrade for the earlier price, but now that they have to buy the whole game, they aren’t interested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During PlayStation’s State of Play event, Bend Studio announced that Days Gone Remastered will be released on April 25, 2025. The remastered version has been built for the PS5 and supports Tempest 3D Audio, VRR, DualSense’s haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers. The game also features improved graphical fidelity and better frame rates for the quality and performance modes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Days Gone Remastered includes new modes and features: Horde Assault, a survival arcade mode; Permadeath mode; Speedrun mode; enhanced Photo mode; and new accessibility features. The new features can also be accessed on PC by purchasing the Broken Road DLC, which costs $10.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the director of Days Gone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slammed Bend Studio</a> for not protecting the game’s legacy in Astro Bot ads. Also, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/willl-there-be-a-days-gone-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whether the game will receive a sequel</a>.

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s modding community has already created a mod for Goku’s new Super Saiyan 4 transformation from the Daima series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spoilers ahead for the players that haven’t caught up with the new Daima series yet, but Goku reached his iconic Super Saiyan 4 transformation again during the latest episode,’ Awakening’, and the form is canon this time. The new Goku SSJ4 Daima transformation draws a lot of inspiration from its GT counterpart, but it is also different in some ways, such as the colours and Goku still being short. The modders have perfectly captured Goku SSJ4 Daima’s essence in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-sparking-zero-goku-ssj4-daima-mod">Sparking Zero Goku SSJ4 Daima Mod</h2>

The creator, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/EmiG84/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EmiG84</a>, has posted his creations on Patreon and has Daima Super Saiyan 4 transformations for both Goku and Vegeta; you can check them out in action <a href="https://youtu.be/PUEAAaTBZxY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.

They have already released their first DLC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-hero-of-justice-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hero of Justice</a>, and two more DLCs are planned.

<p>Ubisoft has a big launch on the new through Rainbow Six Siege X—a successor to 2015’s Siege. More original Siege content is on the way, but it looks like Rainbow Six Siege X is replacing its predecessor, and offering big upgrades.</p>



<p>Fun Fact: I got Rainbow Six Siege shortly after release and ended up selling it a few months later because <em>I couldn’t stop playing it</em>. Siege greatly disrupted my single-player gaming, and I decided to end the relationship. I fondly look back on those early days, and 10 years later, the game is as celebrated as ever. It’s a huge esports hit, the gameplay is still strategic and intricate, and tens of thousands of players still hop on each day.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-2-reveal-si-2025-rumour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siege 2 rumor</a> gained huge traction in January 2025. The leak came to fruition with the announcement of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siege X</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-rainbow-six-siege-x-release-date">Do we Know The Rainbow Six Siege X Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>10 years of history. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no release date locked in for Rainbow Six Siege X, nor a vague release period.</strong></p>



<p>Common sense suggests Siege X will likely be released following the conclusion of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-y10s1-reveal-prep-phase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege Y10</a>. This isn’t factual though, so be sure to check back as we update you.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date">When is The Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase Date?</h2>



<p><strong>The Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase is penciled in for March 13 at 10 AM PT / 6 PM CT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT.</strong></p>



<p>A <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/4IUTIzwOdeRG4l3ms7h1Dz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft article</a> confirmed Siege’s X Showcase date. “A new era of&nbsp;Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp;will be revealed on <strong>March 13</strong> at the Siege X Showcase,” it said. The Showcase will show us every aspect of Siege X and its new changes compared to the original.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase">How to Watch Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase</h2>



<p><strong>Ubisoft has confirmed you can check out the full Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase by watching the action unfold on the Ubisoft Twitch Channel.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft Rainbow6 Twitch Channel</a> is the home of all things Rainbow Six Siege. So it makes sense for Siege X to be unveiled here. It remains to be seen if any YouTube channels also broadcast the Showcase.</p>



<p>Keep your eyes peeled for alternative sources—as will we.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x">What is Rainbow Six Siege X?</h2>



<p><strong>Rainbow Six Siege X is described as a “major evolution” of Siege, but it isn’t considered a sequel or normal update.</strong></p>



<p>Ubisoft game director Joshua Mills revealed Siege X aims to keep <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siege around for the next 10 years</a>. He raised expectations for Siege X at the Rainbow Six Invitational: “It is not Siege 2, and it’s not just another update. It’s a major evolution. We’re expanding and reinforcing the very foundation of Siege to ensure it remains the pinnacle of tactical PvP first-person shooters.”</p>



<p>“Graphical and audio upgrades, deepened tactical gameplay, and new ways to play the game,” are also at the forefront of Siege X’s marketing ahead of the Showcase.</p>



<p>Check out its first teaser trailer below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege X Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4vvBU-1CCY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>I imagine Siege X is following in the footsteps of Overwatch 2 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-hits-all-time-player-peak-on-steam-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CS2</a> by being a massively upgraded free-to-play enhancement of the original. If so, we can start dreaming of the new content, gameplay mechanics, and much more Ubisoft has in store.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s no secret Ubisoft needs a big win in the next year. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-in-line-with-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> might not be enough, but Siege continues to do the business.
