<p>Marvel Rivals continues to turn heads since being released in December 2024. It has been a smash hit with tens of millions of players worldwide, which is aided by the fact that it’s a genuinely enjoyable, free-to-play hero shooter. NetEase is working hard to ensure the content pipeline remains stoked, and creators are locked in on the game.</p>



<p>One such creator is Shroud, one of the biggest streamers in the business. Recently, the former CSGO pro player gushed over Marvel Rivals and suggested he could be about to make an esports organisation focused exclusively on the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-jest-or-not">In Jest or Not</h2>



<p>Whether he was being serious or not remains to be seen, but if anyone can do it, Shroud can.</p>



<p>For years, Shroud has been one of the most popular streamers in the world, coming out of a relatively successful esports pro player career and opting to sit in front of the camera for years to follow. Today, he’s one of the biggest names in gaming.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, Shroud once again delved into his love for Marvel Rivals, explaining a potential goal for the near future:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If we raise a certain amount of money, I’ll make a Marvel Rivals team, slash org.</p>



<p>This game might just be it.</p>



<p>I might have to set a donation goal, for this number to hit something, and <strong>I will make an org</strong> for Marvel Rivals only.</p>



<p>I might be playing this game for the rest of my life. I genuinely might be playing this game for the rest of my life.</p>
</blockquote>



<div><article><p><span>Shroud says he might make an org just so he can have a Marvel Rivals team 

“This game might just be it…I genuinely might be playing this game for the rest of my life”</span></p></article></div>







<p>Marvel Rivals boasts a solid foundation that would easily support a competitive ecosystem. For now, it’s tied almost exclusively to a ranked platform, but recently, Twitch Rivals hosted a <strong>Marvel Rivals </strong>tournament, which was more or less a first for the game.</p>



<p>In the past, Shroud has dominated the likes of Counter-Strike, Overwatch, and VALORANT, so edging into the Marvel Rivals space is nothing but familiar territory.</p>



<p>Are you eager to see a more legitimate esports ecosystem for Marvel Rivals? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re waiting for.</p>

<p>The VALORANT rivalry between North American teams Sentinels and 100 Thieves has always been hot, but it reached unhinged levels just one week into the 2025 season. After some spicy photos hit the timeline this past weekend though, the two organizations asked their outspoken stars to tone it down.</p>



<p>Still, those photos will be seared into our memory for some time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sentinels-and-100t-requested-the-images-be-taken-down">Sentinels and 100T “Requested” The Images Be Taken Down</h2>



<p>Prior to the highly anticipated match between Sentinels and 100 Thieves at VCT Americas, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/100t-valorants-boostio-says-nrg-cant-win-championships-with-fns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100T’s sparkplug in-game leader Kelden “Boostio” Pupello</a> posted a wild couple of photos on X. This included one of someone bent over in front of him wearing Sentinels’ Jordan “Zellsis” Montemurro’s jersey, with the caption “Banging @Sentinels today.”</p>



<p>However, it was Sentinels that got the last laugh, defeating 100 Thieves in three maps and knocking them down to the lower bracket of the VCT Americas Kickoff event. After the match, Boostio willingly posed in a similar bent-over position for Zellsis, who posted the image onto his Twitter account.</p>



<p>Eventually, both images were taken down, causing some on reddit to speculate that Riot forced the players to delete the photos. Some even claimed that both Zellsis and Boostio were fined for their tweets, but the Sentinels star has denied that speculation.</p>



<p>On X, Zellsis <a href="https://x.com/Zellsis/status/1881173481553101274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> “the internet [is] spreading misinformation as usual. I was not fined for that tweet, nor do I think Boostio was. The tweets were definitely out of pocket so Riot and our orgs politely requested we take them down.” Zellsis previously was fined by Riot Games back in 2023 for making a lewd gesture while on camera.</p>



<p>Should Zellsis and Boostio have received fines for their photos? Let us know down below and on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-civilization-7-civilizations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here-is-all-civilization-7-civilizations-coming-day-one-%E2%80%93-factions-guide.1087239/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-civilization-7-civilizations/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a move that’s quite similar to Humankind, the relatively recent 4X strategy game that saw players leading a budding nation through history, Civilization 7 no longer requires you to pick a static faction and remain the same leader from start to finish. Instead, the game is divided into stages: Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern. During these ages, you’ll evolve your faction from a lowly tribe to a powerhouse with nuclear missiles. Here is a look at all the Civilization 7 civilizations available on day one!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-factions-in-civilization-7-at-launch">All Factions in Civilization 7 at Launch</h2>



<p>As you progress through the various eras in Civilization 7, you’ll expand your empire, bolster your troops, and inevitably evolve your culture from one, such as the Greek, to the next, such as the Norman, before inevitably finishing the game in the modern era as, say, the Prussian. It’ll offer players many opportunities to customize the experience and ensure replayability for quite some time!</p>



<h3 id="h-antiquity">Antiquity</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Aksumite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Egyptian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Greek</strong></li>



<li><strong>Han</strong></li>



<li><strong>Khmer</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mauryan</strong></li>



<li><strong>Maya</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mississippian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Persian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Roman</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-exploration">Exploration</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Abbasid</strong></li>



<li><strong>Chola</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hawaiian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Inca</strong></li>



<li><strong>Majapahit</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ming</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mongolian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Norman</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shawnee</strong></li>



<li><strong>Songhai</strong></li>



<li><strong>Spanish</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-modern">Modern</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>American</strong></li>



<li><strong>Buganda</strong></li>



<li><strong>Imperial French</strong></li>



<li><strong>Meiji Japanese</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mexican</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mughal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Prussian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Qing</strong></li>



<li><strong>Russian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Siamese</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-will-we-see-additional-civilizations-in-dlc">Will We See Additional Civilizations in DLC?</h2>



<p>Most likely, yeah. While it’s not guaranteed that we will receive DLC and expansions for Civilization 7, it’s highly considering the franchise’s overall track record for additional content. In the last game, Civilization VI, players were treated to Portugal, Vietnam, Byzantium, Gaul, and the Maya, to name a few of the leader packs that launched post-release.</p>



<p>For Civilization VII, which launches on February 11, we suspect 2K and Firaxis Games want to offer players even more content, keeping everyone satisfied for years to come!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-settings-and-options/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-cs2-settings-and-options.1087224/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-settings-and-options/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Counter-Strike 2 settings menu is filled to the brim with different options that can change your gameplay, for better or worse. Newer CS2 players may be overwhelmed and will resign to going with the settings recommended by your system. While these options are fine, they can be better.</p>



<p>These are the best CS2 settings we can recommend you try out for yourself.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-video-settings">Best CS2 Video Settings</h2>



<p>Display Mode, Aspect Ratio, and Resolution are very dependent on personal preference. Players that alt-tab during matches or tab over to a program like Spotify, Discord, or a browser will have a more fluid time playing on Fullscreen Windowed. However, playing on Fullscreen Windowed means you can’t alter Aspect Ratio or Resolution. <strong>Playing in 4:3 stretched resolution</strong> is very popular amongst pros and long-time competitive players, as the game feels smoother and character models look wider.</p>



<ul>
<li>Under Video Settings, switch to Fullscreen, 4:3 Original, and 1280×960. By default, you’ll have black bars on the sides of your screen but these can be removed.</li>



<li>Tab out of CS2, and open the NVIDIA Control Panel. Under Display, click Adjust desktop size and position. 
<ul>
<li>Set the Scaling mode to Full-screen</li>



<li>Select GPU under “Perform scaling on”</li>



<li>Keep your resolution native</li>



<li>Set the refresh rate to your monitor’s maximum</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>When you tab back into CS2, you should have the stretched resolution that so many players prefer.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-advanced-video-settings">Best CS2 Advanced Video Settings</h2>



<p>As for your Advanced Video Settings, your goal should be improving FPS, reducing lag, and making CS2 look as clear as possible. Under the Advanced Video tab of your CS2 settings menu, make the following changes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>V-Sync: </strong>Disabled</li>



<li><strong>Multisampling Anti-Aliasing Mode:</strong> None</li>



<li><strong>Global Shadow Quality: </strong>Very High</li>



<li><strong>Model/Texture Detail: </strong>Medium</li>



<li><strong>Texture Filtering Mode: </strong>Anisotropic 16X</li>



<li><strong>Shader Detail: </strong>Low</li>



<li><strong>Particle Detail:</strong> Medium</li>



<li><strong>Ambient Occlusion: </strong>Disabled</li>



<li><strong>High Dynamic Range: </strong>Quality</li>



<li><strong>FidelityFX Super Resolution: </strong>Balanced</li>
</ul>



<p>These settings in the Advanced Video section of the CS2 menu should provide a solid balance between performance and visual clarity. With these, you should get good FPS performance without sacrificing your visuals.</p>



<p>Have these settings improved your performance in CS2? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Did you know Escape From Tarkov has in-game achievements?</strong> Despite playing since Factory was the only available map, I didn’t for the longest time. It’s true, though. As part of the 0.14 content update, EFT now offers achievements. Some remain hidden; others are common enough to score during casual play. Here’s a look at all of them!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-achievements-in-escape-from-tarkov">All Achievements in Escape From Tarkov</h2>



<p>Escape From Tarkov features a ton of achievements, but don’t expect them to unlock anything special, like in-game rewards or transfer over to Steam if the game ever launches on Valve’s digital storefront. They’re primarily for show, a bit of bragging rights as you complete raid after raid, losing all of your equipment…is that just me?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-goes-gold-ahead-of-release/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-goes-gold-ahead-of-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Civilization 7 is ready to launch. Developer Firaxis Games has announced that the game has officially gone gold three weeks ahead of the game’s February 11 release date.</p>



<p>The announcement came via a post on social media on Monday.</p>



<p>“We’ve struck gold,” the <a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1881386264856772846" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post reads</a>. “[Civilization 7] has officially gone gold – we’re ready to hit shelves on February 11.”</p>



<p>With the game going gold, it signals that—barring something drastic—there’s no chance of a delay for the latest entry in the classic franchise. When it launches, Civilization 7 will be available for PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. The game will feature full cross-play on release day.</p>







<p>Those who decide to pre-order one of the more expensive versions of the game will get to play starting February 6, five days before Standard Edition owners.</p>



<p>If you plan on playing the game on PC, there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-full-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different spec requirements</a> depending on the quality you’re looking from.

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is still on the way. That’s according to the game’s developer Team Cherry over the weekend. </p>



<p>In a reply to a fan wondering if the game is progressing or if the developers had “given up on the project”, the game’s head of marketing and publishing, Matthew Griffin, gave a short answer to the question.</p>



<p>“Yes the game is real, progressing and will release,” <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>, following it up with a heart. </p>



<p>While it’s not the update fans are waiting for from a  game that was officially announced in 2019, it’s still something from a team that’s been quite silent up to this point. Originally set to be an expansion to the first game, Silksong turned into a full-fledged sequel during its development. According to Team Cherry, it will feature over 165 new enemies and 100 different benches. </p>



<p>The game sees you play as Hornet, who has been captured and taken to an “unfamiliar land” where she has to fight her way out to get “to the kingdom’s peak”.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollow-knight-silksong-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Team Cherry</a>, in addition to the new enemies and additional benches, Silksong will feature a branch new Kingdom, a new original soundtrack, a challenge mode, new movement mechanics, and new weapons to learn. </p>



<p>The game was originally planned for a 2023 release, but development kept it in the oven. Since then, however, there’s been no hint as to when it could be coming. When it does finally release, Silksong will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC. </p>

<p>EA and DICE have been accused of using photos from the war in Gaza in artwork for Battlefield 2025. </p>



<p>Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/emadalden_/status/1881045891009929516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EmadAlden</a> spotted the similarity when looking at the promotional artwork. Another user, <a href="https://x.com/DANNYonPC/status/1881050549455659026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DANNYonPC</a>, made the claim that the company is using photos from attacks on Gaza in the imagery. </p>



<p>“Damn, DICE is using pictures from attacks on Gaza in their BF2025 artwork,” the post reads. It then shows the photo in question from a bombing in Gaza dated May 12, 2021 taken by Reuters.</p>



<p>You can see the images yourself below for comparison.</p>

<p>While it’s unlikely it was done with intent or malice, it’s no question a decision that many could view as questionable. Insider Gaming has reached out to multiple contacts at EA for comment on the claims and the usage of real conflict for its artwork. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly. </p>

<p>Every new season of Diablo IV brings about monumental changes that completely alter the game’s meta. We usually wind up with colossal skill nerfs, pushing one class down the tier list and bumping another up.

<p>I’m ready for a grind. I want to lose many hours this week, to forget about the winter storm and all of life’s other challenges rearing their ugly heads daily, and that grind comes from Diablo 4 for the foreseeable future. With the upcoming Diablo 4 Season 7 start date, we’ll dive into Season of Witchcraft, with brand-new powers, new enemies, cosmetics, a battlepass, and some of the best quality-of-life features, like a class quest update and the Armory! Here’s when you can play Diablo 4 Season of Witchcraft!</p>

<p>By the time this guide goes live, you won’t have to wait long to jump into the new season of Diablo 4. It begins on January 21, early in the day, and everyone should expect some downtime as the servers shut off for the big switch. We’ll likely see a few hiccups at the start, what with so many people jumping into the new content on day one, so be patient!</p>

<li><strong>January 21 at 10 AM PST</strong></li>



<li><strong>January 21 at 12 PM CST</strong></li>



<li><strong>January 21 at 6 PM GMT</strong></li>

</ul>

You’ll help them throughout the seasonal journey, earning new rewards and powers, like the four schools of Witchcraft: Eldritch, Psyche, Growth &amp; Decay, and Psyche.</p>
