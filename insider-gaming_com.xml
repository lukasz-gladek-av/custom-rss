<p>No Man’s Sky has received its latest major update, Update 5.5 also known as Worlds Part 2. This new update for the game sees the addition of new planets, new stars, and a new story.</p>



<p>“The algorithm of the universe has evolved to generate beautiful new&nbsp;mountains, deep&nbsp;valleys, and sprawling&nbsp;plains&nbsp;on&nbsp;untouched planets, waiting to be discovered,” developer <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-ii-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hello Games wrote</a>.</p>



<p>With Worlds Part 2, a new class of star has appeared as well as new purple-class solar systems that include “countless new worlds”.</p>



<p>“With Worlds Part [2], we added billions of new star systems and trillions of new planets to the universe,” Hello Games founder Sean Murray said. “This allows us to push the boundaries of our engine and technology without changing the things people love about the game already.</p>



<p>“If you settled on your home planet with a beautiful base that you lovingly crafted, that is safe – but now there are new worlds to explore with a level of variety no one has seen before.”</p>



<p>Aside from the new stars and planets also comes a new story for players to experience. The new narrative-driven mission “deepens the&nbsp;<strong>lore</strong>&nbsp;of the universe and&nbsp;<strong>expands upon the story</strong>&nbsp;of Atlas, Atlantid, and the robotic Autophage lifeforms.”</p>



<p>Other big new features with the update include deep oceans with new underwater biomes, better inventory sorting with the push of a button, a new “abandoned” mode that removes all alien life from the game, dynamic weather hazards, and more.</p>



<p>You can check out the extensive list of new features and fixes via the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-ii-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s official website</a>.</p>

<p>Trade Tokens are a unique Pokémon TCG Pocket consumable as they are used to swap Pokémon between friends, and there are ways to gather them fast and easily for higher-profile Trading.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has been a smash hit since day one. Its first month alone made over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-surpassed-120-million-in-earnings-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$120 million</a>, and its developers have continued to pump constant content into the free-to-play Pokémon title. One absent feature was finally added in January 2025—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-trade-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading</a>.</p>



<p>Part of the long-awaited function requires you to micromanage a currency called Trade Tokens. This handy guide shows you how to get Tokens, the best ways to do so, and how to use them.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-trade-tokens-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How to Get Trade Tokens in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>

<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket Trade Tokens are earned by exchanging duplicate cards in the “My Cards” section of the app. It has to be a card with a rarity rating of Three-Diamond or higher.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re familiar with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-flair-in-pokemon-pocket-tcg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flair</a>, this should be quite straightforward. A quick inspection of your card collection shows you how many of each card you have. You likely have a larger quantity of One-Diamond and Two-Diamond cards than you do anything else.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick guide to getting Trade Tokens in <a href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>:</p>



<ol>
<li>On the Pokémon TCG Pocket app, press the <strong>My Cards</strong> button found along the bottom bar tabs.</li>



<li>Find a Three-Diamond-rarity Card or higher.</li>



<li>Make sure you have <strong>three or more of the Card</strong>.</li>



<li>If you do, press on it.</li>



<li>Choose <strong>Obtain Items</strong>.</li>



<li>Press on the <strong>Trade Token</strong> exchange option (<strong>it’s the green symbol I’ve shown in the guide already</strong>).</li>



<li>Finally, press <strong>Exchange</strong>.</li>



<li>An animation plays to give you your Trade Token(s) at the end of it.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-fastest-way-to-get-trade-tokens-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Fastest Way to Get Trade Tokens in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p><strong>The best and fastest way to get Trade Tokens is to open more packs and make sure to exchange duplicates of your highest-rated cards to get more Trade Tokens.</strong></p>



<p>You can’t buy Trade Tokens in the shop, nor can you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-real-money-trade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spend real money on Trading</a>. Sacrificing your highest-rated swaps is the best way to get more Trade Tokens right now. To do so, open Packs, acquire more Hourglasses from the Shop, battles, and Events, and hoard those Packs!</p>



<p>Remember, you need to have <strong>at least three of a card to use the Obtain Items feature and obtain Trade Tokens</strong>. I was fortunate by the time Trading came around, I had several Three-Star Charizard ex 280/226 cards, allowing me to earn a lot of Trade Tokens from the get-go. </p>



<p>If you’re not interested in Flair, or you favor Trade Tokens, this is currently the way to go.</p>

<figure><figcaption>From zero to hero. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can earn anywhere between 25 to 1,500 Trade Tokens depending on the rarity of the Card you exchange in Pokémon TCG Pocket.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick table showing you the exact value of each rarity, so you know what you’re getting in return for the swap.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Card Rarity</th><th data-align="center">Trade Tokens Obtained</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Three-Diamond</td><td data-align="center">25</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Four-Diamond</td><td data-align="center">125</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">One-Star</td><td data-align="center">100</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Two-Star</td><td data-align="center">300</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Three-Star</td><td data-align="center">300</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Gold Crown</td><td data-align="center">1,500</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-are-trade-tokens-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">What Are Trade Tokens in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p><strong>Trade Tokens are one of two items required to perform a Trade in Pokémon TCG Pocket.</strong></p>



<p>It would be nice to do a simple one-off Trade like in the Pokémon games. However, just as Pokémon GO requires Stardust, Pocket adheres to its own consumable item currencies: <strong>Trade Tokens </strong>and <strong>Trade Stamina</strong>.</p>



<p>The better the rarity of the Pokémon, the more Trade Tokens are needed. If you follow my guide though, it should be easier than catching a Weedle with a Master Ball. Stay on top of Trade Tokens and you should always have enough to perform quick Trades.</p>

<p>Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner have announced that its found a new publisher following the US ban fiasco that saw TikTok and its game banned in the US.</p>



<p>Announced on <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1884400415925817429" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (Formerly Twitter), Second Dinner said that the developer has “already signed agreements and started the work to bring almost all operational and publishing responsibilities in-house at Second Dinner with support from a new U.S.-based publisher, Skystone Games.”</p>



<p>The move is to “ensure this never happens again,” they said, referring to the ban in the United States.</p>



<p>Marvel Snap suffered the same fate as TikTok during the US ban, as ByteDance was the parent owner of Nuverse (the previous publisher), and as such, suffered the same fake as TikTok due to “security concerns.”</p>
