<p>If you’re as excited as I am about Planet Coaster 2, then you’ll likely want to check out the achievements coming to the creative park building and management game. There aren’t too many, but enough to challenge you and keep you working toward a goal beyond the most beautiful park imaginable. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-planet-coaster-2-achievements-and-how-to-unlock-each">All Planet Coaster 2 Achievements and How to Unlock Each</h2>



<p>The clear majority of Planet Coaster 2 achievements revolve around progressing through the game’s story mode, completing various challenges, and exploring the game’s core mechanics. They don’t appear overly tricky to unlock, so I’m confident you can 100% the game this year.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-there-a-planet-coaster-2-platinum-trophy-on-ps5">Is There a Planet Coaster 2 Platinum Trophy on PS5?</h2>



<p>As Planet Coaster 2 launches simultaneously on PC and PlayStation 5, along with the Xbox Series X|S, it does indeed have a platinum trophy to unlock. It’s called “Heir to the Throne,” and of course, requires you to unlock all other trophies in the game to acquire.</p>



<p>It’s quite the challenge, but savvy fans with experience in previous “Planet” titles should have no issue meeting the unlock requirements for each of the above-mentioned Planet Coaster 2 achievements and trophies!</p>



<p>Don’t forget to show off your park in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forums</a>! We love to see screenshots of your latest gaming sessions!</p>

<p>The Pokémon TCG Pocket mobile title has a few different packs to choose from at different stages of the game. If you’ve just started Pokémon Pocket, or you’re deeper in and seeking wisdom on which to rip open, we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<p>I find opening packs in Pokémon TCG Pocket as addictive as doing it in real life. The hope of pulling an Ultra Rare or Full Illustration card is too tempting, even though I know it’s going to be another duplicate Psyduck or Slowpoke. Still, the feeling is there, and if you don’t want to splash out your hard-earned money on physical packs, Pokémon TCG Pocket is the perfect fix for this itch.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s early days feature three distinct packs (and starter packs) and it’s understandable if you want advice on opening the best packs.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-starter-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Starter Pack in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So many amazing cards to pull. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>I recommend opening the Charizard Pack</strong> when you first start Pokémon TCG Pocket as the Exeguttor EX in it is an extremely strong card and can be a consistent menace in online PvP. Additionally, I also think the <strong>Charmander Full Art card is the best-looking card</strong> of the six from a purely aesthetic standpoint—but each to their own.</p>



<p>The Charizard, Mewtwo, and Pikachu packs you’re offered aren’t for decoration—each one comes with a special set of two cards guaranteed to drop.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick look at each pack and what they offer you.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pack Type</th><th data-align="center">Pack Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Charizard Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Exeguttor EX</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Charizard Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Charmander Full Art</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mewtwo Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Marowak EX</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mewtwo Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Bulbasaur Full Art</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pikachu Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Arcanine EX</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pikachu Starter Pack</td><td data-align="center">Squirtle Full Art</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-pack-to-open-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Pack to Open in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p><strong>The Mewtwo Packs</strong> are the best to open in Pokémon TCG Pocket as they are the gateway to some of the most powerful cards in Pokémon Pocket—including Mewtwo itself. </p>



<p>In Pokémon TCG Pocket’s early weeks, <strong>Mewtwo EX</strong> is considered one of the strongest—if not the strongest—cards in the whole game. The Mewtwo pack also has other dominant cards including <strong>Venusaur EX</strong> and <strong>Dragonite</strong>. You only need to take a cursory glance at the bubble that pops up over each of the packs to see certain cards are exclusive to those packs.</p>



<p>Charizard packs also feature quite a few special EX cards: <strong>Charizard</strong>, <strong>Moltres</strong>, and <strong>Starmie</strong>. Outside of these, don’t sleep on Vileplume’s Soothing Scent attack which does high damage and puts opponents to sleep, or Alakazam’s Psychic move. On the other hand, the Pikachu pack-specific cards are decent, but won’t get you meta-decks like Charizard and Mewtwo do.</p>



<p>I highly recommend switching up the packs you open as it’s essential to get every card in the set without having to spend Card Points and buying them individually. Not only this, but when the meta does change, you have more cards to choose from, and you can also build diverse decks needed for unique challenges in Pokémon Pocket.</p>
