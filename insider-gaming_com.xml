<p>Cheating and hacking continue to be rampant across first-person online shooters. Delta Force is another that keeps being attacked, but if you are found guilty of cheating here, expect to face extreme consequences in the form of 10-year bans, and more. </p>



<p>There seems to be cheaters everywhere you look in gaming. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-cheaters-with-lifetime-bans-will-receive-a-second-chance-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite is known for handing out lifetime bans</a>—although the shooter is looking to give players reprieve—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-rules-rainbow-six-siege-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege has gone after cheaters</a>, and Call of Duty has infamously had problems with hackers over the years. </p>



<p>It’s a neverending problem, but one Delta Force is keeping on top of. Its latest cheat report indicates it’s stopped 20,000 cheaters in one week alone.</p>

<p>A March 20 post on the <a href="https://x.com/DeltaForce_Game/status/1902666885906469042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Delta Force X page</a> makes for interesting reading. “Our G.T.I. Security team are working around the clock to kick cheaters out of the game,” it says. It also mentions five types of bans Delta Force is handing out, including the hefty fine of a “10-year ban.”</p>



<p>The total number of cheaters targeted by Delta Force this week is <strong>20,024</strong>. Below, you can see the exact figures for each type of ban.</p>



<ul>
<li>10-Year Bans—<strong>1,446</strong></li>



<li>DMA Bans—<strong>365</strong></li>



<li>Devices Blocked—<strong>694</strong></li>



<li>Cheat Attempts Stopped—<strong>13,475</strong></li>



<li>Players Forced Offline—<strong>4,044</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/detail.html?father_content_id=80169c48a4720a450cab07aa9781d08ca521&amp;content_id=80169c48a4720a450cab07aa9781d08ca521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Delta Force website</a> provides a more in-depth look at the bans and actions geared toward cheaters. The report doubles down that “We adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards anyone found to be in violation of our game rules,” and also provides the beginning and ends of banned usernames.</p>



<p>It’s great to see Delta Force taking the cheater issue so seriously. It’s a game on the up after the frosty reception to the Black Hawk Down Campaign DLC which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-mostly-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players deemed to be “too difficult.”</a></p>

<p>Recently, a Twitch streamer accidentally revealed her viewbotting tool while streaming, prompting her to restart her broadcast and try to cover up the blunder by linking it to an OBS update. This is one of the few tangible examples we’ve got of Twitch streamers (and streamers on other platforms) using viewbotting tools to appear more popular than they are.</p>



<p>It’s a topic that has become all too common of late, with streamers going live to thousands of viewers but only having a few dozen people chatting at any given time – if that. In situations like this, it’s becoming much easier to cast stones at those maliciously boosting their viewer count. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-red-handed">Red-Handed</h2>



<p>In a clip that’s doing the rounds on social media, QueenGloriaRP was caught flashing up a viewbotting panel as she started her stream. It was clipped, captured, and circulated almost immediately, with users slamming the small streamer for cheating the platform.</p>



<p>QueenGloraRP had racked up just 3,600 followers when she was banned by Twitch hours after the viewbotting debacle surfaced online.</p>



<p>Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky took to social media to share his clear concerns about the situation, along with a copy of the clip:</p>



<div><article><p><span>So if this random Twitch streamer is viewbotting just 20 viewers… how many streamers are doing this? </span></p></article></div>







<p>It’s fair game for the average small streamer to worry about. They’re often punishing themselves for not netting as many viewers as the next streamer, but how often are the numbers being misrepresented by viewbotting tools? In QueenGloriaRP’s slip-up, it’s easy to see how simple it is to generate fake viewer counts, and she was only adding on a humble 20 non-existent audience members.</p>



<p>What about the larger streamers that have viewer counts in the tens of thousands? What percentage of that audience is real?</p>



<p>The panel that QueenGloriaRP revealed broke down how users will <strong>pay </strong>for their fake viewers. It looked like a token-based system was used, with more viewers equalling more credits (10 pcs for each viewer per hour). If it wasn’t bad enough that she was viewbotting, <strong>paying </strong>for the privilege is nuts on another level.</p>



<p>It’s fake growth; it’ll get you nowhere.</p>

<p>Balatro has continued a winning streak at the Game Developer’s Conference in San Francisco. At the showcase’s award ceremony, Balatro secured four major awards, including Game of the Year. It doesn’t come as much of a surprise, as the solo dev spectacle of a game has continued to take the world by storm since being released just over a year ago.</p>



<p>Astro Bot also secured multiple awards at the GDC ceremony, including Best Audio and Best Technology.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-gdc-awards-winners">All GDC Awards Winners</h2>



<p>GDC is getting bigger and brighter all the time, and it’s starting to rival Gamescom with how expansive it is. This year’s GDC Awards ceremony was a showstopper, with last year’s best games being showered with praise by attendees.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of winners from the GDC Awards:</p>



<ul>
<li>Game of the Year – Balatro</li>



<li>Best Audio – Astro Bot</li>



<li>Best Debut – Balatro</li>



<li>Best Design – Balatro</li>



<li>Best Narrative – Metaphor: ReFantazio</li>



<li>Best Technology – Astro Bot</li>



<li>Best Visual Art – Black Myth: Wukong</li>



<li>Audience Award – Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li>



<li>Innovation Award – Balatro</li>



<li>Lifetime Achievement Award – Sam Lake</li>



<li>Pioneer Award – Lucas Pope</li>



<li>Social Impact Award – Life is Strange: Double Exposure</li>
</ul>



<p>Recently, Balatro’s solo developer went on record with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/localthunk-the-balatro-timeline-solo-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a feature-length blog post</a> that explained what it took to bring Balatro to life. It was a tale of a stressful, strenuous journey that left his mental and physical health in tatters for a time, but it paid off when the game launched to an overwhelmingly positive reception and made $600,000 on Steam in ‘just a couple of hours’.</p>



<p>The GDC Awards represents one of the last awards shows dedicated to 2024’s spread of games. With that buttoned up, we can now look to 2025’s best games, which have already started emerging. I’m willing to bet that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> will secure more than a few awards as the year unravels.</p>
