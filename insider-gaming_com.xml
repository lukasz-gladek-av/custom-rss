<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has opened up all manner of possibilities for gamers and Nintendo itself. With Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 being one of 2025’s biggest and best games, it would only be fitting if the Switch 2 could welcome the GOTY contender onto the console.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-teases-new-content-and-other-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> could already be 2025’s Game of the Year. That’s how revered and successful it is. It’s the highest-rated release this year, and a wider reach could introduce even more players to its unreal world. While it’s anything but official, a new quote from its developer suggests all hope isn’t lost.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It would look good. Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.nintenderos.com/nintendo-switch-2/sandfall-interactive-esta-explorando-lanzar-clair-obscur-expedition-33-en-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintenderos</a> has reported that Sandfall Interactive isn’t ruling out bringing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to the Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>



<p>“We have some possibilities that we will explore, but at the moment we cannot confirm anything,” was the company’s official response when prompted by Nintederos on a Switch 2 port.</p>



<p>Reports are circulating that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/many-developers-still-dont-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many developers are struggling to get Switch 2 dev kits</a>. This understandably holds back many games and is likely to delay a ton of future third-party ports to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>With Sandfall not ruling out a Clair Obscur Switch 2 crossover, this could be the reason why an announcement is taking so long. We’ll keep you updated on the situation and developments on a future Switch 2 version.</p>



<p>Will you buy Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 if it arrives on Nintendo’s new hardware? Or are you busy and impatiently waiting for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-franchise-sandbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel</a>?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-hints-that-metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-was-unfinished/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-hints-that-metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-was-%E2%80%98unfinished%E2%80%99.1287243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain is likely going to go down as Hideo Kojima’s final-ever MGS title. The director has since moved on to create Kojima Productions, but an interesting social media post from him seemingly reaffirms a long-standing theory.</p>



<p>The Phantom Pain is still an unbelievable <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid</a> game. Its open nature and complete freedom and flexibility to complete MGS missions in all-new ways were another evolutionary step forward for the series. If you’ve played it, though, you’ll know the game’s final official moments are abrupt and, dare I say, unfinished?</p>







<figure><figcaption>We nearly had it all. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-written-concept-death-stranding-3-wont-make/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> has been quick to distance himself from his former work in recent times—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wont-play-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he won’t play Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. After all, why wouldn’t he? <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-tops-uk-physical-sales-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2</a> is another acclaimed piece of media, and Kojima is busy working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojimas-od-is-reportedly-safe-from-recent-xbox-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OD</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Physint</a>.</p>



<p>But a September 3 post from Kojima seems to highlight and double down on the notion that Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain was incomplete when it was released. Kojima natively posted an article by <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/metal-gear-solid-v-phantom-pain-hideo-kojima-anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inverse</a> to his X account: “10 Years Later, Hideo Kojima’s Unfinished Masterpiece Is Still Influencing Games Today.”</p>



<p>This is likely Kojima hinting at the theory that a whole chapter was missing at the end of The Phantom Pain. Kojima and Konami infamously fell out toward the end of The Phantom Pain’s development, and necessary missions and storytelling ended up on the cutting-room floor.</p>



<p>The Phantom Pain’s original Collector’s Edition notoriously featured concept art and footage of the unfinished episode, which supposedly wrapped up the game’s story. To this day, The Phantom Pain is considered an incomplete and unfinished game, which is unfortunate, as it’s probably the last piece of Kojima-created MGS content we’ll ever get.</p>







<p>Do you still enjoy The Phantom Pain even with its missing content? Are you still hoping and praying that Kojima makes another MGS title one day? Let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-beaten-to-steam-arena-breakout-infinite/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-is-being-beaten-to-the-steam-launch-punch-by-its-number-one-rival.1287201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov is coming to Steam later this year, but in a new announcement, it was confirmed that it’s being beaten to the punch by its number-one competitor, Arena Breakout: Infinite. In a post on Steam, the Arena Breakout team confirmed that on September 15, ABI will hit Steam, delivering a free-to-play extraction experience to many expectant fans.</p>



<p>This does mean that those interested in extraction shooters have a couple of months to try out Arena Breakout: Infinite before Escape from Tarkov hits Steam at some point this year, after the game’s 1.0 release on November 15.</p>



<h2 id="h-arena-breakout-infinite-heads-to-steam">Arena Breakout: Infinite Heads to Steam</h2>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite has been playable for quite some time, but fans have had to use a proprietary launcher offered by MoreFun, the game’s developer. With ABI coming to Steam on September 15, one of the most popular and free extraction shooters is set to hit an entirely new audience.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Arena Breakout: Infinite is in eighth place on the Steam wishlists chart, sitting just behind ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 but ahead of Dying Light: The Beast and ARK 2.</p>



<p>It has more than <strong>two million wishlist spots</strong>. Escape from Tarkov’s Steam page isn’t yet live, so it has <strong>zero</strong>.</p>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite has managed to keep a core audience pleased over the last year or so, with MoreFun rolling out constant updates, including new maps, modes, weapons, and various collaborations. In July, the studio pushed out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinites-cyberpunk-2077-crossover-introduces-new-events-weapon-skins-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Cyberpunk 2077 crossover</a> that few people saw coming.</p>



<p>I sat down with MoreFun Studios at Gamescom 2024 to learn about some critical aspects of the game. I was interested in their rationale around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-offline-mode-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having no ‘offline mode’</a>, and learned more about their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-facul/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revolutionary AI NPCs</a> that could understand live voice commands.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073620/view/496079294980687187?l=english&amp;curator_clanid=3693985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Steam</a>, MoreFun promoted the game with every ounce of pulling power possible, flexing everything available in the game when it hits full release on the platform in just a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>It might have been seen as a carbon copy for a while, and even came under fire from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-dev-arena-plagiarism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlestate Games for alleged plagiarism</a>, but Arena Breakout: Infinite has managed to hold its own over the last year or so. It looks superb on the surface, has plenty of meat on the bones, and despite some sketchy microtransactions, is <strong>free to play</strong>, and that’s a huge advantage.</p>



<p>Will you be picking up Arena Breakout: Infinite on Steam when it drops on September 15? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The most prominent Resident Evil leaker has doubled down on the claim that Resident Evil Requiem will release on Nintendo Switch 2 and PlayStation 4, albeit with a version that has some reduced visual effects. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about this, but with new power behind the claim, Dusk Golem has stressed that ‘five different people’ have corroborated this with them.</p>



<p>Fans are sceptical about Resident Evil Requiem dropping on PlayStation 4, but for the most part, they’re welcoming the Switch 2 release claims with open arms.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-resident-evil-requiem-coming-to-ps4">Is Resident Evil Requiem Coming to PS4?</h2>



<p>In a post <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963020567076077587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a>, Dusk Golem bolstered their claim that Resident Evil Requiem, which is shaping up to be one of 2026’s most highly anticipated titles, is coming to PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I won’t beat around the bush, Resident Evil Requiem should be releasing in PlayStation 4 &amp; Nintendo Switch 2, seems this was kinda’ known behind the scenes &amp; in the grapevine. I’m not the first person to say this publicly actually, just corroborating. </p>



<p>Talked about it with five different people in the last few weeks and know another guy with a good reputation said as much less than a week ago. </p>



<p>So not from me, but I have been hearing the same thing. Unsure if it’ll be at launch, and my guess is it’ll be a different version with different tech, sorta’ like the 360/PS3 &amp; Wii/PS2 era, since some features of Requiem like ray tracing are focused on modern platforms. But if the question is, is it happening or not, the answer pretty much is, yeah it’s happening.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth highlighting a few critical points about this post before going any further. While reputable, Dusk Golem stresses that much of this post is <strong>guesswork </strong>and that the ultimate delivery is built on a foundation of ‘<strong>pretty much</strong>‘.</p>



<p>Users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n6zqzw/dusk_golem_doubles_down_on_resident_evil_requiem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Reddit</a> were quick to pick up this comment and try to rationalize it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Capcom’s president said that the price point of PS5 (in Japan, but he also mentions others regions) is a “barrier” for (people to buy) Monster Hunter Wilds. He also said Switch 2 reception was ahead of their predictions.</p>



<p>It’s not so hard to guess that a PS4 or Switch 2 port is coming after that.</p>



<p>But yeah, still crazy see publishers aiming games for PS4 while we see rumors about PS6.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On August 20, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new gameplay surfaced online</a>, showcasing the stunning visuals present in Resident Evil Requiem, which was revealed in June during Summer Game Fest.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-camp-revamp-update-notes-new-season-22-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-76-c-a-m-p-revamp-adds-long-awaited-features-to-build-mode.1287177/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout 76 continues to live its best life, with Bethesda Game Studios pouring updates into the MMORPG ecosystem and fleshing out the post-apocalyptic landscape that joined the franchise way back in 2018. The latest update, C.A.M.P. Revamp, adds new build rules, a reworked UI, item locking, and introduces Season 22: Appalachian Modern Living.</p>



<p>This supersized update (1.7.21.25) is available to download now, and it’s set to change how you build C.A.M.P.s in Bethesda’s popular open-world multiplayer shooter that was, once upon a time, hugely divisive. It’s now the number-one played major Fallout game, how about that?</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-76-update-1-7-21-25-notes-in-full">Fallout 76 Update 1.7.21.25 Notes in Full</h2>



<p>In a post <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1962933445375480295" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a>, the team at Bethesda Game Studios outlined everything added in the C.A.M.P. Revamp update.</p>



<p>I have to lead with this, as I’m particularly excited about it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Snapping Items</strong></p>



<p>Items can still snap together in the way that they used to, but now items that used to require snapping are allowed to not snap. Over-snapping your walls to get wallpaper on both sides is also possible now. Walls can also be built beneath the floor, and upper floors can be attached to walls without the need for a staircase.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you know how insane it is that we can now add wallpaper to <strong>both sides of the wall?</strong> That has been a bugbear for me since day dot, and I’m so happy it has now finally been resolved.</p>



<p>Players will now also be able to alter the rules that control their C.A.M.P. builds, choosing between three new options:</p>



<ul>
<li>Snap Mode (Normal) – Place items the way you’re used to.</li>



<li>Collision Mode – Items will not auto-snap but will consider collisions.</li>



<li>Free Mode – No snapping and no collisions.</li>
</ul>



<p>Placement restrictions have also been opened up, which means that players can make some items float or break the rules of physics to create more interesting, free-flowing builds. Foundations have also been adjusted so that items that <strong>used to require </strong>them no longer will.</p>



<p>Before we go any further, here are the update sizes for 1.7.21.25:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PC (Steam)</strong>: 9.9 GB</li>



<li><strong>PC (Microsoft Store)</strong>: 23 GB</li>



<li><strong>Xbox</strong>: 26.4 GB</li>



<li><strong>PlayStation</strong>: 25.6 GB</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-workshop-2-0-explained">Workshop 2.0 Explained</h3>



<p>Fallout 76 now has ‘Workshop 2.0’ in this latest update:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Coming along in this update is a complete rework of the Workshop menu! With a refreshed focus on findability and organization, this new UI should make it a lot easier for you to get to the items you need. We’ve been testing this internally and are excited for you to get your hands on it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This update incorporates a stack of new categories and subcategories, and there are <strong>dozens </strong>of them to make searching for and controlling furniture and item types a more granular process.</p>



<p>The modify menu has also received a sizeable facelift, with edit mode, wallpapers, locks, and blueprints all being overhauled. The team has also added a ‘Replace’ mode, which allows you to swap placed items without needing to scrap and rebuild them. Again, that’s a lifesaver for avid C.A.M.P. builders.</p>



<h2 id="h-elsewhere-in-the-season-22-update">Elsewhere in the Season 22 Update</h2>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios also added Item Locking as part of the update that introduces Season 22: Appalachian Modern Living:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Say <strong>NO</strong> to accidental scrapping because you can now protect your favorite items by locking them!</p>



<p>Lock your weapons, lock your armor, lock your Power Armor. Heck, you can even lock your meds too!</p>



<p>This new feature will prevent locked items from being sold, scrapped, traded, and even dropped. Item Locking has been a long-requested quality-of-life request from many in the community. We’re really excited about bringing this feature to you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On October 7, ‘Mischief Night’ returns to Appalachia, and the arrival of Season 22 brings about changes to combat, manual aim, V.A.T.S., weapon mods, and perks. There’s so much to learn about these combat changes that Bethesda penned <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/3T4SEomfktJyMolMvpvUp5/fallout-76-c-a-m-p-revamp-combat-release-notes-full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an entirely separate blog post</a>.</p>



<p>I can’t stress how huge this update is. It impacts everything from fishing (added in Gone Fission), world events, creatures, skill books, outfits, and food. It’s super sizeable, but it’s still not the ‘biggest update ever’ that Bethesda has been touting for a while.</p>

<p>Stellar Blade was one of the standout titles of 2024, emerging as a new IP with fantastic combat mechanics and an intriguing story. It also helped that the protagonist, Eve, was able to lure in many gamers on account of her character model being just a little bit scandalous.</p>



<p>Insane body model aside, Stellar Blade represented something fresh and energetic, and it offered intense boss battles, a killer soundtrack, and a lot of meat on the bones, enough to keep gamers occupied for many hours.</p>



<p>Now, a sequel has been confirmed as being in development.</p>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-2-is-being-developed-by-shift-up">Stellar Blade 2 is Being Developed by Shift Up</h2>



<p>In a recent financial update, Shift Up confirmed that a sequel to 2024’s Stellar Blade is in active development. It was just a few <strong>weeks </strong>after the game was released that Shift Up announced an intention to make a sequel, but now those cogs are actively turning.</p>



<p>Here’s a snippet of that <a href="https://dart.fss.or.kr/dsaf001/main.do?rcpNo=20250814004388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">financial report</a>, translated by <a href="https://x.com/genki_jpn/status/1963102317886283809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki_JPN</a> on X:</p>

<p>We are actively pursuing the franchise development of the ‘Stellar Blade’ IP and are currently developing a sequel to ‘Stellar Blade’.</p>



<p>This sequel will inherit the action-packed nature of the original ‘Stellar Blade’ while incorporating an expanded worldview and enhanced gameplay, further solidifying its position as a franchise IP. We anticipate that this will result in even greater success than the original.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stellar Blade continued to be a rampant success this year, with Shift Up releasing the game on PC. The anticipation was so high that it hit one million sales <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-pc-hit-1-million-sales-faster-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">19 times faster</a> </strong>on PC than it did when it originally launched on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>It was also said earlier this year that the intention is to release a Stellar Blade sequel by 2027, so we won’t have to wait too long. Not only that, but Shift Up is considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-devs-are-considering-a-switch-2-port-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Switch 2 port</a> for the first Stellar Blade game.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade was one of my favorite games of 2024, which is strange, because the genre isn’t usually one that would attract me. I was won over by the post-apocalyptic setting, the accessible boss battles, and the plot. Definitely the plot.</p>

<p>Playing Borderlands 4 on a PC with the right requirements is likely going to be the best place to get the best graphical quality and performance when compared to consoles.</p>



<p>Luckily, games these days are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-borderlands-4-have-crossplay-split-screen-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to have crossplay</a>, so you don’t even need to force yourself to play on console with friends. All <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future content</a> within the game can be accessed at your desk without any issue, provided your setup can run it.</p>



<p>While the ceiling on AAA games being played on a PC is higher, there is also a lot more room for something to go wrong. In many cases where that happens, it has to do with players trying to run a game on hardware that just can’t handle it. Here are the minimum and recommended specs to play Borderlands 4 on PC.</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-minimum-system-requirements">Borderlands 4 Minimum System Requirements</h2>

<p>While not providing the unmatched amazing experience while playing the game, the Borderlands 4 minimum system requirements will let you play the game, hopefully with the least number of issues possible.</p>



<p>If you try to run the game with specs that fall below this, you may run into quite a few issues with loading times, freezing issues, crashes, and more. Here is what Gearbox on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> considers to be the minimum requirements to play Borderlands 4.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Minimum Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating System</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 64-bit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">100 GB available space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As long as your PC meets all of these requirements, you should be able to play Borderlands 4 with fewer issues holding you back. If you are unsure if you meet the criteria above, you can consider <a href="https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">using this tool </a>to help you understand. If you think you do meet the minimum, but things aren’t working, try updating your graphics drivers.</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-recommended-system-requirements">Borderlands 4 Recommended System Requirements</h2>



<p>As you might expect, the specs definitely take a step forward for the recommended hardware to play Borderlands 4. These are the things that will help your experience on PC outperform those who are playing on a console.</p>



<p>Below are the recommended system requirements for Borderlands 4 on PC.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Recommended Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating System</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 64-bit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">32 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">100 GB available space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>With the above, you should not experience many issues at all when playing Borderlands 4 on your PC. You might not be blowing away the competition, but you can<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-pitchford-nervous-challenge-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> definitely take on difficult enemies</a> and gather all the loot they leave on the ground with the confidence that you’re not seconds away from an unexpected crash.</p>
