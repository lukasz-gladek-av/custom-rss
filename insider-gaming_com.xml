<p>The internet’s social corners are ablaze following a recent claim from Dr Disrespect that he was invited to play Highguard alongside Wildlight Entertainment in Los Angeles. The ‘Two Time’ posted an image on social media of an ID card from the recent event and directly stated he’d taken ‘the Lambo to LA’ to play Highguard.</p>



<p>Even though it took literal seconds to figure out Dr Disrespect’s image was a fake, likely manufactured by the same folks who make his streamer art, some have <strong>boycotted Highguard </strong>because of this impossible collaboration.</p>







<h2 id="h-dr-disrespect-fakes-highguard-invite">Dr Disrespect Fakes Highguard Invite</h2>



<p>On January 24, Dr Disrespect posted an image on social media of his desk, some streaming and gaming equipment, and an ID card that marked him as an attendee to the recent Highguard event in Los Angeles. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It was a staging ground for Wildlight to showcase the all-new shooter in full to a wide audience of streamers, creators, pro gamers, and influencers, and some folks believed that Dr Disrespect also went.</p>



<p>When the image cropped up on social media, it took some who <strong>were </strong>in attendance mere seconds to debunk the image, simply by showing their own, legitimate passes, and pointing out the inaccuracies. But that wasn’t enough for the detritus of those social circles that avoid using logic and reasoning to solve something cryptic.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many took to those same social circles to slam Wildlight for associating with a creator with Dr Disrespect’s reputation. Anyone even remotely interested in the creator space knows about the recent controversies that the scandalous streamer found himself embroiled in over the last couple of years.</p>



<p>Now, the Creator Manager for Highguard at Wildlight Entertainment, Chin, has <a href="https://x.com/thingscp/status/2015884206329463060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a definitive comment</a> on social media, further debunking the image:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hey there! I’m Chin, the Creator Manager for Highguard / Wildlight and I can confirm DDR was not invited to any Highguard event past or present, and the badge was not an official badge.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, no, Dr Disrespect did not jet off to Los Angeles to play Highguard with everyone else. He is <strong>streaming </strong>the game as this article is being written, but that’s the closest to it he’ll ever be.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-battle-pass-free-war-chest/</link>
            <guid>1416853</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can’t have a new live-service game without a Battle Pass, and Highguard doesn’t advertise a properly labeled Battle Pass, to an extent. This guide covers how to get a free War Chest and how it relates to Highguard. </p>



<p>Everyone gets the ick at the mention of a Battle Pass due to the negative connotations. However, if something is free to play, it’s going to have a Battle Pass, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-file-sizes-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> complicates things with its War Chest system.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-highguard-have-a-battle-pass">Does Highguard Have A Battle Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get playing. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard has a fully fledged Battle Pass system under the guise of a War Chest.</strong></p>



<p>Same thing, different name. A War Chest is the name for the game’s Battle System. It has the Pages system that Fortnite and others have adopted in recent years, allowing you to have more freedom in how you accumulate Highguard rewards.</p>



<p>Each reward requires so much <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-highguard-currencies-how-many-are-there-how-to-earn-how-they-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard currency</a>, and they include the usual slew of live-service cosmetics: Skins, weapons makeovers, customizable player profile items, and more. Subsequent War Chests will presumably require real money or acquired in-game currency, but not the first one.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-free-war-chest-in-highguard">How To Claim Free War Chest In Highguard</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Generous. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You need to go into the Highguard Store, click on War Chest, and claim your free Battle Pass.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick step-by-step guide on what to do:</p>



<ol>
<li>Load up Highuard.</li>



<li>Go to the main menu.</li>



<li>Make sure you’re on the tabs at the top.</li>



<li>Cycle across to <strong>Store</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on <strong>Inspect War Chest</strong> in the corner.</li>



<li>Claim the War Chest.</li>



<li>You now have a free Battle Pass for Highguard Episode 1.</li>
</ol>



<p>The first War Chest has a total of 44 items to claim. Goodies vary in terms of rarity, and they’re spread across ‘4 Chapters.’ You need to play matches and rack up a serious amount of Vigil Tokens—which are used in exchange for the rewards found in the War Chest.</p>



<p>It’s expected that future War Chests will follow a similar format, unless there’s stern opposition from the Highguard community.</p>



<p>Will you endeavour to complete the first-ever Highguard War Chest, AKA Battle Pass? Or do you think the rewards are a complete waste of time and not worth the effort? Head to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> and let us know how’d you rate the content on a scale of 1-10. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The marketing train is in full swing for WWE 2K26. Not only have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-king-of-kings-edition-cover-features-triple-h/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various editions</a> of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game been revealed</a> in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-reveals-monday-night-war-edition-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent days</a>, but it’s now known when the game will release as well as some of the platforms.</p>



<p>According to known <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/wwe-2k26-switch-2-plateformes-date-de-sortie-ce-que-lon-sait-60917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Billbil-kun</a>, WWE 2K26 will launch on Friday, March 13. According to the report, the game will release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2. </p>







<p>Insider Gaming can corroborate the Switch 2 plans. The game is also expected to be a game-key card, should you get the physical version of the game on the system.</p>



<p><strong>UPDATE 4:27pm ET: </strong>Billbil-kun has confirmed to Insider Gaming that it IS coming to PC.</p>



<h2 id="h-last-gen-and-pc-status-remain-unknown">Last Gen and PC Status Remain Unknown</h2>



<p>There was no confirmation regarding the game’s availability on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. There was also no mention of WWE 2K26 on PC in Billbil-kun’s report.</p>



<p>Last year’s was available on the platform, but it was treated as a last-gen version of the game, meaning it didn’t include The Island. Also like</p>



<p>As far as what to expect from this year’s game, Insider Gaming was the first outlet to exclusively report that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CM Punk will be the feature superstar</a> for the game’s Showcase Mode. WWE 2K26 will also see the addition and return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four match types</a>, including a highly requested return.</p>







<p>The game will also feature the draft in Universe mode, intergender matches in MyFaction, shopping carts to use during matches, an overhauled reversal system, and more.</p>



<p>Pre-orders for WWE 2K26 open on January 30. More information and impressions on the game are expected to come in February after the invite-only creator event. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-highguard-currencies-how-many-are-there-how-to-earn-how-they-work/</link>
            <guid>1416802</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a common trend in multiplayer games to have numerous currencies, and Highguard appears to be no different. As soon as you load into the game, you’ll see a selection of small symbols at the top right of your screen, indicating how much of each currency you own. </p>



<p>The thing is, when you’re loading into a new game like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-2026-roadmap-all-episode-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> for the first time, the whole experience can be overwhelming, and the last thing you want to figure out is which currencies can be spent where, let alone how to earn them!</p>







<p>Luckily for you, Insider Gaming has you covered, as in this guide, you’ll find out everything you need to know about Highguard’s various currencies. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-currencies-are-in-highguard">How Many Currencies Are In Highguard?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There are already plenty of bundles in the store. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are three currencies in Highguard, and each one has its own unique purpose. </strong></p>



<p>The currencies in question are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Highguard Gold</li>



<li>Warden Credits</li>



<li>Vigil Tokens</li>
</ul>



<p>As is often the case, these currencies have their own rules: each one can only be spent in certain ways, they cannot be interchanged between one another, and they’re all earned in their own unique way. </p>



<p>But don’t worry, there’s no need for confusion, as Insider Gaming have broken down each currency for your convenience.</p>



<h2 id="h-highguard-gold-explained">Highguard Gold, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The bundles don’t come cheap. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard Gold is the premium currency of Highguard. It is used to purchase War Chests and Store Cosmetics.</strong></p>



<p>The main way to earn <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-highguard-launch-day-content-maps-content-weapons-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> Gold is through direct in-game microtransactions, with the prices shown above in GBP. As things stand, there are no other ways to earn the currency.</p>



<p>It’d be great to see it available through other means in the future, either via War Chests or perhaps even Ranked rewards, as plenty of other live-service games offer their premium currency as in-game rewards. Until then, though, if you see something you fancy in the store, you’re going to need to pull out the wallet.</p>



<h2 id="h-warden-credits-explained">Warden Credits, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Some simple cosmetics are on offer. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Warden Credits are used to purchase cosmetics from the Trading Post, an in-game store that rotates its stock weekly.</strong></p>



<p>The Trading Post is similar to the Store, except it offers a smaller variety of cosmetics that can be earned without the need for microtransactions. That’s because Warden Credits can be earned in-game, either by completing challenges or simply playing games.</p>







<p>However, if you’re managing to accrue a lot of them, be warned, as Warden Credits are capped at 10,000. Once you hit this upper limit, you’ll stop storing them in the bank, so be sure to spend them!</p>



<h2 id="h-vigil-tokens-explained">Vigil Tokens, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Similar to a battle pass. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Finally, there’s Vigil Tokens. These are used to purchase items in War Chests, which are packed with various cosmetics.</strong></p>



<p>The primary way to earn these Vigil Tokens is simply by playing matches. The more you play, the more you’ll earn, so it’s a great incentive to reward regular players with some high-tier cosmetic items.</p>



<p>Similar to the Warden Credits, though, there’s an upper limit to how many you can hold onto. 3,000 is the maximum amount of Vigil Tokens you can have at one time, so once again, be sure to spend them when you get them!</p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Highguard is finally here, and after a long month of waiting and speculating, we finally know what the game is about. Not only do we know how the game plays, but we also know what it’s launching with, and it’s a whole lot of content. </p>



<p>For live-service games like Highguard intends to be, it’s important to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-2026-roadmap-all-episode-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep content pouring in</a>. However, if there isn’t enough to start with, then players won’t have anything to get hooked to.</p>







<p>It doesn’t seem like Highguard will have that issue, as there’s a wealth of content to explore at launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-wardens-amp-mounts-available-for-highguard-launch">All Wardens &amp; Mounts Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who is your pick? Image by Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are eight Wardens to choose from, each with their own abilities and skills, as well as three different Mounts. More are scheduled to come with future content updates.</strong></p>



<p>It looks like there’s a nice variety of Wardens to choose from in Highguard, with five playstyles seemingly catered for with their classes. There are three Assault and two Defensive Wardens, making them the most common class at launch.</p>



<p>The eight Wardens available at launch in Highguard are:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Warden Name</th><th data-align="center">Warden Class</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Redmane</td><td data-align="center">Destruction</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Condor</td><td data-align="center">Recon</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Atticus</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kai</td><td data-align="center">Defensive</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mara </td><td data-align="center">Support</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Una </td><td data-align="center">Defensive</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Scarlet</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Slade</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The three Mounts available at launch in Highguard are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Horse</li>



<li>Panther</li>



<li>Bear</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-all-maps-amp-bases-available-for-highguard-launch">All Maps &amp; Bases Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Explore before the sword falls. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five maps to play at launch for Highguard, with a roster of six Bases to select from each match.</strong></p>



<p>Wildlight Entertainment describe the Maps and Bases very distinctly. The Maps are more open-world environments full of loot and gear to collect, whilst the Bases are smaller, typical FPS-style areas that offer more close-quarters combat. It looks set to offer diverse gameplay scenarios, and it’s notably different from other titles in the genre.</p>







<p>Here’s all five Maps available at launch in Highguard: </p>



<ul>
<li>Dustline</li>



<li>Kingdom</li>



<li>Rivermark</li>



<li>Summit</li>



<li>Vesper City</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-all-weapons-available-for-highguard-launch">All Weapons Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A solid selection. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Ten Primary Weapons are available at launch in Highguard, with three Raid Weapons up for selection too—and don’t forget your Melee Axe!</strong></p>



<p>That makes a total of 14 weapons in Highguard, with plenty more bound to arrive across the year. It’s a simple but healthy selection that should hopefully see balancing not become an issue so early in the game’s lifecycle. </p>



<p>Here’s all 14 weapons available at launch in Highguard:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Weapon Name</th><th data-align="center">Weapon Type</th><th data-align="center">Weapon Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Corsair</td><td data-align="center">SMG</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kraken</td><td data-align="center">Pump-Action Shotgun</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Paladin</td><td data-align="center">Full-Auto Shotgun</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Viper</td><td data-align="center">SMG</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vanguard</td><td data-align="center">Assault Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Big Rig</td><td data-align="center">LMG</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Dynasty</td><td data-align="center">Assault Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Saber Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Burst Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Longhorn</td><td data-align="center">Revolver</td><td data-align="center">Marksman</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Ranger</td><td data-align="center">Bolt-Action Sniper</td><td data-align="center">Marksman</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Blast Hammer</td><td data-align="center">Sledgehammer</td><td data-align="center">Raid</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Zipline</td><td data-align="center">Utility</td><td data-align="center">Raid</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rocket Launcher</td><td data-align="center">Rocket Launcher</td><td data-align="center">Raid</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Axe</td><td data-align="center">Axe</td><td data-align="center">Melee</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Developer Wildlight Entertainment went big with a year-long 2026 roadmap for Highguard. It features information on each episode and what to expect from every batch of new content: Each includes a new Warden and much more.</p>



<p>The time for talking is over as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-highguard-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> is out now. Geoff Keighley bigged it up as the second coming of Apex Legends and Titanfall, and it’s not bad at all. If you think Highguard’s base-raiding action is something that’ll keep you gripped for a while, then you need the full 2026 roadmap hub bookmarked for the good times ahead.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-1-2026-roadmap-content-explained">Highguard Episode 1 2026 Roadmap Content, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shoot to kill. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Highguard Episode 1 is the launch-day content. You obviously need content to get a game going, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-is-finally-getting-a-gameplay-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay showcase</a> revealed the shooter’s first Wardens, maps, guns, and the rest of the glitz and glamour for opening day:</p>

<li>6 Bases</li>



<li>8 Wardens</li>



<li>3 Mounts</li>



<li>10 Weapons</li>



<li>3 Raid Tools</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-2-2026-roadmap-content-february-to-march">Highguard Episode 2 2026 Roadmap Content—February to March</h2>



<p>Following up on the launch episode is Episode 2, and this one debuts a fresh Warden, map, and Ranked Mode. Here’s the full list of content announced:</p>

<li>New Map</li>



<li>Ranked Mode</li>



<li>New Mount</li>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-3-2026-roadmap-content-april-to-may">Highguard Episode 3 2026 Roadmap Content—April to May</h2>



<p>You’re going to see a familiar theme with a lot of this content as we go. The character selection screen will become more full, and the meta will be shaken up with a new weapon:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Weapon</li>



<li>New Mods</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Loot Item</li>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-4-2026-roadmap-content-june-to-july">Highguard Episode 4 2026 Roadmap Content—June to July</h2>



<p>The biggest addition in Episode 4’s content (featuring the tropical months of the year!) is a new Limited-Time Mode. There aren’t many mentions of LTMs in the 2026 roadmap, so it’ll be interesting to see what the new mode is:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Map</li>



<li>New Weapon</li>



<li>New Mods</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Limited-Time Mode</li>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-5-2026-roadmap-content-august-to-september">Highguard Episode 5 2026 Roadmap Content—August to September</h2>



<p>Episode 5 looks like a standard couple of months of new content. New additions to many of the Highguard’s core components await:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Weapon</li>



<li>New Mount</li>



<li>New Mods</li>



<li>New Base</li>

<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-6-2026-roadmap-content-october-to-november">Highguard Episode 6 2026 Roadmap Content—October to November</h2>



<p>We’re getting the word, ‘Surprise.’ Given that it falls during Episode 6 and the Halloween season, it’s reasonable to assume the community is getting special spooky surprises, events, and costume tie-ins. Will Highguard do crossovers? We’ll have to see, check out the haul:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Map</li>



<li>New Weapon</li>



<li>Surprise</li>



<li>New Mods</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Amulets</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-7-2026-roadmap-content-december">Highguard Episode 7 2026 Roadmap Content—December</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big 12 months awaits. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Rounding off Highguard’s first year is a rather sparse Episode 7, but more details are sure to be revealed closer to the time. A Winter-themed event and content are expected, and it carries on the tradition of a new Warden every Episode:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>Surprise</li>



<li>New Mods</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s always an element of unpredictability with a new live-service game. Highguard looks the part, but it remains to be seen if it can maintain its player base.

<p>Triple H is on the cover of the Deluxe Edition of WWE 2K26.</p>



<p>2K Games announced on Twitter that Paul “Triple H” Levesque would be featured on the cover of the Deluxe Edition, dubbed the “King of Kings Edition,” for the upcoming WWE 2K26 game. </p>



<p>A two-time WWE Hall of Famer, Triple H has appeared in every WWE video game since his debut in WWF In Your House, the 1996 title released for the original PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC.</p>



<p>Over the years, he has also been a frequent cover star, starting with WWF Attitude in 1999. Iconic games such as WWE SmackDown: Shut Your Mouth, WWE Day of Reckoning, and WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 also feature “The Game” on the cover art. However, this cover is historic for the “King of Kings” because it marks the first time he has been featured solo.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-this-is-not-the-only-cover-of-wwe-2k26-featuring-triple-h">This Is Not the Only Cover of WWE 2K26 Featuring Triple H</h2>



<p>As announced on January 23, WWE 2K26 will also have a special <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Attitude Era edition</a>. The cover art for that edition features many WWE legends from the late 1990s and early 2000s. Triple H was also on the cover. He was featured in the trailer alongside Shawn Michaels, Chyna, and the other members of D-Generation X.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-reveals-monday-night-war-edition-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE also announced a Monday Night War Edition of WWE 2K26. </a>Triple H appears on the cover, representing WWE alongside Steve Austin, Undertaker, The Rock, Chyna, and Kurt Angle. He also appeared in the trailer for this edition, which focuses largely on the promotional rivalry between WWE and WCW that dominated the late ’90s and catapulted wrestling to a new level of popularity and success.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-will-bring-back-classic-match-types-familiar-to-longtime-triple-h-fans">WWE 2K26 Will Bring Back Classic Match Types Familiar to Longtime Triple H Fans</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As first reported by Insider Gaming,</a> WWE 2K26 is expanding its gameplay offerings with four new playable match types. The game introduces the Dumpster Match for the first time while bringing back the Inferno Match, I Quit Match, and 3 Stages of Hell. Triple H has a history of competing in all three returning gimmick matches. Plus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-island-returns-wwe-2k26-new-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Island</a> will make its return this year, featuring a completely new storyline.</p>







<p>As of now, 2K Games has not announced any specific DLC coming to this year’s game. However, on January 24, WWE confirmed that the Monday Night War Edition will provide access to the most content.</p>



<p>Pre-orders begin on January 30. However, there’s currently no set release date or price point. Recent WWE 2K games have released in March. Insider Gaming will keep you up-to-date with the latest WWE 2K26 news.</p>

<p>Highguard is here, and it seems to be a hit – at least, at first. It has been released by Wildlight Entertainment just a few weeks after the first trailer for the game was dropped at The Game Awards in December. This ‘new breed of shooter’ promises to be a stacked free-to-play title, and Wildlight has wasted no time publishing a year-long roadmap for the game.</p>



<p>What’s more impressive is that, within a single hour of being released, the game skyrocketed to half a million concurrent viewers between Twitch and YouTube, and the number is rapidly growing.</p>

<p>Highguard was always going to be one of those games that pulled in viewers, given how much mystery the title was shrouded in ahead of release. It was put on a pedestal by Geoff Keighley during The Game Awards, and critics everywhere already declared it a write-off because it bore similarities to other, failed games.</p>



<p>Now that it has been released worldwide, it’s pulling in some remarkable figures. Between Twitch and YouTube (at the time of writing), Highguard had secured a concurrent viewer count of 480,000 users. It rapidly overtook every game on <strong>both platforms </strong>to secure their respective top spots.</p>



<p>The player count on Steam also climbed at a rapid pace. One hour after launch, almost 100,000 concurrent users were logged in and playing, and that’s while half the world was still at work on a Monday afternoon, and the other half was fast asleep.</p>



<p>Nobody anticipated Highguard to come out of the gate with such strength, but it’s a testament to the hold-out-and-hope marketing model that Wildlight Entertainment employed ahead of the game’s release.</p>
