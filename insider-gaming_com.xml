<p>Take-Two Interactive has confirmed that a new PGA Tour 2K game, likely PGA Tour 2K25, is scheduled to be released in Q4 2025.</p>



<p>The reveal came towards the of the company’s Q2 2025 earnings call on November 6.</p>







<p>“So for Q4, yes, you’re right, we have [Civilization] seven releasing,” Take-Two Interactive CFO Lainie Goldstein said in a response to a question about bookings growth for FY Q4 2025. “We also have our PGA title releasing in the quarter and our WWE title. And last year, we only had our WWE title.”</p>



<p>No other information was given about the next game in the franchise. It’s also unclear if this was an announcement that was supposed to be made or just a slip of the tongue.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Mike Straw had been reporting that the next game was well in development and was expected to release in 2025. Wednesday’s call seemingly confirmed that information.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Take-Two for more direct comment on the reveal from the earnings call. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

<p>Publisher Take-Two Interactive unveiled sales data for several of its big titles and franchises, including the entire Red Dead Redemption series, as part of its earnings call. You know, we’ve been quite curious about the Red Dead Redemption sales over the years, especially considering the sequel is often called one of the greatest single-player video games of all time. Well, now we know!</p>



<p>According to the earnings report, the entire Red Dead Redemption series has sold more than 92 million units to date. Red Dead Redemption 2, as expected, accounts for the vast majority of series sales, with more than 67 million units sold since launch.</p>



<p>As part of its announcement, Take-Two shared a few stats:</p>



<ul>
<li>Red Dead Redemption 2 is the second best-selling title in the U.S. in the past six years.</li>



<li>Red Dead Online launched as a standalone in 2020 but was included with every copy of Red Dead Redemption 2.</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare were re-released on PS4 and Nintendo Switch in August 2023 and PC in October 2024.</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite these obviously impressive sales numbers, we still have yet to hear about Red Dead Redemption 3. Is it happening? When?!</p>

<p>The Holidays are just around the corner, and with Christmas cheer comes family gaming time. Everyone loves to sit around an open fire and play video games with the family, but which games are best to play this Christmas?</p>



<p>Here are the top five best games to play with family at Christmas.</p>



<h2 id="h-top-video-games-to-play-with-family-at-christmas">Top Video Games to Play with Family at Christmas</h2>



<p>Do not get this list confused with the best Christmas games to play. This list solely is made up of the best multiplayer games to play with your family this Christmas.</p>



<p>While so many titles are out there waiting to be explored, there are a specific few that really hit the mark when looking for a family-fun game to play this Holiday season.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-all-lego-games">5. All LEGO Games</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>There are many different LEGO games out there, making it incredibly difficult to choose just one. However, all LEGO video games have a co-op mode, meaning you can explore the plot with another player.</p>



<p>And guess what? They are all family-friendly too! LEGO Star Wars, LEGO Batman and more all fit the bill as being some of the best games to play with family at Christmas. Whether you are looking for a galactic adventure or something else to sit down with your kids and play, any LEGO game should suffice.</p>



<p>LEGO games are also available on all consoles, including PlayStations, Xboxes and Nintendo Switches.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-4-minecraft">4. Minecraft</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another great game for the family to explore together is Minecraft. Not only is this game cheap, but it allows parents and kids to sit down and build entire worlds together. Explore your creativity with this game, building different landscapes the ways you want them.</p>



<p>Minecraft has been around for over a decade now, and still stands as one of the best multiplayer games out there, whether it is with friends or family.</p>



<p>This Christmas, though, anyone with a PC, Switch, Xbox or PS5 will be able to sit down and play this popular game together, making it the perfect video game for the Holidays.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-3-super-smash-bros-ultimate">3. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Need a game with a bit more action? Super Smash Bros. Ultimate takes all the famous Nintendo characters, allowing players to fight each other with them. Smash Bros has been around since the N64, being one of the most popular competitive games out there. The game is a Nintendo exclusive, though, so will only work on the Switch.</p>



<p>Still, this game is great for anyone, as you do not need too much knowledge to actually enjoy the fighting process. With maps resembling your favorite Nintendo character’s world, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will have any gamer excited.</p>



<p>While the game includes fighting, it is still toon-animated, meaning there is absolutely no blood or gore.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-2-mario-kart">2. Mario Kart</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Can’t have a list of games to play at Christmas with the family without including Mario Kart. With Mario Kart 8 Deluxe being the current Nintendo racing game on the Switch, families can jump in a vehicle and race each other just like back in the ’90s when the N64’s version was released.</p>



<p>The game even has a plethora of classic maps too for those who have not played the game in years to explore. Mario Kart has always amped up the action in every title Nintendo has released, making it one of the most popular multiplayer games in the world.</p>



<p>Mario Kart is perfect for anyone looking for a fun game to play with family during Christmas.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-1-mario-party">1. Mario Party</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>With the Nintendo Switch having a few versions of Mario Party for families to play, it is easily the best game to play with your loved ones this Christmas. With mini-games and more, this game is accessible to just about anyone, making it well worth the purchase if you do not have it yet.</p>



<p>With classic maps and new ones, Mario Party is basically a board game using classic Mario characters and more. At the end of each round, players compete against one another in different mini-games. Mario Party is just as much fun as it is competitive, making it the best game for families to play together at Christmas.</p>



<p>What game will you be playing this Christmas with your family?</p>

<p>Dota 2 is arguably the biggest esports in the world. With The International giving out millions of dollars every year, we have seen many new Dota players emerge into the scene. Dreaming of being one of those players? Well, you better start off playing ranked. </p>



<p>Here is a list of all the Dota 2 ranks.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-dota-2-ranks">All Dota 2 Ranks</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Herald</strong></li>



<li><strong>Guardian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Crusader</strong></li>



<li><strong>Archon</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legend</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ancient</strong></li>



<li><strong>Divine</strong></li>



<li><strong>Immortal</strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-in-dota-2-matchmaking-rating-mmr-explained">How to Rank Up in Dota 2 | Matchmaking Rating (MMR) Explained</h2>



<p>Hitting the rank of Immortal in Dota 2 is incredibly difficult for any competitor, even the best. The game’s ranking system follows a Matchmaking Rating (MMR) system, which grants players MMR as they progress through the ranks. </p>



<p>To rank up, players will have to participate in ranked matches, winning games and more. </p>



<h4 id="h-all-dota-2-ranks-and-their-mmr">All Dota 2 Ranks and Their MMR:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Herald:</strong> 1 – 769 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Guardian: </strong>770- 1539 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Crusader:</strong> 1540 – 2309 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Archon:</strong> 2310 – 3079 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Legend:</strong> 3080 – 3849 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Ancient:</strong> 3850 – 4619 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Divine:</strong> 4620 – 5620 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Immortal:</strong> 5620+ MMR.</li>
</ul>



<p>When first beginning to play ranked, new accounts will have their MMR calculated after playing a series of matches. They will then be put into rank and awarded their first medal. </p>



<p>No one, however, will start in Immortal. With each loss, you will lose MMR, potentially dropping in rank. However, those playing core roles in matches (carry, mid-lane) will receive more MMR per win than those playing support roles (off-lane, soft support, hard support).</p>



<p>All Ranks, excluding Immortal, are split up into five parts. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-ranked">What is ranked?</h2>



<p>Ranked play is a special competitive mode in Dota 2 (and many other games) where players compete against one another, climbing a specialized ranked system. While the actual ranked system does not reward players outside of in-game rewards and bragging rights, many pro players still make sure to flex their high ranks amongst others.</p>



<p>With Dota 2 having such a large skill gap, it can be incredibly difficult and daunting for new players to attempt an Immortal run, but it is still entirely possible.</p>



<p>Will you be attempting to hit the Immortal rank in Dota 2?</p>

<p>By now, we’ve all heard or witnessed the atrocity that they’re calling the Borderlands movie. It receives staggeringly low reviews from critics and viewers alike, with low single-digit ratings for the most part. But apparently, it wasn’t all bad. According to Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick, the live-action film didn’t hurt the video game franchise, but it actually helped significantly.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-borderlands-movie-was-disappointing-but-didnt-hurt-at-all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Zelnick said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Obviously that movie was disappointing. That said, it actually sold more catalog. So, I don’t think it hurt at all, if anything I think it may have helped a little bit. It does highlight something that I’ve spoken about many times which is the difficulty of bringing our intellectual property to another medium.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, by “catalog,” Zelnick refers to the collection of video games within the franchise, such as Borderlands 2, Tales From the Borderlands, and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. Essentially, the hype surrounding the film and people actually viewing it in theaters caused a significant rise in video game sales. People saw the movie, wanted more of the genuine article, and went to play the video games instead of re-watching the bomb film a second time. </p>



<p>If you saw the film and were one of the many who decided the video games were more your style, welcome! You should start by playing Borderlands 2, as it’s universally considered one of the best titles in the franchise. I didn’t mind the gameplay in Borderlands 3, but the writing and dialogue left me cringing more frequently than I’d typically like.</p>

<p>Take-Two Interactive held its earnings call for Q2 2025 on Wednesday, and with it came an update on the development of Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6.</p>



<p>In its <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/9aa55113-4f45-4264-8ff6-822353eddcd8">press release</a> for the earnings, it was said, once again, that the game will release in fall 2025. </p>







<p>The small update, which many won’t view as much of an update at all, continues the regular messaging from the company on the state of GTA 6. Over the last few months, Take-Two has continued to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-reaffirms-fall-2025-release-date-for-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaffirm people</a> that GTA 6 is scheduled for a fall 2025 release date. </p>



<p>As far as when a new trailer could be revealed, more details on the game’s features, or a more concrete release date announcement, the release didn’t mention that. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick didn’t provide any additional comment or context regarding the game’s release date or announcement plans during the actual call.</p>



<p>The first reveal of GTA 6 came <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-releases-gta-6-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly a year ago</a> when the first trailer was released. Since then, however, there’s been no update for a game that’s said to be a year away.</p>



<p>Do you still think GTA 6 will release in 2025? Join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>Following the closure of Roll7 and Intercept Games, Take-Two also revealed they sold off indie game publisher Private Division, but didn’t specify the buyer. Along with the sale of the company itself, Take-Two also sold off the publisher’s entire catalog of live and unreleased titles. However, they stated they would continue supporting No Rest for the Wicked, the recent Private Division-published action RPG from developer Moon Studios.</p>



<p>The publisher’s sale comes as part of the Take-Two earnings results, in which they said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are grateful for the contributions that the Private Division team has made to our company and are confident that they will continue to achieve success in their new home.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Supposedly, while the buyer remains unknown, a private equity firm did show interest in Private Division beforehand.</p>



<p>Private Division, as a publishing company, was behind multiple hit releases and upcoming games we had on our radar, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>No Rest for the Wicked</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tales of the Shire</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Outer Worlds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Kerbal Space Program 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>OlliOlliWorld</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hades</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>After 11 years, Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 5 continues to do well with players. Not only is it the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-stream-most-popular-in-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most popular game on stream</a>, but GTA 5’s sales continue to reach milestones.</p>



<p>During its <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest earnings call</a> on November 6, Take-Two Interactive announced that GTA 5 sales have passed 205 million copies in its 11-year lifespan. That total is up by five million from the 200 million copies announced during the company’s Q1 2025 earnings.</p>







<p>As a whole, the GTA franchise has sold over 435 million copies.</p>



<p>In addition to the sales success of GTA 5 and elsewhere, Take-Two praised GTA Online, which continued to be a major point for the company despite its age. According to the company, GTA Online continues to be one of the “largest contributors” to their net bookings despite expectations of a decline.</p>
