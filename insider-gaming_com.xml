<p>The Indie Game Awards took place on December 18, and, as many could assume, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-indie-game-awards-2025-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took home the awards</a> for Game of the Year and Debut Game. However, things have changed and The Indie Game Awards are making a big decision to strip the Clair Obscur and developer Sandfall Interactive of their awards over the use of gen AI in the game.</p>



<p>In an announcement made on Saturday afternoon, Six One Indie, the creators of the show, said that it’s removal comes after the discovery after voting was done, and the show was recorded.</p>







<p><strong>“The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself,”</strong> <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the statement reads</a>. <strong>“When it was submitted for consideration, representatives of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination.”</strong></p>



<p>Six One Indie ended by thanking the community for being patient and providing feedback on the situation.</p>



<p><strong>“The organizational team behind the ceremony is a small crew with big ambitions, and The Indie Game Awards can only grow with your help and support,”</strong> they said. <strong>“We already can’t wait for the 2026 ceremony!”</strong></p>







<p>With Clair Obscur’s disqualification, the awards will now go to the runner ups. That means the award for Debut Game goes to Sorry We’re Closed while Game of the Year now goes to Blue Prince.</p>
