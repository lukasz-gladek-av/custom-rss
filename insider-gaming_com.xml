            <guid>1422163</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>COR3CORP has released a first-look trailer for COR3, a mysterious sci-fi FPS that has <strong>some kind of tie </strong>to Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov. For more than a decade, Nikita Buyanov has been the head of the studio at Battlestate, spearheading the creation of Escape from Tarkov, arguably the most impactful extraction shooter ever made.</p>



<p>Despite being little more than a minute long, the first trailer for COR3 tells us plenty. It’s a first-person, sci-fi apocalypse title set on Mars. Or at least, that’s what we can glean from the minuscule look at the trailer, which you can see below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-cor3-and-why-is-it-exciting">What is COR3 and Why is it Exciting?</h2>



<p>COR3 is the first project <strong>not associated with Escape from Tarkov </strong>that Nikita Buyanov has touted for many years. In the run-up to the trailer being dropped, weeks of teasers, cryptic posts, and puzzling websites surfaced across social media.</p>



<p>Interested users were presented <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-dev-new-game-revealed-february-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with an interactive website</a> that offered lore and a bit of backstory behind COR3, which is what we <strong>assume to be </strong>the game’s title. That’s still unclear.</p>



<p>The website presented a post-apocalyptic environment, putting players in the shoes of an investigator with a few pieces of rudimentary equipment at their disposal, probing systems to solve minor, gamified puzzles. It’s steeped in mystery, and even though the first trailer has been released, <strong>nobody knows what on Earth (or Mars) they’re looking at</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for your perusal:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PRJRPNT_BLUEMARS_FO" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X9kqyqswsL8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>We’re calling it COR3 because that’s the only title we’ve been given thus far. But the name of the video is PRJRPNT_BLUEMARS_FO, which could be a nod to a potential title. Project Repent: Blue Mars?</p>



<p>It’s impossible to say at this point, as we have almost nothing to go on. It’s now time for internet sleuths to start probing the trailer for some sign of what comes next, as the site that was hosting the countdown to the trailer dropping now shows… Well, <strong>the trailer</strong>.</p>



<p>As the short video opens, we see a first-person perspective, quite reminiscent of Escape from Tarkov in how the character moves and interacts with their weapon, manufactured by ‘Kalash Corp’, and then the camera peels back from ‘Mariner City’ in a ruined state and scales back across Mars.</p>



<p>We go into the clouds, and then eventually into the cosmos, past a space elevator and beyond ruined ships, into the midst of cosmonauts adrift in the great beyond. It’s not ‘astronauts’ here, as the outfits the ill-fated space adventurers are wearing are unmistakably Russian in origin, emblazoned with a red star.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/vitality-push-bcgame-lower-bracket-iem-krakow/</link>
            <guid>1422076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>IEM Krakow yielded a long-awaited clash between BC.Game’s Oleksandr ‘s1mple’ Kostyliev and Vitality’s Mathieu ‘ZywOo’ Herbaut this weekend. It was the first time in almost three years that the pair had met on the competitive stage, and it ended with s1mple’s squad being forced unceremoniously into the lower bracket at IEM Krakow.</p>



<p>It was almost a predictable outcome, and it comes after s1mple declared ZywOo as being the closest Counter-Strike pro player to his own ‘prime’ status, back in the day.</p>







<h2 id="h-into-the-lower-run-for-bc-game">Into The Lower Run for BC.Game</h2>



<p>BC.Game opened the series against Vitality with the upper hand, but quickly faltered, with Vitality shutting the door on the team in rapid fashion. The ZywOo-led squad dropped just <strong>one round </strong>before closing out the map in the second half, going on to eliminate BCG from the upper bracket with a decisive 13-5 finish.</p>



<p>Both ZywOo and s1mple held their own, with the former edging out the latter in the numbers, but it’s a team game at the end of the day, and Vitality was the better unit on stage.</p>



<p>Before IEM Krakow, the two superstar competitors hadn’t met since Gamers8 in 2023, hosted in Saudi Arabia. The event has long since been rebranded as the Esports World Cup, but it was the last time that the two gamers shared a stage on opposing sides of the table.</p>



<p>Despite the loss, BC.Game’s journey in Krakow is far from over. They’re now in the lower bracket of their group, and while they have to focus squarely on survival, they have a chance to produce a huge upset over FaZe Clan tomorrow, February 2nd. The squad, featuring the talents of broky, karrigan, frozen, jcobb, and Twistzz, was also pushed into the lower run, but by a dominant 3DMAX side.</p>

<p>VALORANT’s next Night Market event lands on February 5th and runs to March 2nd, allowing players to secure sweet skins for a discount. The trouble is, you won’t know what skins are in<strong> your </strong>Night Market until the event kicks off, as players are offered <strong>six randomized skins</strong>, rather than the option to choose a specific selection.</p>



<p>Below, we’ve outlined the full spread of VALORANT skins coming to the Night Market this February. Take a look and see if there’s anything you’re hoping to unlock.</p>







<h2 id="h-full-list-of-valorant-night-market-skins">Full List of VALORANT Night Market Skins</h2>



<p>VALORANT’s Night Market is a sought-after and anticipated event that surfaces a few times a year. It offers some deep discounts on the game’s best skins and allows players to secure skins that might have long since disappeared from the active store rotation.</p>



<p>Typically, the Night Market <strong>only </strong>features skins from a select few tiers of the ecosystem, locking out Exclusive and Ultra skins, which are much more valuable and boast higher price tags that Riot Games just doesn’t want to discount!</p>



<p>If you’re waiting for the full list of Night Market skins for February’s run, you don’t have to look any further than <strong>right here:</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Haunted Chocolatier is Still Coming, But It’s Taking a While to Finish]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/haunted-chocolatier-long-time-to-finish/</link>
            <guid>1422064</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ConcernedApe has addressed concerns (does that work?) surrounding Haunted Chocolatier, the next major release from the developer of Stardew Valley, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-smashes-steam-record-portal-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most positively rated game</a> ever released. In a recent blog post, ConcernedApe came out to answer questions and quell fears from fans about Haunted Chocolatier’s lengthy development cycle.</p>



<p>It has been years since Haunted Chocolatier was announced, but ConcernedApe stressed that, while it’s taking a while to finish, it’s <strong>absolutely </strong>still coming.</p>







<h2 id="h-i-am-not-going-to-abandon-haunted-chocolatier">‘I Am Not Going to Abandon Haunted Chocolatier’</h2>



<p>ConcernedApe, whose real name is Eric Barone, released Stardew Valley almost a decade ago, in February 20216. His second game, Haunted Chocolatier, has a similar vibe and was unveiled in 2021. In <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent blog post</a>, Barone admitted he announced it way too early, but he ‘had his reasons’.</p>



<p>He then went into more depth about some key concerns regarding the game, such as the leading worry that it might have been abandoned by the solo developer, and the scrapped content would be pulled into Stardew.</p>



<p>He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>No. First, I am not going to abandon Haunted Chocolatier. But even if I did, I am not going to add it to Stardew Valley. Stardew Valley and Haunted Chocolatier are separate games. </p>



<p>It doesn’t even make sense from a technical perspective, as Haunted Chocolatier is written from scratch, it’s not the same “engine” as Stardew Valley. You can’t just copy and paste Haunted Chocolatier into Stardew Valley.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Barone has turned his attention to Stardew Valley again, working on a critical update to appease the millions of people who still play the game. He said that he’s only working on Stardew again because it’s such a drastically popular game and he ‘still has additional ideas for how to improve it.’</p>



<p>In the closing sections of the blog post, Barone confirmed that Haunted Chocolatier still doesn’t have a release window, but it’s <strong>not </strong>cancelled or abandoned.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Ashes of Creation Shutting Down? Cancellation Controversy Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-ashes-of-creation-shutting-down-explained/</link>
            <guid>1422058</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ashes of Creation is an ambitious MMORPG that was released in early access in December 2025. The launch came after almost a decade of playtests, production, and evolution, but it has met a vicious end as the entire studio behind the game has crumbled. In this guide, we’re answering a clear question: ‘Is Ashes of Creation shutting down?’</p>



<p>It seems like the writing is firmly on the wall with Ashes of Creation, which was released just weeks ago by Intrepid Studios onto the Steam platform, but what’s the truth of it?</p>







<h2 id="h-what-happened-to-ashes-of-creation">What Happened to Ashes of Creation?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ashes-of-creation-collapse-entire-intrepid-studios-laid-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ashes of Creation <strong>imploded</strong></a><strong> </strong>around February 1st, 2026. On social media, reports surfaced of Intrepid Studios, the game’s developer, facing complete and indiscriminate layoffs after the studio’s leadership team collectively resigned.</p>



<p>Ashes of Creation’s Steven Sharif, Intrepid’s founder and the game’s creative director, explained in a statement that ‘the Board’ wrestled control of the company away from him, prompting <strong>his </strong>resignation. However, a subsequent investigation determined that Sharif might have been the <strong>sole member </strong>of the Board.</p>



<p>Ashes of Creation’s team has been completely laid off, and what’s worse, the company’s financial position meant that final paychecks couldn’t be processed. This is despite the game selling approximately 250,000 – 300,000 copies on Steam, under a $49.99 price tag.</p>



<p><strong>A global shutdown of Ashes of Creation is almost guaranteed</strong>, but at the time of writing, the game remained live on Steam. Intrepid Studios, however, has collapsed, and as of this point, has no staff to work on the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-ashes-of-creation-refund">How to Get Ashes of Creation Refund</h2>



<p>If you’ve played Ashes of Creation for less than two hours on Steam, you can collect a refund via Valve’s internal support channels, but if you’ve played for <strong>more </strong>than two hours, you’re not entitled to an instant refund.</p>



<p>However, you can still <strong>try </strong>to go through the customer support channels, as this is an extraordinary circumstance.</p>



<p>Many have predicted that class action lawsuits will surface, especially given the suspicious timing of the Ashes of Creation shutdown. The game’s Kickstarter always stated that if the game didn’t launch on Steam, full refunds to all backers would be issued. Even though it was only live on Steam for mere weeks, that clause was effectively fulfilled.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ashes of Creation, an old-school MMORPG that dropped in an alpha state on Steam after <strong>years </strong>of development, has imploded this weekend. The game has been struck with a total collapse, as the team at Intrepid Studios has either resigned or been laid off. It was just two days ago that the team at Intrepid was posting updates and promising a roadmap of improvements to the game.</p>



<p>In a recent message on the game’s Discord server, the company’s founder and creative director for AoC, Steven Sharif, made a damning statement about the situation. He stressed he was forced to resign after ‘control of the company’ was shifted away from him, prompting a walkout that ultimately led to the entire remaining company being laid off.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-ashes-of-creation-shutting-down">Is Ashes of Creation Shutting Down?</h2>



<p>It’s almost <strong>guaranteed </strong>that Ashes of Creation, the ambitious, old-school MMORPG that was in development for almost a decade, will disappear forever. In his statement on the AoC Discord server, company founder <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1qsldun/ashes_of_creation_has_just_been_canceled_all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steven Sharif wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation.</p>



<p>Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support.</p>



<p>Following my resignation, much of the senior leadership team resigned. Following those departures, the Board made the decision to issue WARN Act notices and proceed with a mass layoff.</p>



<p>I cannot responsibly speak to further details at this time due to ongoing legal and governance matters. What I can say is that the developers and staff acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty they are now facing. I am incredibly dismayed by the situation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On Steam’s community forums, users came forward to declare the situation a ‘pump and dump scam’, with some suggesting that class action lawsuits should be sprung up to chase refunds.</p>



<p>However, that might be easier said than done. In a video shared on social media, an internal communication was shared, explaining that ‘all job titles and all positions’ would be hit by an ‘entire and permanent plant closing’. It was then explained that the expected payroll set to run on February 1 will <strong>not </strong>happen because of the company’s financial position.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>𝐀𝐒𝐇𝐄𝐒 𝐎𝐅 𝐂𝐑𝐄𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐋𝐎𝐎𝐊𝐒 𝐓𝐎 𝐁𝐄 𝐒𝐇𝐔𝐓𝐓𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐃𝐎𝐖𝐍</p><p>What some players thought would be the answer to all their MMO questions has come to an abrupt end with Game Director for Ashes of Creation (<a href="https://twitter.com/StevenJSharif?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@StevenJSharif</a>) stepping down.</p><p>The news comes after more… <a href="https://t.co/q1q53dJX0x">pic.twitter.com/q1q53dJX0x</a></p></div>— N_Tys (@N_Tys26) <a href="https://twitter.com/N_Tys26/status/2017792177167036842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>That means that employees under the WARN notice will <strong>not </strong>be paid, which will undoubtedly prompt financial suits.</p>



<p>If you load <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ashes of Creation’s Steam page</a> <strong>right now</strong>, you still have the option to purchase it for £41.99 ($49.99). According to SteamDB’s aggregate systems, as many as 319,000 people may have purchased Ashes of Creation, which averages out to around $14 million.</p>



<p>Those customers who picked up this early access title that has now been dropped just a month after release will be <strong>demanding </strong>satisfaction and compensation.</p>



<p>Popular creator ‘Pirate Software’ addressed the situation on socials, standing up for the developer somewhat:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Not really. At that time in development the game was doing just fine. Stuff was moving forward and the areas of the game he showed weren't actually flat featureless environments as he described.</p><p>It wasn't until the last 6-8 months that shit really hit the fan and fell apart.…</p></div>— Pirate Software (@PirateSoftware) <a href="https://twitter.com/PirateSoftware/status/2017849283043827851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Bizarrely, the situation took <strong>another turn </strong>when eagle-eyed and investigative fans turned up registration information for Intrepid Studios that confirmed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1qsnhhx/intrepid_studios_board_of_directors_is_just_steven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steven Sharif as the sole Board member</a>. This was taken from a filing made on December 30, 2025, and it lists Sharif as the CEO and an individual named John Moore as the CFO. </p>



<p>Sharif is the only named director on the Board, per the document. </p>



<p>On social media, users noticed a troubling clause <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1791529601/ashes-of-creation-new-mmorpg-by-intrepid-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in the game’s Kickstarter</a>, which explained that if the game <strong>doesn’t launch on Steam</strong>, full refunds will be issued to all backers. Well, guess what? The game <strong>launched on Steam,</strong> so that promise was effectively fulfilled. Coincidence?</p>

            <guid>1422037</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a whole new month, and that means it’s time to smash another batch of NYT Connections puzzles! I’m here as always to provide you with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions so you can start February on the upswing with a series of instant successes. Below, you’ll find all the hints and tips you need to get through today’s NYT Connections as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Enjoy!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-1">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 1)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #966:</p>



<ul>
<li>WEDGE</li>



<li>HYPE</li>



<li>MORGAN</li>



<li>FLAT</li>



<li>BOP</li>



<li>THORN</li>



<li>BOOST</li>



<li>MULE</li>



<li>HEATER</li>



<li>SHARP</li>



<li>JAM</li>



<li>PLUG</li>



<li>GLUTE</li>



<li>CLOG</li>



<li>PITCH</li>



<li>BANGER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Ways to talk something up</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Footwear with a twist</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> Tracks that absolutely go off</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Hidden instruments</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 1:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-1-966">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 1 (#966)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BOOST, HYPE, PITCH, PLUG</li>

<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BANGER, BOP, HEATER, JAM</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – GLUTE, MORGAN, SHARP, THORN</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
