<p>There’s a new game coming from the developer of The Axis Unseen, and it’s not what you’d likely expect. Just Purkey Games, the studio operated by developer Nate Purkeypile, has announced Deedlee Doo! Carkour!, a new “racing” game where you do parkour with a car using explosions.</p>



<p>The game is currently scheduled to launch on May 12, 2025 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3582590/Deedlee_Doo_Carkour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC via Steam</a>.</p>



<p>“Everything in the game is made out of clay in real life,” the game’s description reads. “The sound effects and music are all mouth sounds. If you screw up a jump, children laugh and make fun of you. (Just like real life!) Can you reach the top of the Meowtain?”</p>



<p>Regarding the clay art style, it was all sculpted in real life as the description reads. Some of the sculptures, however, were done by Purkeypile’s own children before they were scanned into the game. </p>



<p>In addition to the game’s announcement, a reveal trailer was also released.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/balatros-latest-accolade-is-a-surprise-appearance-in-netflixs-black-mirror/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a wildly successful awards seasons, the breakout indie game sensation Balatro continues to reach a mainstream audience, with a surprise appearance in the hit Netflix series Black Mirror. The show’s creator is a big fan, and the game’s appearance is the latest accolade for a game with momentum that will not slow down.</p>



<h2 id="h-balatro-s-breakout-success-carries-into-2025-with-black-mirror-appearance">Balatro’s Breakout Success Carries Into 2025 with Black Mirror Appearance</h2>



<p>A number of fans of the show Black Mirror quickly spotted the appearance of Balatro in “Hotel Reverie,” the third episode of the latest series, which stars actresses Issa Rae, Awkwafina, Emma Corrin, and Harriet Walter. The sci-fi-dystopia series released its seventh series today, and its fifth since switching from the UK’s Channel 4 to global streaming giant Netflix. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Charlie Brooker, the creator, producer, and head writer for Black Mirror, was at one point obsessed with Balatro, according <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-interview-1236034654/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to an interview</a> he did with entertainment outlet Deadline back in August 2024.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This is going to sound so tragic, but right now there’s a game called Balatro. It’s like poker, and it’s possibly the most addictive thing ever created. It’s currently on Nintendo Switch and Steam deck, but it’s going to be released on phones, and at that point I think humankind’s activity is going to drop about 25%. I play that in short bursts when I’m writing to reward myself.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans of the game wished at the time that maybe Balatro could be the primary focus of an episode of Black Mirror, but most are happy with an appearance in the show. I say “most” since <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1jvun13/balatro_is_in_the_new_black_mirror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a number of fans are upset</a> with how the character is playing. One of the Jokers in play is Sixth Sense, which rewards you with a Spectral card if your first hand is just a single 6, but they play a Full House instead. Some with even keener eyes have noticed that the all the Jokers in play line up with the tutorial seed.</p>



<p>After releasing in the beginning of 2024, Balatro ended the year with widespread critical and commercial success. The game has landed several awards over the past few months, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Community’s Indie Game of the Year award</a>, and added a BAFTA for Debut Game just days before the latest Black Mirror series dropped.</p>



<p>What else is next in Balatro’s meteoric rise? A movie appearance? A sequel? Let us know what you think in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
