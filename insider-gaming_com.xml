<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s DLC 1, Hero of Justice, arrives on January 23, 2025, with 11 new playable characters and tons of new content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bandai Namco has just released the new Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Hero of Justice DLC <a href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1880267152634048695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> featuring 11 new characters, one exclusive costume, three custom battles and more. The Hero of Justice DLC will cover the events of the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie, where we see Gohan and Piccolo battle against the Gamma Twins and Cell. Early access for the DLC kicks off on January 21 at 00:00 CET / January 20 at 15:00 PST.</p>



<p>The playable characters in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Hero of Justice DLC will feature the highly awaited transformation of Gohan, Beast Gohan, and his other forms from the Super Hero movie. Players will also receive the Orange Piccolo transformation and other Super Hero forms for the Namekian. Regarding villains, players will see Gamma 1, Gamma 2, and Cell Max join the roster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Hero of Justice DLC will introduce three new custom battles. The first seems like a clash between the old and new Androids, the second is a battle with Cell Max, and the third is a face-off between Gohan and Goku. Players will also receive the Red Ribbon Army costume for Piccolo in this update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, in addition to the Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Hero of Justice DLC, the developers are adding a limited-time mode called Legendary Warrior Face-Off Mode. This mode will allow players to battle against “characters with sky-high power levels. ” The first one they have to face off against is Broly. The developers will conduct tests with this game mode to prepare for a second test.</p>

<p>According to a reliable insider, the director of the newly released Dragon Age: The Vielguard game has decided to leave Bioware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/corrine-busch-has-seemingly-left-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, Jeff Grubb recently posted a <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1880113210470371790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet</a> stating, “Corrine Busch, director of Dragon Age, really is leaving BioWare.” In the same tweet, Grubb shared that he doesn’t feel EA will close their Bioware Edmonton studio as he was told, “There is nothing solid about that part of the rumour.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Corrine Busch has been on the EA team for over 18 years, working on big franchises such as The Sims and Dragon Age. Busch started as an environment artist for Headgates Studios, grew as a lead systems designer at Bioware, and eventually became a Game Director at EA in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game director’s most recent title was Dragon Age: The Vielguard, the fourth instalment to the franchise and the sequel to Inquisition. The 2024 title features the vibrant world of Thedas, which is filled with wilderness, treacherous labyrinths, and glittering cities. A pair of ancient gods want to destroy the tranquillity of the world, and you have to take the role of Rook, Dragon Age’s latest hero and Thedas’ defender.</p>



<p>In other news, the developers recently announced that Dragon Age: The Veildguard’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-character-creator-gets-standalone-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">character creator will receive a standalone release</a>. Also, earlier Dragon Age games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-remaster-unlikely-creative-director-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might not receive remasters</a>.

<p>The next set of new Pokémon TCG Pocket packs is all anyone wants. Genetic Apex has carried the game through a strong beginning, but it’s time for A2 to drop, change the meta, and make collections bigger.</p>



<p>I do every mission, get all rewards, complete events, and open booster packs. As a result, I need very few new cards. I yearn for a new Pokémon TCG Pocket set, and the rumored A2 booster set could be the cure. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-mythical-island-themed-collection-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythical Island</a> was Pocket’s first proper mini-set, and it had some bangers—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-celebi-ex-meta-deck-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebi ex</a> is a pain, right? </p>



<p>But it’s time to move on to bigger and better things. New packs for Pokémon TCG Pocket can breathe new life into the mobile game, and here’s the latest on set two.</p>

<figure><figcaption>I don’t want to play with you anymore. Credit to Creatures Inc. and DeNA.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The new Pokémon TCG Pocket packs don’t have an official release date, but it’s widely accepted set two AKA Set A2 is dropping at the end of January 2025</strong>—<strong>likely January 29</strong>.</p>



<p>January 2025’s closing days are huge for Pokémon TCG Pocket. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading is finally coming</a>, along with the rumored and much-anticipated A2 set. </p>



<p>Trading was confirmed by Pokémon TCG Pocket’s X social media page. This is a lock, however; Set A2’s current information is purely from leaks and datamines.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-a2-expansion-leaks-and-rumors">Pokémon TCG Pocket A2 Expansion Leaks and Rumors</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An amazing card design. Credit to Creatures Inc. and DeNA.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pokémon TCG Pocket A2 expansion is believed to be another major booster set featuring over 200 new cards.</strong></p>



<p>Genetic Apex is set one, Mythical Island is mini-set one, and A2 is set two. Get ready for tons of new cards, ex beasts, and Full Art beauties we’re never going to pull. We’ll probably get new Crown rarity pulls too.</p>



<p>Social media personality <a href="https://x.com/PokeGirlLauren"></a><a href="https://x.com/PokeGirlLauren" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PokeGirlLauren</a> posted the game’s future content plans in a <a href="https://x.com/PokeGirlLauren/status/1855266563038892098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message on X</a> at the beginning of November: “Mini #PokemonTCGPocket Set A1a to be released 16th December. <strong>The 2nd set ‘A2″ will be released 29th January</strong>, will contain around 230 cards, and is expected to totally change the meta. Plans are for 4 new sets and 4 mini sets a year.”</p>



<p>We know the A1a leak was true, and this was part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored next expansion leaks</a> way back. Developers Creatures Inc. and DeNA seem to be leaving the same amount of team between set releases. This makes a <strong>January 29 release for A2 extremely likely</strong>.</p>



<p>As for Set Two’s contents, this remains a mystery. Genetic Apex is primarily a Kanto region set, and the assumption is set two is Johto-focused. We take nothing for granted in this respect—always expect the unexpected.</p>



<p>Social media is rife with supposed leaks of A2 card designs, but we remain skeptical. Unlike the concrete leaks for set launches and dates, we’ve seen nothing regarding A2’s designs or cards. <strong>I’d recommend you take any Set A2 designs with a mountain’s worth of salt for now</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<p>How many Hourglasses have you already saved up for the A2 Set? Do you have Gold in reserve for opening more packs to get a headstart? Let us know your best pulls so far ahead of a fun period in Pokémon TCG Pocket.</p>
