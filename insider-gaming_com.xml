<p>The first Elden Ring Nightreign network test session has come and gone, and it resulted in for frustration than fun for many users. Due to what FromSoftware called “congestion”, many couldn’t take part in the first session</p>



<p>The issues ultimately led to the PlayStation Servers going down for maintenance during the test. Afterwards, FromSoftware took to social media to apologize for the issues.</p>



<p>“We apologize for the inconvenience caused by the game server issues,” the <a href="https://xcancel.com/ELDENRING/status/1890404327560208502#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media post</a> said. “Work is currently ongoing to improve the stability of the Network Test.”</p>



<p>The developer then added that they are considering an extra test session to make up for the problems with the initial run. As of publishing, there are still four more Elden Ring Nightreign Network Test sessions scheduled for the weekend. </p>



<p>Those times are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>February 14: 7pm-10pm PT / 10pm-1am ET</li>



<li>February 15: 11am-2pm PT / 2pm-5pm ET</li>



<li>February 16: 3am-6am PT / 6am-9am ET</li>



<li>February 16: 7pm-10pm PT / 10pm-1am ET</li>
</ul>
