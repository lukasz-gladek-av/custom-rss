<p>Recently, a claim surfaced on social media suggesting that 2026’s Modern Warfare 4, the rumored next release in the Call of Duty series, will be ‘a complete copy of Modern Warfare 2’ from 2022. It was suggested that the upcoming game’s multiplayer platform is a carbon copy of the 2022 title, right down to the ‘excessive visual recoil’ mechanics.</p>



<p>However, Infinity Ward recently signed off social media for the festive window, chiming in with a comment that directly flies in the face of this claim, prompting Call of Duty fans to lose their minds.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-modern-warfare-4-a-copy-or-not">Is Modern Warfare 4 a Copy or Not?</h2>



<p>TheGhostofHope, a reliable Call of Duty leaker, recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-4-multiplayer-is-reportedly-a-complete-copy-of-modern-warfare-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took to social media</a> with a bombshell claim:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Modern Warfare 4 Multiplayer in its current state is currently a complete copy of Modern Warfare II except for no perk charging system and less ADS/slide penalties.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He expanded soon after:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There is A TON of visual recoil on weapons in Modern Warfare 4 just like Modern Warfare II. Like I said in my last tweet it’s pretty much a complete copy outside of a few little things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans were quick to criticize the comments, while others revelled in the news. Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer platform wasn’t <strong>that bad</strong>, all things considered.</p>



<p>However, in the days that followed, Infinity Ward snapped onto social media with a clear message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Happy holidays everybody! </p>



<p>Wishing our community an awesome holiday season and looking forward to talking soon. </p>



<p><strong>Don’t believe everything you read on the Internet.</strong> </p>



<p>See you in 2026.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team is almost certainly disputing the recent Modern Warfare 4 claims, and TheGhostofHope was quick to respond as he came under fire:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Just gonna address this cause it seems like the perfect time to do so. I have been leaking Call of Duty for years and anybody who has followed me for a long time knows that. </p><p>I have leaked a ton of things about Vanguard, MWII, MWIII, BO6, BO7 before anybody else. Have I gotten…</p></div>— Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/2000713405204988390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>TheGhostofHope’s followers rallied, suggesting that the leaker has ‘never been wrong’ about anything in the Call of Duty space.</p>







<p>What do you think? Do you believe Infinity Ward is trying to save face, or is Modern Warfare 4 genuinely a copy and paste of Modern Warfare 2? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fewer-than-escape-from-tarkov-players-completed-game/</link>
            <guid>1384276</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Before Escape from Tarkov hit 1.0 on November 15, Battlestate Games professed how difficult it would be to ultimately <strong>complete the game’s</strong> new campaign. The crushing difficulty and lengthy challenges of the story mode added with 1.0 would push even the most talented players to their limits, and the latest numbers indicate they weren’t lying.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, Battlestate Games revealed that one million copies of the game have been sold since November 15, on top of the millions that were purchased before 1.0 was released.</p>



<p>They also shared that just 500 PMCs have completed the game, representing a drastically small minority.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-is-the-hardest-game-ever-made">Escape from Tarkov is the Hardest Game Ever Made</h2>



<p>If you take the 500 PMCs that have successfully run through to the end of Escape from Tarkov since the one million copies were sold post-launch, you get 0.5% of players.</p>



<p>If we assume that at least five times as many copies were sold <strong>pre</strong>-launch, you drill down to fewer than 0.1% of players having completed the game. The numbers are rough, but as Battlestate Games has never been transparent with the figures, it’s the best we have to go on.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that the Escape from Tarkov campaign has only been around for <strong>one month</strong>. In that time, the concept of completing it has been available to very few people, and casual players will likely spend months trying to conquer it.</p>



<p>On December 1st, Battlestate Games revealed that Tigz, a streamer, was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first person in the world</a> to complete Escape from Tarkov, and in the days that followed, 500 more players managed to secure that accolade.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Since its release, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EscapefromTarkov?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EscapefromTarkov</a> has sold over one million copies.</p><p>In the first month alone, players spent a total of 135,000,000 hours (or 15,410 years) in the Norvinsk region. This is equivalent to over 200 million full Customs raids, had each lasted until the final minute… <a href="https://t.co/dZnCBV7Bdg">pic.twitter.com/dZnCBV7Bdg</a></p></div>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/2000619759784583446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Now, in a new social post, the team has set up more numbers, alongside a celebration of one million sales post-launch and a new promo code (<strong>ONEMILLIONPLUS</strong>) for all players to enjoy.</p>



<p>But why is this important?</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has always been considered one of the toughest games ever made. It’s a punishing thing that breaks gamers every day, offering a soul-crushing gameplay loop that requires players to load up, run a raid, and hopefully make it out alive.</p>



<p>At any point, a single, well-placed bullet can end everything, stripping them of their progress and their equipment.</p>



<p>There are no maps, no markers, no guidance lines, and no hand-holding mechanics. It’s a brutal experience, and that’s why only 500 players in the world have managed to complete the game thus far.</p>



<p>The number proposed here is 0.1%, but it’s likely lower than that. Escape from Tarkov was on the market for almost a decade in alpha and beta states, and that’s assuming that it sold just five million copies in that time.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has just shared the news that Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter, has sold <strong>one million copies</strong> since hitting 1.0 on November 15. The game underwent an overhaul in November, marking it as a fully released game, and since that happened, it has been going like gangbusters.</p>



<p>The team also revealed that players have spent a collective 15,410 years in the game since November 15, equivalent to over 200 million full raids on Customs.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-still-on-top">Escape from Tarkov (Still) on Top</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is, in the eyes of many, the best extraction shooter ever made. It has stiff competition these days and more on the horizon, but regardless of what surfaces, it almost always remains the number one extraction game going. The most challenging threat the game has faced in recent years is ARC Raiders, but it’s still holding its own.</p>



<p>On November 15, Battlestate Games released the 1.0 update for Escape from Tarkov, bringing the game into a graduated state from the alpha and beta stages it sat in for almost a decade. With this full release having been logged, the team now looks to future projects, including new games, post-launch DLC, and even a console release.</p>



<p>To celebrate the one million milestone, Escape from Tarkov’s developers released a new promo code for all players to enjoy:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>ONEMILLIONPLUS</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s also important to stress that this is the first time Battlestate Games has shared sales figures for Escape from Tarkov. Over the years, estimations have been made, but the team has never been transparent about how many copies Tarkov has shipped. </p>



<p>This figure gives us an idea of how popular Escape from Tarkov has been since its release, but it doesn’t account for the (potentially) tens of millions of copies sold in the last decade.</p>

<p>The 2017 indie Metroidvania, Hollow Knight, is making its way to Nintendo Switch 2. A port of the game was announced by Team Cherry alongside <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-expansion-sea-of-sorrow-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a free DLC expansion</a> for Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>



<p>Released in 2017, Hollow Knight started as a Kickstarter before becoming the game it’s known as today. As the nameless Knight, you’ll tackle a multitude of hard bosses and explore the bug-infested world of Hallownest. Known for its brutal difficulty and beautiful visuals, the Team Cherry title has become one of the most successful indies of the 2010s. Its spinoff, Hollow Knight: Silksong, released in 2025 and went on to receive multiple awards and nominations, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several Game of the Year nods</a>. Now, the team is bringing the world to a new console: the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>







<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition-announced-free-upgrade-for-nintendo-switch-owners">Hollow Knight: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Announced, Free Upgrade for Nintendo Switch Owners</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog from Team Cherry</a>, the team announced that <strong>a Nintendo Switch 2 version</strong> of <strong>Hollow Knight</strong> is <strong>in the works</strong>. The game will feature a bevy of additions, like <strong>high frame-rate modes and resolutions</strong>, as well as <strong>new graphical effects</strong>. <strong>No release date for the edition was revealed</strong> outside of a 2026 release window. Screenshots of the game can be found above and on the blog.</p>



<p>Additionally, <strong>all those who own Hollow Knight for the Nintendo Switch can upgrade to the Nintendo Switch 2 edition for free</strong>. An update bringing new features and bug fixes will launch on current consoles around its release. The news comes after Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced to get a new DLC expansion, Sea of Sorrow. Both Hollow Knight: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and Sea of Sorrow will launch in 2026.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch was one of the first consoles to get Hollow Knight back in June 2018, months before PlayStation and Xbox. Originally, Silksong was planned as DLC for the title, but shifted to its own game. Now, fans can enjoy both series titles on the Nintendo Switch 2, enhanced and with new content to enjoy for free.</p>

Playing as Hornet, you’ll take down many hard bosses and explore the bug-infested land of Pharloom. Its release had been anticipated by many for years since being announced in 2019, before finally launching in September 2025.

Now, Team Cherry has revealed what’s next for Hornet with a small but intriguing tease.</p>

<p>The news comes after Hollow Knight: Silksong’s win for Best Action/Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2025. Silksong was up for multiple awards, including Game of the Year, but lost a majority of them to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-broke-all-time-the-game-awards-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record-breaking Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.
