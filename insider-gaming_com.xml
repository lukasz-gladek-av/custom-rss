<p>Atlanta FaZe just secured a 3 – 0 victory over Toronto Ultra to push one step forward at the CDL Madrid Major. The massive victory forced Ultra into the elimination bracket to square off against the Royal Ravens – their last chance at staying in the running.</p>



<p>Following the sweep of a match, I sat down with Atlanta FaZe’s Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris and McArthur ‘Cellium’ Jovel to talk about their nine-game win streak, playing more aggressively this season, and how they bounced back from a rough start.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-was-underperforming">‘I Was Underperforming’</h2>



<p>Atlanta FaZe didn’t have the cleanest start to the 2025 CDL season. The squad suffered a 0 – 3 loss in a qualifying stage for the first time since May 2023. That decisive defeat was handed down by the Carolina Royal Ravens, a team that has been on fire so far in 2025.</p>



<p>From there, FaZe lost three matches back-to-back-to-back before taking a break and turning things around. Presently, the team is on a near-historic nine-match win streak, almost refusing to drop a map in any series.</p>



<p>I caught up with Cellium and aBeZy to chat about the change-up:</p>



<p><em><strong>Cellium: </strong>For me personally, I was underperforming really badly. There were a lot of internal team talks about how we play the game and how we think about everything, and I think it definitely helped us improve over the break. Everyone is on the same page now and we trust each other.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>aBeZy: </strong>We had a team talk after the break, leading after the Falcons match that we won. We put everything on the table and after that, we’ve just been firing on all cylinders. Like he said, we just trust each other in every situation that we’re in and we’re just frying.</em></p>



<p>The talk turned to a recent comment made by Drazah, who wasn’t present for the chat. He’d previously said that ATL would take on ‘anyone, anytime’, suggesting the strategy had now turned to aggression. I asked aBeZy and Cellium if that was the case:</p>



<p><em><strong>aBeZy: </strong>Yeah, 100%. I don’t think it matters who we play. I feel like if we’re playing at our best, I feel like no one can beat us.</em></p>



<p>Cellium mirrored that sentiment, echoing with the claim: <em>‘I just think we’re the best team right now, by a mile.’</em></p>



<p>For the third time in two days, I asked the Call of Duty League pros what they thought about the crowds supporting the tournament here in Madrid. Thus far, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-shotzzy-wants-more-eu-majors-thanks-to-madrid-crowd/">OpTic Texas</a> and LA Thieves have agreed that the EU crowds are on another level compared to NA, and that was supported by the Atlanta FaZe guys:</p>



<p><em><strong>aBeZy</strong>: I think EU crowds are insane … Even this crowd is <strong>crazy</strong>.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Cellium: </strong>Both times I’ve went to Europe so far, it has been amazing. I would use the EU crowd is insane.</em></p>



<p>Atlanta FaZe now pushes into the winner’s final against the LA Thieves, which is set to take place tomorrow evening. The loser of that match will be pushed down into the elimination bracket for a final chance to go forward, and they’ll be taking on either Toronto, Carolina, Miami, or Minnesota.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lat-scrap-and-ghosty-interview-cdl-super-team/</link>

<p>The LA Thieves just destroyed the Miami Heretics on (sort of) home turf, pushing them down into the elimination bracket following a complete sweep. The 3 – 0 scoreline was probably easy enough to predict, but it came a little closer than some would have expected, with the Heretics putting up a considerable fight.</p>



<p>In the aftermath of the win, which pushed LA Thieves further towards the grand final, I caught up with Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe and Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst to learn how they were handling the expectations of being the CDL’s ‘Super Team’ this season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shouldering-it">Shouldering It</h2>



<p>For the opener, I asked Scrap and Ghosty whether they felt extra pressure trying to live up to these lofty expectations and whether they believed they <strong>had</strong>. In the run-up to the CDL kicking off, the LA Thieves’ squad was billed as being a Super Team, with Nadeshot making it very public (even if in jest) just how much securing the talented roster had cost the organisation.</p>



<p>Here’s what they had to say:</p>



<p><em><strong>Ghosty: </strong>I feel like there’s always a sense of pressure as a competitor to be the best version you can be. There’s definitely more external pressure from other teams, fans, whatever – but it still doesn’t amount to the personal pressure you put on yourself as a competitor.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Scrap: </strong>For myself, from how much shit I talk, there’s just pressure from the whole community on me, no matter what team I play for. People can call us a Super Team, yeah, I’ll call myself a Super Team because <strong>my team is godlike</strong>. You know, we have pressure on us, but we go into every match taking no-one lightly.</em></p>



<p>Following that, Scrap walked me through his growth in the CDL since entering the League as a rookie during the MWII season. He was painted as (and loved being) the villain, going on a notorious arc that set his profile ablaze.</p>



<p><em><strong>Scrap: </strong>I don’t think I’ll ever change. Honestly, I’m just being myself up on that stage, to be honest. If it comes out, it comes out. I feel like over the past couple of years in the League I’ve grown into more of a leadership role of a sort, not like the kid that just flies around. Now that I’m on a younger team that has a lot of young players and I’m just trying to work as best around them.</em></p>



<p>Like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-shotzzy-wants-more-eu-majors-thanks-to-madrid-crowd/">OpTic Texas’ Shotzzy</a>, the pair agreed that the crowd in Madrid is one of the most energetic they’ve ever seen, and they are ‘down for some more’ EU tournaments.</p>

<p>Fallout New Vegas and Horizon Zero Dawn lead writer John Gonzalez has announced he will be retuning to Obsidian after 14 years. </p>



<p>The announcement came via his LinkedIn profile, where he was quick to shoot down impending rumours of Fallout New Vegas 2, by simply saying, “No, it’s not Fallout: New Vegas 2.”</p>



<p>As for what Gonzalez is working on remains to be seen and could ride on the success of the studios next two upcoming games, Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2. If tremendously successful, he could be working on a future sequel.</p>



<p>However, Obsidian Entertainment has also released some stellar games in the past few years, including Pentiment, Pillars of Eternity, and Grounded, so he could also be working on a sequel to those, or a new IP entirely. But for now, all we know if that he’s not working on New Vegas 2… Apparently.</p>



<p>What do you think Gonzalez is working on? Would you like to see a Fallout: New Vegas 2? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>
