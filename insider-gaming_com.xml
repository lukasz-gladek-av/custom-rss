<p>Activision has seemingly heard the cries of players, and a major change for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 multiplayer is coming to the game at launch. In a post on the game’s website, the publisher announced that Black Ops 7 will have non-disbanding multiplayer lobbies at launch. </p>



<p>That means once you find a game lobby, you’ll remain in it until you either leave or it’s disbanded. </p>



<p><strong>“We’ve heard the community discussion and dialogue around lobby disbanding, and as we mentioned earlier during the Beta, we’re focused on keeping players together from match to match more often,”</strong> <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision said</a>. <strong>“Today, we’re excited to announce we’ll have persistent lobbies at launch for Black Ops 7. We’re committed to improving this experience for players, and will be sharing more details soon.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to persistent lobbies, Activision also announced that it <strong>“open matchmaking with minimal skill consideration will be the default for Black Ops 7 multiplayer.</strong> In other terms, that means skill-based matchmaking is being taken out of Black Ops 7</p>



<p><strong>“Simply put, imagine the matchmaking experience of Open Moshpit from the Beta, but as the standard in Black Ops 7 on day one,”</strong> they said. <strong>“Our team feels strongly about providing players with a more varied experience, and the Beta proved to be a great opportunity to test this approach. We’ll be sharing more details as we get closer to launch!”</strong></p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>

<p>The developers of Hyper Light Breaker are ending development on the game and laying off a number of employees at the studio.</p>



<p>First reported by Game Developer, Heart Machine has confirmed its plans to wrap up the game’s development. However, they didn’t confirm how many people would be losing their jobs. </p>



<p><strong>“As we wrap up our work on&nbsp;Hyper Light Breaker, we’ve had to make the difficult decision to part ways with a number of talented team members,” </strong>a Heart Machine spokesperson <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/heart-machine-making-layoffs-and-ending-development-on-hyper-light-breaker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told the outlet</a>. <strong>“This was not our ideal path, but rather the only one available given the circumstances.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“While this path will include a conclusion on the project, it reflects broader forces beyond our control, including shifts in funding, corporate consolidation and the uncertain environment many small studios like us are navigating today.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as that “conclusion on the project” is concerned, the studio says it still has something planned for the game in January that will be “meaningful and as polished and complete” as they can. </p>



<p><strong>“We’re doing our best to refine what we can, complete key systems, and have the game culminate in a satisfying punctuation point,” </strong>they said. <strong>“Given our limited resources with team members rolling off the project, we won’t be releasing any more updates or hosting any Q+As for the rest of this year. We want to make sure the team can focus fully on getting this next release into the best shape possible.”</strong></p>



<p>Hyper Light Breaker, a prequel to 2016’s critically acclaimed Hyper Light Drifter, launched in January 2025 in Early Access to generally mixed reviews. </p>
