<p>A new Futurama mod is breathing fresh life into the 2003 classic, The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run. Developed by Slurm Team, Futurama Hit &amp; Run transforms Springfield into an almost identical recreation of New New York.</p>



<p>According to the developers, the mod was created with <strong>“all fully from scratch 3D models, built from the ground up like it was an intended expansion pack for the game.” </strong></p>



<p>It’s even got the attention of the original game’s lead designer Joe McGinn, who said, <strong>“I can only say … this looks awesome! I want to play it.”</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>The mod is currently available to <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download as a free demo</a> and features four story missions, a bonus mission, four races, six vehicles, and more. The current map is roughly a quarter of New New York.</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that the team used AI-generated dialogue for aspects of the mod due to the series’ voice actors not being able to participate in its creation.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-didn-t-the-simpsons-hit-amp-run-2-happen">Why Didn’t The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run 2 Happen?</h2>



<p>With a new mod for the classic game, it obviously leads to the question of why fans didn’t get a The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run 2? As it turns out, development on a sequel was actually underway after the success of the original. Unfortunately, the original game’s publisher, Vivendi, lost the license for the franchise and turned down a deal to make more games. </p>



<p><strong>“The Simpsons came back with an offer for five games for X amount of dollars — a really good deal — and Vivendi said ‘No.’,”</strong>&nbsp;former executive producer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-didnt-we-get-the-simpsons-hit-run-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Melchior said back in 2023</a>.</p>

<p>Ridgeline Games was instrumental in the beginning of Battlefield 6, but the studio was closed midway through the game’s production following the voluntary departure of former director and VP Marcus Lehto. The former visionary has revealed that several members of the team were left out of the Battlefield 6 credits—including himself.</p>



<p>It’s never a nice feeling for your work to go unappreciated. This appears to be the case for several members of the now-defunct Ridgeline Games team, who worked tirelessly on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-former-battlefield-6-director-criticizes-game-for-not-acknowledging-former-devs">Former Battlefield 6 Director Criticizes Game For Not Acknowledging Former Devs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not good. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-lehto-7378b31/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marcus Lehto</a> was a “Studio GM/VP” for Battlefield between 2021 and 2024. He led Ridgeline Games—formed in 2022—with the specific purpose of working on Battlefield 6—before walking away in 2024.</p>



<p>Lehto <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7386081189645885440/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> to LinkedIn on October 20 to say: “Many of my former teammates from Ridgeline Games were not properly credited in the recent release of Battlefield 6.”</p>



<p>The former talent posted an edited version of the Battlefield 6 credits, featuring the devs who were omitted. It also highlights that anyone who was recognized was simply saved for a “Special Thanks” section toward the end of the credits. </p>



<p>Lehto called this out:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>“These talented developers worked tirelessly for 1 to 2.5 years, building the foundation of the game, before I left voluntarily and the studio was subsequently shuttered. Despite their significant contributions, most who were laid off were relegated to a “Special Thanks” section at the very end of the credits — and several were omitted entirely, including myself.</p><p>Out of respect for my colleagues and the awesome work they poured into this project, I want to take a moment to properly recognize them — listing their names and roles as I would have preferred them to appear in the credits.</p><p>Game development is a team effort, and every contributor deserves fair acknowledgment.”</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>The comments section, for the most part, was nothing but love for Lehto and his team, and condemnation for the credits leaving out all the missing talents.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/monolith-rogue-td-tower-defense-game-play-villain/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to play a tower defense game but from the perspective of the ones doing the attacking? So did developer Progress_Check and publisher Tate Multimedia. Introducing Monolith: Rogue TD, an upcoming tower defense title that has you playing the role of the villain.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming can exclusively reveal Monolith: Rogue TD, its features, and the first trailer that gives players a look at the game’s art style, creatures, and environment. </p>



<p><strong>“You are the Monolith: an unbreakable force of corruption crashing down from the heavens, reshaping entire worlds in your own villainous image,”</strong> Progress_Check says. <strong>“With evolving battlefields, strategic tower placement, and powerful upgrade choices,&nbsp;Monolith&nbsp;challenges players to outsmart waves of defenders and reshape every world in their dark image.”</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Features of the game include procedurally-generated worlds, adaptive enemies, tower summons, and more. You can check out the full feature list below, courtesy of Progress_Check.</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summon Towers</strong>&nbsp;– Deploy three tower types and six unique attack styles as your loyal minions lay waste to the opposition.</li>



<li><strong>Expand the Board&nbsp;</strong>– Reshape the battlefield each day as terrain shifts, paths split, and strange structures emerge to challenge your strategy.</li>



<li><strong>Defend Your Core</strong>&nbsp;– The forces of good will stop at nothing. Face off against desperate defenders and powerful bosses determined to purge your corruption.</li>



<li><strong>Pick Upgrades</strong>&nbsp;– Forge your own deck of upgrades from randomized pools. Enhance your towers, your core, and your potential for devastation.</li>



<li><strong>Conquer Again</strong>&nbsp;– Procedural worlds, adaptive enemies, and escalating difficulty make each run a fresh opportunity for domination.</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Will Add 10 Years Worth Of Content]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-add-10-years-worth-of-content/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-will-add-10-years-worth-of-content.1330249/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you thought the hype for ARC Raiders couldn’t get any bigger, then you should know how much Embark Studios values its new extraction shooter. A 10-year plan is already drawn up for ARC Raiders, so if you buy the game, expect a lot of content to be fired your way.</p>



<p>It’s been a while since an extraction shooter had this much hype and attention. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-early-access-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is taking the spotlight from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape From Tarkov</a>, and the game’s build-up has featured the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/has-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-been-extended-playtest-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Slam Beta</a> and is crescendoing into a big-time release. We’re not sure about you, but if you had any doubts about the future of ARC Raiders, the company has issued a <em>very </em>long-term vision.</p>



<h2 id="h-embark-studios-thinks-arc-raiders-is-a-10-year-game">Embark Studios Thinks ARC Raiders Is A 10-Year Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Embark Studios design lead Virgil Watkins—and his team—were asked about what the future holds for ARC Raiders in a sit-down interview. We’re not sure where the original source comes from, but the video credit goes to <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersNews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@ARCRaidersNews</a> for now.</p>



<p>Watkins had this to say about post-launch content:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I think internally, for a very long time, we referred to this [ARC Raiders] as a 10-year game. That is the ambition we are aiming for and that dictates the type and quantity of content we want to put into it.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The design lead doesn’t elaborate on the exact nature of any content or a timeframe, as it can “spiral into promises that can go unfulfilled if things change.”</p>



<p>While we know that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-price-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders isn’t free-to-play and has a price</a>, it should be somewhat comforting to know that the money you part with will supposedly be repaid 3,650 times over.</p>



<div><article><p><span>ARC Raiders’ design director, Virgil, on the game’s post-launch future.</span></p></article></div>



<p>It’s very bold to proclaim a game will have a 10-year lifecycle of plans and content in this day and age. If ARC Raiders sees a huge drop-off in players within a couple of years, and it doesn’t financially make sense to develop content for a non-existent audience, then those 10-year plans are suddenly under threat.</p>



<p>Should Watkins have said this? Have you been impressed by ARC Raiders enough to think it can sustain itself for at least 10 years?
