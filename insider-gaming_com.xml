            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-pc-require-psn-account/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been confirmed that The Last of Us Part II Remastered, scheduled to be released on PC in April, will require a PSN account to function, despite having no online features. This follows the trend established by many PlayStation-centric games that found their way to PC platforms in the last year or so, but it doesn’t make it any less irritating for players.</p>



<p>This disruptive inclusion means that The Last of Us Part II on PC won’t launch in the several countries where the PlayStation Network doesn’t operate, which is one of the chief issues at play.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-backlash-continued">Backlash Continued</h2>



<p>Last year, a sudden change brought this requirement into the Helldivers 2 universe, with players being prompted to link a PSN account to continue playing the game. It caused a monumental downfall for the game, with tens of thousands of negative reviews being cast against the title.</p>



<p>That situation was rectified, but Sony would go on to make it a base requirement for further ports, such as God of War Ragnarok and Horizon: Forbidden West.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> discovered the requirement after wishlists went live. The Last of Us Part II Remastered will hit PC platforms – such as Steam and Epic Games Stores – on April 3. Instead of a Last of Us Part III, players are once again being forced to satisfy themselves with the iterations that have been re-released so many times over the years.</p>



<p>The game will arrive just as the second season of the popular HBO live-action adaption is set to drop. It was recently confirmed – along with a new trailer – that The Last of Us season two will hit screens worldwide in April. While a date wasn’t stressed, it’s expected to coincide with the PC release of The Last of Us Part II.</p>



<p>Tactics.</p>



<p>Do you see the PSN linking requirement as being a major issue, or are you not bothered? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, a job listing surfaced for a ‘Project Senior Producer’ in Los Angeles, working at a new PlayStation studio in Los Angeles. In the listing, it’s explained that the office is part of a ‘newly established AAA studio based in Los Angeles, driven by a team of seasoned industry leaders’.</p>



<p>It’s expected that this is Jason Blundell’s studio, the legendary developer who departed Deviation Games in September 2022. It was mentioned in December 2023 that Blundell was set to lead a PlayStation studio, and later rumours suggested that he would be partnering with Bungie to produce a new action game in a sci-fi universe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rumours-galore">Rumours Galore</h2>



<p>In the job listing discovered on the PlayStation site and shared by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-has-a-new-studio-in-los-angeles-working-on-a-new-ip.1078485/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">users on Restera</a>, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are a newly established AAA studio based in Los Angeles, driven by a team of seasoned industry leaders and experienced game developers. </p>



<p>Our mission is to create the next groundbreaking AAA original IP while reimagining the development process with a lean and highly efficient approach.&nbsp;We’re&nbsp;seeking talented individuals who share our vision and are eager to join us on this journey.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/sonyinteractiveentertainmentglobal/jobs/5413216004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The listing</a> is all business and doesn’t mention anything to identify the game, nor does it confirm the name of the studio or who is leading it, but the strongest possibility is that it’s Jason Blundell’s studio.</p>



<p>Blundell boasts a stunning career that saw him march through high-profile roles at Treyarch during Call of Duty’s peak. He was instrumental in the success and popularity of the franchise’s Zombies ecosystem, but in February 2020, he departed the company to found Deviation Games.</p>



<p>Deviation would later be shut down before it could ship a single game.</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-linkedin-ex-deviation-games-employees-set-up-a-new-studio-with-sony-led-by-jason-blundel-new-ip.868227/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rumoured a while ago</a> that former Deviation Games employees would be funnelled into a new Sony-backed studio with Jason Blundell at the helm, and this could be that claim brought to fruition.</p>

<p>It was just announced that HITMAN: World of Assassination has passed a unique threshold, securing 75 million players worldwide in just under a decade. In the words of IO Interactive, this has increased ‘its status as the most successful Hitman game of all time’. </p>



<p>In December 2024 alone, one million active players were recorded assuming control of Agent 47 and hunting down all manner of targets across a range of maps, missions, and modes. On December 12, Jean-Claude Van Damme was added to HITMAN: World of Assassination as a new and challenging elusive target.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-huge-numbers">Huge Numbers</h2>



<p>HITMAN: World of Assassination is a live-service title firmly rooted in the universe that debuted way back in 2000 with Hitman: Codename 47.</p>



<p>This decades-old franchise has maintained a solid following over the years, transitioning through the various gaming generations and touching everything from mobile to VR. It’s an industry staple and features an instantly recognisable protagonist and concept.</p>



<p>In a recent press release, IO Interactive explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Since its release, HITMAN World of Assassination has continued to introduce a vast array of live content, including new locations, contracts, seasonal events, and collaborations, expanding HITMAN’s narrative. </p>



<p>With 1 million active players in December 2024, HITMAN World of Assassination remains as popular as ever thanks to its constant additions and a dedicated community. With more content planned to come to HITMAN World of Assassination in 2025, players can continue to look forward to more and more hours of HITMAN to enjoy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The report explained just how challenging the most recent update was, which is an element that most Hitman fans appreciate. In their attempt to hunt down Jean-Claude Van Damme’s character, only 40% of players have been successful, and it took one player a whopping seven hours to complete the mission.</p>



<p>Have you managed to eliminate the latest elusive target? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p>HITMAN: World of Assassination is available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<h2 id="h-counter-strike-major-records">Counter-Strike Major Records</h2>



<p>The Astralis organization holds the record for the most Major wins as an organization with four. Notably though, the organization has struggled in recent years, and has failed to qualify for the past four Majors. Astralis has not reached the playoffs of a Major since winning StarLadder Berlin 2019.</p>



<p>Peter “dupreeh” Rasmussen has won the most Majors as an individual with five, having won four with Astralis and one with Vitality. Dupreeh is tied with Dan “apEX” Madesclaire and Finn “karrigan” Andersen in total Major appearances with 19. However, dupreeh has the sole distinction of having attended all 19 of the CS:GO Majors.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows First Expansion ‘Claws of Awaji’ has been revealed to contain over 10 hours of additional content.</p>



<p>The new information comes courtesy of the Assassin’s Creed Shadows <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>, which was updated after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s recent delay</a>. </p>



<p>As a part of the update, the new description reads, “Pre-purchase now to get a bonus mission and the upcoming Claws of Awaji expansion. Travel to a new region, get over 10 hours of additional content, and unlock a new weapon type, new skills, gear, and abilities.”</p>



<p>In addition to the Claws of Awaji, Insider Gaming also exclusively reported in October 2024 that Ubisoft is planning to release a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op mode for Shadows</a> and is currently under the codename ‘League’.</p>



<p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/analysis-ubisoft-faces-its-most-challenging-year-in-its-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ANALYSIS: Ubisoft Faces Its Most Challenging Year in its History</a></strong></p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is now set to release on March 20, 2025, after an announcement from Marc-Alexis Côté said that the game needs a few additional weeks to implement changes based on feedback.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources, Côté’s statements reflect what is being handled internally, with staff saying that the delay is to ensure that the game is as polished as possible. </p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows had its first delay to February 14, 2025</a>, after it was announced that the game needed further polish, with sources behind the scenes also revealing that the team needed additional time to improve the authenticity of the game to its setting.</p>



<p>As for media previews, which were set to take place next week, it seems like we’ll have to wait a little longer for those, too, as Ubisoft is set to update on the dates.</p>

<p>OpTic Gaming has come out on social media with a revelation regarding its 2025 Halo Championship Series roster. In a massive shakeup, it was revealed that going into the new season, FormaL, Bound, Renegade, and Lqgend will be flying the banner of Team Green.</p>



<p>Last season was tough for OpTic, with the team failing to secure a single major win but landing in second place no fewer than five times. The team fell short of the trophy at every HCS Major and Halo World Champs.</p>



<p>Every loss except for one came at the hands of Spacestation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-year-new-optic">New Year, New OpTic</h2>



<p>OpTic’s social media post announcing the team was met with jubilation from fans:</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/OpTic/status/1877414903947854216
</p></figure>







<p>Some have already branded the team a ‘God Squad’, being as it is made up of some of the sharpest competitors in Halo esports today.</p>



<p>FormaL is an instantly recognisable force of nature, being one of just two esports pro players on Earth with world championship titles in <strong>two </strong>games. He has long been considered one of the best (if not <strong>the best</strong>) controller-based esports players ever seen.</p>



<p>Bound and Lqgend join OpTic Gaming from Spacestation – the very roster that wiped the floor with OpTic on so many occasions last year, which is ironic at best. Will the duo be able to start winning trophies for OpTic this season, rather than preventing victory at the last minute possible?</p>



<p>Finally, there’s Renegade, who joins OpTic Gaming from FaZe Clan, the only other team to pip OpTic to the post last season during an HCS Major.</p>



<p>These are some of the most storied, seasoned, and successful competitors in Halo esports. Could this be the year that OpTic Gaming lifts multiple trophies <strong>again</strong>? We’ll find out when the season starts.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-flea-market-lockdown-extended/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has revealed on social media that it has been ‘actively monitoring community feedback’ in Escape from Tarkov, and as a result, it’ll be keeping the Flea Market locked down for a further five days. It was due to be unlocked <strong>now</strong> following December’s wipe, but it’ll now open up to all users on January 14.</p>



<p>This was seen by some as one of the most bizarre changes the developer has made in Escape from Tarkov. By locking down the Flea Market, BSG effectively put a stranglehold on the game’s peer-to-peer economy for a couple of weeks. Also, the studio made it impossible to use non-FIR items to upgrade the hideout, which was seen as another huge mistake.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-little-while-longer">A Little While Longer</h2>



<p>On social media, Battlestate Games wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are actively monitoring community feedback on Flea Market being locked and decided to extend the lock for 5 more days until January 14 3PM GMT / 10AM EST. </p>
