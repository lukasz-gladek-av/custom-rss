<p>According to a storefront leak, Silent Hill Townfall is coming in early 2025. Furthermore, even before we’ve seen gameplay, we know when it’s releasing.</p>







<p>Announced all the way back in 2022, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-transmission-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill Townfall</a> is a collaboration between Konami and Annapurna Interactive. Not much is known about the project outside of a cryptic announcement video from the Silent Hill Transmission presentation. Many had a bad feeling the project wouldn’t see the light of day, as the series hadn’t been doing well, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/entire-annapurna-interactive-team-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Annapurna layoffs</a>. However, right at the prime of the franchise, with Silent Hill 2 Remake and Silent Hill f being massive successes, it seems it’s not too far off. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The leak in question comes from e-shop Liverpool Mexico, which showed Silent Hill Townfall and a release date of March 26, 2026. Unfortunately, the listing in question has since been deleted, though <a href="https://cdaction.pl/newsy/silent-hill-townfall-z-nieodlegla-premiera-meksykanski-sklep-potwierdza-plotki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polish outlet CD Action</a> managed to screenshot it beforehand. Prominent Silent Hill figure <a href="https://x.com/Rashmunchel/status/1990457427565715645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rachel Ashmun</a> also credited the listing on Twitter/X, lending a bit more leverage to it.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that Konami and Annapurna have not released anything official yet regarding Silent Hill Townfall, so take the leak with a grain of salt. Still, the timing does come at a mighty convenient time. On November 20th, Xbox is holding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-partner-preview-confirmed-for-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partner Preview</a> at 10 am PT/1 pm EST. One of the games heavily rumored, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and even leaked</a>, for the presentation is Silent Hill 2 Remake. The title, helmed by Bloober Team, is a timed PlayStation exclusive that, if true, will come to Xbox Series X|S on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-store-leaks-silent-hill-2-xbox-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 21st</a>. Perhaps we may get a double feature for Silent Hill then? We’ll have to wait and see!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sandfall Interactive’s Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has broken a very impressive record following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025 nominations</a>. The game, nominated for Game of the Year, leads a stellar list of other contenders, including Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and Hollow Knight Silksong.</p>







<p>Releasing earlier this year, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 blew many out of the water. Not only did it look gorgeous for an indie game, but the turn-based RPG combat felt reminiscent of classic Final Fantasy and Persona. It quickly became <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-now-2025s-highest-rated-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025’s best-reviewed title</a> for a time before <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a> overtook it a month ago. Still, it was pretty clear the game would make an appearance at The Game Awards in big categories. However, its nominations prove it’s showing up in a huge way, more than any other year.</p>



<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-record-12-nominations-at-the-game-awards-2025">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Gets Record 12 Nominations at The Game Awards 2025</h2>

<p>The Game Awards 2025 announced its nominees today (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can find the whole list here</a>) and it had some bombshells. Perhaps the biggest of all was Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The indie title managed to snag a record-breaking 12 nominations, including three in one category. Previously, the record holders were 2020’s The Last of Us Part 2 and 2023’s God of War: Ragnarok, which each had 11 nominations. The full list of nominations for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 can be found below:</p>

<li>Best Game Direction – Sandfall Interactive</li>



<li>Best Narrative</li>

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 joins Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Hollow Knight Silksong, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Hades 2 for Game of the Year. Either way, we’ll find out who takes home the title on December 11th when The Game Awards 2025 goes live.</p>

<p>The Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.2.0 patch notes have released ahead of its November 18th release. The notes include a new map and mode, aim assist features, and plenty of bug fixes.</p>







<p>The update plans to add a ton of stuff and fixes to Battlefield 6. In terms of new content, a Southern California-inspired map, called Eastwood, will be available. Included with the map is a new limited-time mode focused on destruction aptly called Sabotage, as well as two new weapons: the M357 Sidearm and DB-12 Shotgun. </p>



<p>As for fixes, the biggest change addressed in the Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.2.0 patch notes is to the Aim Assist. According to the developers, it has reverted the tuning back to how it was during the Open Beta. Other fixes include weapon accuracy, gadget improvements, and smoother responses for controllers. </p>

<p>The Valley of Memory’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ac-mirage-valley-of-memory-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy List</a> was revealed a few days ago, providing a complete list of trophies and achievements players can target.

The update’s size according to platforms is as follows: PlayStation 5 – 22.6GB, PlayStation 4 – 16.6GB, Xbox Series X/S – 32.39GB, Xbox One – 10.11GB, PC – 28.15GB. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-assassin-s-creed-mirage-title-update-1-1-0-valley-of-mirage-dlc">What’s New in Assassin’s Creed Mirage Title Update 1.1.0 Valley of Mirage DLC</h2>



<h3 id="h-new-free-content">New Free Content</h3>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage Valley of Memory DLC comes as a free update for all players, taking them on a new adventure with Basim. Basim has heard something about his long-lost father still being alive, and chasing these rumours, he has reached the new region, AlUla, “a land of secrets, ancient ruins, and vibrant oases. Players will have to complete the “Head of the Snake” mission to access this content. New game players have the option to skip ahead in the story directly through the main menu. </p>



<p>The region of AlUla will feature hours of content that players can explore, including new and returning world activities, family-friendly side activities, world events, work contracts, and brand-new additions. Some of these additions have been named, including Stolen Goods and Oud Melodies, the first mission asks you to stal maps from robbers and the second has players collect musical scenes through parkour sequences. </p>



<h3 id="h-gameplay-improvements">Gameplay Improvements</h3>



<p>As mentioned above, players will observe some significant gameplay improvements in Assassin’s Creed Mirage after title update 1.1.0. Firstly, the free jump option has been included, allowing players to jump manually by pressing a button. Side and back ejects can now be performed even when Basim has no clear area to land on or has a handhold. The “Free” mode can be toggled on/off, and “Safe” mode can be used if you prefer safe and sound landings for Basim. </p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Mirage Valley of Memory DLC update will also introduce replayable missions, known as Animus Sequences. These missions will present new challenges that can be completed for rewards, including Animus Mods. These mods are essential auto-refills for your tools and resources, which can only be used in this mode or New Game+. </p>



<p>Two new difficulties have also been added: Hardened Assassin, which comes between Assassin (Normal) and Master Assassin (Hard). Ultra Hardened is the new hardest difficulty, and there is also a new Custom Difficulty preset for a more tailored experience. The DLC also adds a tier 3 tool upgrade, with Throwing Knives becoming explosive, Smoke Bomb becoming corrosive and disolving dead enemies, Blow Darts piercing through heavily armored enemies, Noiskmakes putting enemies to sleep in the impact zone, and Traps can make enemies attack their fellow guards. </p>



<p>There are additional improvements, additions, which you can check out in the full patch notes below: </p>

<p>Hypixel Studios is back, and they have brought an old friend along with it. On Monday, founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced that they had reacquired the rights to sandbox game Hytale from Riot Games.</p>



<p>The news comes roughly five months since it was announced that the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-cancels-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being shut down</a>.</p>







<p><strong>“We are thrilled to announce that we have acquired Hytale from Riot Games,”</strong> <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Collins-Laflamme said</a>. <strong>“While it didn’t make sense for them to continue developing it in its existing form, they ultimately wanted what’s best for players, and that’s for us to eventually play a revised version of the game. We are grateful to Riot Games for making this possible.”</strong></p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme said that the studio has hired <strong>“more than 30 developers who know this game inside and out, with additional returns in the coming days.”</strong></p>



<p>He says that the team is going to go back to the original version of what Hytale was supposed to be. It was added that the studio is fully independent and committed to funding Hytale <strong>“for the next 10 years”.</strong></p>







<p>As far as what’s next, an Early Access release and pricing will be announced <strong>“in the coming days”.</strong> It’ll be available first on Windows with a Mac and Linux release possible and other platforms later on. Regarding content, the Early Access version of Hytale will include a Creative Mode, Exploration Mode, and Modding capabilities. What won’t be available are minigames and an Adventure Mode. Both of those will come later on.</p>
