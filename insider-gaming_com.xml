            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nearly two months after announcing the plans, Avalanche Studios has officially closed its office in Liverpool. This closure sees 31 people lose their jobs, adding to the ever-growing job loss count in the gaming industry.</p>



<p>In a post on its website, the company confirmed the closure and thanked the staff who were impacted.</p>







<p><strong>“The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project,” </strong><a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/updateliverpool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the statement reads</a>. <strong>“We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to Avalanche Studios Group.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Our focus remains on supporting the [staff] through this transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities.</strong>“</p>



<h2 id="h-layoffs-months-in-the-making">Layoffs Months In The Making</h2>



<p>Plans of the Liverpool closure was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avalanche-studios-closes-office-lays-off-staff-after-contraband-cancelation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced in September</a>. They came just weeks after it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-development-stopped-at-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development on Contraband</a> was ending. Avalanche said the decision came after an internal review of the company and its plans moving forward after the game’s cancelation. </p>







<p>“<strong>This review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations</strong>,” they said at the time, while saying it would impact all employees in Liverpool.</p>



<p>In addition to the Liverpool office, layoffs were planned for offices in Malmö and Stockholm. There hasn’t been an update on those locations, however. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Avalanche Studios for what the plans for the studio are moving forward. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite releasing less than a month ago, AdHoc’s Dispatch has sold two million copies. The last episodes, 7 and 8, only came out last week and reached <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-million-copies-adhoc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a million copy milestone</a> within 10 days.</p>







<p>Released in late October, Dispatch follows Robert, a former superhero working a desk job and dispatching ‘reformed’ villains in Los Angeles. Composed of former TellTale Games members, AdHoc Studios brought the iconic Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-type dialogue choices and consequences. The game quickly became&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1981416301709934652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best-selling title</a>&nbsp;on Steam with only two episodes. Then, it reached a million copies only a week and a half after release. Now, with all the episodes out, the team shared an even bigger milestone.</p>



<h2 id="h-adhoc-studios-celebrates-two-million-copies-sold-for-dispatch-with-new-drawing">AdHoc Studios Celebrates Two Million Copies Sold for Dispatch With New Drawing</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We're also sad there are no new episodes this week, but thank you to the 2 million players that have joined us so far. Wouldn't be here without you.</p><p>Art by Derek Stratton. <a href="https://t.co/1Bu2MIMmh9">pic.twitter.com/1Bu2MIMmh9</a></p></div>— AdHoc Studio – Dispatch OUT NOW! (@theAdHocStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1991235043868410096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1991235043868410096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new post from AdHoc Studios</a> reveals that Dispatch has sold two million copies, a huge milestone for an indie title. To commemorate the occasion, Derek Stratton, the game’s art director, drew a new picture featuring everyone’s favorite character, Beef. The drawing is somber, as no new episodes have been released due to Episode 7 and 8 being the last ones. Still, the team seems pretty grateful for the many fans who joined in the journey.</p>



<p>Currently, Dispatch is available on PC and PlayStation 5. No ports to Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch 2 have been announced. Unfortunately, no Season Two has been revealed yet, though the team <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/11/11/a-new-update-on-dispatch-season-2-after-its-surprising-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">seems adamant</a> about bringing it back. Given how it started development years ago, it’ll likely be some time before we see the Z-Team again. Still, with how popular it has become (and earning a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Award nomination</a>), the future for the title is looking bright.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Every family has at least one nostalgia-filled retro gamer. You know, that person who still swears the SNES controller is perfection or insists that nothing beats the original Pokémon intro. And honestly? They might not be wrong. There’s something timeless about jumping back into the games we grew up with, which makes retro-themed gifts some of the best surprises you can give during the holidays.</p>



<p>Whether you’re the type of person who has to hunt down classic cartridges from the 70s, 80s, and 90s, or you just want to do something small for someone special in your life, there are plenty of gift options to make that retro gamer in your life happy. From fantastic books to novelty gifts, these are the best gifts in 2025 for your nostalgia-filled friend.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-retro-gaming-gifts-for-2025">Best Retro Gaming Gifts For 2025</h2>



<p><strong>Press Reset by Jason Schrier</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>One of the best books on games and the people that make them, Press Reset comes from veteran journalist Jason Schreier. Rather than tell you more, let’s let Schreier explain it himself.</p>



<p><strong>“The business of videogames is both a prestige industry and an opaque one. Based on dozens of first-hand interviews that cover the development of landmark games—Bioshock Infinite, Epic Mickey, Dead Space, and more—on to the shocking closures of the studios that made them,&nbsp;Press Reset&nbsp;tells the stories of how real people are affected by game studio shutdowns, and how they recover, move on, or escape the industry entirely.”</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Original Xbox: The Console and the Games by&nbsp;Jonathan Clarke&nbsp;and&nbsp;Clarke</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are a long-time Xbox fan, the upcoming book Original Xbox: The Console brings you a visual history of all of the games released on the original Xbox. </p>



<p>The book comes from the team at Xbox Era and features 360 full color pages and over 790 games. <strong>“From Fable to MechAssault, Halo: Combat Evolved to the very first Forza Motorsport, this book is a celebration of the console that started it all.”</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>The 100 Greatest Console Video Games: 1988-1998 by Brett Weiss</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The 100 Greatest Console Video Games: 1988-1998 is the follow-up to the best-selling The 100 Greatest Console Video Games: 1977-1987. </p>



<p>The book features 100 games with two-to-three full pages of the game’s history, production info, details, developer quotes and more.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>A Handheld History by Lost in Cult</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The last book on this list, A Handheld History takes a look&nbsp;<strong>“into decades of gaming memories and reconnect you to that long car journey full of discarded AA batteries before speeding ahead to the contemporary days of blockbusters in your backpack.”</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Mario Heat Changing Mug</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For your coffee or tea aficionados, this mug is as straight forward as it gets. When it’s cold, it shows and overworld Mario level. Pour a hot drink in it, it goes dark with extra details.</p>







<hr>







<p><strong>Gameboy Lego Set</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are a lot of gaming-themed LEGO sets, but one of the favorites is the Gameboy set. Featuring 421 pieces, this set includes a Gameboy display, two game cartridges that can go into a Gam Pak slot, and even options for a Nintendo Start Screen or game screen placeholders. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Nintendo NES Coasters</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want to show off your fandom without leaving a ring on your table, these NES coasters look like the cartridges from eight classic games: Metroid, Duck Hunt, Donkey Kong, Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3, The Legend of Zelda, and Excitebike.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Super Mario Coin Block Pillow Plush</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are plenty of plush pillows available, but the Mario coin block pillow is one that just wants you to let out some frustration. Get this pillow and just give it a few punches, but it’s unlikely you’ll get any coins out of it. You can try, though.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Subscription (12 months)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A modern-day console gift for a retro gamer? That’s right. With a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion subscription players get access to not only NES, SNES, and Game Boy classic games, but also Sega Genesis, N64, and GameCube games.</p>



<p>If the backlog wasn’t full enough, adding these games that are full of nostalgia for the gamer in your life is one heck of a gift.</p>







<hr>







<p><strong>8Bitdo Bluetooth Retro Receiver for PS1, PS2, and Windows</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you want to play your old PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 with a modern controller, then 8Bitdo has you covered. The 8Bitdo Bluetooth Retro Receiver allows you to use your Xbox, PS4, PS5, Wii U Pro and Switch Pro controllers wirelessly with your older systems. Imagine just sitting on your couch that’s more than 10 feet from your TV?</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>The Oregon Trail Card Game</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you want to get away from the screen but still relive your gaming youth, The Oregon Trail Card Game will give you dysentery wherever you go. The game supports 2-6 players and even features 8-bit style art.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Atari 2600+ PAC-MAN Edition Console</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sticking with the classics, if you grew up playing the Atari 2600 or just want to see what all the fuss is about, then the Atari 2600+ might just be the next best thing to the original classic console. The Atari 2600+ includes a wireless joystick and is compatible with both 2600 and 7800 games. The system also comes with Pac-Man 7800 and Pac-Man 2600 and has HDMI output for modern TVs.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-available-campaign-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-campaign-%E2%80%9Cendgame%E2%80%9D-will-be-unlocked-for-all-players-on-friday.1358521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Starting this Friday, Black Ops 7’s Endgame mode will be unlocked for everyone, regardless of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-endgame-multiplayer-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campaign completion</a> or not. Fortunately, those who beat the story will get some rewards.</p>







<p>Released earlier this month, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has had quite the rough patch. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI allegations</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-metacritic-user-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">negative feedback</a> have taken a lot of the airwaves for the game. Furthermore, its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwhelming player count</a> on opening weekend compared to Battlefield 6 are not the best. However, its multiplayer modes, especially Endgame, have been recieved well. It did require one to go through a ‘garbage’ campaign, so many haven’t gotten to try it yet. Now, not even a month since releasing, the mode will be available to all.</p>



<h2 id="h-endgame-mode-available-on-friday-without-campaign-requirement-in-black-ops-7">Endgame Mode Available on Friday Without Campaign Requirement in Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Co-Op Endgame mode will unlock for all Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 players starting this Friday, November 21. </p><p>Those who finished the campaign to get Endgame will receive 3x 1 hr 2XP Tokens, 2X Weapon XP Tokens, 2X Battle Pass XP Tokens, and 3x Perkaholic GobbleGums. <a href="https://t.co/i3z6j0pVll">pic.twitter.com/i3z6j0pVll</a></p></div>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1991221059119415675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post on Twitter/X, <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1991221059119415675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a> stated that, starting Friday, November 21st, Black Ops 7’s Endgame mode will be available for everyone. As mentioned before, the mode was previously locked behind beating the co-op campaign. If you were one of those who beat it to get Endgame, there are rewards you’ll be able to redeem. The list can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>3x 1-Hour 2XP Tokens</li>



<li>2x Weapon XP Tokens</li>



<li>2x Battle Pass XP Tokens</li>



<li>3x Perkaholic GobbleGums</li>
</ul>



<p>The mode is Call of Duty’s new answer to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dmz-is-officially-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DMZ from Modern Warfare 2</a>. With an open world, Avalon, you and four friends can take on missions, secure objectives, and explore. Other teams will be on the map and you’ll compete with them, as well. </p>



<p>With the mode now available to all, it’ll be interesting to see if it has an effect on the player count. Many fans do like the mode, so without having prerequisites, it may bring more people in. Either way, the move does feel a bit sudden, especially coming just two weeks after releasing. </p>







<p>What do you think of Endgame being fully available in Black Ops 7? Is it to boost engagement? Have you played the mode? Was it worth going through the campaign?

<p>Twitch, on Wednesday, announced changes to how the company will tracking views for clips in order to “better reflect genuine viewer engagement”.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1991208256614854719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the company is making five specific changes that will track more views more accurately. It also continues the company’s recent efforts to combat view botting that has plagued the site for a while. </p>







<p><strong>“While clip views may initially appear lower, you’ll now have cleaner and more consistent cross-platform clips data that will ultimately help provide you with better insights into clip performance,” </strong>Twitch said. </p>



<p>As far as the specific changes go, those include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixing a technical issue that was inadvertently inflating clip view counts</li>



<li>Including clip views from Stories in clip view totals</li>



<li>Making view counting more consistent across all platforms (web, iOS, Android)</li>



<li>Better filtering out of bot traffic</li>



<li>Enabling improved clip analytics and laying the groundwork for us to explore new analytics features</li>
</ul>



<p><strong> “Going forward, we’ll continue to fine-tune our clip view counting system on an ongoing basis,”</strong> they added. </p>







<p>What do you think of the changes being implemented by Twitch for views tracking on clips?
