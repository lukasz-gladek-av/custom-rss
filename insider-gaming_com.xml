<p>Stardew Valley has hit another sales milestone. According to the game’s developer ConcernedApe, the game has sold over 41 million copies as of December 2024.</p>



<p>That total puts it roughly 11 million more than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-30-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the “over 30 million”</a> it surpassed earlier 2024. According to the <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a>, 26 million of the 41 million copies have been sold on PC while another 7.9 million were sold on Nintendo Switch. </p>



<p>Released in 2016, Stardew Valley was a solo-developed game that has continued to see major updates nearly nine years later. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-latest-stardew-valley-console-update-is-massive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last major update</a> — 1.6 — saw new festivals and events added along with hundreds of other changes.</p>



<p>In addition to game updates, the game continues to hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-hits-all-time-player-count-eight-years-after-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new player count records</a>. Even the music has found its place in the hearts of players with <a href="https://www.stardewvalleyconcert.com/news/new-tour-announcement-sos-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a full orchestra tour</a> performing the game’s soundtrack. Lastly, a recent study found that Stardew Valley was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-best-game-reducing-stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best game for reducing stress</a>.</p>

<p>PlayStation isn’t giving up on live service games any time soon. In a recent interview with Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/26274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a>, PlayStation Co-CEO Herman Hulst said that the company still believes in the model despite recent hiccups like Concord.</p>



<p>“The game business is constantly changing due to various factors, including technological advances, new genres and ways of playing,” Hulst said via auto translation. “However, one thing that remains constant is people’s desire for great entertainment experiences, and attention to games continues to grow. However, this has also created competition, and like many companies in the industry, we have had to make changes to our business to solidify a more sustainable operating base.”</p>



<p>Hulst continued by saying PlayStation will “continue to focus on developing live service titles along with the story-driven single-player titles that our players want.”</p>







<p>As far as why a  continued effort towards live service games, Hulst pointed to Helldivers 2’s success as a reason. The co-op title from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-biggest-surprise-hit-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowhead Game Studios showed how</a> a live service game can succeed in the modern era, and it’s something that Sony and PlayStation are paying attention to.</p>



<p>“We are learning a lot as we establish the ability to develop high-quality live service titles within SIE,” he said.&nbsp;“Helldivers 2 attracted many players through continuous content provision, and achieved results that support the potential of live service titles.”</p>



<p>What do you think of PlayStation moving forward with more live service games? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-game-of-the-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When it comes to video games, 2024 wasn’t just another year. It truly was a standout year for games over the last decade. Yes, we’ve heard that sentiment before, but this time it felt different. This year brought a wave of incredible experiences, with something for everyone. From the smallest indie gems to blockbuster AAA titles, the gaming landscape was full of great titles.</p>



<p>Games like Helldivers 2, Balatro, Black Myth: Wukong, and STALKER 2 dominated conversations at various points throughout the year. But one game managed to capture the hearts of the Insider Gaming community above all others. That game, and the Insider Gaming Community’s 2024 Game of the Year, is Astro Bot. </p>



<p>In a tightly-contested vote on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>, the race came down to two favorites: Astro Bot and Balatro. In the end, Astro Bot edged out the poker-themed roguelike, claiming 37% of the vote compared to Balatro’s 33%.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-makes-astro-bot-so-special">What Makes Astro Bot So Special?</h3>



<p>This isn’t just another <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/astro-bot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">3D platformer</a>; it’s a love letter to PlayStation’s legacy. With stunning visuals steeped in nostalgia, Astro Bot takes you on a journey through PlayStation’s storied history. Its level designs are masterfully varied, ensuring that no two stages ever feel the same.</p>



<p>From a gameplay perspective, it’s pure fun and, arguably, the most enjoyable 3D platforming experience on PlayStation since the early days of Crash Bandicoot or Spyro. The game is packed with inventive mechanics, each one thoughtfully designed to keep things fresh. Whether you’re wielding Aloy’s bow or transforming into a sponge to soak up water and grow in size, every moment feels like a perfect fit for the worlds Team Asobi created. Importantly, nothing is overused, so the game always feels engaging and never overstays its welcome.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-return-to-gaming-s-roots">A Return to Gaming’s Roots</h3>



<p>But what truly sets Astro Bot apart is the way it makes you feel. It’s a throwback to the golden age of gaming—a traditional 3D platformer without the clutter of microtransactions or overwhelming bloat. It’s just long enough to satisfy, but never so drawn out that it becomes a slog. Playing Astro Bot feels like revisiting the essence of what made so many of us fall in love with video games in the first place. Even the game’s soundtrack evokes a feeling of yesteryear while still feeling fresh and modern.</p>



<p>Do you agree with Astro Bot as the Game of the Year, or is there another 2024 standout that stole your heart? Let us know down below, and join the conversation in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>!</p>
