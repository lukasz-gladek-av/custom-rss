<p>Xbox players will be able to access PlayStation exclusives like God of War and Insomniac’s Spider-Man series on the next console, the latest reports state.</p>



<p>The next-gen era for Microsoft and Sony is on the horizon, despite the fact that many developers continue to support last-gen consoles like the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and there looks to be a titanic shift in terms of exclusive titles.</p>



<p>Xbox has already manoeuvred away from first-party exclusives, bringing the likes of Starfield, Forza Horizon 5, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo to PlayStation</a>, while Sony has eased slightly, as indicated by the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox earlier this year.</p>



<p>There are still some big exceptions, notably on PlayStation’s side with the likes of God of War, Insomniac’s Spider-Man, and Ghost of Tsushima, but that’s set to change in the new era.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-exclusives-coming-to-xbox-in-new-era">PlayStation Exclusives Coming to Xbox in New Era</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Central’s Jez Cordon</a>, Microsoft’s plans for the next era of Xbox will bring the console more in line with PC, including the addition of various storefronts onto the console.</p>



<p>Some steps toward that goal have already been taken with the ROG Ally X, which includes support for the likes of Steam and Epic Games Store, and the next Xbox console will have similar support.</p>



<p>With the addition of Steam and Epic storefronts onto the console, the door will be opened for titles that were previously PlayStation console exclusives, like God of War and Spider-Man, onto the Xbox platform—even though it won’t be a direct release and will lack established Xbox features, like Gamerscore and Achievements, for example.</p>



<p>The blurring of the waters in regards to exclusives has been difficult for players to get their head around, with the term exclusive now being looser than ever, but, in general, it’s good news for consumers.</p>

<p>Kratos Actor Christopher Judge has expressed his thoughts about going to Egypt for the next God of War game.</p>



<p>We keep hearing updates on spin-off and mainline God of War games, but we have yet to receive an official announcement. We recently saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshots</a> of the canceled multiplayer game emerge online, and now Kratos’ actor has expressed interest in traveling to Egypt for the next mainline release. </p>



<h2 id="h-going-to-egypt-for-the-next-god-of-war-would-be-a-completion-of-my-circle">Going to Egypt for the Next God of War “Would be a Completion of My Circle’ </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/god-of-war-actor-christopher-judge-says-he-hopes-a-potential-sequel-will-take-place-in-egypt-but-i-have-no-doubt-that-no-matter-what-pantheon-it-is-it-will-be-great/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Kratos actor Christopher Judge spoke about going to Egypt for the next God of War game at a panel at MCM London Comic Con. Judge stated that travelling to this location “would be a completion of my circle”, as he is highly popular for playing Teal’c from Stargate. Judge said “but whatever is decided”, before tracking back and stating “if there is another game”, he has “no doubt that no matter what pantheon it is, it will be great.”</p>



<p>Egypt, as the next location for a God of War game, has been a topic that has surfaced online many times in the past. And it makes sense to do so as well, as Kratos has already conquered Greek and Norse pantheons, it’s time for him to face off against a new set of gods. There was also a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> earlier this year that Sony was casting Middle Eastern actors for an unknown AAA game, which could be the next God of War title set in Egypt. </p>



<p>In other news, Amazon’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-casting-call-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casting call</a> for its God of War TV series has leaked. Additionally, the long-rumored Greek God of War game has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/greek-god-of-war-game-pushed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly delayed to 2026</a>.
