            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has had one of the first chances to get hands-on with the second installment in the Hell Let Loose series, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose has always been one of my go-to World War 2 games since it released in early access in 2019 following its successful Kickstarter campaign (which I backed!). Its huge scale, impressive visuals, and its high-stakes one-shot kill gameplay have made the game one of the most immersive World War 2 multiplayer games that I don’t think anyone has been able to match.</p>



<p>So when the publisher behind Hell Let Loose, Team 17, announced that there was going to be a new installment in the series, but this time set in Vietnam, I had to jump on the chance to get some hands-on.</p>



<h2 id="h-familiar-but-entirely-different">Familiar, But Entirely Different</h2>



<p>To start the match, I made my way to the action as a gunner in a helicopter, ready to rain down bullets on any Vietnamese fighters we came across. After a short one-minute flight over the rivers and the jungle, we landed at our objective on a swampy riverbank.</p>



<p>Almost instantly, enemy mortar fire started to rain down on our location as we made our way to our objective, which was a Vietnamese village already crawling with enemy soldiers. Bamboo bridges provided fast but risky navigation from building to building, and we were under attack from green tracer rounds, suppressing our position from the jungle tree line.</p>



<p>After a couple of minutes of taking down a few enemies, we secured the objective and made our way to the next one, which meant crossing a large river. For those familiar with Hell Let Loose, you know that this would often provide a challenge of trying to find an uncontested bridge or a canal boat pile-up to get across, but in Hell Let Loose Vietnam, we were able to swim across. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, our squad’s time was short-lived as we were all killed, but the moment made for one of those classic Hell Let Loose cinematic moments that never get old, as the treeline facing us was suppressed by an artillery strike. Sadly, it didn’t hit the enemy that lit up our squad with an AK-47, but hey, what can you do?</p>

<h2 id="h-massive-improvements-across-the-board">Massive Improvements Across The Board</h2>



<p>For those who adore Hell Let Loose, this game feels really familiar, with plenty of improvements across the board that I hope will bleed over into the original game. But importantly, the game feels refreshing in the grand scheme of things. The developers have managed to maintain that immersive feeling that Hell Let Loose is known for, all while making sure the game feels different enough that it warrents an entirely new title. </p>



<p>One of the biggest concerned I had I when heared about the series heading into Vietnam was the lack of enemy visibility, which sometimes is a problem in the first game. However, the improved lighting overhaul with the game upgrading to Unreveal Engine 4 from its predessessor to Unreal Engine 5 has seemingly made a massive difference to the games overall colour pallet. While you’re certainly going to be shot from weird places from to time, those concerns are now firmly squashed. The audio overall has also made a tremendous difference in the game, allowing the player to rely on their ears as well as their eyes to pinpoint enemy locations. </p>



<p>Overall, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is going to be an unforgettable entry into the Hell Let Loose franchise, giving players a fresh and immersive gaming experience that is often overlooked in the first-person shooter scene.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam currently has a vague release date of 2026 for the PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hollow Knight has hit a new peak player count on Steam more than eight years after being released. This super-surge in popularity has come about after the Hollow Knight: Silksong release date was <strong>finally revealed </strong>after years of anticipation. </p>



<p>As I write this, the game peaked at 22,260 users on Steam <strong>three minutes ago</strong>. It’s trending upwards, so we can expect that number to climb as more people jump onto Hollow Knight to experience it before Silksong’s release date comes around.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-silksong-release">When is the Silksong Release?</h2>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong is set to be released on September 4, 2025. </strong>It’s closer than we expected, but it was a date that many thousands of players had to be patient for, especially given that the last game hit the market almost a decade ago.</p>



<p>During the recent Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom, Team Cherry unveiled an all-new trailer for Silksong, which included the ultimate drop of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/">game’s release date</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s the new Silksong release trailer, which has racked up more than 3 million views in under a day:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>The original Hollow Knight title has skyrocketed in popularity since the trailer dropped during Opening Night Live. In recent minutes (at the time of publishing), a new peak was achieved by Hollow Knight on Steam. Before today, the last peak was 20,300 players in May 2022, but I can’t say for sure what caused that surge.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight is one of the best-reviewed games ever made, boasting an ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’ rating on Steam that’s represented by 97% positivity across a whopping 136,000+ reviews.</p>



<p>It’s easy to see why the anticipation is so high for the follow-up game.</p>



<p>Are you eagerly awaiting the Silksong release date? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-hands-on-preview-my-exclusive-first-look-at-harlowe-gameplay.1278117/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the last few weeks, I’ve been rinsing the Borderlands series, which prepared me quite nicely for an extended demo of Borderlands 4 at  Gamescom. However, my preparation was rendered mostly insignificant when I discovered just <strong>how much of an evolution Borderlands 4 is </strong>over Borderlands 3 (and the rest of the series).</p>



<p>As I explored the seamless and sumptuous open world of Kairos with Harlowe, the ‘Gravitar’ Vault Hunter, I found myself marvelling at the sheer level of differences that set Borderlands 4 apart from everything that came before, while still managing to retain most of what makes Borderlands <em>Borderlands</em>.</p>



<p>Read on to scope out my full Borderlands 4 preview, pieced together from an exclusive, never-before-seen demo at Gamescom.</p>



<p>Before you dive in, here are 35 minutes of Borderlands 4 gameplay, featuring Harlowe:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="35 Minutes of Borderlands 4 Gameplay | Exclusive First Look at Harlowe" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XK2qNsnKLqc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-less-border-more-lands">Less Border, More Lands</h2>







<p>Borderlands 4 has a stunning open world that’s the biggest single environment Gearbox has created in the 20-year history of the franchise. It’s a hugely ambitious undertaking that reflects nothing but the sharpest quality. The classic cartoon visuals of Borderlands 4 are more detailed than ever before, allowing players to study the most minute elements of this enormous map.</p>



<p>To accommodate the size and scale of Kairos, Gearbox has created a Borderlands game that has more traversal options than you can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-will-feature-30-billion-guns/">shake 30 billion guns at</a>. From grapple hooks and gliders to double-jump mechanics and multiple customizable vehicles, there’s no shortage of ways to get around this vast map.</p>



<p>Those elements feed into the game’s combat sequences, too. I found myself flying around the battlefield as Harlowe, employing powerful gadgets to hold enemies in stasis or blast them with an incredible launcher that corroded them from the inside out. It’s easy to never stop moving in Borderlands 4, which is great, as you’ll be digging through the map for <strong>many, many hours</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-humor-but-different">Humor, But Different</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a pre-demo presentation, I learned from Gearbox that the traditional humorous elements of Borderlands are still present in Borderlands 4, but they’ve been toned down a little to reflect the tone of the game. I still had a chuckle at some of the more entertaining character introductions and dialogue choices, though.</p>



<p>The core gameplay loop around the campaign has also been altered, going from a mostly linear path to a truly flexible, sandbox-based RPG. You’re free to do what you want, when you want, where you want, and that suits me down to the ground. It has been revealed by Randy Pitchford that Borderlands 4 has immensely tough bosses, so you’ll want to grind and level up before challenging them.</p>



<p>From a technical perspective, I played Borderlands 4 on both controller and with a keyboard and mouse, and both inputs were accessible, enjoyable, and familiar. I didn’t experience a single bug in an hour, the game rendered and ran beautifully, and the weapon variation and abilities popped nicely.</p>



<p>The same old weapons manufacturers are present, but new ones have been added to the mix, and cross-licensing now happens, bringing one brand’s parts and abilities to other weapons – at a cost. Vehicles can be deployed from anywhere, the skill paths are varied and support multiple styles, and customization has been improved.</p>



<p>Like I said, it feels like an entirely new game, but it still takes a few key elements from the older titles. </p>



<h2 id="h-officially-a-contender">Officially a Contender</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>I’d say that Borderlands 4 is a contender for Game of the Year. Given how strong the year has been for me thus far, that’s not a light statement. I was overwhelmingly impressed by Borderlands 4 during my preview at Gamescom, and one hour of gameplay wasn’t enough for me.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">love that Randy Pitchford</a> has for this game is so clear and tangible, which also fills me with faith for the road ahead.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The wait for Crimson Desert keeps getting longer, and players have been patient since 2019 to finally see the game in action. As we wait, Insider Gaming had the chance to play the preview build for Crimson Desert at Gamescom 2025, and here are our early thoughts on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those unaware, Crimson Desert is an upcoming open-world action adventure set on the continent of Pywel. Players take on the role of Kliff, the leader of the Greymanes, as they explore this beautiful yet brutal landscape, defending Pywel from all types of foes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-complicated-yet-exciting-combat">Complicated Yet Exciting Combat</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Crimson Desert preview build was around 50 minutes long, which was easily one of the longest demos at the event. During this time, players received a comprehensive tutorial on combat and movement, experienced a war sequence, and engaged in a proper boss fight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right from the get-go, youre introduced to a variety of moves and skills, and that’s just with one weapon. You can get in all types of different combos and special moves by using different button combinations. However, this game is not a button masher, and repeating the same moves might get you through the minions, but you really need to know your skillset when taking on the bosses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players were only able to face one faction during the preview, which featured several enemy times. Some were small and quick, inflicting relatively minor damage at once but causing more damage over time. The other type was big and slow, but could unleash some hefty blows at the same time. </p>



<p>The boss is an entirely different matter—a true monster who could eliminate you in an instant if you found yourself cornered. There’s a specific system in place, and if you’re not adhering to it, you’ll find yourself in a challenging situation.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-great-blend-of-magic-and-brute-force-nbsp">A Great Blend of Magic and Brute Force&nbsp;</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Combat heavily relies on melee combat, but it’s blended with several magic-based skills. You were able to access three different types of elements in the preview build: Fire, Freeze, and Thunder, which can be used to enchant your weapons and deal some mighty blows to the enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We had access to two different types of arrows, too, for ranged attacks. One of the other weapons could be imbued with one of your chosen elements to inflict damage as well as a status effect on the enemies. The other arrow called for a barrage of raining fire arrows from the sky, damaging masses of enemies at once.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It took me some time to get used to all the attacks and abilities they had to offer, but once things started going, I was having a whole lot of fun. I was slashing one enemy, stabbing another; I think I even pulled off a WWE move once, smacking the enemy straight down into the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-visual-treat-nbsp">A Visual Treat&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The graphics and performance of Crimson Desert were brilliant, at least for a preview build. <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pearl Abyss</a> brings players to an intriguing fantasy world, which is filled with all types of flora and fauna. The world feels massive, although I was only able to explore a tiny part of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With such a massive world, you need to have different ways to traverse, and the game offers several. Of course, like most games, you can jump and sprint wherever you need to go, and there are plenty of climbable surfaces. On top of that, the main character has a floating/gliding ability, which can be used to cover a lot of distance when dropping from heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You also have a trusty steed, like most fantasy games. However, the horse’s movement felt very clunky and slow; it needs a bit of work. Sprinting was almost always faster to get to a location.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Crimson Desert has excellent potential and has a lot going for it. It will be the perfect title for players who are looking to sink their teeth into a new fantasy adventure. Combat is extensive and complex. It can be unforgiving at times, especially with the bosses, if you don’t know your way around it.&nbsp;It isn’t a Soulslike game, but it will require some effort from casual gamers.</p>



<p>However, there was not a lot to explore in Crimson Desert’s open world, so it’s hard to tell how it’s shaping up or if it feels lived in. At the same time, if the developers have put in the same amount of attention to detail with the world design as they have with combat, then players have a solid experience waiting for them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight’s reveal at Gamescom 2025 has ignited a wealth of excitement for the upcoming title from TT Games, and we’ve gathered everything we know about the release date.</p>



<p>Revealed as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next LEGO title from TT Games</a>, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight impressed us during a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a>, although some eyebrows have been raised with marketing stating that there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-will-feature-only-7-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only seven playable characters</a> in the game.</p>



<p>There’s still plenty to be revealed about LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, and, if you want to begin your countdown to release, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-have-a-release-date">Does LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight Have a Release Date?</h2>

<p><strong>No, a precise release date for LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has not been shared by TT Games.</strong></p>



<p>After being revealed at Gamescom, it’s understandable that players are keen to know exactly when they will be able to get their hands on the title, but there’s going to be a bit of a wait before those details become available.</p>



<p>In fact, don’t expect a precise release date to be shared this year, given the release window that has been issued is pretty broad.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-window">What is The LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Release Window?</h2>



<p><strong>TT Games announced at Gamescom, following the reveal of LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, that the release window for the title is 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike many other games, no specific month or season for <a href="https://warnerbrosgames.com/article/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>‘s launch has been shared, resulting in a pretty broad window, but there are some trends that could be followed.</p>



<p>For example, Grand Theft Auto 6 is looming large in 2026 with a release date in May, and most, if not all, developers will want to avoid going head-to-head against the titan, giving it is expected to be one of the biggest gaming launches of all time.</p>



<p>Although LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga was released in April 2022, that was an outlier in TT Games’ history, as, traditionally, releases have come in May/June or September/October/November.</p>



<p>In 2018, LEGO: DC Super-Villains was released in October, while in 2017, LEGO: Marvel Superheroes 2 was released in November. Going back further, LEGO Dimensions was released in September 2015, and LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham was released in November 2014.</p>



<p>Though that doesn’t clear the release window up exactly, it does mean that TT Games’ previous schedule suggests we won’t see LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight in the first half of 2026.</p>
