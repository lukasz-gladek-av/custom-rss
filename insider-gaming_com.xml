<p>A new claim states that Fortnite has already begun work on its next anime collaboration, and it’s none other than Chainsaw Man. </p>



<p>Fortnite is known for collaborating with franchises and properties across all media of entertainment. Some of their most popular collaborations have been anime-related, with the game bringing in characters from Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-next-big-anime-collaboration-for-chapter-7-season-1-has-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bleach</a>, Jujutsu Kaisen, and more to the island across the years. It seems they will build on this foundation with another highly popular anime, Chainsaw Man. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-chainsaw-man-in-the-works">Fortnite x Chainsaw Man in the Works</h2>



<p>The Fortnite x Chainsaw Man collaboration’s claim comes from SamLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/2008156723803254943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter); the leaker had previously accurately revealed the Bleach collaboration. However, no other details were revealed, such as the release window, the included characters, or the mythics. But the players have already started making their character wishlists, with Denji, Makima, Reze, and Power as the top contenders. Some are also praying for Pochita to arrive as a Sidekick in the game. </p>



<p>Epic Games has already gone the OG anime route by bringing in names like Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, and Bleach, with One Piece being the only one remaining from the big 3. However, they have been targetting more recent anime as well, with Jujutsu Kaisen, Kaiju No. 8 and My Hero Academia along with Chainsaw Man expected to join the lineup soon. </p>







<p>In other news, Chainsaw Man’s director was working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chainsaw-man-director-is-working-on-a-new-horror-game-for-roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new horror game for Roblox</a> earlier in 2025. Additionally, Shroud has predicted that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-arc-raiders-fortnite-hot-take/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders will be ‘bigger</a> than Fortnite’.

<p>The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is reportedly set to receive new DLC in 2026, developed by Fool’s Theory. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-rumored-to-get-brand-new-dlc-in-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reports</a> about a new Witcher 3 DLC have been circulating online since June 2025, when it was claimed that the third major expansion for the game would be announced in 2025; however, it never was. New details have now surfaced online thanks to a Polish Noble Securities Analyst, which provide an expected release window for the DLC as well as The Witcher 4. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-3-s-2026-dlc-will-kickoff-a-proper-marketing-campaign-for-the-witcher-4">The Witcher 3’s 2026 DLC Will Kickoff a “Proper Marketing Campaign for The Witcher 4”</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-there-really-going-to-be-a-2026-witcher-3-expansion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Polish Noble Securities Analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke about</a> The Witcher 3’s new DLC releasing in May  2026. Chrzanowski has stated that The Witcher 3’s next paid DLC will arrive in May 2026 and will be developed by Fool’s Theory, who are also working on the Witcher 1 Remake. The new expansion is expected to “kick off the proper marketing campaign for The Witcher 4.” The analyst also predicted that The Witcher 4 will release in Q4 2027. </p>



<p>Eurogamer also followed up on the original source, Borys Nieśpielak, who stated that the information about The Witcher 3’s 2026 DLC has been verified by “several” independent sources. Nieśpielak also pointed to a statement from CD Projekt RED’s recent earnings call, which states that “Given our current progress, there is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year.” However, CD Projekt RED’s official response states that the company “does not comment on rumour or speculation”. </p>
