<p>Marvel Rivals has announced a new, limited-time game mode, Clone Rumble, which will launch on March 7, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Clone Rumble is a new game mode where players must rely on strategy, teamwork and ‘controlled chaos’. Each team will be allowed to select one Hero, and the remaining players must choose between these two. The battlefield will become an “ultimate mirror showdown”, where players will find clones of the same Hero battling each other across the map.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Marvel Rivals Clone Rumble, players will have to adapt to survive. They need to coordinate with team members using the same Hero to bolster their strength and figure out how to exploit the weaknesses of the opposing Hero. Everyone on the map will use the same Hero and abilities, so efficiency and tactical movements will be key.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1896953790915391788" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> for Marvel Rivals Clone Rumble provides us with a glimpse of all the chaos that awaits us on March 7. The video starts with a row of 6 Mr. Fantastics marching around the map before they clash with a group of another 6 Reed Richards. We also see a swarm of Punishers wreaking absolute destruction across the map, with turrets popping up in every nook and corner.&nbsp;A new Black Widow skin will also be introduced, called Widow of Timely. It can be claimed through Galacta’s Cosmic Adventure. </p>

<p>The first Battlefield Labs playtest will start this week, Insider Gaming has learned.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Battlefield Labs will have its first playtest to test “concepts and mechanics” on Friday March 7th. The playtest will be the first in EA’s new Battlefield Labs program, which was announced earlier this year. The first test is scheduled to take place for approximately two hours on the PC.</p>



<p>According to the email sent to participants, the test is in a “closed test environment” and recording, streaming, and discussions about the game are strictly prohibited. But whether participants stick to such a confidentiality agreement remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Players can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still sign up to the Battlefield Labs</a> in order to try and gain access to future Battlefield playtests.</p>



<p>Battlefield Labs is said to be EA’s “most ambitious community development collaboration ever, where a select number of fans will step inside the war room.”</p>



<p>Its announcement saw hundreds of thousands of people sign up, with EA assuring players that no matter when you register, you’ll still be as equally eligible to be accepted as those who registered first.</p>



<p>The playtest comes as DICE and EA want to work more closely with the community after Battlefield 2042’s fumbled launch, which was poorly received by the community.</p>



<p>The next Battlefield title is scheduled to release later this year on the Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>Have you already signed up to the Battlefield Labs playtests? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>&nbsp;if you have any success.</p>

<p>The release window for Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has seemingly been confirmed by one of the game’s voice actors. </p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, voice actor Khary Payton said that the current plan for the game’s launch is around Christmas time this year.</p>



<p>“We’re still working,” the Black Panther voice actor said. “We’re planning on 2025… We’re thinking like a Christmas situation. But I’m so excited.”</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-wonder-woman-canceled-and-is-it-the-games-media-s-fault">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wonder-woman-canceled-and-is-it-the-games-medias-fault/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Woman Canceled And Is It The Games Media’s Fault?</a></h6>



<p>A Christmas 2025 release is the most definitive information regarding the game that fans have gotten in some time. The game was first revealed during GDC 2024 with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-revealed-along-with-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its name and first trailer</a> shown. Since then, however, it’s been quiet on all fronts as the game’s development continues.</p>



<p>Set in occupied Paris during World War II, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is based on the 2010 limited series comic Captain America / Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers. The story follows an alliance between Black Panther and Captain America as they work to prevent Hydra from coming into power. The game will allow players to control one of four main protagonists throughout, including Captain America Steve Rogers, Azzuri (Black Panther), the leader of the Wakandan Spy Network Nanali, and Howling Commandos member Gabriel Jones.</p>



<p>Neither developer Skydance New Media nor publisher Plaion have commented officially on the game’s release date. Should the Christmas 2025 window be confirmed, it’s likely to happen sometime in the next few months as more gaming events such as Game Developers Conference 2025 and Summer Games Fest 2025 take place.</p>



<p>What do you think of a Christmas 2025 release window for Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1721/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
