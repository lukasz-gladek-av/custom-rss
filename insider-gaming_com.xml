<p>Fortnite Chapter 6 is finally coming to an end. It’s been another incredible part of the game’s long journey, and it culminates in the wild-looking Zero Hour event. Let’s find out what it is, and what to expect from the looming Chapter 6 finale.</p>



<p>No one expected Fortnite to go in as hard as it did on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-springfield-map-coming-crossover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons</a> collaboration. And yet, the entire map became Springfield, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ned-flanders-has-eliminated-over-33000-fortnite-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ned Flanders</a> caused chaos, and some of the most famous characters fought back as bosses!</p>



<p>All good things must come to an end, and Fortnite Chapter 6’s finale brings us Zero Hour.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-zero-hour-event-explained">Fortnite Zero Hour Event, Explained</h2>

<p><strong>Zero Hour is a transitional event that will likely remove The Simpsons theme, and is doing so in the form of a giant battle between titanic characters, including a giant Homer, Godzilla, King Kong, and features Star Wars, Kill Bill, and more, and you will likely need to defeat one or more of these forces.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite seasons and chapters always go out in style. This looks like an Infinity War-style battle, bringing together multiple renowned franchises for one seismic battle. It makes sense as leaks have indicated that the collabs and crossovers will continue.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kill Bill</a> has already been identified in the Zero Hour trailer, and leakers say a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-pass-leaks-reveal-back-to-the-future-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Back to the Future crossover</a> is happening. It could be that this live event will shake the foundations of time and space, resulting in Fortnite characters time-hopping!</p>



<p>Unfortunately, we don’t have much concrete information, but this is what the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-hour-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Hour</a> trailer is pointing to.</p>

<h2 id="h-when-is-fortnite-chapter-6-ending-finale-date-explained">When Is Fortnite Chapter 6 Ending? Finale Date, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Fortnite Chapter 6 concludes on November 29 or November 30—depending on your region and timezone—as the event will last a certain amount of time, and then there will be the usual few hours of downtime, enabling the transition from Chapter 6 to Chapter 7.</strong></p>



<p>Get your hours in now while you can. The Chapter 6 finale will be here before you know it. However, it’s not all doom and gloom if you’re sad about the season wrapping up. More leaks have already dropped, revealing new gameplay mechanics that will reshape <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite in Chapter 7</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-leaks-reveal-driveable-reboot-vans-bots-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Chapter 7 leaks are saying that Driveable Reboot Vans and a ‘Bots Mode’</a> are on their way to the game. This will be huge for revives, and the game mode is perfect for those in need of warming up or grinding some easy XP.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s battle royale mode, REDSEC, is getting an esports competition, the Elite Series, featuring a $1 million prize pool in the first season from December 10 to January 18. </p>



<p>The Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series will kick off on December 10, 2025. Alongside the Elite Series, we will also see the launch of Open Series on December 12, 2025. The Open Series will be a competition for players of all skill levels, whereas the Elite Series will be the best REDSEC has to offer in the competitive phase. All competitions will feature cross-platform and cross-input environments, with players able to use a controller or mouse &amp; keyboard on PC or console. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-battlefield-redsec-elite-series-work">How Does Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series Work?</h2>



<p>The new Elite Series will feature weekly competitive cash cups divided across three regions: The Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA), and Asia-Pacific (APAC). 50 team captains from each region will be invited, each with a squad of 4, for a total of 600 competitors. </p>



<p>These 50 squads will go through a series of six REDSEC Battle Royale matches, which will end with the top eight squads battling head-to-head in a gauntlet. The format will be repeated over three Qualifying Match Days, with squads earning Elite Series Points for their performance.&nbsp;After this period, the top-25 squads will progress to the regional Season Finals. </p>



<p>All matches will be online, streamed by all competitors, and Battlefield Studios will host the Season Finals broadcast for each region. The Americas region will have a $50,000 USD prize pool for each Qualifying Match Day, as well as a $500,000 USD prize pool split across all participating squads in the Finals Gauntlet.&nbsp;The APAC and EMEA regions will have a $20,000 USD prize pool for each Qualifying Match Day, and a $285,000 USD prize pool for the Finals Gauntlet.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-redsec-elite-series-season-1-schedule">Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series Season 1 Schedule</h2>



<p>The start time for each season will be announced closer to the Qualifying match day, but here are the Match Day and Season Finals dates: </p>



<ul>
<li>Match Day #1 – Wednesday, December 10, 2025</li>



<li>Match Day #2 – Thursday, December 11, 2025</li>

<li>Season Finals – Thursday, December 18, 2025</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-does-battlefield-redsec-open-series-work">How Does Battlefield REDSEC Open Series Work? </h2>



<p>The Open Series will also be held in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. Players can register their squads on <a href="http://repeat.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Repeat.gg</a> (see the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/redsec/news/introducing-competitive-battlefield-redsec?utm_campaign=battlefield_hd_ww_ic_ic_twitter_&amp;utm_content=1763655670&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a> for more details), and on each match day, they can find the tournament code in the Repeat App. Scoring will be based on the cumulative 10 best Battle Royale and the 10 best Gauntlet matches played across all three Match Days. The top 250 teams will qualify from each region for the Season Finals, and the top 8 teams will qualify for next season’s Elite Series. </p>



<p>Open Series will feature a $30,000 prize pool, with $10,000 reserved for each region. </p>
