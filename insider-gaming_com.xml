            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Borderlands 4 boasts the biggest evolution of the series thus far. It’s the most ambitious game the team at Gearbox has ever created, boasting a seamless open-world map, numerous hours of exploration-based opportunities, and a core gameplay loop that facilitates endless playstyles.</p>



<p>I caught up with Randy Pitchford, Gearbox CEO, at Gamescom, and took a deep dive into the changes that will help to differentiate Borderlands 4 from Borderlands 3. He wasn’t afraid to admit he’s nervous about one key change that will alter the game’s difficulty rating.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-borderlands-4-hard">Is Borderlands 4 Hard?</h2>



<p>I played Borderlands 4 for an hour at Gamescom and can confirm that it’s not <strong>super tough</strong>. I <em>was </em>playing on a lower difficulty level, so it’s tough to give an accurate representation of how the game will feel when you’re playing with more users to push the challenges up and running the game at a higher difficulty grade.</p>



<p>Going into my interview with Randy Pitchford, I knew that the team at Gearbox had designed some of the toughest bosses in franchise history. I was curious why and how that challenge would be felt by even the most die-hard veterans of the series.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have lots of players that actually aren’t interested in deep, hard challenges; lots of people that love just exploring the Borderlands or spending time with the characters.</p>



<p><strong>I’m a little nervous because there are points of Borderlands 4 that are more challenging</strong>, but one of the coolest things about Borderlands 4, because of the nature of the RPG, is if anything is a little challenging for you, you can just grind somewhere and level up and become more powerful.</p>



<p>You will find that things that were hard when you were a little chump will become trivial when you become a badass.</p>



<p>But we definitely have pushed the challenges quite a lot, especially with bosses and boss fight mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans of the series will recognize this gameplay mechanic. If you can’t defeat an enemy, go away and level up, and you’ll do much better on your successive pass at that boss or objective.</p>



<p>In my exclusive Gamescom demo, I got to control Harlowe, one of the game’s more technical Vault Hunters, and I faced off against a fairly challenging boss, a ‘Spy Master’ of the game’s ‘Timekeeper’ big bad. It was innovative, enjoyable, and satisfying, even considering my hatred for intense challenges.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nvidia graphics cards are getting a bit cheaper in Europe as the company has lowered the prices of a number of RTX 50-series GPUs.</p>



<p>Cut by nearly 10% in some cases, the RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070 have seen their prices drop across the region. The move comes as the Euro contains to strengthen against the United States (US) dollar.</p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-cuts-geforce-rtx-50-prices-in-europe-as-eur-strengthens-against-us-dollar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>, the top-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 is retailing for €2,099, a 9.88% drop from the launch price of €2,329. The next-highest card, the RTX 5080, is now 9.4% lower at €1,059. The RTX 5070 has fallen 9.24% from €649 to €589. Lastly, the low-end RTX 5050 has a smaller drop, but still a drop nonetheless, of 6.7% to €251.</p>

<p>While the prices are lower in Europe, there’s been no sign that the US will see anything similar any time soon. Due to the state of global economics, companies are looking at ways they can continue to sell products while generating revenue. In this instance, it’s more of a case of adjusting for the aforementioned strength of the Euro against the US dollar than anything else.</p>



<p>With the prices a bit lower, are you going to pick up a new Nvidia GPU? Let us know down below, and take the discussion even further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p>The Division 2 has revealed its Year 7 roadmap for 2025 and beyond at Gamescom. Furthermore, the next season of the title is only a few weeks away.</p>



<p>Developed by Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment, The Division 2 has been going steadily since its release in 2019. Taking over for the original, the game has expanded its boundaries, both in locations like Washington, DC and in modes like the roguelike Descent. Now, the future of the multiplayer shooter has been laid out, thanks to a new update from Gamescom.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Starting off the new content for Year 7 of The Division 2 is The Pact, a new season launching September 9th, 2025. We get a glimpse of what it will be like in the trailer above. As per <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/4235uGIN3QkbDq4iNQVlT1/the-division-2-at-gamescom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> on The Division 2’s website, The Pact focuses on the enemy factions, which have joined up. New to the season is Retaliation, a permanent open-world activity that adds Control Points mechanics.</p>



<p>After The Pact, the next season, titled Mutiny, will launch later this year. It plans on adding new modifiers, as well as a new companion mechanic. While details are scarce about Mutiny, the team promises that fans will hear more in the coming months. In the roadmap, there is mention of the franchise’s tenth-year anniversary, so there’s many reasons to look forward to that, whether it be The Division 3 or bigger expansions.</p>



<p>What do you think of the upcoming roadmap for The Division 2? Will you be joining in on The Pact and Mutiny? Let us know in the comments and on the forums!</p>

<p>After years of waiting, The Division 2 is getting a survival mode called Survivors is coming in 2026. Announced at Gamescom, the team at Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment showed off some of the new mode.</p>



<p>Since its release in 2019, The Division 2 has been going strong with new updates and expansions. Earlier yesterday, the team laid out the roadmap for Year 7, with plans for two new updates. Beyond that, as revealed today, a whole new way to play will be what fans have been asking for for quite some time.</p>

<p>While a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/division-2-project-gamescom-reveal-panels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tease earlier this month</a> did hint at it, it has now been confirmed that The Division 2 will get a Survival Extraction mode. Called The Division 2: Survivors, the project is in early development with Magnus Jansén directing. However, in <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/enWR3N37m6wAbtZbV4nuA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> on the official page of the game, executive producer Julian Gerighty released a statement, saying:</p>



<p><strong>“The Division 2: Survivors is as much your baby as it is ours, and we strive for transparency during its development,”</strong> Gerighty states. <strong>“Clear communication and community involvement are a focus as we build the new experience, and we will be closely involving you as we move forward on the development journey.”</strong></p>



<p>Concept art of the mode, including Survivors’ logo, can be found on the blog, as well. We see some familiar landmarks in Washington, DC, all dusted in snow. Given how the base game plays, it’ll be interesting to see how the mode comes out. Still, it seems like it may be far off in terms of release. However, the team sounds positive that it will live up to expectations.</p>
