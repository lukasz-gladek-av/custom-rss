<p>For the third consecutive month since its release, the Nintendo Switch 2 led the way in sales in the United States (US) for August 2025.</p>



<p>According to the latest data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m2op7exr2426">Circana</a>, released on Wednesday, the Switch 2 was the top system in both units sold and dollars for the month. The system’s strong sales were <strong>“able to able to offset double-digit percentage declines across each of PlayStation 5, Xbox Series and Switch.”</strong></p>



<p>Looking at the numbers, video game hardware sales rose by 32% year-over-year for August to $312M. In year-to-date numbers, sales have reached $2.9 billion, a 20% jump from last year’s numbers at this time. </p>



<p>Sticking with the Switch 2, Nintendo’s latest console has passed 2.4 million units sold in the US as of August 30. That puts it 5% ahead of the pace of the PlayStation 4’s 2.2 million sold in its first three months. Comparing it to the original Switch, which launched for just $299 in 2017, unit sales are currently 77% ahead of pace for the Switch 2.</p>



<p>Moving to accessories, spending there fell by 6% year-over-year to $169 million. That said, the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller was, once again, the best-selling accessory in terms of both units sold and total dollars. One area that did increase, however, was in racing accessories. Sales increased by 7% year-over-year while total year-to-date sales rose 3% to $78M.</p>

<p>Fans of Little Nightmares 1 and 2 will love Little Nightmares 3. That tells you a lot about the nature of the game’s contents, setting, unsettling atmosphere, and flaws. Supermassive Games has taken over from Tarsier Games, but has remained faithful to the franchise to a teeth-chattering T.</p>



<p>There’s a perverse enjoyment in playing Little Nightmares games. After all, you’re basically forcing children to live out their nightmares and worst dreams come to life. But the cathartic conclusions make each journey memorable. Little Nightmares 2’s improvement over the first was incremental. I’d go as far as saying that’s the case for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> as well.</p>



<p>While the game’s air is thick with dread, the stench lingering in the air is recognizable. We’ve inhaled this scent before. This is Supermassive Games’ first attempt to awaken a new nightmare, and there’s a lot to love.</p>



<h2 id="h-little-nightmares-3-review">Little Nightmares 3 Review</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a> follows in the footsteps of its predecessors: It’s a new game, a new world, with new unfortunate characters. This time around, we’re focusing on Low and Alone. The former wears a raven mask and sports a bow, whereas Alone looks like a perfect Sid Wilson Slipknot cosplayer with a full green jumpsuit, goggles, and a mean wrench.</p>



<p>The second game in the series introduced an AI ally to help you along the way. In Little Nightmares 3, you can either go this Alone, or, Low and behold, you can now team up to tackle the terror in co-op. However, it’s <em>online co-op</em> only. This means you can’t have a person join you on the couch to immerse yourselves and absorb the action on-screen together. </p>



<p>I played Little Nightmares 3 in single-player, so I only have the experience of my reasonably competent AI partner to call upon, but while the addition of co-op is much-needed, the decision to leave out couch co-op is a headscratcher, as it’s an obvious inclusion. On the plus side, the Friends Pass system—popularized by A Way Out and Split Fiction—is used, meaning two people can play together with only one copy of the game.</p>



<p>The AI has the odd moments of madness. I controlled Alone, and Low would occasionally ignore me—stopping me from getting a collectible or interacting with the environment—they would get in the way and block my path, and randomly not move, forcing me to restart the checkpoint. Otherwise, it was a fairly coherent experience, just one I wish I could’ve had with someone sitting next to me.</p>



<p>Little Nightmares 3 is split into four juicy chapters, with each biome proving to be as distinct as the last: From a crazy carnival to a madhouse. The goal to escape ‘The Nowhere’ took me around 7-8 hours—making it the deepest entry yet—and the signature blend of platforming and puzzles makes Little Nightmares 3 a scarily fun proposition.</p>



<h2 id="h-highs-and-lows-and-alones">Highs And Lows (And Alones)</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Light the way forward. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The end goal is to make it through each level’s series of treacherous traps, chase sequences, and puzzles. Admittedly, these aren’t the hardest brainteasers, and I can count on one hand how many times I genuinely had to take a second to figure out what to do next. There are plenty of fun concepts sprinkled throughout the game, from a special doll that changes the world around you and opens up new avenues to thinking outside the box to get around deaf enemies.</p>



<p>Hidden trap doors, environmental obstacles, and remembering your character’s abilities are all required to push forward. Low’s bow triggers buttons, cuts ropes, and immobilizes enemies; on the other hand, Alone’s wrench breaks glass to open new paths, bulldozes holes through walls, and also finishes off the aforementioned enemies.</p>



<p>Even though you have weapons, the rare combat skirmish you encounter is awkward. The timing of strikes and the proximity of your characters to enemies feel off. I think it also takes away from the game’s defence mechanism when you can fight back, and the franchise benefits from the fear of helplessness.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the chase sequences remain as exhilarating as ever, and the platforming never lets up. It feels tight and responsive, and even in scenarios where your perspective is horribly warped or your depth perception is challenged, the game does a great job of assisting you.</p>



<p>It does feel a bit repetitive towards the end of its runtime, and its biggest weakness is the same gameplay styling that has existed since day one: Trial and error. Sometimes you have to relive excessive passages of gameplay multiple times, which can greatly eat up time. While many can tolerate the intended nature of this loop, I found it frustrating in Little Nightmares 1, and it’s just as gratuitous and oppressive now.</p>



<h2 id="h-little-nightmares-3-review-verdict">Little Nightmares 3 Review Verdict</h2>



<p>The addition of co-op (albeit limiting) and the use of a free Friends Pass system is a win-win. If you have played a Little Nightmares game before, though, don’t expect a wildly different experience, but it’s still different enough to help Little Nightmares 3 stand on its own four feet. Supermassive Games has more than demonstrated its expertise in horror and flexed its chops here, while adding in new mechanics and madness along the way. The franchise is in safe hands, and I look forward to the next installment of Tim Burton-esque horror.</p>

<p>Skate’s controversial decision to have microtransactions in early access has been exacerbated by an extortionate and terrible-looking Isaac Clarke skin from EA’s Dead Space franchise.</p>



<p>EA’s newest Skate title arrived to much chagrin and dismay. The community feels the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skate-to-enter-early-access-on-september-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skate early access</a> launch is a soulless cash-grab, and the decision to include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-adds-microtransactions-to-skates-closed-alpha/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">microtransactions</a> was never going to go down well. It’s hard to be objective as well when you see the state of the new Dead Space bundle in Skate that EA is charging you a <em>lot </em>of money for.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-space-amp-skate-bundle-is-made-of-cardboard-literally">Dead Space &amp; Skate Bundle Is Made Of Cardboard, Literally</h2>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Not cheap. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>What is that? Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>The new Isaac Clarke bundle in the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate?isLocalized=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Skate</a> shop sure is something. To be fair, it does come with other accessories, including player profile cosmetics and flourishes for your board. But the main reason anyone wants this is for the Isaac Clarke skin.</p>



<p>Did you know Skate 3 had an Isaac Clarke skin that was completely free and simply required a code to unlock? Furthermore, it looked exactly like Isaac’s real suit in the game. In 2025, Skate’s early access offers a bundle that costs upwards of $40, and it looks like a last-second Halloween outfit made of painted cardboard.</p>



<p>We had to study this for ourselves. On the Skate store, you buy the San Van Bucks separately; the cheapest it costs is £30.97 (buying 2,800 SVB and two lots of 500 SVB), which equates to <strong>just over $40</strong>. </p>



<p>Or you can buy the Founder’s Deluxe Pack for $49.99, which has more than enough San Van Bucks and extra content.</p>







<p>What do you think? Is EA going too far with this? Or should it be expected? We’re very interested ot hear your thoughts in the comments below, and through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
