            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’ve finally learned about Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s first DLC—Mega Dimension. It adds new Mega Evolutions and missions, but we’ve also learned that your Pokémon can go above Level 100—a series first.</p>



<p>For decades, the rule on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-first-year-revenue-estimates-hit-1-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> has been simple: Once your Mon reaches Level 100, it has pretty much reached the peak of its powers. Yes, it will be extraordinarily strong and unbeatable, and one of them can pretty much sit on the Elite Four single-handedly, but Level 101 is out of the question.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-go-over-the-level-100-pokemon-cap-in-mega-dimension-dlc">You Can Go Over The Level 100 Pokémon Cap In Mega Dimension DLC</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Level 162?? Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you look at the screenshot above, you can see the new Mega Baxcalibur and its mind-blowing <strong>Lv. 162 status</strong>. So, not only are we breaching Level 100 for the first time, we’re completely jumping the shark.</p>



<p>As shown by the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A DLC trailer for Mega Dimensions</a>, Pokémon can finally breach the max level cap.</p>



<p>An official <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Discover-Hyperspace-Lumiose-and-New-Mega-Evolutions-in-Pokemon-Legends#:~:text=Venturing%20into%20Hyperspace%20Lumiose,strange%20events%20befalling%20Lumiose%20City" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a> explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In&nbsp;Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension,&nbsp;Trainers will revisit Lumiose as spatial distortions begin to form around the city. Donut chef Ansha and her companion, the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa, will guide players as they explore the mysterious dimension known as Hyperspace Lumiose. This not-quite Lumiose City is home to newly discovered Mega-Evolved Pokémon and other Pokémon not usually found in Lumiose, <strong>some of which can exceed the normal limit of Lv. 100 with hyperspace levels.</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This seems like a gimmick feature exclusive to the Mega Dimension DLC. We’re not 100% how the mechanic works, but it’s likely these will only be temporary level boosts, and your Pokémon won’t be able to stay above Level 100 for the entire game.</p>
