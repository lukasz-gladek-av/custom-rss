<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is Ubisoft’s first Day One release on Steam it’s already climbed the platform’s all-time player peak charts to become third in series history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/not-even-1-day-after-release-assassins-creed-shadows-player-count-on-steam-already-has-valhalla-beat-and-now-its-coming-for-odyssey-and-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>), Assassin’s Creed Shadows is off to a great start on Steam, achieving an all-time player peak of 41,412 on the first day (at the time of writing). To compare, Shadows has more than doubled AC Valhalla’s numbers, which peaked at 15,679 2.3 years ago. It is less than 150 players away from beating AC Origins’ peak, 41,551, which arrived 7.4 years ago. AC Odyssey still stands strong at the moment, peaking at 62,069 6.4 years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding AC Shadows reviews on Steam, things seem to be going well for Ubisoft, with the platform categorising it as “Very Positive”.

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the latest instalment of Ubisoft’s popular series. For those unaware of the game, the new setting takes players to Feudal Japan, where they explore a fresh narrative set in a vast open world through the eyes of dual protagonists.</p>



<p>The new protagonists are Yasuke and Naoe, both featuring distinct playstyles. One is a stealthy Assassin, and the other is a legendary Samurai; players must master both characters to take down enemies with precision and power. The game also introduces a fully customisable hideout where you train your crew, craft/upgrade weapons, and interact with characters.&nbsp;</p>
