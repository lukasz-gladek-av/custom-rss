<p>2026 is in full swing, and there’s plenty to look forward to in gaming this year. However, with so much on the calendar, it’s easy to lose track of what’s dropping and when.</p>



<p>From major drops to indie games worth your attention, Insider Gaming has selected several games worth checking out releasing in the week of January 12.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-games-releasing-january-12-18-2026">Biggest Games Releasing January 12-18, 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-hytale">Hytale</h3>

<p>Launching into early access on January 13 after years of waiting, exclusively on PC, gamers have been warned that the title is very much a work in progress, but that’s unlikely to stop hordes of players from immediately diving into the Minecraft-inspired world at the first opportunity.</p>



<p>The open-world sandbox has stunning visuals, with teaser images and clips showing everything from barren deserts to bountiful forests, alongside a variety of creatures and monsters. While it’s unclear how much of that will be available immediately, the depth that Hytale offers long-term will be difficult to match.</p>



<h3 id="h-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Squad up. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Admittedly not a new release, with the game turning six this year, the Nintendo Switch 2 edition comes along the mammoth 3.0 update, offering a hefty chunk of DLC-sized content for all players and doesn’t require any extra purchases.</p>



<p>The 3.0 update includes the addition of a new hotel, with customizable rooms to fit a desired theme, new collab items to unlock, and new villagers, so there’s plenty to offer for both new and returning players.</p>



<h3 id="h-quarantine-zone">Quarantine Zone</h3>

<p>Launching January 12 on PC, Quarantine Zone puts players in control of managing a checkpoint in a collapsing city during a zombie outbreak. Players utilise advanced screening tools and their own intuition to decide whether a survivor is free to pass through, or if the doors are slammed in their face.</p>



<p>One wrong move can quickly lead to your downfall, and players also need to manage resources, reinforce defences, and keep your camp alive in this chaos-filled strategy simulator.</p>



<h3 id="h-cassette-boy">Cassette Boy</h3>

<p>Anyone seeking a new puzzle adventure to sink time into should take a look at Casette Boy, which launches on January 15 across PlayStation 5, PC, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Players must rotate a 2D pixel-styled 3D world to uncover the mystery of the vanished moon, utilizing new weapons and equipment to improve their survival chances in exploration and combat.</p>



<h3 id="h-brokenlore-unfollow">BrokenLore: UNFOLLOW</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Haunting. Image via Serafini Productions</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’re up for a haunt, BrokenLore: UNFOLLOW is definitely a title to check out, with the first-person psychological horror exploring the impact of social media on mental health. The concept certainly grabs attention, and the sinister creatures you will encounter are truly terrifying.</p>



<p>BrokenLore: UNFOLLOW launches January 16 on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.</p>



<h3 id="h-craftlings">Craftlings</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Choices. Image via Ariano Games GmbH</figcaption></figure>



<p>Launching January 15 exclusively on PC, Crafdtlings is “inspired by legendary classics from the ’90s”, pulling players along in a journey full of strategic decisions, testing players to optimize automated production chains.</p>



<p>The Craftlings themselves are tiny humanoids you put to work to shape the world around you, improving your settlement with various building types, including farms and barracks. It’s not all smooth sailing, though, as there’s always the risk of encountering danger as you progress through different biomes and environments.</p>

<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was a critically acclaimed smash in 2025. It was also the debut release from French video game development team Sandfall Interactive.</p>



<p>Now that they have had time to reflect on the work that went into the successful RPG, senior members of the team are praising their staff for making such a beloved game.</p>











<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-basically-did-twice-the-work-of-a-more-experienced-team-to-get-the-hit-french-rpg-out-the-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Edge Magazine (via GamesRadar+), </a>the game’s lead designer, Michel Nora, explained that one of the benefits of working with a younger staff was the lack of expectations of what a studio should be and how a game should be made.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[The younger staff] didn’t have any expectations about how a studio should be run and how a game should be made, and they brought fresh ideas that were very valuable for the rest of the project. So it ended up being a good decision, but it was also kind of by force, because it’s almost impossible to hire any senior people if you don’t have the money, which wasn’t there at the beginning.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Game producer Francois Neurisse also chimed in, saying that working with such a young team meant there were no bad habits brought to the project from other gaming companies, and the team had the benefit of learning alongside one another.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[We were] trying to create something new, and even new skills, from scratch. I’d say we basically did twice the work, because we were doing things for the first time to that scale. [But we had] the opportunity to research and execute the best practices. I also worked a lot of collaborating and exchanging [ideas] with other teams in France, and in Montpellier where many other indie studios are based. I find this industry great, it’s so collaborative among companies, rather than competitive. We benefited a lot from sharing experiences.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Reason Nintendo Traded ‘Nindie Showcase’ Branding For Indie World Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-reason-nintendo-traded-nindie-showcase-branding-for-indie-world-revealed/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Former Nintendo of America employees, Kit and Krysta, have provided some insight as to why the “Nindies” branding went away in favor of showcasing independent games coming to Nintendo consoles via Indie World presentations. Largely, it’s due to Nintendo’s careful protection of its core branding.</p>



<p>In the late 2010s, Nindie Showcases shone a spotlight on games like My Friend Pedro and Yooka-Laylee as they were coming to the Nintendo Switch platform. The Branding of “Nindie” was a playful, creative mashup to showcase indie games coming to Nintendo. Ultimately, despite the creativity and an overall positive energy around the branding, it would be that mashup that would ultimately raise concerns for Nintendo’s legal department.</p>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-doesn-t-want-any-part-of-its-name-being-used-to-create-a-new-word">Nintendo Doesn’t Want Any Part Of Its Name Being Used To Create A New Word</h2>



<p>In a clip from The Kit &amp; Krysta Podcast, the namesake hosts revealed that while Nintendo’s Publisher and Developer Relations Department came up with the term and was very proud of it, they were ultimately told that they’re not allowed to warp the Nintendo name in any way, as it runs the risk of hurting the protection of the brand’s intellectual property.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“You definitely cannot, kind of, cut the Nintendo brand in half and tack it to another word. It dilutes the brand, in the words of legal. It makes it so that you cannot defend your brand later on for some sort of legal dispute,” Krysta said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was said that a representative from Nintendo’s PDR team tried to fight the mandate, but he ultimately lost.</p>

<p>There you have it, you can’t fight City Hall. Unless you’re Rocko Wallaby, that is.</p>
