<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows creative director recently revealed what players should expect from the game’s side quests, and it seems we might get some flashback sequences for Yasuke and Naoe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows creative director Jonathan Dumont recently spoke about the game’s world, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-will-adapt-to-the-character-you-are-playing-with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dual-protagonist system</a>, side-quests and more during an interview with <a href="https://screenrant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-world-protagonists-jonathan-dumont-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screenrant</a>. When asked about the content of the side-quests, Dumont explained three different types, “objective board or bandits”, “relationship-oriented”, and ones that are “hidden behind a couple of meditation mechanics”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows side-quests that are hidden behind these meditation mechanics are the ones that let you “experience the past” of Naoe and Yasuke. At the start of the game, players will not know who these characters are exactly, but with the help of these flashbacks, they will understand why they are here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objective board or bandits side-quests in Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be familiar to players. You need to hunt targets across the world, and they each have different abilities and values. It will be interesting to hunt ninjas and samurais this time around. On the other hand, the relationship ones help players build bonds with different characters, recruit them, and explore romantic options.&nbsp;</p>

Also, the game&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-game-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has the largest file size</a>&nbsp;in the franchise’s history.&nbsp;What are your thoughts on Assassin’s Creed Shadows side-quests?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’s Creative Director has revealed that the game will adapt to the character you are playing with.</p>



<p>Many have wondered how Assassin’s Creed Shadows can be played with two characters with distinct archetypes and backgrounds. What if someone wants to play with only Naoe to be stealthy throughout their experience, or maybe Yasuke to be as aggressive as you can? The developer has now revealed how the game will change according to the player’s preferences while having unique experiences for both characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://screenrant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-world-protagonists-jonathan-dumont-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screenrant</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-director-on-splitting-time-between-the-two-heroes-the-core-of-the-game-can-be-pick-your-character-and-the-game-adapts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Jonathan Dumont, the game’s creative director, spoke at length about how the dual protagonist system will work for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Dumont explained that Yasuke and Naoe are distinct in gameplay but “complementary” in narrative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the story and the world are experienced from “two different sides.” Naoe comes from a Shinobi background, and Yasuke is a stranger but nobility at the same time. Dumont said he likes how “both voices sound very different, in the sense that they look at the world a little bit differently.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dumont added that both Assassin’s Creed Shadows characters will receive “individual introductions and then they get their own questline”. This means Yasuke can’t play Naoe’s personal quests and vice versa. However, “the core of the game can be pick your character, and the game adapts”, explained the creative director.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dumont also clarified that there might be “a couple of choices here and there”, which might make players wonder “what would happen with this character”, but he doesn’t think they are “missing out”. The developers don’t want to force players to “try to split the time”; players can decide whether to stick to one or balance it out.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The WWE Universe is once again preparing itself for War (Games). The release of WWE 2K25 continues 2K’s annual take on professional wrestling. With the profession hotter than ever, the developer is looking to deliver a five-star show worthy of headlining any Wrestlemania.</p>



<p>WWE 2K25 welcomes new wrestlers, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-features-revealed-including-new-game-modes-and-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">match types</a>, and more chaos than ever before. It mirrors real-life WWE in its sense of progression and scope. The Triple H-era of WWE is producing record gates, attendances, and social media numbers and the interest is sky-high. It feels like 2K’s WWE games have been going the same way.</p>



<p>Gameplay footage has already revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-cover-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cover star</a> and a gargantuan amount of graps, and we love it. If you’re also looking forward to 2K25, let’s check out everything we know about its key details.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-release-date">WWE 2K25 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dirty Dom has had it coming. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>WWE 2K25 releases on March 14 for all players, whereas you can get your name on the card earlier on March 7 via Early Access.</strong></p>



<p>March 14 is the official worldwide launch of <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25</a>. This is when anyone with any edition can jump in. But Early Access is a chance for keen fans to flex their muscles (and wallet) by purchasing the Deadman and The Bloodline Editions. </p>



<p>Doing so entitles you to a lot more content, including special <strong>Early Access or WWE 2K25</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-platforms">WWE 2K25 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Steam AKA PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox X|S are the supported platforms available for WWE 2K25.</strong></p>



<p>2K has a habit of launching new titles on as many platforms as possible. While it probably means more work for the developer and gives it a harder time when it comes to optimization and balancing out what works and what doesn’t on old-gen, it’s an inclusive way to bring in as many new fans as possible.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, like another common trend in 2025, the <strong>Nintendo Switch misses out</strong>. The PS4 and Xbox One editions aren’t as equipped as the PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC releases, but they can still handle a solid version of WWE 2K25. The Switch can’t though. </p>



<p>It remains to be seen if the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> can handle WWE 2K25 or future releases.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-editions-amp-price">WWE 2K25 Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>WWE 2K25 has a Standard Edition, Deadman Edition, and The Bloodline Edition to purchase. In order, you are looking at $69.99 or £64.99, $99.99 or £89.99, and $129.99 or £119.99.</strong></p>



<p>These are the RRP figures for each edition of WWE 2K25. If you’re going physical, you might be able to get the wrestling title cheaper elsewhere. Also, there is no super-duper Collector’s Edition or anything like that here.</p>



<p>Check out every edition and its price right here.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">WWE 2K25 Edition</th><th data-align="center">WWE 2K25 Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Standard Edition</td><td data-align="center">$69.99 or £64.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Deadman Edition</td><td data-align="center">$99.99 or £89.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">The Bloodline Edition</td><td data-align="center">$129.99 or £119.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>SEGA’s unwavering commitment to the Yazkuza/Like a Dragon series shows no signs of stopping. Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is the newest release—arriving quite soon after Infinite Wealth—and we’ve put together an all-in-one guide to its key details.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-gets-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> is a new, fully-fledged Like a Dragon game. It’s one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2025-is-the-year-of-the-rpg-upcoming-rpg-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025’s biggest RPGs</a> and Goro Majima is the leading man again as we journey through the franchise’s bizarre new direction. If you thought 2024’s Infinite Wealth was starting to get wacky with its foray into Hawaii, you’ve seen nothing yet.</p>



<p>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii gives overboard on the pirate theme. It looks to be the most swashbuckling entry in the series’ illustrious history and looks to be a cutlass above the rest.</p>



<h2 id="h-like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-release-date">Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It makes you want to scream yarrrr! Credit to SEGA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>February 21 is the release date for Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.</strong></p>



<p>I’m not sure how developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has managed this, but the predecessor Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth was released on Jan. 26, 2024. This means it’s only a <strong>13-month turnaround for the sequel</strong> to happen.</p>



<p><a href="https://ryu-ga-gotoku.com/pirate/asia_en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> isn’t going to be a 100+ hour marathon like many Yakuza games, however, expect to spend a good chunk of time roaming around Hawaii—pillaging and pirating.</p>



<h2 id="h-like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-platforms">Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC are the confirmed platforms Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is available</strong> <strong>on.</strong></p>



<p>Want to play Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii on old-gen hardware? You got it. Fancy seeing Goro on a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S? You can. Or does PC take your fancy? SEGA caters to most people’s needs.</p>



<p>Nintendo Switch is the only major platform missing out as it stands. The power of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-nintendo-switch-2-direct-reveal-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> might mean a future port isn’t out of the question though.</p>



<h2 id="h-like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-editions-amp-price">Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>You can buy a Standard Edition for $59.99 or £54.99, the Deluxe Edition for $74.99 or £74.99, or a Collector’s Edition of Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii for $129.99 or £109.99.</strong></p>



<p>It’s standard fare where Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is concerned. A standard edition is the base game and maybe a pre-order bonus. The Deluxe Edition features a lot more content—usually digital, and the Collector’s Edition is for the biggest fans offering the most sought-after memorabilia.</p>



<p>Here’s an easy-to-read table showing every edition and its costs.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Edition</th><th data-align="center">Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Standard Edition</td><td data-align="center">$59.99 or £54.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Deluxe Edition</td><td data-align="center">$74.99 or £74.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-collectors-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collector’s Edition (Complete Box)</a></td><td data-align="center">$129.99 or £109.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Marvel Rivals developers are going back on their decision of rank resets for the second half of the first season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals recently released a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-detail-season-and-half-season-ranks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer update</a> for the second half of the upcoming season. In it, we learned about the release date, forthcoming changes, and a rank reset that drops players by four divisions. This worried many players, as they would have to drop four ranks now and another six ranks when the second season begins. Naturally, there was a huge uproar, and due to the massive feedback, Netease decided to reverse the decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250211/40954_1211177.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> from Marvel Rivals delves deeper into the concerns around rank reset. NetEase understands that a rank drop every half-season will make the “competitive mode less enjoyable” for the community. Hence, rather than a rank reset, players must “complete 10 matches in Competitive mode and meet the relevant conditions by the end of the season” to earn new rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rewards for the end of the second half will be the same as those they just received. Players will be eligible to earn “a new Gold rank costume and a variety of Crests of Honor, featuring distinct designs for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All.” The Marvel Rivals community is <a href="https://x.com/Valennxxte/status/1889209660822970688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">happy</a> their concerns received a swift response from the devs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals has its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-section-disney-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">own section on Disney Plus</a>. Also, Ninja thinks NetEase’s new game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-dead-ninja-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has killed Overwatch</a>.
