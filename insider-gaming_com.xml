<p>New documents have revealed that People Can Fly and Sony Interactive Entertainment have signed a deal to create a prototype for a game based on Sony’s IP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by Zuby_Tech on <a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1900605141914444110/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), People Can Fly and Sony have signed a “prototype development agreement.” The prototype in question is for a “new video game codenamed Project Delta,” which is based on one of Sony’s IPs.&nbsp;It is unclear which Sony IP Project Delta is based on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Sony and People Can Fly deal states that the latter will be hired through a “work-for-hire model,” meaning they will work as developers for Sony for an “agreed remuneration.” The production agreement states that the game’s development will be divided across milestones. </p>



<p>People Can Fly was recently announced as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/people-can-fly-is-co-developing-gears-of-war-e-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-developer on Gears of War: E-Day</a>, a month after the studio laid off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/people-can-fly-announces-layoffs-impacted-120-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">120 staff members</a>. The studio also cancelled its longtime game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/people-can-fly-cancel-project-dagger-after-years-of-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Dagger</a>, in April last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a PlayStation logo was recently spotted on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-logo-spotted-on-starfield-creation-club-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield’s Creation Club</a> website. Also, a new job listing suggests another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-yet-to-announce-live-service-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-service multiplayer</a> game is in the works. What are your thoughts on Sony and People Can Fly entering this deal?
