<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/apex-legends/" id="27">Apex Legends</a> will end service for the original <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302">Nintendo Switch</a> on August 4. The Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Switch 2</a> version of the game, which launched in August 2025, will remain live.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/respawn-entertainment/" id="95172">Respawn Entertainment</a>, via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" id="52204">EA</a>‘s <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/update-on-nintendo-switch-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>, announced that season 29 will be the final update for Nintendo Switch, with all future updates continuing on the console’s successor. Season 30 begins on August 4.</p>



<p>The development team stressed that all progress, purchases, and earnings are tied to players’ individual EA accounts, and everything will carry over to Nintendo Switch 2, regardless of when you purchase the console. It also stressed that the game will continue to be supported on all other platforms and that the reason for the switch, no pun intended, is to deliver the best possible experience and utilize the power of the Switch 2.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Our goal is to deliver a high-quality experience. Thanks to Nintendo’s investment in the Nintendo Switch 2, the platform offers a great handheld experience for Apex Legends.”</p>

<p>As 2026 will be the first full calendar year with the Nintendo Switch 2 on the market, the transition away from the original Switch continues. Nintendo recently held a dedicated Direct to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-reveals-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-release-date/" id="172885">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>. This is one of the final games designed specifically for the original Nintendo Switch, and it will also be playable on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Additionally, major Nintendo releases such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-release-date-announced/" id="171439">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> are receiving dedicated editions for the new Switch 2, adding enhanced visuals and new modes, further encouraging players to switch over. The Switch 2 had a successful 2025, leading the market in hardware sales for December.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/highguard/" id="3394">Highguard </a>has added a new gameplay mode, now available to play.</p>



<p>Highguard has added a 5v5 Raid Mode. The mode is now live, but it will be available for a limited time. The mode is experimental and is only playable this weekend. It’s a separate playlist and will not replace the 3v3 raids.</p>



<p>Lobbies have been updated to allow for parties of 5 for the weekend. Additionally, in this mode, Raids are now 10 lives instead of 6, and respawns are slightly longer to allow for generators to be planted or diffused.</p>



<p>A new base has also been added to Highguard. In addition to the new game mode, they have also added a new base, Soul Well. Described as a dark relic from a lost age, the new base has been added to the rotation in all game modes.</p>







<h2 id="h-quality-of-life-improvements-are-also-coming-to-highguard-in-this-patch">Quality-Of-Life Improvements Are Also Coming to Highguard in This Patch</h2>



<p>Additionally, there are several updates for optimization and quality of life. Several optimizations improve animation performance, projectile behavior, and other gameplay systems. These updates benefit both console and PC and will also include features such as a motion blur toggle.</p>



<p>The developers note that players in 3v3 playlists should see some improvements, but they ask for some leeway during testing of the new game mode. Also, Firing Range does not currently support 5v5.</p>







<p>Learn more about the game, which received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-receives-mostly-negative-reviews/" id="172228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mostly negative reviews on Steam</a> after a difficult launch, by checking out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-2026-roadmap-all-episode-content/" id="172210" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full 2026 roadmap.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Patents Adaptive Controller With Virtual Button Layouts]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sony-patents-adaptive-controller-with-virtual-button-layouts/</link>
            <guid>1421503</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/sony-interactive-entertainment/" id="3274">Sony </a>has patented a new controller type that could revolutionize how gamers think about what a controller can be.</p>



<p><a href="https://sudoku-online.pro/pdfs/buttonless-sony-ps6-controller.pdf">According to a new patent</a> dated January 27, 2026, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sony-interactive-entertainment/" id="52192">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> is presenting a very forward-thinking adaptive controller. In the pack, they describe the drawbacks to modern video game controllers, including difficulties with fixed layouts. For example, they present a hypothetical scenario in which controllers are too large or too small for some users, and highlight the need for game controllers that support different configurations. They also discuss the desire for improvements in the placement of joysticks or D-pads</p>



<p>The drawing shows the layout of a typical controller without fixed buttons, but with a digital screen that allows customization. It also shows different button and D-pad placements, and notes that a button press can be recognized by different movements, such as a tap or swipe.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Sony has registered a patent for an unusual gamepad without physical buttons.</p><p>It features a fully touch-sensitive surface that supports gestures such as taps and swipes, and it will be able to adapt to finger positions, dynamically changing the control zones. <a href="https://t.co/XnQLO18WfZ">pic.twitter.com/XnQLO18WfZ</a></p></div>— Gaming.Bo3.gg (@Gaming_bo3gg) <a href="https://twitter.com/Gaming_bo3gg/status/2017206220491239924?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<h2 id="h-sony-has-redefined-controllers-in-the-past">Sony Has Redefined Controllers in the Past</h2>



<p>Sony has always been innovative with their controllers. The current standard of twin analog sticks began with the DualShock controller, which, in and of itself, was an advanced take on the original PlayStation controller. Later, they would innovate with Sixaxis motion-sensing technology in their PlayStation 3 controller. The PS4 added a touchpad, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38">PS5 </a>added haptic feedback and dynamic triggers.</p>



<p>While there’s no way to know whether this controller patent will be realized, it shows that Sony is considering ways to be inclusive and allow players to choose their own configurations and play their way. </p>







<p>Also, one could argue that, with the rise of mobile gaming, a younger generation is already accustomed to virtual gamepads. At the same time, it’s a leap into the future that may be difficult for some.</p>

<p>This year’s game features CM Punk as the game’s main cover athlete and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" id="169985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feature wrestler in the game’s Showcase Mode</a>.

<p>Speaking of the Island, the mode is officially coming to PC for the first time after skipping the platform in WWE 2K25.</p>



<p>As mentioned, WWE 2K26 launches on March 13. Those who preorder the higher-tiered editions of the game, however, get access to the game a week early on March 6.</p>
