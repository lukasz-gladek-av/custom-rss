            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/donk-counter-strike-history/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets is a name that everyone following Counter-Strike esports should be familiar with. This year, the superstar prodigy has marked himself as one of the most talented individuals to watch going forward, and after winning the Perfect World Shanghai Major, he has cemented himself as a record holder.</p>



<p>He’s the youngest Counter-Strike player to win a Major, the youngest to be named HLTV MVP, and he’s tied first for some of the highest ratings in competitive CS history. Coming out of the Team Spirit Academy and moving into the first team, he has racked up more prize money in <strong>one year </strong>than most pro players will make in ten.</p>



<p>Is there anything donk can’t do?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-donk-donk-donk-donk">donk, donk, donk, donk</h2>



<p>With all the makings of a game-wide GOAT, donk has managed to make a solid name for himself in a matter of months. Last year, he made his way into Team Spirit’s starting lineup in CS:GO, and then underwent the transition that everyone else made, moving over to CS2.</p>



<p>Since then, donk has <strong>exploded</strong>.</p>



<p>He just won the Shanghai Major, becoming the youngest CS player in history to net the achievement, and he was named MVP of the event, which is his <strong>fifth </strong>this year at a ‘big’ event. He was previously named MVP at IEM Katowice, a legendary event that kickstarted months of success for donk – and the rest of Team Spirit.</p>



<p>Few players have managed to secure more MVP awards in a single year – the likes of s1mple, ZywOo, and device come to mind.</p>



<p>As the Shanghai Major unfolded, donk racked up <strong>four </strong>aces, one of which was secured in the grand final against FaZe Clan – which was yet another record picked up by the 17-year-old competitor. </p>











<p>That move was preceded in the group stage of the Shanghai Major by a stunning 1v5 against Heroic. Later on in the tournament, Heroic would be sent home by G2 Esports.</p>



<p>All in all, this has been a <strong>stunning </strong>rookie year for donk, who has pieced together almost half a million dollars in earnings thus far. </p>



<p>What’s even more amazing is how humble donk has been through all this. Earlier this year, he <a href="https://blast.tv/article/spirit-donk-blast-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke to BLAST</a> and said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve won some big trophies in my first season. We’ve shown good results but we should also do better and keep our routine to work harder. </p>



<p>I’m not very consistent yet. I need to find my key to playing consistently, and I’m trying to do that right now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When asked if he sees himself as one of the top three players in the world, he said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I am, no.</p>



<p>It’s m0NESY, ZywOo, and sh1ro.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With donk, the sky is the limit, and there are high expectations that he’ll become one of the greatest esports competitors of all time.</p>



<p>Where do you place donk in your top CS players ranking? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It has been claimed that LEGO Horizon Adventures could soon be coming to Xbox in a bid to make the game a commercial success.</p>



<p>That’s according to Arab media outlet <a href="https://justplayit.info/news/sony-game-coming-to-xbox-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">justplayit</a>, who claim that their sources have said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a> will be coming to Xbox in the coming months.</p>



<p>While the outlet did not give a specific date, they said it’s likely to come in the first months of 2025 “at most” and even went as far as to speculate that it could be sooner.</p>



<p>The move comes as the console exclusivity strategy between platforms has shifted in the past few years. PlayStation has seen tremendous success in bringing some of its titles to PC, whereas Xbox has decided to bring the majority of its exclusives over to PlayStation.</p>



<p>WindowCentral’s Jez Corden even recently said that console exclusive titles on Xbox “is over” in a <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1867407921199362372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent tweet</a>. PlayStation bringing Lego Horizon Adventures to Xbox could mark a change in its console strategy, too, with PlayStation seemingly testing the waters on a multiplatform release (although the game is already on Nintendo Switch and PC).</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony/PlayStation for comments, and if we receive a comment, we will update this article.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atl-faze-roster-comes-under-fire-following-landmark-cdl-loss.1061925/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/atl-faze-roster-under-fire-cdl-loss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For the first time in 587 days, Atlanta FaZe has been dealt a 0 – 3 loss in the qualifying stage of a CDL Major. This loss came at the hands of a dominant Carolina Royal Ravens side, which succeeded in trapping FaZe in the hundred-point club during the opening Hardpoint, and it all went downhill from there.</p>



<p>Atlanta FaZe is now 0 – 3 in the qualifiers and has failed to secure a single CDL Point since the 2025 season kicked off. Typically, Atlanta FaZe is the single-most successful team on the board in the regular season, but right now, they’re on par with the Vegas Falcons.</p>



<p>Is it time for a roster change?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-paradigm-shift">Paradigm Shift</h2>



<p>Since the Call of Duty League became a thing in 2020, Atlanta FaZe has been a stalwart force in the scene. The squad, comprised of Simp, aBeZy, Cellium, and <strong>someone else</strong> (Drazah since last season), has been a team to be reckoned with for the longest time, but this season has started with such a sour mood that questions are now being asked.</p>



<p>In the Cold War season, Atlanta peaked, winning three Major tournaments and the CDL Championship. In the year that followed, the squad didn’t secure a single victory, and when Modern Warfare II arrived, only one Major win was lined up for the team.</p>



<p>This year, FaZe made history by winning the first Esports World Cup in the Call of Duty MP category, but coming in off that win has meant little for the squad, starting this CDL 2025 season with three heavy losses.</p>











<p>In a historic loss, Atlanta FaZe fell to the Royal Ravens. The opening Hardpoint set the tone for the series, with FaZe losing P2 on 42 points and securing just 88 points by the time the match had ended. Between the second rotation from P1 to P4, the team picked up just 24 points, counting themselves lucky to even find the final scraps on the hills.</p>



<p>Do you think a change is needed, or do Atlanta FaZe just need to find their fit in Black Ops 6?</p>

<p>The Game Awards 2024 was raised in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the showcase. It was an ambitious event all around, and many viewers rated it higher than any iteration in history. Collectively, we saw dozens of awards handed out (which not everyone agreed with, admittedly) and many games either revealed or updated with new trailers.</p>



<p>It has been revealed in data collected by Streams Charts that this year’s The Game Awards was the most-watched edition ever, topping more than <strong>four million </strong>concurrent viewers. The growth was aided by co-streamers and watch parties, which are fast becoming some of the most entertaining ways to watch streams online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bigger-than-ever">Bigger Than Ever</h2>



<p>The Game Awards played host to some massive announcements and trailers, such as The Witcher 4, Naughty Dog’s new game, a new Virtua Fighter, and Mafia: The Old Country.</p>



<p>It was potentially the most electric edition of The Game Awards we’ve ever seen, and Geoff Keighley’s team spared no expense in piecing together an all-singing, all-dancing event featuring a star-studded lineup of guests.</p>



<p>In a report published <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/game-awards-2024-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Streams Charts</a>, it was revealed that The Game Awards (across top channels) racked up a combined peak concurrent viewership of 4,003,578 users. It had a total watched hours count of 15,267,555, and 1,498 channels were logged broadcasting the event in some way.</p>



<p>In total, The Game Awards was on air for just south of five hours, and while the top channels for the broadcast were the official ones, the likes of IGN, Asmongold, and Moist Cr1TiKaL pulled in massive audiences while reacting to the showcase.</p>

<p>On November 12, Activision revealed the full line-up of CDL skins, but fans worldwide are <strong>still waiting </strong>for them to be delivered in Black Ops 6. While this year’s CDL skins aren’t as gaudy or ‘interesting’ as they have been in recent years, fans are still eager to represent their favourite CDL teams in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>With that being said, when <strong>are </strong>the CDL skins coming to Black Ops 6, and how much will they cost when they arrive?</p>



<p>Read on to find out what we know.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cdl-skins-release-date-in-black-ops-6">CDL Skins Release Date in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed by Activision when the CDL skins will be released in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>If we use last season’s release schedule as a representative example, we can determine that it might still be a couple of weeks until they arrive.</p>



<p>Last season, the action commenced on December 8, 2023, and the MWIII CDL skins were released on January 8, 2024. </p>



<p>The current season started on December 6, so it could be the first week of January that the team skins arrive once again. It was mentioned that it would be ‘later in season one’ that the CDL skins would drop, and that’s more or less where we are now that the ‘Season One Reloaded’ update has arrived.</p>



<p>If you’re holding out to know when the CDL skins are coming to Black Ops 6, take note – it could be another few weeks.</p>



<p>Which skin will you be purchasing once they’ve dropped? There isn’t much variation between the various CDL skins this year, but it’s still nice to see the teams represented, and of course, the organisations benefit from the sale of the skins.</p>



<p>On that note, how much do the CDL skins cost?</p>



<p>Typically, a CDL skin pack – which comes with the base skin, weapon camos, stickers, emblems, and calling cards, retails in the COD store for around $11.99. They can’t be purchased with COD Points – only real-world money.</p>



<p>Let us know which team you’re representing in Black Ops 6 when the CDL skin packs drop.</p>

<p>TSM has announced the benching or dismissal of its Danish Counter-Strike 2 roster ahead of the 2025 season. In a post on social media, the organisation revealed an intention to ‘evaluate roster moves’ before the next year of competitive events kicks off.</p>



<p>To that end, Valde, niko, and Rejin (coach) have all been let go, while sirah, acoR, and Zyphon have been benched pending further decisions. The players aren’t sitting around and waiting, though – acoR has already taken to socials to announce his decision to seek a new team.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-is-what-it-is">‘It Is What It Is’</h2>



<p>Speaking on social media about the sudden decision, Frederik ‘acoR’ Gyldstrand wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We didn’t get the players that were planned when I joined the team which did make the start feel weird.</p>



<p>We had a decent period i nthe start, we managed to make the RMR with no time to practice.</p>



<p>After the benching of Altekz it took a long time to get back on track with sirah. Though it did feel like we were getting back on track in the end, but <strong>it is what it is</strong>.</p>



<p>I am looking for a new team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was just a few days ago that TSM brought to an end the all-female CS2 team, TSM Impact. However, it’s worth stressing that this is a different scenario, as TSM intends to stay in the CS2 scene with a male team, but it’s not yet known what that squad will look like when the 2025 season opens up.</p>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://x.com/tsmreport/status/1867990639188791782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TSM simply wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Today we part ways with Valde, niko, and a CS Head Coach Rejin. We would like to thank them for their hard work throughout the year, and wish them all the best going forward.</p>



<p>We have also opted to bench sirah acoR, and Zyphon while we evaluate our next roster moves ahead of the 2025 season.</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/m0nesy-g2-eliminated-faze-shanghai/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>G2 Esports has officially been eliminated by FaZe Clan at the Perfect World Shanghai Major. Tomorrow, FaZe Clan will face off against a dominant Team Spirit, and it could be a day that makes history, with $500,000 sitting on the line for the grand victor.</p>



<p>It has been a whirlwind tournament thus far, and many competitors have gone home with their heads hung in disappointment. One player who felt the blow this weekend was G2’s Ilya ‘m0NESY’ Osipov, who parted ways with a message of sore emotions following his loss.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-faze-clan-vs-spirit-for-it-all">FaZe Clan vs. Spirit For It All</h2>



<p>FaZe Clan wiped out G2 with a 2 – 0 win in Shanghai to qualify for the grand final against Team Spirit.</p>



<p>It was a wash on the first map, but G2 showed up a little tighter in the second round – but it wasn’t enough, unfortunately. In a slick finish, FaZe Clan’s Robin ‘ropz’ Kool came out to play, racking up 50 kills across the two maps and cementing himself as one to watch in the grand final.</p>



<p>M0NESY took it hard, though, taking to social media to write:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t find the words to describe my feelings. I’m very angry with myself, forgive me for my terrible performance this month. This is the end and the beginning of something new.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Everyone wants to see if Team Spirit’s donk will have what it takes to achieve the incredible and win a CS2 Major during his rookie season. It has been a phenomenal year for the young star thus far, and securing the top spot in Shanghai would be a fantastic way to close out 2024.</p>



<p>He’s not alone in those aspirations, though. On FaZe Clan’s side, David ‘frozen’ Čerňanský is also seeking his first Major win.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan might be coming in hot off a win, but this year has been a tough one for the squad against Team Spirit. In terms of head-to-head, Team Spirit has managed to overcome FaZe Clan three times in the last 12 months.</p>



<p>If I was a betting man, my money would be on Team Spirit to secure the Major win.</p>
