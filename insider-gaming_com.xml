<p>Just a few months after its announcement, Rebellion has canceled its Sniper Elite Battle Royale game, Archipelago.</p>



<p>First announced in August 2024, Project Archipelago, internally known as Sniper Island, was a team-based multiplayer Battle Royale in which teams of three battled it out to be the last to survive. The game had its last Alpha playtests in mid-August 2024.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that the game was canceled because Tencent decided not to continue funding the project. While we’ve not been able to pinpoint the exact reason, Rebellion higher-ups implied in meetings with staff that funding was pulled due to the disastrous launch of Firewalk Studios’ Concord, which caused Tencent to get skittish about some of its projects.</p>



<p>Archipelago’s announcement didn’t necessarily go down well with Sniper Elite fans, either. Its reveal was criticized on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gulSkpVklx4&amp;ab_channel=Rebellion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rebellion YouTube channel</a>, with fans confused over Rebellion’s decision to move from single-player games to a Battle Royale. </p>



<p><span>It’s understood that despite the game’s canc</span>ellation, no one’s employment was affected, with staff being moved to other projects, including&nbsp;Sniper Elite: Resistance, its next mainline Sniper Elite game.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming asked Rebellion to comment before publication, but they declined to comment.</p>
