            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 developers have stated that matchmaking considers skill as a factor, but doesn’t prioritise it. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 open beta is the only thing players have been talking about recently, after we got to see a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-biggest-ever-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spectacular show</a> over the past weekend. As we gear up for the new map and modes for BF6 Open Beta weekend 2, new details about the game’s matchmaking system have been revealed. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-prioritises-ping-over-sbmm">Battlefield 6 Prioritises Ping Over SBMM</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-lead-says-skill-is-a-factor-in-matchmaking-but-far-down-the-list-so-please-lower-your-pitchforks-and-torches/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, the lead producer for Battlefield, David Sirland, was recently <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1954901993245581459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">asked</a> whether any form of SBMM kicks in during Battlefield 6 server match-ups. Sirland clarified, stating that BF6’s open beta matchmaking prioritised all elements they expect for launch, and they remain the same as in the previous title. The biggest priority for Battlefield 6’s matchmaking is “ping and time to game”. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Clarification: Open beta used all matchmaking priorities we expect for launch. And they are the same as they have been in previous titles. We prioritize Ping, and time to game ahead of most things. 1/2</p>— David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1954901993245581459?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Sirland explains that skill is a factor in Battlefield 6’s matchmaking; however, it is “far down the list”. The lead producer added that the game’s large mode requires “a spread of skill to work well”. The sandbox needs players to have different types of skillsets to “function well”, which is “also why the matchmaker teambalances to make the teams even as part of that process.” </p>



<p>Ahead of the open beta, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-sbmm-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Battlefield 6’s skill-based matchmaking will rely on four core aspects: Ping, Player’s Location, Server Availability and Some Skill Factor. Moreover, it was said that the matchmaking factors “will vary based on each game mode and player counts”.</p>



<p>On the topic of Battlefield 6, the viral VTuber ‘RileyCS’ has&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-rileycs-cheating-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been banned on Twitch</a>&nbsp;following allegations of cheating. Additionally, BF6 developers are looking into “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-devs-are-looking-into-unexpectedly-fast-time-to-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unexpectedly fast” time to death</a>. What are your thoughts on Battlefield 6 developers not prioritising skill for matchmaking?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In an all-new trailer promoting the imminent launch of Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series platforms, Arrowhead has slipped in a teaser for a potential Halo 3: ODST crossover. It’s only a few seconds worth of content, but it has proven enough to get chins wagging in the comment section under the video.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 will be released on Xbox on August 26, more than a year and a half after it first dropped on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bring-the-boom">Bring the Boom!</h2>



<p>The newest Helldivers 2 trailer has been released, two weeks before the game launches on Xbox platforms worldwide.</p>



<p>Here’s the minute-and-a-half showcase of what’s coming (as if you don’t already know!):</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Bring the Boom | Out August 26" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n_dxYcvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>If you’re an eagle-eyed gamer, you’ll have spotted the nod to Halo 3: ODST at the end of the video. The sequence containing the drop pod backed by an orchestral score is pulled straight from the 2009 Xbox 360 title, and it has fans <strong>excited</strong>.</p>



<p>The trailer was also one of the first times we’ve seen this surface, which is mind-bending:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans are expecting some kind of launch day crossover between Halo and Helldivers 2, and honestly, there couldn’t be a more perfect thing to hope for. One user wrote on YouTube, ‘Don’t give me hope like that. If there’s an ODST-themed crossover, I’ll cry tears of joy.’</p>



<p>In recent Helldivers-related news, it was revealed that Arrowhead Studios wants to make <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-developers-want-to-make-game-more-challenging/">the game more challenging</a>. It was also confirmed that the developer and publisher have no plans to bring the game to any subscription services <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-have-no-plans-of-putting-it-on-game-pass/">like Game Pass</a>.</p>

<p>A game that bears a striking resemblance to Pocketpair’s popular survival crafting title, Palworld, has been spotted on the Nintendo Store. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Pocketpair is already fighting a patent infringement lawsuit from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, with Nintendo alleging that Palworld has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-argues-invalidity-and-non-infringement-against-nintendos-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infringed on 3 of their patents</a>. Interestingly, now a game that feels like a lookalike of Palworld is available for purchase on the Nintendo Store. </p>



<h2 id="h-palland-and-palworld-look-eerily-similar">Palland and Palworld Look Eerily Similar</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/with-the-palworld-lawsuit-rumbling-on-in-the-background-the-nintendo-switch-welcomes-palland-a-survival-game-that-looks-a-whole-lot-like-pocketpairs-creature-collector/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/palland-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOooQaIk-Baos18U8SW8wkjXAqdMfQRjonByqq4OCiP4XMJEGR9eI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">listing</a> for Palland has appeared on the Nintendo Store, and from the outset, players will notice many similarities to Palworld (if Pal-land wasn’t a big giveaway already). The key art and gameplay screenshots feature a similar red-haired woman we have seen in Palworld’s screenshots, with different types of creatures. However, the art style of the two games is slightly different.  </p>



<p>Coming to the description, here’s where players will see more similarities between Palland and Palworld. The description states that Palland features a world with captivating survival, building, and exploration, where players choose “how to gather resources, expand your shelter, and deal with wild creatures that can be both threats and valuable sources of power.”</p>

<p>Palland has been priced at $9.99 ($3.99 on discount till August 14) and is available as a digital game for the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. BoggySoft has published the game, and it was released on July 31, 2025. </p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-modifies-patent-amid-ongoing-palworld-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modified a patent</a> amid the ongoing Palworld lawsuit.

<p>Battlefield 6 players will be able to access two new game modes and a new map during the upcoming open beta weekend. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-launch-deemed-unsatisfying-and-underperformed-major-update-coming/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can’t deny FBC: Firebreak is ambitious, even if it is a game no one was necessarily clamoring for. The latter part of this is now evident, as Remedy has given deeper insight into FBC: Firebreak’s underwhelming launch and plans for the IP.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-fbc-firebreak-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a> was Remedy’s first new release since the Game of the Year-contending <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-over-2-million-copies-and-is-finally-profitable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>. Firebreak is set in Control’s (another Remedy IP) world and is a team-based FPS. This is quite a bold shift from the company’s other games. We’ve seen from gameplay and matches that the game has potential, but its launch has failed to land.</p>



<h2 id="h-fbc-firebreak-receiving-major-update-in-september">FBC: Firebreak Receiving Major Update in September</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Firebreak hasn’t caught yet. Credit to Remedy</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s quite damning to hear that the FBC: Firebreak “launch underperformed.” This is the official word from Remedy’s Jan-Jun 2025 financial <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>.</p>



<p>“On Steam, which was planned as the primary consumer sales channel on PC, the launch underperformed. The game’s initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews.”</p>



<p>The company was happy that “The launch succeeded technically, reaching over 1 million players in its first 10 days,” but goes on to say: “Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak.”</p>



<p>The majority of the shooter’s revenue has come from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-xbox-game-pass-playstation-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus</a>-subscribing users. Firebreak was free on both services at launch.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, despite the adversity, Remedy believes FBC: Firebreak is a “solid game” the team can build on: “Looking ahead, a larger ‘Major Update’ late September will be the next key step for&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak. This will be supported by targeted marketing activities, which we expect to drive interest in the title. We are committed to continuing to work on&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak, engaging with the community, and expanding the game.”</p>



<p>Do you think Firebreak can bounce back? With so many live-service games out there, it’s tough to stand out. Let me know if you think it can by heading to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
