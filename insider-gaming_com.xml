<p>The specs for the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU have been leaked online ahead of the processor’s official release. European comparison website Geizhals (first spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/extensive-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-specs-leak-details-unlocked-120w-cpu-with-5-2-ghz-boost-clock">Tom’s Hardware</a>) has posted the full specs of the new chip that shows some solid improvements over its predecessors.</p>



<p>Before getting into the leaked specs, it’s worth noting that none of this has been officially confirmed by AMD. That means that some of the details could be slightly different from the actual information.</p>



<p>According to the leaked specs, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D features a base clock speed of 4.7 GHz with a boost clock of up to 5.2 GHz. The base clock comes in at 500 MHz higher than the 7800X3D. It also features a TDP of 120W along with 8MB of L2 cache and 96MB of L3 cache.</p>



<p>As far as pricing goes, that wasn’t part of the specs leak. However, recent rumors suggest that it will cost $479, $30 more than the 7800X3D. The CPU is expected to release November 7.</p>



<p>You can check out the rest of the leaked specs for the processor below:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-creative-director-leaves-to-join-xboxs-perfect-dark/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The creative director of Marvel’s Wolverine has reportedly left the game to work for Xbox and its Perfect Dark reboot. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wolverine-perfect-dark-brian-horton-playstation-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stephen Totilo’s Game File</a>, Brian Horton left Insomniac over the summer. He is now the creative director on Perfect Dark, which is being developed by The Initiative.</p>



<p>An Xbox representative told Game File that Horton will be “bringing his wealth of experience to the upcoming reboot of the classic secret agent series”.</p>



<p>Totilo’s report states that Horton left Insomniac and Wolverine as part of creative changes around the game. Another move made was that Cameron Christian is no longer game director on Wolverine. Instead, he moves to a different, currently unknown, role within the studio.  </p>



<p>Taking over as Wolverine’s game director and creative director are Mike Daly and Marcus Smith, respectively. The two were the leads on Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Sony for comment on the changes, but no response was received.</p>



<p>Perfect Dark has seen a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-perfect-dark-game-in-rough-shape-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">number of reported issues</a> with development over the years. However, this <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-reboot-first-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summer saw a new look</a> at the game released during Xbox’s Summer Showcase. </p>



<p>Regarding Wolverine, the last look fans received came via the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ransomware-group-leaks-over-1-3-million-files-in-insomniac-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major Insomniac leak</a> from 2023. The game was first announced in 2021, but Insomniac <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniac-gearing-up-to-show-more-from-wolverine-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may be “gearing up”</a> to showcase more of the game in the near future. </p>



<p>As far as a release date for Perfect Dark or Wolverine, none have been officially announced. Rumors suggest that Wolverine could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniacs-wolverine-wont-release-until-2025-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release sometime in 2025</a>.</p>
