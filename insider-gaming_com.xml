<p>You’ve just hit a beautiful clip in Counter-Strike 2. A 1v4 or a 1v5 in the final rounds of regulation to give your team the win. Your voice chat crackles to life with the sounds of your jubilant teammates. But then reality sets in: you don’t have any program to clip it with.</p>



<p>So many CS2 players have lost clips to the void because they don’t have any clipping software. With all the choices, it can feel overwhelming to pick one, but most provide the same basic features while offering some neat additional ones. Here are our recommendations for the best clipping software to capture your CS2 highlights.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-clipping-software">Best CS2 Clipping Software</h2>



<h3 id="h-medal">Medal</h3>



<p>Medal is a popular choice for clipping highlights from CS2 and other titles. There are several features that Medal utilizes that are attractive to players, including built-in editor tools and an activity feed where you can share and view other clips. Medal lets players hit a shortcut key to save footage from the past 15 seconds up all the way to the past 20 minutes, or the entirety of the gameplay session. You can also use the editing tools on video that wasn’t captured through Medal.</p>



<p>Medal offers a premium the enables cloud sync and larger uploads to the feed, but it’s also a free-to-use application.</p>



<h3 id="h-steelseries-gg">SteelSeries GG</h3>



<p>The SteelSeries GG application, which is used for managing your SteelSeries devices, also features a Moments section for clipping highlights of CS2 and other games. What sets it apart from other pieces of software is an auto-clip feature that automatically slips specific moments. For CS2 in particular, it will automatically detect and clip 3-kill rounds, headshot kills, and knife kills, but you can adjust it to only include one or two of these events. Additionally, after your game closes, a window pops up of all the clips generated, letting you quickly delete ones not worth keeping.</p>



<h3 id="h-steam-game-recording">Steam Game Recording</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Steam introduced Steam Game Recording back in June 2024, giving players the option to sign up for the program beta and clip highlights through Steam. Steam Game Recording offers two recording options: manual recording that starts and stops with a keyboard recording, or automatic “background recording” that saves your most recent two hours of gameplay. After recording, players can use the built-in clip editor to trim down recordings into clips.</p>
