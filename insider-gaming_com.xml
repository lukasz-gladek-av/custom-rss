<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has gone with a different approach for pre-order bonuses and editions. It could be a beneficial move to help the latest sequel succeed, and we’ve got the latest on every AC Shadows edition and how to claim pre-order bonuses.</p>



<p>Ubisoft isn’t shy about having multiple editions for one of its AAA releases. This is evident with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> having several different editions to choose. In a positive move, Ubisoft has ditched the title’s Season Pass and is offering planned post-launch content for free—to an extent.</p>



<p>This is likely part of the reason why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-in-line-with-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows pre-orders are strong</a>. So let’s catch you up on every AC Shadows edition and all pre-order bonuses.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It’s free. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Every edition of Assassin’s Creed Shadows has two pre-order bonuses: The Claws of Awaji of DLC and the Thrown to the Dogs Quest.</strong></p>



<p>To be clear, if you pre-order <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, you get both pieces of content for free. Thrown to the Dogs is a typical AC quest found in the game, whereas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-expansion-claws-of-awaji/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Claws of Awaji is a DLC with 10+ hours of new content</a>. The first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer</a> is very promising, and if you’re looking to maximize your Assassin’s Creed Shadows experience, it might be worth pre-ordering early.</p>



<p>If you don’t, The Claws of Awaji DLC will be released at a later on as a standalone purchase. There is no Season Pass for Shadows, making it the first AC release in a long time to skip the popular business move.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Decisions, decisions. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has three main editions: Standard Edition, Digital Deluxe Edition, and the Collector’s Edition.</strong></p>



<p>There’s nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ editions. Your commitment to the game, interest, and how much you’re interested in extra content all come into your edition decision.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass is back with a brand new collection of games for players to try in March 2025, with titles like 33 Immortals, One Lonely Outpost and more joining the fray.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-game-pass-schedule-for-march-2025">Xbox Game Pass Schedule for March 2025</h2>



<p>Starting today, March 4, players can try out Monster Train on the cloud, console, and PC through Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard. Monster Train has returned to the subscription service to let new players try out the strategic roguelike deck builder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On March 5, players on the Xbox Series X/S can try Galacticare through Game Pass Standard. In this game, players are the directors of an interstellar healthcare company, and their task is to build a hospital, recruit staff, and save alien species from bizarre illnesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next is One Lonely Outpost, which will be available for cloud, console, and PC on March 6 through Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. The cosy sci-fi farming sim will have players terraforming different lands, growing organic or genetically modified crops, and raising robo-livestock.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coming up next on March 13 is Mullet Madjack, which will be available for cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X/S through Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. It is a high-octane shooter set in a classic anime, where you constantly waste enemies to beat your best time.&nbsp;</p>

Players will be able to enter an op-op action-roguelike for 33 players where you are a “damned soul” that is rebelling against God’s final judgement”.&nbsp;</p>
