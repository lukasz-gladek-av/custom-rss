<p>The Simpsons are on their way to Fortnite, and it appears Bart Simpson is the first to make his arrival, as his iconic treehouse can be found on the Battle Royale island, and we’ll tell you exactly where to go.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s mini-season themed around The Simpsons kicks off this week, starting with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge live event</a>, which marks the final part of Chapter 6 in the game, with Epic Games now gearing up for the big release of Chapter 7 at the start of December.</p>



<p>Ahead of the big live event, a new quest is live in Fortnite that tasks you to investigate the Mysterious Anomaly, and we’ve got a full breakdown of where you need to go.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Head here. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Mysterious Anomaly in Fortnite, aka Bart Simpson’s treehouse, is located in the northwestern part of the map, close to the Creepy Camps POI.</strong></p>



<p>Approaching this location, you’ll immediately spot a cell-shaded treehouse that sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the environment, which serves as a huge teaser ahead of the Simpsons-themed mini-season that will serve as the final swansong of Chapter 6 in Fortnite.</p>



<p>To claim the 20,000 XP and complete the quest, which provides a huge bump to your season level and can help you unlock any remaining rewards from the Battle Pass and Fortnitemares, simply approach the Treehouse. When you appear close enough, the challenge will automatically tick off and provide the reward.</p>



<p>There’s no need to head inside the treehouse, but if you do, you’ll be treated to another mini easter egg for the forthcoming season, with a TV that has a sketchy signal in the corner of the building. Periodically, images will flash up with memes from The Simpsons, another major hint at what is coming.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-any-other-simpsons-easter-eggs-in-fortnite">Are There Any Other Simpsons Easter Eggs in Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, there are other Simpsons-themed easter eggs located on the Fortnite app, though none of the others provide an additional quest or XP bonuses.</strong></p>



<p>In the Steamy Shacks location, a workstation very similar to Homer Simpson’s at the nuclear power plant can be found, with no secret as to who it belongs to, as pink-glazed donuts are also there, many of which have had a bite taken out of them.</p>



<p>Additional teasers could be added before the start of the live event this weekend, but it’s not too long to wait now until the big reveal of everything there is to enjoy.</p>

<p>The current season in Fortnite, along with the heap of collabs in the Fortnitemares event, is rapidly approaching its conclusion, with all eyes cast towards The Simpsons mini-season, and we’ve already seen a bunch of leaked skins.</p>



<p>The Simpsons are making a long-awaited arrival in the world of Fortnite this week, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live event set to kick off the huge collab</a>, with a month-long stage in the spotlight before Chapter 6 comes to an end and Chapter 7 begins.</p>



<p>Leaks for the big Simpsons takeover in Fortnite have already emerged, and we’ve highlighted all of the skins that are coming to the game as part of the update.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-leaked-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-skins">All Leaked Fortnite x The Simpsons Skins</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Collab crazy. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Keyart leaked for Fortnite, and a small batch teased by Epic Games themselves, has provided a first look at a total of 12 skins coming in The Simpsons mini-season.</strong></p>



<p>As usual, a bunch of skins will be available as part of the Battle Pass, now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-battle-passes-will-now-be-included-in-xbox-game-pass-ultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">included with a Game Pass subscription</a>, and the usual approach is that characters front and center of keyart will be included in the Pass.</p>



<p>Therefore, we expect Homer, Marge, Simpsons Jonesy, and Simpsons Hope to be included in the Battle Pass skins, while Ned Flanders could be the final reward, along with his trademark moustache-styled glider.</p>



<p>Other skins could still be included in the Battle Pass, but we’ll have to wait and see. There’s plenty more to come in the Item Shop though via V-Bucks purchases, including Lisa Simpson and Krusty the Clown.</p>



<p>As usual, many of the skins will be NPCs to interact with on the map, with Moe Syslak standing out as the leading candidate for that regard, with his bar likely to be a POI, while Lisa Simpson could potentially be found the the school. Again, we’ll have to wait for full confirmation.</p>



<p>Check out the table below for all the leaked Simpsons skins in the Fortnite collab.</p>

<p>Heads Please (also known as Heads, Please!) is a coin-flip-based RNG <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-blue-lock-rival-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience where you spin Coins and aim to land on the obverse side to earn the maximum amount of Wones. You’ll still earn a small number of Wones when flipping tails, but to obtain the best Coins, such as the Seraphim Coin, Anti Gravity Coin, Unsteady Coin, and many more, you’ll need not only Lady Fortuna’s blessing but also Gacha Luck, Wones, and boosters. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Sims Games Coming to Xbox and PlayStation, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-sims-games-coming-xbox-and-playstation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-sims-games-coming-to-xbox-and-playstation-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1336498/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reputable source has claimed that MySims, an adorable version of the popular life simulation series, is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox later this year. MySims first surfaced in 2007 on the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii, before expanding to PC, mobile platforms, and in 2024, the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>This marks the first time that MySims will be available to play on Xbox or PlayStation, and fans of the franchise are excited. The MySims: Cozy Bundle, which was recently announced for Apple Arcade (November 6), will arrive on PS5 and Xbox Series platforms from November 18.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-sims-in-mysims">More Sims in MySims</h2>



<p>In an exclusive report published <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mysims-cozy-bundle-arrive-enfin-sur-playstation-et-xbox-on-vous-devoile-sa-date-de-sortie-60696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Dealabs</a>, backed by leading industry insiders, it was claimed that MySims: Cozy Bundle will be released on Xbox Series X, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5 on November 18, 2025. It was stressed that the game will be priced at $39.99.</p>



<p>The bundle includes the original MySims game, released almost 20 years ago, and MySkins: Kingdom. They’re <strong>remastered version </strong>of the original titles, though.</p>



<p>MySims is something along the lines of The Sims fused with Animal Crossing, presenting players with a cutesy take on the life sim that was first released way back in 2000. It was a spin-off of sorts from SimCity, with developers wanting to explore a more granular take on the city builder, zooming in and allowing players to simulate a life of their dreams.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>As the MySims Cosy Bundle is set to drop exactly one year after it was released on Nintendo Switch, it’s easy to assume that an exclusivity deal was arranged between Electronic Arts and the Japanese gaming titan.</p>



<p>The ‘retro re-release’ of MySims has been met with excitement from fans of the franchise. It has been a while since we had a new Sims game, given that The Sims 4 is now a free-to-play, live-service game, and anyone who hasn’t played MySims before is hungry to experience all it has to offer.</p>
