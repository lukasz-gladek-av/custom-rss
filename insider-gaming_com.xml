<p>I’m as much of a sucker for a physical collector’s edition of my favorite video games as anyone else, and you can bet I have my eye on the Stalker 2 Ultimate Edition. It’s expensive, though. It’s a little too expensive for my blood, and I’m pretty sure my wife would have something to say about one showing up in the mail, too. In any case, it’s still nice to dream and live vicariously through others. So, here’s what’s inside the Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl Ultimate Edition!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/activision-cracking-down-on-call-of-duty-vpn-users/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Activision’s Team RICOCHET has published changes on Black Ops 6 and Warzone to combat account boosting and VPN users. For the longest time, gamers worldwide have accused streamers of abusing ‘VPN lobbies’ to get better clips while playing in regions with a less talented pool of players.</p>



<p>In the latest round of changes, RICOCHET has confirmed how it’s tackling that practice, and while it’s not eradicating the use of VPNs, it’s ‘cutting down’ VPN abuse.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-wherever-you-will-go">Wherever You Will Go</h2>



<p>Using a VPN in Call of Duty has been a thing for several years. Typically, players will use a VPN to get away from highly competitive regions like the United Kingdom, North America, and some European countries. It reached a point where some VPN providers were marketing their products directly at Call of Duty players trying to circumvent ‘tougher lobbies’.</p>



<p>In a recent update, it was confirmed that Team RICOCHET (and Treyarch) has deployed two new changes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enhanced AFK detections to battle against account boosting</li>



<li>Adjusting ping thresholds to require players to play matches in their region to cut down on VPN abuse</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’ve got awful internet, then the latter change might impact you regardless of whether you have a VPN active or not. One thing that users insist Activision needs to address is the number of players taking part in the practice of ‘2 boxing’.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is yet to have a serious issue with cheaters, so something is being done right at Team RICOCHET. In the latter months of its lifecycle, Modern Warfare III was plagued by cheaters, particularly the Ranked Play platform. In the coming days, Ranked Play will hit Black Ops 6, so it could just be a matter of time before this game also suffers.</p>

<p>In a rather surprising turn of events, in celebration of Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, Blizzard unveiled and surprise launched remasters of Warcraft 1 and Warcraft 2, which are available on Battle.net at this very moment. If you want to purchase the entire collection, you can score Warcraft Remastered, Warcraft 2 Remastered, and Warcraft 3 Reforged for $39.99 in a unique Battle Chest. Oh, and if you buy now, you’ll also receive Warcraft Orcs &amp; Humans, Warcraft 3 Reforged multiplayer hero skins, and the World of Warcraft Meat Wagon mount, akin to a siege weapon with massive, bloody spikes on its front, rear, and wheels.</p>

<iframe title="Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ryZ2jiW95qo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The surprise shadow drop of both Warcraft remasters occurs alongside the announcement that, after two decades, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/after-20-years-world-of-warcraft-is-getting-player-housing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Warcraft is finally getting player housing</a> in its upcoming expansion, Midnight. However, it’s still a year or two away from launch. But for now, if you pick up the Warcraft Battle Chest, you’ll find yourself with plenty of real-time strategy goodness to sift through before then.</p>



<p>For now, let’s focus on Warcraft Remastered and Warcraft 2 Remastered. For starters, Brad Chan, senior manager of Warcraft RTS, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>These remasters have brand new hand drawn visuals that capture the original art style from each game, and you’ll be able to swap between the original graphics and the remastered versions in real time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The remasters feature UI and UX improvements, making both real-time strategy games more accessible to modern audiences. Alongside the remasters, Warcraft 3: Reforged Patch 2.0 is on its way, featuring an environment and lighting overhaul, and improvements to the user interface. Oh, and there are uprezzed HD assets.</p>



<p>Is Warcraft a little too old for your tastes? Let us know if you’re hopping into the remastered RTS trilogy this week with the Battle Chest by visiting us on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>It wasn’t long ago that Blizzard took the stage at BlizzCon 2023 to announce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-worldsoul-saga-warcraft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20 more years of World of Warcraft with the Worldsoul Saga</a>!</p>
