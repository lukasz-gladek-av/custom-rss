            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The upcoming Netflix live-action adaptation of Assassin’s Creed has cast a co-lead for the show. Furthermore, it’s an actor whose resume includes projects like Euphoria and The Bikeriders.</p>







<p>The Assassin’s Creed series of games has been going strong since 2007. Spanning eras of history with action-packed gameplay and gripping story, it’s had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-hits-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a decent streak recently</a>. A film adaptation starring X-Men: First Class’ Michael Fassbender came out in 2016 to negative press. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ordered-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed earlier this year</a>, Netflix is working with Ubisoft to develop a live-action Assassin’s Creed series. Multiple ones are in the works, as revealed in the blog from July, but it seems traction has been gained on at least one of them.</p>



<h2 id="h-toby-wallace-to-co-lead-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-series">Toby Wallace to Co-Lead Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/assassins-creed-toby-wallace-cast-netflix-series-1236628211/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive report from Deadline</a>, actor Toby Wallace is set to co-lead Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series. While no date or story was announced, it’s stated that he will be a series regular.  Even more so, the report says that filming will occur in Italy, which may serve as the main setting. </p>



<p>Toby Wallace is a fairly new actor, only having a few big roles under his belt, like The Bikeriders and Eden. However, the actor is set to star as a series regular in the new season of HBO’s Euphoria. An interesting tidbit is that Wallace will co-lead, so another actor, not yet known, will star alongside him. Given the game’s usage of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-assassins-creed-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">present and past</a>, perhaps another actor will play the ancestor or present-day descendant. In the film, Michael Fassbender played both parts, so maybe the co-lead is a Templar head or another role. Either way, it’ll be interesting to see how the cast, and show, shape up.</p>







<p>What do you think of Toby Wallace’s casting in Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series? Do you think the show will work out? Who do you want to see cast in the series? Any actor in particular?

<h2 id="h-the-best-xbox-ally-x-accessories-for-2025">The Best Xbox Ally X Accessories For 2025</h2>



<p><strong>Anti-Glare Screen Protector</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the system costing $600-$1000, the first thing you should do is protect the most important part of the handheld: the screen. Available in a two-pack, these screen protectors retail <strong>for under $15</strong> and are made of tempered glass that cover the whole display.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>NINKI Silicone Skin</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want to have some protection around the device without a big hard shell? This case might be just what you’re looking for. It’s form-fitting on the Ally X while offering added grip on the sides and protection around the system. It comes with a kickstand as well, allowing you to set it down nicely wherever you happen to be. You can pick up <strong>the case for $20.</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Travel Case&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want a nice carrying case that can not only hold your Xbox Ally X handheld but the charger, stand, and more? This case features a compartment that is designed for carrying everything you need for the system. It’s <strong>less than $30</strong> and feels as durable as something two-to-three times the cost. It was one of the first thing’s purchased when the handheld came in and has gone on every trip since.</p>











<hr>



<p><strong>Docking Station</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This docking station from JSAUX has everything you need to hook up your Xbox Ally or Ally X to a TV or monitor.

<hr>



<p><strong>Samsung PRO Plus microSD</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>You’ve seen this card in a lot of Insider Gaming’s holiday guides this year, and that’s for good measure. The Samsung PRO Plus MicroSD is the best one on the market for the price. This card offers read/write speeds up to around 180 MB/s for reading and 130 MB/s writing. The card starts at <strong>$26.99</strong> for 256GB but is also available in 512 GB for<strong> $49.99</strong> and <strong>$79.99</strong> for 1TB.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty League 2026 Maps and Modes Revealed]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ahead of the start of the season, Call of Duty League 2026 has revealed the maps and modes that will be present. Furthermore, a new mode will be added, Overload, spicing up the competition further.</p>







<p>With each new entry, the Call of Duty series has been a great multiplayer experience. Despite Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-player-count-black-ops-7-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not doing so hot</a>, one can count on Activision and the teams doing well by the mode. Nothing, though, has said it better than in Esports. Last year, Optic Texas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-champs-optic-texas-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took home the championship</a>, with Mercules scoring MVP. With CDL 2026, it’s anyone’s game, especially with the addition of a brand-new mode to competition.</p>



<h2 id="h-cdl-2026-adding-overload-to-game-modes-starting-december-5th-7th">CDL 2026 Adding Overload to Game Modes, Starting December 5th-7th</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a tweet from <a href="https://x.com/CODLeague/status/1993347588654018822?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty League</a>, the full lineup of maps and modes for the 2026 season has been unveiled. Additionally, the full competitive rules and settings can be <a href="https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/competitive-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found here</a>. The full list of maps and modes can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hardpoint
<ul>
<li>Blackheart</li>



<li>Colossus</li>



<li>Den</li>



<li>Exposure</li>



<li>Scar</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Search &amp; Destroy
<ul>
<li>Colossus</li>



<li>Den</li>



<li>Exposure</li>



<li>Raid</li>



<li>Scar</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Overload (NEW)
<ul>
<li>Den</li>



<li>Exposure</li>



<li>Scar</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>As mentioned before, Overload is a brand-new mode added to the Call of Duty League. From Black Ops 7, the 6×6 mode acts like Capture the Flag, as teams will try to get the Overload Device to a designated objective. It’ll be interesting to see how it evolves within the competitive scene. Either way, it’s definitely one to watch on December 5th-7th.</p>







<p>What do you think of CDL’s map and modes lineup? Excited to see Overload added to the modes? Which map do you think will be great for competition?

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Ranked Play Release Period, Explained]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Ranked Play is at the top of the wishlist for many of you. After all, it’s where the best of the best prove they are above the rest. Black Ops 7 Ranked Mode release details are coming your way.</p>



<p>Ranked is a staple of any recent Call of Duty release. Eventually, traditional lobbies can only offer so much competition, and there needs to be something to grind for—outside of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-multiplayer-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer Camos</a>.</p>



<p>This is where Black Ops 7 and Ranked Mode go hand in hand.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-ranked-mode-coming-to-black-ops-7">When Is Ranked Mode Coming To Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Party like it’s 2025. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s been announced that Black Ops 7 is getting its long-awaited Ranked Mode in Season 2.</strong></p>



<p>This might come as disappointing news for those of you who want Ranked now. There are a few weeks to go until Ranked Play hits BLOPS 7. The devs have previously announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-black-ops-7-season-2-maps-have-already-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 2</a> will see the addition of Ranked Play for both of Activision’s main games: Black Ops 7 and Warzone.</p>



<p>You might be even more aggrieved to know that no one knows when in Season 2 it’s happening. It could be with the season’s launch, it could be midway through, or Treyarch could suddenly announce the day before.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for further updates and announcements on Ranked Play coming to Black Ops 7. If you don’t have it already, you can always use <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/">Insider Gaming to buy Black Ops 7 much cheaper</a>.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For those asking, Treyarch has previously confirmed Ranked Play for both Black Ops 7 MP and Warzone will launch with Season 02.</p>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1993029985452671461?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-is-black-ops-7-ranked-play">What is Black Ops 7 Ranked Play?</h2>



<p><strong>Ranked Play is a competitive mode where your performances in Call of Duty matches determine your ranking, and good performances and wins are rewarded with skill points and promotions, whereas losing usually can result in demotions to inferior ranks.</strong></p>



<p>For example, in Black Ops 6, you had eight ranks to work your way through: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Crimson, Iridescent, and Top 250. Think of it like a worst-to-best scale. </p>



<p>It remains to be seen if Black Ops 7 adopts the same ranks, names, and divisions, but this is usually how it works. Furthermore, certain maps, weapons, and equipment are restricted in Ranked. Treyarch will inflict limitations on various aspects of Black Ops 7, meaning you need to be adaptable and prove your skill at will.</p>



<p>Reasons for this include meta weapons, to stop everyone from defaulting to them.</p>



<p>Is Ranked something that should launch with CoD on day one? Are you impatient for Ranked Play right now?
