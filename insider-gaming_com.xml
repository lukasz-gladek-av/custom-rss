<p>Activision has seemingly confirmed that the actors in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 zombies have been recast. </p>



<p>After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-zombies-actors-quit-lack-of-ai-protection-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors began</a> to circulate that actors within the mode quit the game over concerns surrounding AI protections, the studio has released a statement on the matter. </p>



<p>&nbsp;“We respect the personal choice of these performers,” an Activision spokesperson said to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/black-ops-6-zombies-characters-recast-after-original-actors-withdrew-during-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>. “Out of respect for all parties, we won’t add new commentary about the ongoing negotiations with SAG-AFTRA. We look forward to a mutually beneficial outcome as soon as possible.”</p>



<p>The current SAG-AFTRA strike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began in July</a> over the aforementioned AI protections. It came after “18 months of negotiations” between the union and various studios, including Activision Blizzard. As of writing, there is still no deal.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering why the game isn’t a part of the strike, it’s because of a clause in the contract. This clause allows union member actors to work on games that were in production before the strike was called. However, should a member be on a “daily contract”, <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/ima-strike-notice-members" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the union says</a> they can choose to not re-new their deals.</p>



<p>Activision has been using AI in its game development for some time, according to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a>. There is even evidence that shows that in various artwork in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. One <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1865107470751834402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">specific example shows</a> a holiday-themed loading screen featuring a zombie with six fingers. For those unaware, generative AI software is notorious for issues when generating hands on characters.</p>



<p>What do you think of the issues surrounding the Black Ops 6 zombies actors being recast and AI in game development in general?

<p>The Gaming World Tour has wrapped for 2024, and after a year of stellar events, the team is looking forward to what comes next in 2025. This year, the squad – including Jake Lucky and Hunter Grooms – travelled to South Korea, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Germany, but in 2025, they’ll be going bigger and broader at every event.</p>



<p>Here are the events that the team at Gaming World Media is most looking forward to for 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-around-the-world-with-gwm">Around The World With GWM</h2>



<p>I caught up with Jake and Hunter recently, eager to learn about their most anticipated events coming in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-tokyo-games-show-japan">1. Tokyo Games Show (Japan)</h3>



<p><em>Tokyo Games Show is an event that has been on our radar for a long time, as one of the biggest games shows out there. After visiting Korea for G-STAR, I can’t even begin to imagine how much bigger and better TGS will be.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-2-blast-austin-major-united-states">2. BLAST Austin Major (United States)</h3>



<p><em>A North American Major is extremely exciting for us, as we get to see all the NA Counter-Strike fans come out to enjoy the esport. Esports events don’t often happen in North America, so the excitement that surrounds something like this is definitely something to look forward to.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-3-runefest-united-kingdom">3. Runefest (United Kingdom)</h3>



<p><em>As a lifetime RuneScape fan, Runefast has been something I wanted to attend since I was a kid. After hearing that Jagex is working on a new open-world survival game, I’m even more excited to see what they have in store.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-4-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia">4. Esports World Cup (Saudi Arabia)</h3>



<p><em>The EWC really just gives us some of the best access to multiple esports and players. Being able to hop from stage to stage and put out loads of coverage and interviews is a perfect scenario for us.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-5-six-invitational-boston-united-states">5. Six Invitational Boston (United States)</h3>



<p><em>Though I can’t expect the Six Invitational to match up to the hype it had this past year, I’m still thrilled that the event is in North America. We had a lot of fun with the Rainbow Six crowd and Ubisoft this past year, so I can’t wait to run it back in Boston.</em></p>

<p>Arrowhead’s CEO and CCO have responded to the community’s backlash against the price of Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 cosmetics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 cosmetics <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-x-killzone-cosmetics-are-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped yesterday</a>, launching the title’s first crossover. However, the community isn’t too happy about the collaboration’s prices and has expressed dissatisfaction on social media. Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani and CCO Johan Pilestedt have acknowledged and responded to the community’s sentiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-killzone-collab-pricing-backlash-pilestedt-on-warbond-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VG247</a>, a user on <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1869577821296947219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> pointed out to Pilestedt that he felt the price of Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 cosmetics was a bit steep, considering this is only half of the collaboration. Pilestedt said he is sorry if the user found the prices high, and the devs are “looking at all the feedback”. Additionally, the CCO revealed that this collaboration would’ve been a Warbond. However, they decided against it as the devs thought “a higher-priced warbond would carry negative sentiment.”</p>



<p>Yesterday, the CEO also took to the game’s official Discord to respond to criticism about Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 cosmetics prices. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-players-rip-into-arrowhead-for-straight-up-ridiculous-killzone-crossover-prices-ceo-defends-the-choice-the-more-of-this-we-sell-the-more-illuminate-type-stuff-we-can-keep-dropping-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Jorjani stated, “Hey, quick comment on the Helghast stuff. Firstly, this is our first collaboration, so we’ll figure it out as we go along. Let us know what you’d like to see in the future. Secondly, it’s optional. The more of this we sell, the more Illuminate-type stuff we can keep dropping for free.”</p>



<p>Jorjani clarified in a later message that his wording could have been better. He added, “I meant to say that the better the game does, the more stuff we can do. Part of Omens of Tyranny was made by co-development studios that we could not have done unless you fine folks supported us through supercredit purchases.”</p>

<p>In one of the strangest stories you’ll hear, an NFL owner reportedly made team decisions based on player ratings in EA Sports Madden NFL. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6005172/2024/12/19/woody-johnson-jets-madden-sons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Athletic</a>, New York Jets owner Woody Johnson vetoed trades and questioned potential free agent signings due to various ratings in the game. </p>



<p>In one particular instance, Johnson nixed an offseason trade for former Denver Broncos wide receiver (WR) Jerry Jeudy because his Madden rating “wasn’t high enough”. Jeudy ended up being traded to the Cleveland Browns instead. In his first season in Cleveland, he has put up 1,052 receiving yards and four touchdowns.</p>



<p>Another example was Johnson questioning the signing of guard John Simpson. The report states that Johnson didn’t like Simpson’s awareness rating in the game, leading to push back. Luckily for the Jets, General Manager Joe Douglas signed Simpson who has been one of the better players at his position this season.</p>



<p>As far as why Johnson is using Madden ratings to make real-life decisions, it stems from his sons Jack and Brick after they were including in meetings. </p>



<p>“When we’re discussing things, you’ll hear Woody cite something that Brick or Jack read online that’s being weighed equally against whatever opinion someone else in the department has,” an anonymous Jets executive told The Athletic.</p>



<p>For what it’s worth, a spokesperson for the Jets declined the claims.  </p>
