<p>PlayStation logos have started appearing on Starfield’s creation club website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by Okami13_ on <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/1900584005000368350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), a mod on the Starfield Creation Club website features a PlayStation logo along with a PC Game and Xbox logos, hinting that a PS5 release could be around the corner. These logos are supposed to signify what platforms this mod is available on, and it’s surprising to see PlayStation listed among PC and Xbox when the platform hasn’t even been officially confirmed yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Starfield mod in question with a PlayStation Logo is called <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/5eb39a17-916a-4220-85ff-b710174e184f/WIP___Ship_Decals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WIP—Ship Decals</a> and has been created by ValleysEdge. At the time of writing, the PlayStation logo is still visible on the mod’s page on Starfield’s official Creations website. The mod adds “work in progress” decals to your ship. Its installation size is 8.9 KB, and it was created on March 12.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have yet to hear anything official about Starfield coming to the PlayStation 5. All we have heard is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phil Spencer</a> stating earlier this year that no Xbox game stays put. Bethesda also recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-plans-starfield-not-saying-anything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> they have “a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year.” Could one of those things be a PS5 release? We will have to wait to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-and-fallout-4-are-also-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent claim stated</a> that Starfield and Fallout are coming to Nintendo Switch 2. Also, Starfield character artist has revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-character-artist-reveals-why-gore-was-cut-from-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why gore was cut from the game</a>. What are your thoughts on PlayStation logos appearing on Starfield’s Creation Club website?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Saber CCO’s recent statement hints that Star Wars KOTOR Remake is still in development.</p>



<p>Tim Willits, Saber Interactive’s Chief Creative Officer, recently shared some information on the games they are working on. Willits stated on <a href="https://x.com/TimWillits/status/1900374508113961250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> that the studio is currently working on several games across different genres; however, all the games Saber has spoken about are “still in development.” This statement has led many to speculate that the KOTOR remake is still in development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details about the KOTOR remake have been scarce since the game was confirmed in 2021. Since then, Embracer Group has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kotor-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoken about</a> all the games in development “as of May 24, 2023.” The list included the likes of Tomb Raider (final title TBC), Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine II, Remnant 2, Ride 5, and Star Wars: KOTOR remake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have not received concrete details about the Star Wars: KOTOR remake or an official confirmation from developers. The original KOTOR was released in 2003, and players had to become the last hope of the Jedi Order and master the power of the Force to save the Republic. The game has a unique Star Wars RPG experience with unique characters, creatures, vehicles, and planets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KOTOR encourages players to learn to use the Force and wield 40 different powers while building their lightsaber. Players get to explore some of the most popular regions in the franchise, including Tatooine and the Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk. Several customisable characters can be added to your party, and there are eight enormous worlds in the player’s starship, Ebon Hawk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Star Wars Eclipse developer is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-eclipse-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unaffected by Netease’s restructuring</a>. Also,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-star-wars-collab-heresy-act-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Destiny 2 recently</a> received Star Wars skins. What are your thoughts on Saber Interactive’s CCO suggesting that a KOTOR remake is still coming?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
