<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could be getting a major boost in games after it launches. According to a new claim from known leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NateTheHate</a>, Xbox exclusives Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and Halo: The Master Chief Collection are coming to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The games are also reported to be coming to PlayStation 5 as well.</p>







<p>“Games that I have heard will be released multiplatform in 2025, beyond the obvious, include Flight Simulator—will come to PlayStation 5 and Switch 2—and Halo: The Master Chief Collection will be coming to PS5 and Switch 2 as well,” NateTheHate said.</p>



<p>While those two games were the main ones discussed, they don’t appear to be the only ones coming to the upcoming Nintendo console. In a reply to a <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1877737536048574891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on social media</a> about games coming to the system, Windows Central Executive Editor Jez Corden said the total would be “way more than that”. He then followed up with that the games would be “most older games/timed stuff”.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct Announced for January 23&nbsp;</a></h6>



<p>No other details about what older games could come to the system were mentioned. Aside from Xbox games, NateTheHate also suggested that Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth—both PlayStation 5 console exclusives—will come to the system. They’ll also be coming to Xbox starting with Remake in 2025 and Rebirth in 2026.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s selection of editions can’t come soon enough for long-time fans. It’s a chance to separate the casual audience from the hardcore players who adore the hardcore gameplay.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has provided a delectable selection of treats, depending on which Deliverance 2 edition you pick up. From a traditional Standard Edition to the pricey but prize-ridden Collector’s Edition, there’s something for everyone. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> has a lot of pressure to perform after the massive success of the debut title, but I’d argue that so do its launch-day editions.</p>



<p>Everyone has a Collector’s Edition nowadays, and it’s up to the team to make Deliverance 2’s special. Let’s find out if it is.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-edition">Every Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Edition</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re coming for at least one of those editions. Credit to Warhorse Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has three editions to choose from and pre-order: <strong>Collector’s Edition</strong>, <strong>Gold Edition</strong>, and <strong>Standard Edition</strong>.</p>



<p>I’m not shocked to see <a href="https://www.kingdomcomerpg.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deliverance 2</a> has three main editions. Occasionally, four editions might be seen for a new game, but a Standard Edition, a Collector’s Edition, and something in-between is the norm.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-collector-s-edition-explained">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2—Collector’s Edition Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>That’s a lot of goodies. Credit to Warhorse Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-collectors-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Collector’s Edition</a> is the ultimate bundle for fans as it comes with the game, a physical statue, digital bonuses, and a whole host of other smaller tangible tidbits.</p>



<p>It costs <strong>$199.99 </strong>or <strong>£189.99</strong>, and while this is expensive, I’ve seen much worse for Collector’s Editions. Its price tag can be ignored though as these super-duper editions always have enough demand to make their availability scarce. If you want your own, you better be quick.</p>



<p>Here’s the complete list of contents for the Collector’s Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>A copy of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</li>



<li>“The Lion’s Quest” Bonus Quest pre-order DLC.</li>



<li>Expansion Pass for post-launch DLC.</li>



<li>Henry &amp; Pebbles 30cm Statue.</li>



<li>Letter of Hope.</li>



<li>The King’s Rebels Collectable Cards.</li>



<li>Coats of Valor: Enamel Pin Set.</li>



<li>Alleys of Kuttenberg.</li>



<li>Gallant Huntman’s Kit (digital content).</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-gold-edition-explained">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2—Gold Edition Explained</h2>



<p>The Gold Edition is the middle ground, offering a slightly more lucrative package than the Standard Edition, but costing considerably less than the Collector’s Edition.</p>



<p>This is for users wanting to show their support for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and wanting some half-decent content in the process. The extra goodies here are digital-only though, so bear this in mind if you’re after physical memorabilia. You’re looking at <strong>$89.99</strong> or <strong>£79.99</strong> here for a purchase.</p>



<p>This is the full set of goodies in the Gold Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>A copy of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</li>



<li>“The Lion’s Quest” Bonus Quest pre-order DLC.</li>



<li>Expansion Pass for post-launch DLC.</li>



<li>Gallant Huntman’s Kit.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-standard-edition-explained">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2—Standard Edition Explained</h2>



<p>Finally, the Standard Edition is a routine copy of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 with no extra thrills or spills.</p>



<p>If you’re eager, you can secure the pre-order bonus if you order ahead of its launch. This at least secures you a bit of extra content you wouldn’t get otherwise—and it costs <strong>$69.99</strong> or <strong>£59.99</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s a smaller list, but this is the full inventory included:</p>



<ul>
<li>A copy of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</li>



<li>“The Lion’s Quest” Bonus Quest pre-order DLC (If you pre-order).</li>
</ul>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has been a long time in the making. It has been almost seven years since the release of the first game, pushed to market following a Kickstarter campaign that raised $1.3 million in just one month. On February 4, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be released, and I’ve been lucky enough to piece together a preview of the game.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of the first title, which was steeped in historical accuracy, featured gruelling mechanics, and had an authentic story that left you feeling immersed and challenged in equal amounts. All that and more awaits you in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>Here’s my full preview – it’s an exploration of a cinematic masterpiece in progress.</p>



<p>If you’d prefer, you can watch the full preview in video format:</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-world">Enter the World</h2>



<p>I can’t stress how immersive I’m already finding Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 to be. With a surround-sound headset, I’m traipsing through summertime forests and fields, hearing the leaves and brush crunch under my feet while birds twitter above me in the canopy. The light’s rays pierce the branches, splashing a burst against a nearby stag, who catches my scent and scarpers through the trees.</p>



<p>Perhaps I’ll hunt later.</p>



<p>In the next moment, I’m on a beaten path flanked by a twinkling stream, which would be idyllic if I wasn’t being held up by cutthroats. They demand my Groschen; I simply plead with them to leave me alone, for I have nothing.</p>



<p>They don’t care, and in a flash, I’m on my back.</p>



<p>After a reload, I’m in a nearby village, watching a fight break out between two shopkeepers, for whatever reason. The townspeople gather to watch the spectacle as I turn tail and walk down the path, avoiding making eye contact because I’m not familiar with the residents and they are inherently mistrusting of me because of a recent tavern brawl.</p>



<p>That’s how granular Warhorse Studios has made Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>From the reputation system to how the AI treats items you’ve dropped, and from manually smithing a sword step-by-step to needing to dry herbs and smoke meat to preserve everything, the finest details and all the most monumental moments alike have been considered by the studio in this awe-inspiring game.</p>



<p>This is just the beginning.</p>



<h2 id="h-henry-returns">Henry Returns</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Henry of Skalitz (Tom McKay) is one of my favourite game characters of all time. His ascendance in the first game was nothing short of memorable, with his rags-to-riches story capturing perfectly the true grit of a survivor hellbent on turning around his ill fortune.</p>



<p>Henry returns in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, flanked by Sir Hans Capon (Luke Dale), his trusty companion – a brash, cocky counterpart with a sense of swagger as large as the fortune that sits in his family’s coffers.</p>



<p><em>Audentes fortuna iuvat</em>, and all that.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 sees our troubled duo land in hot water within a few minutes of the game’s opening sequences, left for dead after a skirmish and a near-naked chase through the night. The game’s deeply cinematic introduction left my mouth agape – everything from the soundtrack to the way the camera pans over medieval vistas blew my hair back right off the bat.</p>



<p>Immediately, McKay and Dale deliver stellar performances, perfectly representing the chemistry they’ve built up both on- and off-screen over the years. There’s humour, there’s intensity, and for the first three or four hours, there’s… Well, the typical tutorial missions you’d expect from a game like this – but it’s all <strong>great</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’ve never even heard of Kingdom Come Deliverance, you’ll enter the second game unsure of what to expect, but after a few hours settling into the ambitious open-world RPG, you’ll be chomping at the bit to explore, grow as a character, and pursue the winding, branching story.</p>



<h2 id="h-evolution-at-its-finest">Evolution at its Finest</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The first Kingdom Come Deliverance game was a marvel – but it was rough around the edges at times. It felt a little sluggish, there were a fair few bugs to deal with, and occasionally, it felt a bit <strong>too </strong>challenging. It’s not a game that holds your hand, but sometimes the difficulty level felt a bit too punishing for the average gamer.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 retains that obvious challenge in the earliest sequences of the game, presenting players with a dire set of circumstances that take them from being a lauded nobleman to little more than a peasant begging for scraps. Where you once had a fine set of armour and a razor-sharp sword, you now have rags and bloodied knuckles.</p>



<p>That’s the welcome you get in KCD2 – but it’s phenomenal.</p>



<p>For those new to the franchise, you’re starting at the beginning, building Henry of Skalitz from the ground up and shaping him into what you want, and Warhorse Studios has done such a perfect job of explaining <strong>why </strong>that’s happening. This is an RPG at heart, and from the skill paths to the way you build your character based on your desired fighting style, everything is manipulated and experienced by you, the player.</p>



<p>For my Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 preview, I worked my way through the first ten hours or so of the game, but that was enough time to see that Warhorse has taken everything from the first game that I loved and improved upon it immeasurably – an evolution indeed.</p>



<p>Visually, the game is <strong>stunning</strong>. The audio palette is sumptuous and realistic, the movement mechanics are much smoother and more satisfying than the first game, and combat has been toned down a bit and optimised. The game’s AI is believable, interactive, and sensible, and the world around you feels as though it exists.</p>



<p>Of course, it helps that it’s rooted in history and authenticity – Warhorse made sure to employ the sharpest experts to make sure everything from swinging a sword to the behaviour of the local farmers is correct to the game’s period.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, I’m having no issues. I’m playing KCD2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-pc-specs-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a high-end gaming PC</a> with a controller, and running it at Ultra 1440p is giving me no concerns about the game’s stability. It’s buttery smooth and (almost entirely) bug-free.</p>



<h2 id="h-forge-your-story">Forge Your Story</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I spoke to Tom McKay</a>, the actor behind Henry of Skalitz, he let me know about the depth of the choice and consequence system in this game. As I explored the opening sequences, piecing together the steps for my Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 preview, I became aware of just how impactful even a passing comment in a conversation could be.</p>



<p>The world is truly what you make of it, and if you want your Henry of Skalitz to be a conniving, manipulating criminal, then so be it. If you’d rather be a stalwart and honest member of the wider community in the open world of KCD2, then you’re free to do that as well.</p>



<p>As you explore the game and mould your character, you’ll come to experience intense fights, incredibly cinematic cutscenes – all of which are fully acted – and at times, a slower pacing that makes you feel as though you’ve been teleported back in time by a few hundred years.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 starts as a very slow burner. You might not even hit the title flash for a good while, depending on your play style. It’s designed to give all players a solid introduction, a spread of the backstory, and a tutorial for the game’s many mechanics. It’s nice – it feels natural and entertaining, and the best way to learn is by doing, so I was more than happy to crack on with it.</p>



<h2 id="h-not-long-to-wait">Not Long to Wait</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be released worldwide</a> on February 4, 2025. That’s just a few weeks away – and until then, I’ll be neck-deep in the game, exploring every nook and cranny in preparation for my full review, which you’ll find here on Insider Gaming on February 3.</p>



<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this brief Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 preview – stay tuned for more coverage as the game’s release date draws closer, and as always, stop by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to chat about the game.</p>
