<p>When you think of modern-day online shooters, you have to consider Overwatch and Fortnite. It feels almost wrong that the two brands haven’t come together at some point. New leaks suggest the sought-after crossover between the two giants is happening—brace yourself.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-earn-lego-fortnite-ninjago-2025-twitch-drops-all-rewards-how-to-get/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> is still red-hot and untouchable in 2025, whereas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-patch-december-overhauls-competitive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch 2</a>‘s (and the brand as a whole) has dropped off a bit in recent times, but it’s still a bona fide behemoth in the shooter genre. The two franchises have never partnered up once over the years, but leaks suggest this could change.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-amp-overwatch-crossover-possible-according-to-leaks">Fortnite &amp; Overwatch Crossover Possible, According To Leaks</h2>



<p>Hypex (One of the world’s biggest sources for news and leaks) has shared new information—courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR"></a><a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Wensoing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wensoing</a>—of a potential collab. They stress that this is only a “POSSIBLE” collab, so take this information with a huge pinch of salt until we know more.</p>







<p><a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR"></a>SpushFNBR shared leaked assets on December 11, revealing a bunch of LEGO heads and pieces. One headpiece that players were quick to jump on was a potential match for <strong>Hanzo</strong>, from Overwatch. It appears to only be for LEGO, though.</p>

<p>Hypex explained about the Hanzo hair model: “It was used on an early version of a Fortnite LEGO skin, then removed, then re-added today again.”<a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR"></a></p>

<p>There’s not too much more to go on for now. Fortnite is lining up a bunch of collabs coming up, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-leak-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Park</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kim-kardashian-fortnite-guess-what-players-saying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim Kardashian</a>, and anything else Epic Games can get its hands on, it seems.</p>
