<p>Pokémon mania continues to spread around the world, and 2026 is set to be a huge year for the franchise, which celebrates 30 years since the release of the first games in Japan.</p>



<p>In the three decades since, Pokémon has introduced over 1,000 creatures to catch and collect in video games, alongside thousands of anime episodes, full-length films, an extremely successful TCG, and countless spin-off titles.</p>



<p>With next year being such a landmark occasion for the Pokémon franchise, Insider Gaming has taken a look at what to expect from the company in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-pokemon-in-2026">What to Expect From Pokémon in 2026</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New World Order. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-pokopia-launches-a-new-series-of-games">Pokopia Launches a New Series of Games</h3>



<p>Due to launch on March 5, Pokopia is set to be the first Pokémon title to release in 2026, and the first Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive for the franchise—although there is a way to play on the original Switch.</p>



<p>The concept of a Pokémon version of an Animal Crossing-like game seems like a perfect match and if the title is as successful as it looks likely to be, it will likely spark the start of a new series of games.</p>



<p>Pokopia may feature Pokémon from a variety of generations, but it appears to be set in Kanto, with a post-apocalyptic theme leaked, which leaves the door open to adventures across even more regions in the future.</p>



<h3 id="h-30th-anniversary-tcg-set">30th Anniversary TCG Set</h3>



<p>A 30th anniversary TCG set for Pokémon is a surefire guarantee, with trademarks already registered in Japan. It doesn’t take a genius to predict them, as previous anniversaries saw the Celebrations set release in 2021, and Generations in 2016.</p>



<p>Exactly what Pokémon has up their sleeve remains to be seen, though they could opt to reprint classic cards once again. There are countless possibilities, however, and plenty of debate around what would be the best move for Pokémon<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Either way, it’s a guaranteed money-spinner for the Pokémon franchise, particularly given the craziness in the market currently, which, sadly, doesn’t look likely to stop for a while.</p>



<h3 id="h-gen-10-releases-on-nintendo-switch-2">Gen 10 Releases on Nintendo Switch 2</h3>



<p>2026 will mark four years since the release of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, making it the longest gap between generation releases since Black and White were released in 2010, and the next generation of Pokémon<strong> </strong>is almost certain to arrive next year.</p>



<p>Pokémon Day 2026 would be the perfect time for the first reveal, and it seems likely to be when the first teaser will be shown, with a full release coming at the back-end of 2026 in a similar spot to where Legends: Z-A released this year.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for original Switch players, Gen 10 is likely to be the first main title released as a Switch 2 exclusive, setting a precedent for future releases to follow.</p>



<figure><figcaption>New generation. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-black-amp-white-remakes">Pokémon Black &amp; White Remakes</h3>



<p>Black and White are the next games in line for a remake, and were widely expected to be released this year, but Pokémon went quiet and, following on from the rather disappointing Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl in 2021, it could be that the entire approach has shifted.</p>



<p>Remakes of Gen 5 are inevitable at some point, however, and they’d be the perfect signing-off game for the Switch era, releasing on both the original console and Switch 2. </p>



<p>Black and White remakes in 2026 are far from a guarantee, however, as the aforementioned Gen 4 remake titles seem to have left a lasting impact, and not in a good way. That’s all for the best, though, as it’s better for time to be taken to hit the remakes in the way that Heart Gold and Soul Silver did, for example.</p>



<h3 id="h-more-pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansions">More Pokémon TCG Pocket Expansions</h3>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has achieved vast success in its first year since its initial release, and it’s only going to get bigger from here, which makes more expansions in the game in 2026 one of the easiest predictions to make.</p>



<p>TCG Pocket has moved into the Mega Evolution scene with the start of the ‘B’ sets, a trend likely to remain for the foreseeable future, but it’s already exciting to consider what could be on the horizon, considering the game has almost 30 years of TCG history to reflect back on for inspiration.</p>



<p>A 30th anniversary set in TCG Pocket seems to be a solid bet for sure, and there are plenty of options when Gen 10 comes around, too. </p>



<h3 id="h-another-pokemon-mobile-title">Another Pokémon Mobile Title</h3>



<p>A flurry of Pokémon titles have been released on mobile devices in recent years, including big hits like Pokémon Go, TCG Pocket, Cafe Remix, and more, so it isn’t hard to see another Pokémon title launch onto mobile in 2026.</p>



<p>It’s already been confirmed that Pokémon Champions will be released on mobile, but an entirely new game is possible. There are endless possibilities, with the ability to tie into existing games or offer something different entirely.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-lego-sets-make-a-wave">Pokémon LEGO Sets Make a Wave</h3>



<p>After an eternity of waiting, Pokémon and LEGO have finally partnered together, and the first sets from the huge collab will be released in 2026, but expect there to be a fight to secure them.</p>



<p>LEGO and Pokémon are both extremely popular hobbies, with both fanbases often having a fight to get the products they want, so don’t be surprised if you struggle to find any LEGO Pokémon products in your local store.</p>



<p>The good news is, LEGO is a lot better at making sure products are available long-term and in greater quantity than Pokémon’s TCG side, so it shouldn’t lead to a scalper frenzy.</p>

<p>2025 has been another big year for gaming, and while the past 12 months have been headlined by huge releases and major updates to existing titles, there’s also been a slew of weird moments.</p>



<p>Take a trip down memory lane with Insider Gaming to take a look at the weirdest gaming moments from 2025, and don’t forget to share yours!</p>



<h2 id="h-2025-s-weirdest-gaming-moments">2025’s Weirdest Gaming Moments</h2>



<h3 id="h-assassin-s-creed-s-attack-on-titan-crossover">Assassin’s Creed’s Attack On Titan Crossover</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Weird duo. Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bringing the world of Attack On Titan into the Assassin’s Creed universe was always going to be a weird choice, and it became even weirder when players actually got their hands on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-x-attack-on-titan-crossover-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new content in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, which went viral for all the wrong reasons.</p>



<p>Some of the screenshots shared on social media following the release of the limited-time quest were harrowing, and there were plenty of annoyances around both the disappointing content introduced and the fact that it was only available to complete for an extremely small period of time.</p>



<h3 id="h-fortnite-s-darth-vader-ai">Fortnite’s Darth Vader AI</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The Force Unleashed. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Back in May, coinciding with the annual Star Wars day, the huge Disney franchise once again launched a collab with Fortnite, bringing new content, characters, skins, and more into the Epic Games title during a dedicated mini-season, which also featured Darth Vader as a recruitable ally, with AI interaction using the actual voice of James Earl Jones.</p>



<p>It doesn’t take a genius to predict where an AI-voice for an iconic character would go wrong, and it wasn’t too long until players found ways to avoid Epic Games’ restrictions entirely, leading to viral slips where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-darth-vader-fortnite-slurs-epic-patching-fix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vader engaged in inflammatory language</a> and controversial situations.</p>



<p>Epic Games hasn’t brought back a similar AI character since, and it’s clear that major improvements are needed if the idea is to be revisited.</p>



<h3 id="h-mindseye-s-messy-release">Mindseye’s Messy Release</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Mess. Image via Build a Rocket Boy</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gamers were hoping that Mindseye would present a Grand Theft Auto alternative, particularly following the latest delay in GTA 6, and Mindseye, on paper at least, looked like it could potentially fill that void for a bit. However, not only did Mindseye fall way short of that mark, but it ended up being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-reviews-creep-in-worst-rated-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of 2025’s worst games</a>.</p>



<p>Criticism was directed at all areas of the game, with game-breaking bugs present, a sub-par storyline, unjoyable characters, and more all receiving the brunt of those criticisms, and things took an even weirder turn when Build A Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard claimed on Discord that the negative reception was part of a third-party campaign to make a “concerted effort to trash the game and the studio.”</p>



<h3 id="h-gta-5-becomes-too-realistic">GTA 5 Becomes Too Realistic</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Too much VR. Image via Rockstar</figcaption></figure>



<p>One player enjoying the world of Grand Theft Auto 5 had a much more realistic experience than they could have ever anticipated, after a car evading police crashed into a woman’s house while she herself was trying to escape the cops in the game.</p>



<p>Emma Graves detailed the terrifying experience to the <a href="https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/crime/leeds-woman-petitions-for-safety-measures-on-residential-road-in-armley-after-car-crashes-into-flat-5320663">Yorkshire Eve</a><a href="https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/crime/leeds-woman-petitions-for-safety-measures-on-residential-road-in-armley-after-car-crashes-into-flat-5320663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">n</a><a href="https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/crime/leeds-woman-petitions-for-safety-measures-on-residential-road-in-armley-after-car-crashes-into-flat-5320663">ing Post</a>, saying the incident was “just so ironic” and she “literally couldn’t” make it up. While it wasn’t funny at the time, as the crash occurred inches away from where she was playing, she’s found the humorous side since.</p>



<h3 id="h-make-fps-great-again">Make FPS Great Again</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Controversial. Image via Summer Games Fest</figcaption></figure>



<p>At Summer Games Fest, 1047 co-founder Ian Proulx took to the stage to promote Splitgate 2 bizarrely, wearing a cap that read “Make FPS Great Again” and calling out Call of Duty directly with his comments. Both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-ceo-apologizes-for-sgf-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incidents sparked controversy</a> and stirred up quite an aftermath, though Proulx insisted the cap, which mimicked Donald Trump’s infamous presidential election catchphrase, was not a political statement.</p>



<p>The irony is that Splitgate 2 far from achieved any goal of making the FPS genre “great again,” with Metacritic reviews narrowly seeing the title edge out the much-maligned Black Ops 7, and being way adrift of Battlefield 6. If any title made FPS’ great again, it was undoubtedly Battlefield.</p>



<h3 id="h-miss-piggy-amp-geoff-keighley-flirting">Miss Piggy &amp; Geoff Keighley Flirting</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Uncomfortable. Image via The Game Awards</figcaption></figure>



<p>At The Game Awards, the on-stage flirting between Geoff Keighley and Miss Piggy was a fever dream, particularly for those in areas of the world in time zones that saw the event take place in the middle of the night, and it’s fair to say that Kermit the Frog would not approve of the incidents.</p>



<p>Seeing an iconic Muppets character engaging in the flirting was weird enough, but seeing Keighley reciprocate made for uncomfortable viewing.</p>







<figure><figcaption>What the Duck? Image via Team Soda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Escape From Duckov may sound like the sort of weird advertisement for a mobile game you’d find appearing mid-video on YouTube, but not only was it a major launch, it actually became one of the most successful titles of the year, adding a further feather in the cap of the extraction shooter genre.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Millions of players across the world</a> splashed out to purchase Escape From Duckov, with the game also boasting a strong audience in China, and it sits with overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-literal-peanut-shining-on-the-streaming-stage">A Literal Peanut Shining on The Streaming Stage</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Nutty. Image via Twitch</figcaption></figure>



<p>The world of streaming has often been weird and wonderful, though things took an even stranger turn in 2025 with the emergence and huge reach of TheBurntPeanut, who boasts over 1 million followers on Twitch and is closing in on that mark on YouTube, too.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut was also an award winner in 2025, taking home the prize for the Best VTuber at the Streamer Awards, sparking some controversy in the VTuber community. Overall, it showed the weird and wonderful world of streaming, providing evidence that even a humble snack can rise to the top.</p>



<h3 id="h-gamestop-s-staplegate">GameStop’s Staplegate</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Odd. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>GameStop can’t escape the headlines and controversy, regularly causing a stir in 2025, but by far the biggest blowup was Staplegate after the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, with GameStop stapling receipts to the console’s box, in some cases causing damage to the screen.</p>



<p>One of the Staplegate copies of the Switch 2 console <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamestops-switch-2-stapler-sells-for-250000-at-auction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold for six figures on eBay</a>, because of course it did, and the whole incident really puts the claims that there is no such thing as bad press to the test.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NVIDIA Pushing RTX 5090 Prices to $5000 in 2026, Rumor Claims]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-prices-to-5000-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1394851</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The ongoing impact of artificial intelligence’s growth could be felt even more acutely by PC gamers in 2026, according to a new rumor. It has been claimed that next year, NVIDIA will increase the prices of the RTX 5090 GPU to as much as $5,000 for a <strong>single unit</strong>. It has been suggested that price increases will start rolling out from January onwards.</p>



<p>NVIDIA isn’t alone in the pricing boom. In a recent report from a South Korean outlet, it was claimed that sources close to the technology have stressed AMD will also be boosting price tags on its highest-tier GPUs.</p>







<h2 id="h-gpu-prices-are-about-to-get-ridiculous">GPU Prices Are About To Get Ridiculous</h2>



<p>It’s easy to see the cost of top-tier GPUs soaring through 2026 when you look at how much <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/">RAM costs have skyrocketed</a> through 2025. The construction of AI-fed data centers and the technology backbone to support the growing vertical have absolutely shattered the hardware market in the last few months, but we’re not out of the woods yet.</p>



<p>In a recent claim <a href="https://mobile.newsis.com/view/NISX20251229_0003458273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from Newsis</a>, a South Korean outlet, it was stressed that we’re just seeing the beginning of monumental and borderline ridiculous price hikes in the GPU space.</p>



<p>The report explained that sources have suggested a climb in the RTX 5090 stakes from $1,999 at launch this year to as much as $5,000 later in 2026. AMD’s RX 9000 series is apparently set to mimic that ticket growth, but not as steeply.</p>



<p>It was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Both companies are reportedly planning to continue raising GPU prices every month going forward. It’s highly likely that the price increases will extend across their entire product lineup, encompassing not only consumer GPUs but also GPUs for AI data centers and servers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The report then noted a quote from an ‘insider’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The average proportion of memory in the overall GPU manufacturing cost has recently exceeded 80%.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, this situation is having an impact on all areas of technology. Recent concerns surfaced regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ram-prices-next-gen/">development of the PlayStation 6</a>, the cellphone space is getting shaky, and RAM prices reached an all-time high in 2025.</p>



<p>It’s likely going to get worse before it gets better.</p>

<p>As gamers enter an all-new year, they’re looking forward to big releases, massive reveals, and of course, a slew of free games handed to them from subscription services like PS Plus. In a recent post, the first PS Plus game of January 2026 was revealed, and it’s coming in just a few days.</p>



<p>Fans of high-octane racing titles with an arcade twist will be pleased with what’s coming first to PS Plus in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-need-for-speed-unbound-coming-to-ps-plus">Need for Speed: Unbound Coming to PS Plus</h2>



<p>In a new post from Dealabs, it was leaked that the first game headed to PS Plus in January 2026 is Need for Speed: Unbound. It’ll be added to the PS Plus service from Tuesday, January 6th at 9 AM GMT.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-on-vous-revele-le-premier-jeu-du-mois-de-lannee-2026-60812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs report</a>, Need for Speed: Unbound will be available across all tiers of PS Plus: Essential, Extra, and Premium. It’s not yet clear what the ‘other two titles’ are that will join the service at the same time.</p>



<p>Need for Speed: Unbound was released in 2022 and stands as the most recent iteration in the popular racing series. It secured a Metascore of 77, which is regarded as ‘Generally Favorable’, so it should be a nice addition to the PlayStation Plus service.</p>



<p>We recently published a guide showcasing the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/10-best-games-you-must-play-on-playstation-plus-released-in-2025/">top PS Plus titles</a> on the service released in 2025 that you <strong>need </strong>to play. No racing games found a spot on the list, unfortunately. It did feature the likes of God of War: Ragnarok, Red Dead Redemption, and Alan Wake 2, though.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you intend to install Need for Speed: Unbound when it lands on PS Plus in January 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the first-person shooter space, fans of the two titans, Call of Duty and Battlefield, have found themselves up in arms again. This time, it’s over accusations that Electronic Arts has ‘blatantly copied’ Call of Duty art from days gone by, releasing a new Battlefield 6 skin that is eerily reminiscent of 2013’s Call of Duty Ghosts.</p>



<p>The latest Battlefield Pro battle pass contains a skin with a balaclava that’s admittedly walking the line between ‘inspired by’ and ‘pure replication’. Check it out below.</p>







<h2 id="h-did-electronic-arts-plagiarise-call-of-duty-ghosts">Did Electronic Arts Plagiarise Call of Duty Ghosts?</h2>



<p>If you’ve been in the Battlefield 6 space of late, you might have noticed the new Battlefield Pro battle pass drop that contains, amongst other things, the ‘Objective Ace’ skin.</p>



<p>If you were also around during 2013 and enjoyed Call of Duty Ghosts, you might have spotted something that doesn’t look right.</p>



<p>The Objective Ace skin for the Assault class has a balaclava that’s almost a stitch-for-stitch copy of the iconic ‘Ghosts’ balaclava from the 2013 Call of Duty game of the same name.</p>



<p>Here’s a comparison image of the two graphics side-by-side for you to make up your own mind:</p>

<p>On social media, fans were quick to draw comparisons with bright red arrows and circles, pointing out some of the obvious similarities. For instance, the ‘spiking’ of the skull to the base of the image, the ‘craack’ across the lower half of the skull, and the ‘chip’ above the right eyebrow.</p>



<p>It’s not <strong>identical</strong>, but it’s damn close, and that’s why fans have issues with this particular skin.</p>



<p>It’s difficult <strong>not </strong>to see the resemblance, but perhaps there are only so many ways you can represent a faded, scuffed, and worn skull motif on a balaclava. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the Battlefield 6 team came under fire on December 21 for using what was believed to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/">AI-generated art</a> for new sticker bundles. It’s not getting better, is it?</p>







<p>Do you think the Battlefield Pro balaclava is too close to the Call of Duty Ghosts art to be acceptable? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There’s no question about it: 2025 has been a standout year for video games. From massive AAA blockbusters to boundary-pushing indie gems, the release calendar has been stacked with quality, and many titles have earned widespread critical praise.</p>



<p>With the year drawing to a close, it’s the perfect moment to reflect on its strongest launches. This list is based solely on Metascore ratings from Metacritic. To qualify, a game must have been released in 2025 to <strong>over 25 critic reviews</strong>—apologies to The Legend of Zelda; as great as you are on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-switch-2-claimed-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, we want new games, not ports.</p>







<p>If you’re searching for the cream of the crop, here are the ten highest-rated video games that released in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-top-10-highest-rated-games-released-in-2025">Top 10 Highest Rated Games Released In 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-10-monster-hunter-wilds">10. Monster Hunter Wilds</h3>

<p><strong>Metascore: 88</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-showcase-announced-for-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter franchise</a> hardly needs an introduction. Venture through sprawling environments, craft and wield powerful weapons, and take down towering beasts—all in pursuit of better gear and ever-greater challenges. It’s a formula that has defined the series for years, and for good reason: it’s endlessly satisfying.</p>



<p>Capcom has long perfected this loop, and Monster Hunter Wilds showcases the series at its very best. It’s also the most approachable entry to date, making it an ideal starting point for newcomers. Whether you’re a veteran hunter or someone curious about diving in for the first time, Wilds stands tall as the newest and most impressive evolution of the franchise.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">9. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Take a trip back to medieval Europe. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 88</strong></p>



<p>It’s easy for early-year releases to slip from memory—especially in a stacked year like 2025—but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-devs-acquire-kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-lead-gameplay-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> refuses to be forgotten. Its remarkable immersion and gripping atmosphere have kept it firmly in the spotlight, resonating with critics right through to the year’s end.</p>



<p>Nearly every aspect of the game is executed with exceptional polish. The cutscenes, writing, visuals, and core gameplay all stand as shining examples of what a modern RPG can strive to be. If you’re a fan of rich, grounded storytelling paired with deeply engaging, authentic gameplay, then this is one 2025 release you absolutely shouldn’t overlook.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-dispatch">8. Dispatch</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Up there with the Telltale greats. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 89</strong></p>



<p>Dispatch may not have launched with the same blockbuster buzz as some of 2025’s heavy hitters, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-director-calls-dispatch-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quickly made a name for itself</a>, as it settles in as one of the highest-rated games of the year. AdHoc Studio’s episodic adventure blends sharp writing with a clever superhero twist, placing you in the role of Robert Robertson III—a former hero now managing crises from behind the scenes as a dispatcher. </p>



<p>If you thought the gameplay was reminiscent of Telltale games of old, then you’d be right. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-dispatch-adhoc-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AdHoc is made up of former Telltale veterans</a>, and Dispatch proudly channels that lineage with its branching choices, punchy character dialogue, and narrative-driven pacing. Each episode plays out as a slick animated series brought to life, backed by strong performances and confident direction. It’s tightly crafted, consistently entertaining, and a standout reminder of how impactful choice-based storytelling can be.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">7. Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Kojima at his best. Image by Kojima Productions.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 89</strong></p>



<p>There are few creators in the industry with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-doesnt-know-if-od-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vision as distinctive as Hideo Kojima’s</a>, and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach might be his most striking showcase yet. At a glance, it may appear to be another atmospheric delivery-focused “walking sim,” sending players across sweeping landscapes with cargo in tow—but that surface-level read barely scratches the depth beneath. The sequel expands on the original’s foundations with richer mechanics, broader exploration, and a renewed emphasis on improvisation and survival.</p>



<p>At its core, Kojima once again crafts a story about human connection and the lengths we go to forge and maintain it. Every mechanic, from traversal to cargo management, serves a narrative purpose, reinforcing the themes woven throughout the journey. Combined with an exceptional cast delivering some of the year’s strongest performances, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-film-a24-original-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2</a> lands as one of 2025’s most affecting and ambitious releases.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-hollow-knight-silksong">6. Hollow Knight: Silksong</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The wait didn’t disappoint. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 90</strong></p>



<p>There were stretches over the past few years when it genuinely felt like the long-awaited sequel to Hollow Knight might never arrive. Team Cherry maintained an unwavering silence that became almost mythical in its own right, leaving fans to wonder if Silksong would remain a dream rather than a reality. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">But when it finally launched</a>, the wait proved more than worthwhile—Silksong didn’t just meet expectations, it shattered them.</p>



<p>What makes the game so remarkable is how confidently it elevates every facet of the original. Movement and combat are faster, smoother, and more expressive than ever, giving Hornet a distinct identity that feels both familiar and thrillingly new. The world is richer and more atmospheric, the story deeper, and the level design more ambitious in scope. Silksong accomplishes what many believed impossible: it meaningfully improves on Hollow Knight, delivering an adventure that stands as one of the year’s defining triumphs and a masterclass in Metroidvania design.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-donkey-kong-bananza">5. Donkey Kong Bananza</h3>



<figure><figcaption>On the hunt for Bananas! Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 91</strong></p>



<p>Fans had been hoping for a Super Mario Odyssey sequel ever since the Switch classic was first released, but Nintendo ultimately had a different vision in mind. Donkey Kong Bonanza arrived as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananzas-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spiritual successor rather than a direct follow-up</a>—a game that channels Odyssey’s spirit while carving out its own bold identity.</p>







<p>What’s immediately clear is that it’s unapologetically a Donkey Kong adventure. The refined elegance of Mario is swapped for DK’s heavier, more powerful movement, giving the platforming a satisfyingly weighty feel. Yet the team didn’t abandon the fluidity that made Odyssey such a modern platforming masterpiece. Instead, they built upon it, designing levels with verticality, momentum, and environmental interaction tailored perfectly to DK’s strengths. The result is a vibrant, imaginative, and fiercely inventive 3D platformer, one that proudly stands as one of the best the genre has seen in years, and one of the highest-rated games of 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-split-fiction">4. Split Fiction</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hatch your very own dragons. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 91</strong></p>



<p>Hazelight Studios has practically redefined what co-op gaming can look like, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-is-on-course-to-outsell-it-takes-twos-20-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> carries that torch with confidence. It’s a game built entirely around collaboration—so much so that playing it solo is downright impossible. Its enforced teamwork isn’t a gimmick but one of its greatest strengths, pushing players to communicate, coordinate, and experience every moment together.</p>



<p>Even beyond its co-op brilliance, Split Fiction is an exceptional piece of game design. The sheer variety on display is astonishing: one moment you’re soaring across a fantasy realm atop a dragon, and the next you’re tearing through a neon sci-fi setting on a high-speed motorbike. Each sequence feels fresh, inventive, and packed with personality. It’s wild, imaginative, and endlessly entertaining.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-blue-prince">3. Blue Prince</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll never stop exploring. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 92</strong></p>



<p>Blue Prince emerged as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-creator-praises-blue-prince-as-one-of-the-best-games-hes-ever-played/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of 2025’s standout indie hits</a>, offering a clever blend of mystery, strategy, and roguelike design. You play as Simon P. Jones, tasked with uncovering the hidden 46th room inside the ever-shifting Mt. Holly Estate. Each day, the mansion reshuffles itself, forcing you to reopen doors, navigate new layouts, and piece together clues as you steadily rebuild your understanding of its labyrinthine structure.</p>



<p>What makes Blue Prince so captivating is how it turns that unpredictability into a deeply satisfying puzzle. Every run reveals new fragments of lore, fresh room combinations, and surprising twists that make the mansion feel alive. It’s inventive, atmospheric, and endlessly replayable, making it one of the highest-rated games of 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-clair-obscur-expedition-33">2. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Race against time. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 92</strong></p>



<p>Explaining why Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 ranks among the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sets-record-as-2025s-best-third-party-xbox-game-pass-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-rated games of the year</a> is almost impossible—not because the reasons are scarce, but because there are so many to choose from. The turn-based fantasy RPG blends a stunning Belle Époque–inspired aesthetic with a gripping, emotionally charged narrative, all while pushing the boundaries of what a modern turn-based RPG can be. Its combat system, worldbuilding, and striking visual identity come together in a way that feels both refreshingly new and instantly timeless.</p>



<p>It’s rare for a studio to deliver a debut title with this level of polish and ambition, yet that’s exactly what Sandfall Interactive has achieved. The French team has crafted something bold, beautiful, and unforgettable—an experience that resonates long after the credits roll. After all, there’s a reason it became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most nominated game ever at The Game Awards</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-hades-2">1. Hades 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hauntingly beautiful. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 95</strong></p>



<p>Hades 2 arriving in 2025 felt like the gaming world collectively holding its breath—and Supergiant Games delivered in a way only they could. After spending some time in early access, the sequel takes everything that made the original so beloved and expands it with confidence, introducing a new protagonist, a richer world, and even deeper layers of mythology to explore. The moment-to-moment gameplay is as sharp and addictive as ever, but there’s a newfound elegance in how combat, progression, and narrative flow together, making each run feel meaningful.</p>



<p>What elevates Hades 2 even further is how effortlessly it balances familiarity with innovation. Supergiant’s signature art style and storytelling return in full force, but the expanded cast, refined systems, and fresh environments give the sequel a flavour entirely its own. It’s bigger, bolder, and often more surprising than its predecessor—no small feat considering the heights the first game reached. In a year stacked with standout releases, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2 shines as the highest-rated game released in 2025</a>.</p>
