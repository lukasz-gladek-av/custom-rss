<p>Perfect Dark could have been saved, according to a new report. </p>



<p>The reboot, done by Crystal Dynamics, The Initiative, and Xbox, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-and-xbox-no-longer-working-crystal-dynamics/">cancelled earlier this July</a> out of the blue. Given the game’s well-received gameplay trailer and excitement, many were disappointed in the news. Plus, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-holds-layoffs/">last week’s layoffs</a>, it felt like a nail in the coffin for the classic shooter from Rare. Sadly, it does look like any chance of the game coming out has been silenced.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NjgzNDY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzU3NDM5NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMVoyQTRHUTdMRlEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.iGoAomXADlAaCsr4KgsTEy8oHTbv4k9XTSl7NVtRZXo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> from industry insider Jason Schreier for Bloomberg, Crystal Dynamics cut staff last week because they were unable to secure a deal with a new publisher for Perfect Dark. Embracer, which owns Crystal Dynamics, was reportedly close to striking a deal with Take-Two Interactive. If it went through, the publisher would’ve bought the game from Xbox and then seen the game to completion. Sadly, the talks ceased due to Perfect Dark’s ownership, though exact details were not disclosed.</p>



<p>Along with the cancellation of Perfect Dark, its studio, The Initiative, closed down. However, the report also states that leadership from the studio and Crystal Dynamics have been trying to get a publisher for the last two months. While negotiations did happen with a few, Take-Two was the farthest along.</p>



<p>While chances for Perfect Dark to return are seemingly unlikely, it could see the light of day. Tango Gameworks, which Xbox shut down after the success of Hi-Fi Rush, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-acquired-by-pubg-publisher-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought by Krafton</a> and can work on their IPs again. Whether The Initiative meets that same fate is unknown, but it all depends on the IP of Perfect Dark and if the rights can be purchased.</p>



<p>Are you disappointed to see Perfect Dark cancelled and, likely, never coming back? Let us know in the comments and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the forums</a>!</p>

<p>Activision has announced that all players of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone will receive 20 Battle Pass Tier skips. The move comes as a thank you to players as updates for the game wind down ahead of the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>In order to get your free Battle Pass Tier skips, players simply have to login to either Black Ops 6 or Warzone between now and September 16. Once you do, they will automatically be added to your account.</p>



<p>Activision says that the Black Ops 6 Season 5 Reloaded update will <strong>“be larger on some platforms”</strong> due to <strong>“reorganizing&nbsp;Call of Duty&nbsp;content to prepare for the&nbsp;Black Ops 7&nbsp;Beta on October 2.”</strong> Because of the size of the update, Activision will be giving players a number of double XP tokens on all platforms.</p>



<p>Those who download the update and login to the game between September 4 and October 1 will get <strong>five 1-hour double player XP tokens</strong>, <strong>five 1-hour double weapon XP tokens</strong>, and <strong>five 1-hour double Battle Pass XP tokens</strong>. That equates to 15 hours of double XP in order to unlock and level up what you’re still grinding for. </p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 5 Reloaded launches on September 5. The update includes a new multiplayer map, more Zombies content, new and returning modes, and more. Full details for the update can be found on the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-season-05-reloaded" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty website</a>.</p>
