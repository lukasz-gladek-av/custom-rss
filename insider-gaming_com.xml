<p>Hunt: Showdown 1896 developer Crytek announced today that the company will be laying off around 15% of its 400 employees.</p>



<p>Crytek revealed in a post on <a href="https://x.com/Crytek/status/1889623029723885913/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> that it is the latest studio in the industry to lay off employees due to “unfavourable market dynamics.” The developer will lay off around 60 employees across the “development teams and shared services.” The developer also revealed that since the next Crysis game was put on hold in Q3 2024, they are trying to move its workforce to Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>



<p>Crytek stated that layoffs would be “inevitable” if the company had to move forward. They had already tried reducing costs and “cutting operating expenses,” but to no avail. To help the affected employees, the Hunt: Showdown developer will provide them with “severance packages and career assistance services”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crytek believes that Hunt Showdown: 1896 offers a “very strong gaming service.” Therefore, they are “fully committed to its operation” and will continue to “expand and evolve” the game with new content. The focus on their engine, Cryengine, will also continue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crytek is the latest studio to lose employees in 2025. We have already seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-suffers-more-layoffs-as-suicide-squad-support-winds-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocksteady</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-holds-more-layoffs-across-multiple-departments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-cuts-entire-behavior-development-team-as-part-of-new-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unity</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-layoffs-memo-to-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a>, and others lay off employees this year, and it seems this trend isn’t going to stop soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What do you think about Crytek’s decision to lay off 15% of its employees?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Xbox and PlayStation’s partnership continues to strengthen. To celebrate this, we’ve compiled a list of every confirmed Xbox game coming to PlayStation and every rumored release potentially in the works.</p>



<p>I didn’t know anything else other than console wars throughout high school. I was (and still kind of am) a PlayStation fan, and there was always a primal urge to defend the brand. As I’ve grown, I’ve seen the error of my ways and learned to appreciate all aspects of gaming. But so have Microsoft and Sony it seems. PlayStation is releasing exclusives on PC, whereas Xbox is bringing its library to everything.</p>



<p>2025 is set to be one of the most unimaginable years yet. A few Xbox-exclusive launches are penciled in for Sony’s PlayStation consoles, and many others are rumored. </p>



<h2 id="h-every-confirmed-xbox-exclusive-coming-to-playstation">Every Confirmed Xbox Exclusive Coming to PlayStation</h2>



<p><strong>These Xbox games are 100% confirmed for PlayStation.</strong> If you own a PlayStation, you can buy and own one of these titles once they finally release. Some you might not have thought possible, but never say never.</p>



<p>Certain titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-gameplay-releases-on-may-15-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM The Dark Ages</a> don’t make this list because they’re not released as Microsoft exclusives. It’s a third-party game from day one, although it is tied to Bethesda and Microsoft. Every game on this list isn’t currently available on PlayStation and is already out on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll continue to update this list as more shocking announcements are unveiled.</p>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</h3>



<figure><figcaption>PlayStation inherits a classic arcade-racing series. Credit to Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-period-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a> was rumored to be in the pipeline for PlayStation for a while. A Holiday 2024 announcement was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-was-ready-but-delayed-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a>, but January 2025 saw a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring 2025 release</a> confirmed. Racers feel like a dying breed at the moment, and Gran Turismo 7 is coming up to its third birthday.</p>



<p>Forza has always been one of Microsoft’s biggest brands providing authentic simulated racing through Forza Motorsport, and Horizon being the arcade relief. Forza Horizon 5 smashed it when it first came out, so this is a big coupe for the blue brand.</p>



<h3 id="h-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A playable Indiana Jones film. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-be-on-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> launch isn’t exactly a well-kept secret. Since day one of Microsoft’s Bethesda purchase, the gaming community has often wondered which titles are coming to PlayStation. After initially seeming like Xbox would get a ton of exclusives, many are coming to PlayStation after all—and Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is one.</p>



<p>Initially, The Great Circle is a timed exclusive. It came out on Dec. 9, 2024, for Xbox Series X|S and PC. But its PlayStation status was quickly confirmed too. It’s set to be an epic PS5 release in 2025, and the more hands on The Great Circle the better.</p>



<h2 id="h-rumored-xbox-games-coming-to-playstation">Rumored Xbox Games Coming to PlayStation</h2>



<p>More exciting than the confirmed Xbox-exclusive games coming to PlayStation are the ones <strong><em>potentially </em>releasing on PS4 or PS5</strong>. The rumors pipeline is hectic and chaotic, and it makes for exciting reading. As someone who’s missed out on many Xbox exclusives over the years, it might be an amazing time to be a PlayStation fan in 2025 and beyond.</p>



<h3 id="h-age-of-mythology">Age of Mythology</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Not a myth anymore? Credit to Ensemble Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Jez Corden is one of the gaming industry’s leading insiders. He’s one of the frontrunners when it comes to leaks and rumors, and he’s claimed Age of Mythology is coming to PlayStation at some point in 2025.</p>



<p>The strategy title first came out in 2002, and <em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em> came out 22 years later as a suped-up rerelease with all the expansion packs and it remasters the original from the ground up. It would be a great addition to the PS5 catalog and give real-time strategy fans a new universe to explore.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War E-Day</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Make it happen. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-coming-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War E-Day coming to PS5 could be surreal</a>. Gears of War was a franchise I was jealous of growing up—not owning an Xbox. It looked cool and brutal, and my Xbox friends all played and basked in its glorious goryness. Using a chainsaw gun to carve up an enemy is the perfect adolescent-enhancing rush anyone could ask for.</p>



<p>E-Day is an upcoming prequel set 14 years before the first mainline entry. It brings beloved characters back together, and I can’t think of a better way to start a Gears of War journey than with a narrative chronicling the pre-origins of Gears of War. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-possibly-considering-gears-of-war-playstation-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft considering a Gears of War PlayStation release</a>, I think many would be on board.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-collection">Gears of War Collection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What age are we living in? Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Carrying on the Gears of War narrative is a rumored <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-collection-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War Collection</a>. It would be a whole collection featuring remasters of any of Gears of War 1, 2, 3, 4, and Judgement. It would understandably be a big project —presumably from developer The Coalition—and the PS5 would be a likely destination.</p>



<p>As with many entries on this list, it’s speculation and pinches of salt here and there. But don’t be shocked to see at least one older Gears of War title come to PS5.</p>



<h3 id="h-halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo The Master Chief Collection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I never thought we’d see the day. Credit to 343 Industries</figcaption></figure>



<p>Leaker NateTheHate claims several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/at-least-two-xbox-exclusives-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox exclusives are on the way to PlayStation</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Microsoft is spreading the love to everyone at this point. Amongst these rumors is news of the Halo Master Chief Collection heading to PlayStation. Again, the teenage version of myself (and the adult version) can’t wrap my head around this possibility.</p>



<p>Halo was Xbox’s premier franchise for years. Halo 3’s launch was historic and all over the news at the time. Granted, its popularity has waned in recent years (Halo Infinite being a perfect example) and a PlayStation launch could give the series a much-needed shot in the Spartan Armor.</p>



<h3 id="h-senua-s-saga-hellblade-2">Senua’s Saga Hellblade 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It would follow in the footsteps of its predecessor. Credit to Ninja Theory</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hellblade 2 carried on Senua’s battle with psychosis in the 9th century. The able-bodied warrior originally debuted as a timed-exclusive on PlayStation and PC, before eventually getting an Xbox port later down the line. The tables most certainly turned with Senua’s Saga Hellblade 2 as it was released on Xbox and PC—not PlayStation.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellblade 2 is reportedly coming to PlayStation in 2025</a>. Hellblade 2 cost a lot more to develop, and deserves more praise and recognition. A PS5 launch could go a long way to doing this.</p>



<h3 id="h-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A casual stroll in the sky. Credit to Microsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 had the hard task of trying to better the outstanding Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. It arrived with a ton of new features and missions, and it was also a Microsoft exclusive. However, PlayStation owners might need to clean off and ready their own cropdusters if gossip is to be believed.</p>



<p>The same Jez Corden report about Age of Mythology and Hellblade 2 also mentions Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Again, there’s no substance regarding a release date or announcement, but a 2025 release of the Xbox game on PS5 a real possibility.</p>



<h3 id="h-starfield">Starfield</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A big occasion. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>No, you’re not spacing out, Starfield coming to PS5 might not be a rumor anymore. If you don’t believe us, take it from the mouth of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phil Spencer who suggests Starfield is flying to PlayStation 5</a>. Initial suggestions indicated a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-starfield-coming-to-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield PS5</a> release was never going to happen under any circumstances.</p>



<p>When asked about Starfield staying on Xbox, Spencer has an interesting response: “There’s no specific game that I would…This goes back to my redline answer, there’s no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place that it will find players where we would have business success for us.”</p>



<p>It’s not difficult to read between the lines and get our hopes up for Starfield and PlayStation star-hopping together.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you also finding it hard to accept a world where PlayStation and Xbox finally join forces? If this is only the beginning, which other Xbox exclusives from years gone by do you want to see arrive on PlayStation?</p>



<p>PlayStation exclusives could be making the jump too with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-16-xbox-release-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 16 move to Xbox</a> being a major example.</p>

<p>Bobby Kotick, the infamous former CEO of Activision Blizzard, has revealed on a podcast which studio acquisition taught him ‘an expensive lesson’ almost twenty years ago. While sitting down with Bing Gordon, former Chief Creative Officer at Electronic Arts, Kotick took a stroll down memory lane, looking back over the last forty years of the gaming industry.</p>



<p>When it was mentioned by Gordon that Kotick and his team had a ‘flawless’ mergers and acquisitions record, Kotick set the story straight by mentioning one studio buyout that was less than ideal. In his words, it was an $80 million lesson.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-wrote-it-off">‘We Wrote it Off’</h2>



<p>In a recent<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> episode of the ‘Grit’ podcast</a>, which at the time of publishing is unlisted on YouTube, Kotick took a quick dive into an awful acquisition that Activision made before merging with Blizzard in 2008.</p>



<p>He said:</p>



<blockquote>

<p>In this segment, Kotick is referring to Bizarre Creations, the developer behind Project Gotham Racing, a series of titles that were exclusive to the Xbox platform. While the acquisition <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/activision-buys-studio-behind-project-gotham-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">left Microsoft with the PGR label</a>, Activision would lean on Bizarre Creations to piece together ‘Blur’, which was released in 2010, three years after the 2007 buy-out occurred.</p>



<p>Blur was intended to be released in 2009, but it was <a href="https://investor.activision.com/static-files/f2927482-7047-46da-b069-cfd2cc95acd5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">delayed by Activision</a> to allow Bizarre to further polish the game.</p>



<p>Less than a year later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bizarre-says-goodbye-with-farewell-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision closed Bizarre Creations</a>, dissolving the studio (which was based in Liverpool and not Manchester, as Kotick suggested) and releasing around 200 employees.</p>



<p>To this day, the Project Gotham Racing series stands abandoned</p>



<p>Kotick went on to walk Gordon through Activision’s former acquisition processes, which were centred mostly around retaining the identity of studios and allowing them to keep doing what they were <strong>already </strong>doing. By contrast, he explained how Electronic Arts – Gordon’s former company – would ‘take over’ acquired studios and rebrand them, stripping out their image somewhat.</p>



<p>In the same discussion on the Grit podcast (props to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-passed-on-chances-to-buy-guitar-hero-call-of-duty-and-blizzard/1100-6529398/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameSpot</a> for the link), both Gordon and Kotick explained that, once upon a time, Electronic Arts <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/electronic-arts-almost-owned-cod-blizzard/">almost purchased Activision and Blizzard</a>, which would have left franchises like Call of Duty under the EA umbrella.</p>

<p>In a recent interview as part of an episode of the ‘Grit’ podcast, Bobby Kotick sat down with Bing Gordon, former Chief Creative Officer at Electronic Arts. It was revealed in the earlier minutes of the episode – which spans a whopping two hours – that Electronic Arts once passed up opportunities to acquire Blizzard, Call of Duty, and Guitar Hero, among other brands.</p>



<p>Eventually, Activision Blizzard, which was formerly led by Bobby Kotick as CEO, was purchased in its entirety by Microsoft, with the tech titan acquiring all aforementioned labels.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-might-have-been">What Might Have Been</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Grit podcast episode</a> opened with Bobby Kotick suggesting that Bing Gordon would have been one of the toughest CEOs in gaming to deal with as a competitor and that he and his team would have <strong>paid </strong>to keep the then-CEO in place at Electronic Arts. It was all in jest and talk turned to mergers and acquisitions, with Gordon gushing over Kotick’s notorious success in the space.</p>



<p>That’s not entirely true, though – Kotick explained some of the rougher patches of the M&amp;A streak:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We actually had a bad acquisition.</p>



<p>The company that was in Manchester that did the driving game for Xbox… We had a good guy who was running the day-to-day but he was like a brilliant guy, who — he was in strat planning.</p>



<p>It was $80 million and like, we wrote it off two years later. Everything about it violated all our principles.</p>



<p>That guy was an expensive lesson.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I can assume Kotick is referring to Bizarre Creations, the developer behind Project Gotham Racing – but the studio was based in Liverpool, not Manchester.</p>



<p>Kotick then explained how Electronic Arts tried acquiring Activision and Blizzard (assumedly pre- the 2008 merger):</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They tried to buy us a bunch of times, we had merger conversations a bunch of times.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gordon then expanded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While you were doing Blizzard, <strong>that EA passed on</strong>, and you were doing King, EA did PopCap — just stupid things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>These revelations were in the first ten minutes of the two-hour podcast episode. It’s a plethora of gaming history that sees Gordon and Kotick walk down memory lane while discussing the origin stories of some of the biggest franchises in the business.</p>



<p>In one segment of the podcast (thanks to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-passed-on-chances-to-buy-guitar-hero-call-of-duty-and-blizzard/1100-6529398/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameSpot</a> for the link), Kotick explained how Overwatch was created at Blizzard. He stressed that it went against the Blizzard ‘aesthetic’ and mentioned it was ‘unbelievable’ that the team pieced it together after focusing on ‘dark’ games for so long.</p>



<p>Do you think Electronic Arts would have tanked the Call of Duty brand as it did with Medal of Honor and (arguably) Battlefield? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
