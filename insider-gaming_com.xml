<p>The latest trailer for the Super Mario Galaxy movie reveals a couple of fan-favorite characters. Also, it shows that the upcoming film has taken more inspiration from recent Mario games than was once believed.</p>



<p>In a special Nintendo Direct specifically for the Super Mario Galaxy movie, Shigeru Miyamoto revealed the latest trailer for the upcoming film. The trailer begins with Mario and Luigi traveling through the Sand Kingdom from Super Mario Odyssey. They run into several Tostarenans who are excited to see the plumbers. </p>



<p>They point them toward the disturbances they’ve been experiencing. This leads to a dark cavern, requiring Mario and Luigi to use a fire flower, and when they reach the center warp pipe, Yoshi is revealed. At first, they are just as afraid of Yoshi as he is of them, but they quickly realize that they have found a new companion in everyone’s favorite green dinosaur.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>In addition to Yoshi, there was a brief fight scene featuring Princess Peach and Birdo, paying homage to the fact that Birdo was a boss battle in the second Super Mario Bros game. In the trailer, Birdo was shooting eggs at Princess Peach with great ferocity. There was also a brief moment of Luigi wearing a frog suit.</p>



<p>Keegan-Michael Key’s Toad also returns, and he is initially annoyed at the fact that Yoshi immediately joins the group. The whole gang is later seen running away from the realistic dinosaur featured in Super Mario Odyssey.</p>







<p>Chris Meledandri from Illumination also appeared at the end of the presentation to say that the movie was currently in post-production and had finished animation. The movie will be released in theaters on April 1.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Ball ‘AGE 1000’ is Revealed, and Fans Think It’s Dragon Ball Online 2]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/</link>
            <guid>1415407</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Dragon Ball team recently revealed an all-new project, codenamed ‘AGE 1000’, set to be released in 2027. In a short trailer posted online that showcased a never-before-seen character, it was confirmed that a full reveal will take place on April 18 during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to pick up on the AGE 1000 reference, which until now, has only been used in connection with Dragon Ball Online. This MMORPG debuted in 2010 but has long since been shut down, being replaced somewhat by <em>Xenoverse</em>.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-dragon-ball-game-coming-2027">New Dragon Ball Game Coming 2027</h2>



<p>The Dragon Ball team wrote on social media that AGE 1000 offers ‘a new world and new characters brought to life by Akira Toriyama,’ the father of Dragon Ball. You can see the two-minute teaser trailer below:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Announcing a New Dragon Ball Game Project, "AGE 1000", set for 2027!<br>A new world and new characters brought to life by Akira Toriyama!</p><p> The latest updates will be unveiled at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 in the U.S. on April 18-19.<br>Stay tuned for more information. <a href="https://t.co/ouBqvz5FwA">pic.twitter.com/ouBqvz5FwA</a></p></div>— Dragon Ball Games (@dragonballgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/2015246051461210565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Eagle-eyed fans spotted the AGE 1000 reference in seconds, pointing out that, until now, the only other game to use that setting was Dragon Ball Online.</p>



<p>In <strong>that </strong>game, players are transported to the age 1000 in a time-traveling adventure that sees them explore an open-world environment, search for Dragon Balls, and interact with NPCs and other players on their journey. It boasted multiple classes and races, several settings in terms of time and location, and diverse quest mechanics.</p>



<p>While Dragon Ball Online died years ago, <em>Xenoverse </em>almost took its place, adopting the core story elements and character creation features that surfaced in DBO.</p>



<p>This is why fans think AGE 1000 is a direct follow-on (or reboot) of Dragon Ball Online.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rayman is getting a 30th Anniversary game, and it has been rated in Australia.</p>



<p>Rayman was Ubisoft’s mascot at one time, and while the series may be best known today for introducing the Rabbids, Rayman was one of the premier adventure-platforming titles. The original game was released in 1995 for PC, Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, and Atari Jaguar, and now a 30th-anniversary edition is coming to modern consoles.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson recently stated on <a href="https://youtu.be/8rRejJWM3jg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Insider Gaming Weekly podcast</a> that two Rayman projects were in the works at Ubisoft, and while one, codenamed “Steamboat,” is believed to be a remake of Rayman Legends, Insider Gaming understands that this project is currently under the codename “Iceman.”</p>

<h2 id="h-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-s-rating-in-australia">Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition’s Rating in Australia</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Australian classification </a>has rated the currently unannounced title as G, safe for the General Public, with very mild content and minimal impact. Specifically, this game is noted as having very mild violence. The classification date is listed as Thursday, January 22, 2026.</p>



<p>The game is listed for release on both the Nintendo Switch and the Sony PlayStation 5. Atari is listed as both the publisher and developer. Atari also handles the remakes and new releases in the once-popular Bubsy franchise.</p>







<p>Even though Rayman is no longer the face of the Ubisoft franchise, this remake comes at a time when Ubisoft is undergoing a massive restructuring in its own right. Recently, the planned remake for Prince of Persia: Sands of Time was shelved as the company moves forward in a new direction.

<p>As Nintendo continues to celebrate Milestones like the 40th anniversaries of the Super Mario and Legend of Zelda franchises, key developers from Nintendo’s history are entering the next phases of their lives as well.</p>



<p>Legendary producer Kensuke Tanabe recently announced that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be his final game at Nintendo. The news was shared in an interview with the Japanese magazine<a href="https://www.ndw.jp/category/news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Nintendo Dream</a>, which was later posted on<a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405257646218805574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Weibo.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-kensuke-tanabe-confirms-he-s-worked-on-his-last-title-at-nintendo">Kensuke Tanabe Confirms He’s Worked On His Last Title at Nintendo</h2>



<p>As <span>reported by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><span>Vi</span>deo Games Chronicle</a>, Tanabe confirmed that he will no longer be involved in the studio’s production, but trusts that Risa Tabata and the team at Retro Studios will be able to continue moving forward should that be what Nintendo requests.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Completing this game took far longer than anticipated… Furthermore, I have confirmed that I will no longer be involved in the production of the series moving forward. Whether a sequel will be made is still uncertain, but I sincerely hope that one day, Ms Tabata and Retro Studios will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close.</p>



<p>It’s been 40 years since I joined Nintendo. Metroid Prime 4 will be my final title developed at Nintendo.</p>



<p>However, we didn’t set out to create anything ‘special’ because of this. Instead, we worked closely with Retro Studios, just as we always have with Nintendo projects, aiming to deliver a fun and unique experience for players of all ages and playstyles.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Following news about Tanabe, it was also confirmed that Hideki Konno, known for launching the Mario Kart franchise, left the studio in July 2025. </p>



<p>The news was confirmed via his private Facebook account. He received a special thanks credit in the recent Mario Kart World release and last worked on the Mario Kart 8: Deluxe DLC for the original Nintendo Switch.</p>







<p>Shigeru Miyamoto, the man behind the Mario and Zelda franchises, remains on board at Nintendo. Currently, he has been working closely with Universal on the release of the Super Mario Bros. movies. The forthcoming Super Mario Galaxy movie is due to release in April 2026. A Nintendo Direct will reveal new information about the movie on January 25.
