<p>As a gamer, finding enough time to sit and enjoy a game can be tough. That’s especially true when you have responsibilities like a full-time job or being a parent. Luckily, there’s a specific genre of game that exists for this exact reason: roguelites. These games offer quick, pick-up-and-play action without much setup. But what games are the best roguelites of all time?</p>



<p>Overall, there are hundreds of these games to choose from over the years, but some stand out more than others. These are seven of the best roguelite games that you can pick up and play right now.</p>



<h2>What’s The Difference Between Roguelikes and Roguelites?</h2>



<p>You’ve probably heard people toss around “roguelike” and “roguelite” as though they mean the same thing. And while they do share many similarities, there are enough differences to make each game feel different. </p>



<p>Roguelikes are games that often stick to the formula of permadeath and procedurally-generated levels. Every run is a fresh start, so it’s all about your skill, learning tendencies, and getting a bit lucky.</p>



<p>Roguelites, on the other hand, add on to that formula. While they also follow the single-run strategy, they give players some sort of progression system. As you play, you’ll unlock abilities, new levels, characters, upgrades, and more to keep you coming back. </p>



<p>TL;DR: Roguelikes start you from zero every time, while roguelites let you grow a little with each run, making them easier for players to jump into and keep playing.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-rogulites-of-all-time">The Best Rogulites Of All Time</h2>



<h3>Dead Cells</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A metroidvania-inspired Roguelite, Dead Cells is one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-cells-gets-final-update-from-evil-empire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the toughest games</a> you’ll find on this list. The game has you exploring an ever-changing castle, where the more you play, the easier it <em>should </em>get. As you play, you’ll unlock new levels, mutations, weapons, and abilities to help you out. Weapons like the War Spear and Panchuku&nbsp;will have you mowing through your enemies like a hot knife through butter. </p>



<p>There aren’t any checkpoints, meaning that once you die, it’s back to the beginning in a new corpse. It’ll be frustrating at times, but it’s the type of frustration that has you thinking you finally figured out how to make it to the end. </p>

<h3>Risk of Rain 2</h3>

<h3>Enter the Gungeon</h3>



<figure></figure>

<p>The newest game on this list, Absolum, is one of the<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/absolum-review-a-must-play-roguelite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> best games in the genre’s history</a> without doing anything to reinvent the wheel. The game follows four heroes working to save the world from Sun King Azra, who has used the world’s fear of magic to take over and enslave wizards. Each character offers unique abilities and skill sets that differ enough to make you want to try each out. Each run features route branching along with upgrade changes and enemy spawns to keep the game feeling fresh, no matter how many hours you put in. Add in the multiplayer aspect, and you have a game worthy of your time.</p>



<hr>



<h3>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is one of the most popular roguelite games ever made. The game follows Isaac, a young boy who escapes from his abusive mother into his basement full of horrors. The game is dark and twisted, but also funny and creative, as it features hundreds of items and enemies inspired by biblical references and other sources. The game also has multiple endings and unlockable characters that add replay value. Each run in the game takes about 30 minutes or less. </p>



<p>If you want more Binding of Isaac content, you can pick up the recent Repentance DLC that adds enough content to make it an entirely new game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Naval Warfare Content is Already in Development, Datamines Reveal]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-naval-warfare-content-is-already-in-development-datamines-reveal.1325479/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It appears that Battlefield 6’s future naval warfare content is already in development, according to datamined files found by Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>According to some strings of code obtained by Insider Gaming, it appears that several different vehicles are currently in development for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-bloom-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, including Jet Skis and RHIBs (Rigid-Hulled Inflatable Boats).</p>



<p>Both strings of code were attached to the multiplayer files, suggesting that work on naval combat is already well underway in some capacity. The lines read:</p>



<p>Game/GlacierMP/Kits/Vehicle_Neutral_Boat_JetSki<br>Game/GlacierMP/Kits/Vehicle_Neutral_Boat_RHIB</p>



<p>For those out of the loop, “Glacier” is the codename for Battlefield 6, whereas “MP” is the abbreviation for multiplayer.</p>



<p>However, we’ve also heard from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-teases-naval-warfare-is-coming-to-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 developers themselves</a> that naval combat requests, which have been highly requested by the community, “have not gone unnoticed.” </p>



<p>As for when naval combat will be introduced in Battlefield 6, it is unclear. However, judging by the Season 1 content, which appears to lack maps with vast amounts of water, we might be waiting for a while. That said, a fully dedicated season to naval warfare is something that Battlefield has done before and could easily do again with Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>You can read Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review of Battlefield 6</a>, for which we gave it a 4/5 due to the game’s somewhat lackluster campaign. </p>



<p>What do you think of Battlefield 6 adding naval warfare? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>
