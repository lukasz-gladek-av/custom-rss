<p>A popular feature from the Assassin’s Creed franchise, ‘social stealth’ could make its return in one of the next games in the series. </p>



<p>Since Assassin’s Creed: Shadows has now been released, players are already waiting for the next big game in the series. Recently, Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-over-remake-slip-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatened to sue</a> the actor of Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag over a slip-up with the remake details. Now, the developers have revealed that an old feature hasn’t been ruled out from the franchise, which means we could see it in one of the next games. </p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-devs-reveal-why-it-didn-t-have-social-stealth">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Devs Reveal Why It Didn’t Have Social Stealth</h2>



<p>During a recent AMA segment with the devs on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/hi_were_simon_andr%C3%A9_and_luc_developers_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/assassinscreed</a> subreddit (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/ubisoft-explains-why-assassins-creed-shadows-ditched-social-stealth-but-says-its-likely-not-gone-for-good-our-stealth-team-chose-to-put-100-percent-of-their-energy-on-the-moment-to-moment-tactical-shinobi-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), the developers were asked whether “social stealth elements” could make a comeback in the future. Additionally, they were also asked why social stealth was not a part of Assassin’s Creed: Shadows. </p>



<p>The developers responded, stating that for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, the stealth team had put “100% of their energy on the moment-to-moment tactical shinobi experience”, which is why there was no room to add social stealth. However, that “does not mean that Social Stealth is gone from the Assassin’s Creed franchise”. </p>



<p>For those wondering, social stealth was a feature seen in previous Assassin’s Creed games, where the protagonist could hide from his enemies and pursuers by blending in with the crowd. </p>

<h2 id="h-assassins-vs-templars-conflict-is-the-core-pillar-of-the-ac-series">Assassins Vs. Templars Conflict is the Core Pillar of the AC Series </h2>



<p>During the same AMA segment, the developers added that the Assassins vs. Templars conflict has always been a core pillar of the Assassin’s Creed series. With Shadows, they planned to establish their protagonist in the setting before expanding on the conflict. Now that it is done in the main game and through the Critical Role story drop, players should expect “more deep dive in this conflict in the near future.”</p>



<p>In other news, the Claws of Awaji DLC is scheduled to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-releases-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release this September</a>. Additionally, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-rating-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. What are your thoughts on social stealth returning to the Assassin’s Creed franchise?

            <title><![CDATA[The ‘Big Division 2 Project’ Will Be Revealed at Gamescom]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/division-2-project-gamescom-reveal-panels/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-%E2%80%98big-division-2-project%E2%80%99-will-be-revealed-at-gamescom.1269174/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has revealed that two panels centered around The Division 2 will take place at Gamescom next week. The team will be hosting a meet-and-greet event alongside two presentations designed to reveal the future of The Division 2, including the ‘big Division 2 project’ that Ubisoft has just started talking about.</p>



<p>It was also noted that The Division: Resurgence, the all-new mobile game that’s in development now, will be showcased.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-big-division-2-project">What is the Big Division 2 Project?</h2>



<p>I’ve got no idea, but thanks to a new social post from Ubisoft, I know we’ll get more clues next week when Gamescom unravels.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is what the team said about what’s coming to Gamescom from Ubisoft, where The Division 2 is concerned:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Division 2 will be at Gamescom this year, with two panels and two meet-and-greets.</p>



<p>Our first panel will take a look at the creative and art direction behind Battle for Brooklyn, and we’ll also give you a small glimpse at what’s coming next for the seasons.</p>



<p>In our second panel, we’ll talk about how your feedback is shaping The Division 2, share some updates about The Division: Resurgence, and reveal more about the ‘big Division 2 project’. We’ve only just started teasing it, but we’re really excited to give you an update.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you can’t make it to Cologne (hint: we’ll all be there!), you can watch both panels online across Ubisoft’s channels.</p>



<p>Battle for Brooklyn was released earlier this year and was met with positive sentiments from the community. After more than six years, The Division 2 is still alive and well, and judging from Ubisoft’s comments, it’s about to get even better.</p>



<p>Are you going to tune in to see what Ubisoft is teasing for The Division 2? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The start date and times for the Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Beta are vital if you want more action. The first beta destroyed all expectations, literally, on its debut, so let’s check out the Week 2 Beta and all-new content included.</p>



<p>Well, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-impressions-battlefield-is-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 beta</a> has been worth the wait. EA and Battlefield Studios have put their blood, sweat, and explosions into BF6. The first week of the beta blew up in more ways than one by bringing in over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500,000 players</a>—destroying CoD’s all-time Steam peak.</p>



<p>We’re not done yet, though. The Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Beta is back and bigger and better than before. This hub has everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-week-2-beta-start-amp-end-dates">Battlefield 6 Week 2 Beta Start &amp; End Dates</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We are so back, again. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 beta starts on August 14 and wraps up on August 17.</strong></p>



<p>You get nearly 100 hours of pure bombastic Battlefield 6 action if you want it. The open beta might be the final chance you get to play <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> before launch.</p>



<p>Battlefield Labs can be considered the game’s alpha period. This makes August a definitive beta test. With only a couple of months to go until the official Battlefield 6 release, I’d advise you to make the most of the Week 2 Beta.</p>



<p>See you on the Battlefield—revive me if you see me! </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-week-2-beta-start-times">Battlefield 6 Week 2 Beta Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>It’s confirmed that the Weekend Two Battlefield 6 Beta starts at 08:00 UTC—the same as Week One.</strong></p>



<p>I’ve already extensively covered the nature of Battlefield 6’s Week Two beta and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when you can play it again in a separate guide</a>. It includes more specific regions and time zones to help you out.</p>



<p>But yes, it’s the same start and end times as the first BF6 open beta. This should make your life a lot easier.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-battlefield-6-weekend-2-beta">How to Play Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Beta</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More maps to break. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You need to have played Battlefield Labs, be an EA Play Pro member, or use the Battlefield 6 website to gain access to the Week 2 Beta.</strong></p>



<p>One of the most commonly asked questions about the BF6 beta is about how you can take part. Many mistakenly believe you need to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-have-to-pre-order-battlefield-6-to-play-the-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order Battlefield 6 to play the open beta</a>. This is simply not the case.</p>



<p>The easiest of these solutions is using the BF6 site. Let me walk you through the instructions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6 website.</a></li>



<li>Click on ‘Download Now’ on the starting screen.</li>



<li>Press ‘Select Platform’</li>



<li>Choose the platform you want to play the beta on.</li>



<li>It will take you to the format’s storefront.</li>



<li>Purchase the free beta.</li>



<li>Download the Battlefield 6 open beta on your console or computer.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-6-weekend-2-new-content">All Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 New Content</h2>



<p><strong>Week 2 introduces the new Empire State map and new game modes, including Rush.</strong></p>



<p>The first thing to note is that all content from Week 1 is back! Siege of Cairo, Liberation Peak, Breakthrough, etc, are all here for you to enjoy. The second week could have left it there, but Battlefield Studios has thrown more toys in the playbox.</p>



<p>Check out each <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-gets-new-map-and-modes-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new map and mode</a> in Week 2.</p>
