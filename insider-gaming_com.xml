            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-bananza-spoiler-accidentally-revealed-by-nintendo-korea-before-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has already shown off Donkey Kong Bananza as one of its biggest early exclusives. But Nintendo Korea looks to have dropped a clanger regarding a major character spoiler in the game.</p>



<p>Firstly, if the title hasn’t given this away already—<strong>there is a Donkey Kong Bananza spoiler here</strong>. If you read on, you know what you’re getting yourself into. But we have to make this declaration, as Nintendo Korea’s website apparently (and prematurely) went early with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-is-getting-a-new-3d-adventure-on-the-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DK Bananza</a> graphic.</p>



<p>In it, we see the return of a popular and legendary DK character. The news is sure to be <em>apeeling </em>to many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/top-5-donkey-kong-appearances/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong</a> Bananza-wanting fans.</p>



<p><strong>This is your final spoiler warning.</strong></p>

<p>The Nintendo Korea website originally had a Donkey Kong Bananza graphic featuring a younger-looking <strong>Pauline</strong>—the legendary DK damsel in distress. The graphic has since been swapped—as you can see in our before and after image above—but thanks to this <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-koreas-website-seems-to-spoil-a-huge-detail-about-donkey-kong-bananza.1156071/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra post</a>, the original evidence can still be seen.</p>



<p>Pauline has featured prominently throughout the annals of Donkey Kong history. She first appeared in the original 1981 debut of Donkey Kong, has since taken up a recurring role in countless Donkey Kong games (including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-vs-donkey-kong-princess-peach-showtime-sold-over-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong vs. Mario</a>), and has been a playable character in Super Smash Bros. and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart</a> franchises.</p>



<p>She looks unmistakably younger here, though. This leads fans to wonder if this is a prequel or if new character Odd Rock is connected to her. We look forward to finding out!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-marathon-an-extraction-shooter-gameplay-details-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon is an all-new project from Bungie that’s set to act as a reboot of sorts to a game released in the 1990s. In the earliest materials released by the decades-old developer, we’ve been given snippets of a shooter that’s colourful and intriguing, but what’s the core premise here? Is Marathon an extraction shooter?</p>



<p>The extraction shooter genre is a tough one to break into, given how a few titles dominate the space. If Marathon is an extraction shooter, how well will it fare against the competition?</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>







<p><strong>Marathon is a traditional PvP extraction shooter with sci-fi vibes and cybernetic mercenaries.</strong> The core gameplay loop will see players accept a series of quests, gear up, load into one of three maps, and then attempt to extract successfully, all while fighting other players and digging up loot.</p>



<p>That’s as simple as the extraction shooter loop gets, but the kicker with Marathon is the setting.</p>



<p>It’s set in and around a ‘lost colony’ on Tau Ceti IV, a planet <strong>far </strong>from our own. Players will control ‘Runners’, cybernetic characters that are little more than soldiers of fortune. They’re in it for riches and rewards, and each raid into the world of Marathon is an opportunity to seize valuable loot and claim the gear of other players.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marathon-multiplayer">Is Marathon Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>Marathon is a multiplayer game with a PvP model, which is typical for the extraction shooter genre.</p>



<p>It’s a survival title, and as it’s an extraction shooter, you can bet your last dollar it’s tougher than your average shooter.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has the top spot in the genre, and that’s one of the most punishing games ever made, so take that on board.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-loot-work-in-marathon">How Does Loot Work in Marathon?</h2>



<p>In 2023, Insider Gaming revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-early-details/">exclusive Marathon gameplay details</a>, breaking down how loot works in the game.</p>



<p>We revealed that loot is split up into three categories: loot, implants, and perks.</p>



<p>Players can unlock various items as they play, using implants to augment their character and perks to acquire new skills and abilities. It was also suggested by sources that Marathon will have a permadeath feature in some capacity, which could mean that each death in the game could come with catastrophic consequences.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-already-selling-for-enormous-amounts-on-ebay.1156905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-already-selling-for-enormous-amounts-on-ebay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Many gamers are experiencing a serious case of FOMO over the Nintendo Switch 2. The Switch successor has already been taking pre-orders across the UK, and sellers are listing their pre-orders to make amazing profits on eBay.</p>



<p>Most people want the latest and greatest items. This appears to be the case for Nintendo’s recently shown-off Switch 2. The epic console has been given a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>, and we’ve also got an insight into the cost of its games. However, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console’s price</a> tag was a talking point after the Direct 2 Showcase.</p>



<p>Whatever you think of the Nintendo Switch 2’s price, it’s nothing compared to how much people are prepared to pay for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-are-already-live-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UK pre-order</a> on eBay.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-buy-a-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-on-ebay-for-lots-of-money">You Can Buy a Nintendo Switch 2 Pre-Order on eBay For Lots of Money</h2>



<figure><figcaption>At least they’ll get to play. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the UK, you can grab a Switch 2 console on its own for £395.99 or £429.99 if bundled with a digital copy of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>. This is much more than the OG Switch, but it’s not surprising given the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-features-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new features</a>.</p>



<p>However, if you’ve been unable to secure a pre-order, you can battle it out with other <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=nintendo+switch+2&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;rt=nc&amp;LH_Sold=1&amp;LH_Complete=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eBay</a> buyers who are spending over £600 for pre-orders! Completed sales of Switch 2 pre-orders range from anywhere between about <strong>£450 to £600 plus</strong>.</p>



<p>The most expensive one I’ve seen is for <strong>£628.92</strong>—with Mario Kart World included. Even still, this is <strong>£198.93</strong> over the original price. </p>



<p>We’re not here to tell anyone how much they should and shouldn’t want a Switch 2. This is simply a cautionary message that if you’re seeking a Switch 2 pre-order through eBay, you’ll need to pay way over the odds.</p>



<p>Head to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IG Forum</a> and let us know what you think. Is the Switch 2 worth this much? Or are you better off waiting if you don’t have a pre-order secured?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ashton-hall-gaming-latest-video-bag/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ashton-hall-bags-on-gaming-in-his-newest-%E2%80%98motivational%E2%80%99-video.1156887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ashton-hall-gaming-latest-video-bag/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ashton Hall, the viral personality behind the sensational ‘morning routine’ videos, has uploaded a new clip comparing his life in 2018 to 2025. It can be interpreted as a veiled bag on gaming – in the 2018 segment, he’s playing games multiple times a day and raging at cutscenes on Grand Theft Auto 5, for some reason.</p>



<p>However, when he hangs up the controller (which was never even switched on), he becomes a new man, waking up at 3 AM and plunging his face into ice bowls before making thousands of dollars in the blink of an eye.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-plot-holes">Plot Holes</h2>



<p>Ashton Hall has become a phenomenally successful creator following the viral trend around his morning routine videos. In the clips he has uploaded across social media, Hall has shown what his daily routine looks like, revealing a morning schedule that unfolds over several hours, prompting parodies worldwide.</p>



<div><article><p><span>2018 vs. 2025. First 4 hours will change everything ⏰</span></p></article></div>







<p>In his latest video uploaded to Twitter, Hall shows himself ‘in 2018’, playing video games in a dinky apartment, relying on snack foods and carbonated beverages for sustenance, and doom-scrolling on social media.</p>



<p>He becomes enraged at a cutscene on Grand Theft Auto 5 on PS4, throwing a controller that was never even powered on at the television, shattering it on impact. Later, he’s seen playing the same game on the same television set, so I’m not sure what to believe at this point.</p>



<p>His classic skewed timelines are also front and centre – it takes him 12 minutes to power on the controller after picking it up from a nightstand.</p>



<p>But it’s okay because after ditching the video games, Hall became a much better man with a regimented morning schedule that involves rubbing bananas on his face and spending four minutes suspended in mid-air over a swimming pool, so there’s that.</p>



<p>Generational run, indeed.</p>

<p>Schedule 1 is taking the world by storm, topping the charts on Steam and pulling in hundreds of thousands of players. It’s a shock hit that has come out of nowhere, and it’s dominating the gaming world despite having a bizarre theme. In this guide, we’re looking at whether Schedule 1 is multiplayer, and <strong>if it is</strong>, we’ll break down how to play with friends.</p>



<p>If you’ve been trying to play Schedule 1 co-op, read on to find out how it all works.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-co-op-in-schedule-1">How to Play Co-Op in Schedule 1</h2>



<p><strong>If you want to play Schedule 1 with your friends, you’re in luck – you can do so in both the free demo and the paid version of the game</strong>. To invite friends to your game, you’ll need to open the ‘Lobby’ menu that can be found in the top-right corner of the game scene. From there, you’ll utilise Steam’s friend mechanics to invite someone to your game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-schedule-1-multiplayer-work">How Does Schedule 1 Multiplayer Work?</h2>



<p>In Schedule 1 multiplayer modes, the host has all the power.</p>



<p>They’re responsible for saving the game, and any progress you make in someone else’s co-op lobby won’t impact your single-player adventure. That means if you buy Schedule 1 and boot it up and jump straight into your friend’s game, you’ll end up unlocking <strong>nothing in your single-player game</strong>.</p>



<p>You won’t even have a save file.</p>



<p>If you’ve already kickstarted a solo venture, you won’t be able to invite any friends to revel in your drug manufacturing madness.</p>



<p>It gets a little trickier when it comes to finances, too. Every dollar you earn and bank with your friends in Schedule 1 multiplayer is added to a collective pot – but the cash in your pocket is <strong>yours alone</strong>. Also, items can’t be shared between players unless they’re placed in storage.</p>



<p>Put simply, you need to put something down before another player can pick it up.</p>



<p>Oh, and you can only have a maximum of four players in both the demo and the paid version of Schedule 1.</p>



<p>That’s effectively everything you need to know about Schedule 1 multiplayer – have fun making drugs together!</p>
