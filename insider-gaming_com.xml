<p>Activision announced that PC users will have to enable Secure Boot to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </p>



<p>Secure Boot is a Windows 10 and Windows 11 security feature that ensures a PC only loads safe software during startup. Secure Boot enables Activision to detect and remove users of banned third-party devices or other cheating software. </p>



<p>EA also uses the security measure for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-secureboot-not-enabled-error/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, and players experienced difficulties because they couldn’t play the game without enabling it. Enabling Secure Boot varies depending on the manufacturer of your PC, which can make it a confusing process. Black Ops 6 players are about to experience the same confusion. </p>

<p>Starting in Black Ops 6 Season 5, which begins on August 7, PC users must have Secure Boot enabled. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision</a> explained, “Secure Boot makes cheating at a hardware level much more difficult, ensuring cleaner PCs at start and allowing for more trusted environments for RICOCHET Anti-Cheat to operate in.” </p>



<p>If you need more information on how to enable Secure Boot, Activision provided a <a href="https://support.activision.com/articles/trusted-platform-module-and-secure-boot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">manual</a> on how to do so. You won’t be able to play BO6 without having the security measure enabled, and that also applies to Black Ops 7, when the upcoming game releases later this year. </p>



<p>In addition, the devs encouraged you to secure your account with email verification and two-factor authentication. Activision also introduced new detection tools targeted at rooting out boosting and teaming in BO6 multiplayer and Warzone Ranked Play, and confirmed that 22 additional individuals responsible for developing and selling cheats were cut off.  </p>



<p>Is Secure Boot enough to cut down on cheating? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/black-ops-7-will-require-secure-boot-to-play.3211/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-activision-leadership-isn%E2%80%99t-worried-about-battlefield-6-because-call-of-duty-is-%E2%80%9Ctoo-big-to-fail%E2%80%9D.1263753/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Activision leadership has been taking note of Battlefield 6’s recent hype, but is not worried that the franchise will surpass Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorised to talk about Activision’s internal conversations, it’s been said that although Activision is keeping a close eye on Battlefield, they are not worried about the game outcompeting its flagship franchise.</p>



<p>It’s said that Activision leadership believes that Call of Duty is “too big to fail” and will remain a profitable, annually released franchise for many years to come. At the time of writing, an annual Call of Duty title is penciled in for the next four years at least.</p>



<p>This year’s Call of Duty title, dubbed ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-revealed-during-xbox-games-showcase-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>‘, is said to be a “strong” title according to those familiar with the game’s plans, despite initial problems in development. </p>



<p>Interestingly enough, this year’s Call of Duty will take place in a slightly futuristic setting similar to Battlefield 6, with both games targeting a similar audience. Whether or not that direct competition will impact Call of Duty is unclear, but at the time of writing, Activision doesn’t think it will.</p>



<p>There’s also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s Battle Royale</a> to consider, which is believed to be a free-to-play component to the premium game. If EA can take a considerable chunk out of Call of Duty: Warzone’s playerbase, which has been depleting for the last couple of years, it could have a detrimental impact on Call of Duty’s long-term playerbase.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-black-ops-7-reveal-event-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 is set to get a full reveal</a> at this year’s Opening Night Live on August 19th.</p>



<p>What do you think of Activision not being worried about Battlefield outcompeting Call of Duty? Should they be? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 6 Season 4, Shock ‘N Awesome, goes live tomorrow and ahead of that, the developers have revealed all the new additions of this season. </p>



<p>Fortnite’s Power Rangers collaboration was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-power-rangers-collaboration-confirmed-in-new-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed yesterday</a> through a brand new teaser by Epic Games. The same teaser also revealed that Chapter 6, Season 4 is called Shock ‘N Awesome and will have players dealing with hordes of bugs. The latest blog post provides all the details of the new season, including new POIs, weapons, enemies and more. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-shock-n-awesome-update-details">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock ‘N Awesome Update Details </h2>



<p>Bugs have infested Fortnite in the new season, and players will have to stomp and smash this swarm with the O.X.R., the Island’s anti-bug military defence force.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-fortnite-pois">New Fortnite POIs</h3>



<p>Four new POIs have been introduced in the latest Fortnite Season, including The Hive, Swarmy Stash, O.X.R. HQ. and Rangers Ruin. The Hive exhibits signs of high insect activity, and players are bound to encounter a swarm in this area. O.X.R. HQ is where players will find troops stationed in barracks, commanders at battle operations, an OXR Armoury, and more. The Rangers Ruin is a former weapons lab, formerly an O.X.R. base, that was overrun by an infestation. No specific details about Swarmy Stash were revealed. </p>

<h3 id="h-new-fortnite-bug-enemies">New Fortnite Bug Enemies</h3>



<p>There are three types of new bugs Fortnite will introduce in Chapter 6 Season 4, Shock ‘N Awesome, including the Swarmer, Bomber and the Queen. The Swarmer is a bottom-feeder, but it can take you down if not dealt with quickly. Bombers are bugs that are guarding nests. They can burrow and pop up behind the player and also attack with a goop lob from afar. Last, but not least, is the Queen, a massive bug that is taller than most buildings. She can body slam you or even summon more bugs to make your life difficult. </p>

<h3 id="h-new-fortnite-shock-n-awesome-weapons-boons-and-medallions">New Fortnite Shock ‘N Awesome Weapons, Boons and Medallions</h3>



<p>When dealing with hordes of massive bugs, players will need appropriate equipment to take them down, and that’s where O.X.R. comes in. The game now features O.X.R. ranks, and all players start with a C rank and can progress up to S+ rank with their party. Each rank up will provide players with an O.X.R. Drop Pod, which brings a lot of loot and a Super Soldier Boon. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h4 id="h-weapons">Weapons</h4>



<p>There’s a special weapon, the Bug Blaster, which can shoot loose explosive plasma projectiles and deal a heavier attack when charged. The other new item is called Roly Poly, which allows players to roll and bounce around the map or charge it up and unleash a big burst of speed. There are some O.X.R. issued weapons too, including Leadspitter 3000&nbsp;minigun,&nbsp;Sweeper Shotgun,&nbsp;O.X.R. Rifle,&nbsp;Wrecker Revolver, and the laser-guided&nbsp;Swarmstrike&nbsp;rocket launcher. </p>



<p>With this season introducing Power Rangers to Fortnite, we also receive a special themed sidearm, the Blade Blaster. It is a sci-fi energy pistol that can fire in quick-tap mode or charged bursts. The other exotic weapons and items include Eradicator O.X.R. Rifle, Double Trouble, Shock N’ Slow Shockwave Launcher, Marksman Wrecker Revolver and Exotic Slap Berry Fizz. </p>

<h4 id="h-boons">Boons</h4>



<p>Coming to Boons, players will find new sets in O.X.R. chests and Hive Sacs, they can also be purchased from the Armory. There are three standard boons: Agile Aiming, Extended Magazine, and Storm Forecast. Then there are 4 Super Soldier-Ranked Boons, which are exclusive to O.X.R. drop pods. The Super Soldier Boon Rank B provides reduced energy consumption during sprint, Rank A boon provides Rank B abilities with increased reload speed. Rank S provides A and B abilities with reduced weapon recoil and spread, Rank S+ provides A, B and S abilities with increased sprint speed and unlimited energy.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h4 id="h-medallions">Medallions</h4>



<p>When clearing out swarms in certain POIs, players will be able to battle one of three Queen Bugs. Each bug provides a unique mythic weapon and medallion. Check out what each Queen provides at the three POIs below: </p>



<ul>
<li>The Hive’s Queen delivers players with Mythic Enhanced Wrecker Revolver and&nbsp;Surge Medallion, which increases movement speed and gives a burst of speed when sliding. </li>



<li>Ranger’s Ruin Queen provides players with a Mythic Tactical Shotgun and&nbsp;Springleg Medallion, which gives you the ability to double jump, with fall damage immunity. </li>



<li>Demon’s Domain Queen pgives Mythic O.X.R. Assault Rifle and&nbsp;Carapace Medallion&nbsp;which gives 50 Health when you eliminate an opponent, and passively gives 3 Shield per second up to 50 Shield.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-whirlybird">Whirlybird </h3>



<p>Fortnite’s Shock N’ Awesome season will also introduce the Hammerhead Choppa later in the season. It functions like a helicopter and can briefly hover mid-air when players switch seats to lay down suppressing fire on the other side. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-new-blitz-royale-poi">New Blitz Royale POI</h3>



<p>Last but not least is the new Fortnite Blitz Royale POI, which comes with new medallions and mythics. On August 12, players will be able to take flight with Kinetic Ore as the new Oathbound Citadel POI arrives on the map. On August 19, new Medallions, Boons, and select Mythics &amp; Exotics from Shock ‘N Awesome will be added.
