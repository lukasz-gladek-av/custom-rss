            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/build-a-rocket-boy-io-interactive/</link>
            <guid>1420717</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that the developers behind <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mindseye/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mindseye/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MindsEye</a>, Build a Rocket Boy, are planning to announce soon that they have decided to part ways with their publisher, IO Interactive.</p>



<p>According to sources close to the impending news, the decision is driven by Build a Rocket Boy’s desire to bring its publishing in-house and gain more control over its future. That includes faster decision-making, simpler communication, and greater control over the player experience.</p>



<p>As part of the change, it’s said that the upcoming MindsEye x Hitman crossover, which was announced during 2025’s Summer Game Fest, will no longer be taking place. Instead, Build a Rocket Boy will continue focusing on more fixes and content updates to build out MindsEye.</p>



<p>It’s understood that the decision to part ways is Build a Rocket Boy’s, rather than IO Interactive’s.</p>



<p>MindsEye launched on June 10, 2025, to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-reviews-creep-in-worst-rated-game-2025/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-reviews-creep-in-worst-rated-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horrible critic reviews</a>, with just 6% of critics recommending the game and receiving mostly negative to mixed reviews on Steam. Prior to the game’s launch and just a couple of weeks earlier, Mark Gerhard, the co-CEO of Build a Rocket Boy, took to Discord in a Q&amp;A to claim that the negative pre-release reception of MindsEye was part of a paid campaign by a third party to make a “concerted effort to trash the game and the studio”.</p>



<p>Build a Rocket Boy remained mainly silent following the game’s release, instead focusing on trying to fix and improve the game. Co-CEO <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-relaunch-as-ceo-blames-saboteurs/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-relaunch-as-ceo-blames-saboteurs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leslie Benzies reportedly told staff </a>on a call one month following the game’s release that 300 developers were at risk of redundancy, saying the “studio and game’s struggles” were due to “internal and external saboteurs”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has contacted IO Interactive for comment, but did not receive one prior to publication. Should one be given, we will update this report.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-power-armor-fallout-devs-lock-paywall/</link>
            <guid>1420690</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bethesda Game Studios recently unveiled an awesome new ‘Mojave Bundle’ to eager Fallout 76 players, especially those neck-deep in the second season of the television show, which comes to an end in under a week. The Mojave Bundle contains a kick-ass new power armor skin that replicates the recent one revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-more-than-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the TV series</a>, but there’s a huge catch.</p>



<p>Despite the Mojave Bundle boasting a few more cosmetics, some fans are outraged that it costs a whopping $30 – or £26.99, if you’re on the other side of the pond.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-vegas-ranger-power-armor-locked-behind-pay-barrier">New Vegas Ranger Power Armor Locked Behind Pay Barrier</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 players are contending with the revelation that one of the coolest suits of power armor ever added to the Fallout universe (let’s not get into <em>that </em>debate) is locked behind a hefty paywall.</p>



<p>If you want to acquire Fallout 76’s Mojave Bundle, you’ll need to part ways with $30 of your hard-earned cash. It’s not available to purchase using in-game currency (Atoms), nor do you get any kind of a discount for having a Fallout 1st <em>premium </em>subscription.</p>



<p>As a side note, check out why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-1st-removed-from-player-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 76 fans in Japan</a> are especially annoyed at Fallout 1st…</p>



<p>The Mojave Bundle comes with:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ranger Power Armor Paint</li>



<li>NCR Flag</li>



<li>New Vegas Neon Sign</li>



<li>Ad Victoriam (Super Sledge)</li>



<li>Legion Legate Outfit</li>



<li>Player Title Prefix</li>



<li>Player Title Prefix &amp; Suffix</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s not a tiny bundle by any means, but it’s 100% cosmetic and has a high price point, which is the core problem here. To put this into perspective, the base game currently costs under $10, so the cosmetic pack is more than three times the cost of the game (when it’s not on sale).</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Most people would be playing Fallout 76 via a paid-for subscription, like Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, so they’re even more unlikely to invest cash in the ecosystem to acquire a $30 cosmetic bundle.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, Bethesda <strong>pledged </strong><span>there would be no paid DLC for Fallout 76, then later unveiled Fallout 1st, which caused a bit of outrage by paywalling items many thought they should all&nbsp;</span>get, like the treasured stash box and survival tent mechanics.</p>



<p>Admittedly, every expansion to hit Fallout 76 thus far, including the recent Burning Springs expansion, has been <strong>completely free</strong>, so it could be argued that a $30 cosmetics bundle isn’t rocking the boat too much and should be eaten up nicely by the die-hard fans of the post-apocalyptic world.</p>







<p>Do you think $30 is too much for a Fallout 76 cosmetics bundle? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new claim states that PlayStation is developing an OLED version of the Portal, following the success of the original. </p>



<p>We have heard about several leaks about the upcoming PlayStation 6 handheld over the last year, with reports that it will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-handheld-console-will-be-dockable-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dockable</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not as powerful</a> as the PlayStation 5, and more surfacing online. Now, new information has surfaced online on the existing PlayStation handheld, the Portal. </p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-portal-oled-model-is-reportedly-in-development">PlayStation Portal OLED Model is Reportedly in Development</h2>



<p>The claim about the PlayStation Portal OLED model comes from KeplerL2 on <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/intels-panther-lake-igpu-is-really-worth-considering-for-a-handheld-amd-fell-asleep-at-the-wheel.1692741/page-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Neogaf</a>. In the thread, Kepler first mentioned that the PS Handheld will be RDNA5 before discussing the Portal. They then stated that the original Portal model “seems to be a success,” with PlayStation working on “another version this year.” When asked which version they were referring to, Kepler responded, “OLED version.” </p>



<p>The PlayStation Portal received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-portal-gets-cloud-streaming-in-surprise-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprise cloud-streaming update</a> last year, adding the ability to stream select PS5 games directly to their devices with PS Plus Premium. The library includes some big names like Astro Bot, Borderlands 4, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Fortnite, Ghost of Yōtei, Grand Theft Auto V, Resident Evil 4, Cyberpunk 2077, God of War Ragnarök, Hogwarts Legacy, Sword of the Sea, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, and more.</p>



<p>With the new update, the PlayStation Portal OLED Model would be more attractive to new customers; however, we have yet to receive official confirmation, so readers should take this information with a grain of salt for now. </p>







<p>In other news, a recent claim states that Xbox’s dedicated handheld was cancelled as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-handheld-amd-10-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMD required 10 million units</a>. Additionally, layStation Store seems to have inadvertently confirmed an incoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-ps5-upgrade-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance PS5 upgrade</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new announcement reveals that the original Final Fantasy 7 is re-releasing on Steam, replacing the 2013 version. </p>



<p>Nowadays, all we hear about Final Fantasy 7 is the remake instalments, Intergrade has already been released for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Switch 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-series/" id="3453">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-part-3-confirmed-for-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebirth and Part 3 </a>have been confirmed for both platforms as well. However, today we aren’t talking about any of the remakes; instead, we are talking about the original Final Fantasy 7 title. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-re-releasing-to-replace-2013-version-on-steam">Final Fantasy 7 Re-Releasing to Replace 2013 Version on Steam </h2>



<p>According to a recent post on <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/2016920806258069772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/square-enix/" id="149">Square Enix</a> has posted a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/39140/view/514107648813039662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> on Steam regarding Final Fantasy 7’s re-release. The new version will rename the current version to FINAL FANTASY VII – 2013 Edition, and this version will no longer be available for purchase once the new version is released. </p>



<p>Existing owners of the 2013 version of Final Fantasy 7 don’t need to worry, as they will both retain access to the previous version and gain access to the new version at no additional cost. This means players can have both versions in their library, but there is no save data compatibility between them. Players with FF7 2013 save data can only use it for the 2013 edition, and the same for the new release. </p>



<p>Moreover, Square Enix has yet to provide a release date or an explanation for re-releasing Final Fantasy 7 on Steam. From what I can see, there are no noticeable upgrades in this version. </p>







<p>In other news, a new claim states that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth could release for Xbox and Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-could-arrive-for-switch-2-this-summer-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this summer</a>. Additionally, Final Fantasy 7 Remake part 3 will bring back the iconic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-bring-back-the-snowboarding-mini-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snowboarding mini game</a>.
