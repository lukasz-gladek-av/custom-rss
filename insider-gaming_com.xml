<p>Early images of what could be a new live-service IP by Bend Studio’s have been posted online.</p>



<p>The images came from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-sony-bend-new-ip-in-development-screenshots-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, who say that the images came from the portfolio of an undisclosed UI designer at Bend Studio who have been working there since March 2022. According to the outlet, the images originate from a Google Drive that where uploaded sometime in 2023, but it’s unclear on when exactly the images where taken.</p>



<p>They reveal that Bend Studio appears to be working on, or has worked on, some live-service military shooter. </p>

<p>As some people have already pointed out, the one image above appears to be some kind of central hub where players could interact. However, without knowing the full context of the images, it’s possible that this is just a design level for the game, to test out different aspects and isn’t intended for final use.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-next-game-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Job listings</a> have already pointed to Bend Studio’s next game being some kind of live service, and with how the industry has been going all-in with Battle Royales and extraction shooters in the past few years, it isn’t difficult to imagine that Bend Studio could be going in that direction.</p>



<p>For now, though, we’ll have to wait and see what exactly they are developing.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, Bend Studio’s next game has been in development for four to five years, so we should start to hear more about it soon.</p>



<p>What do you think Bend Studio is developing? Are you excited about another potential live-service battle royale/extraction shooter? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
