<p>The fan favorite map Cache is returning to Counter-Strike after its creator remade it for CS2, but Valve has to officially approve it before players can hop back in. After more than half a decade, finally, Cache is back.</p>



<h2 id="h-fmpone-completes-the-cache-remake-for-cs2">FMPONE Completes the Cache Remake for CS2</h2>



<p>Shawn “FMPONE” Snelling, one of Cache’s original creators and a celebrate community map maker for Counter-Strike, has officially returned. FMPONE <a href="https://x.com/FMPONE/status/1896594726738141512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the return of Cache on X (formerly known as Twitter) today, including a couple of screenshots and a link to the official file on the Steam Community workshop. However, the link currently doesn’t work.</p>



<p>FMPONE says this is because “has to approve it first,” expressing his hopes that the approval process will be quick. A number of pro players and creators are celebrating the imminent return of the map already, including North America-based streamer Erik “fl0m” Flom, who <a href="https://x.com/fl0mtv/status/1896595554635030718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">implored</a> Valve to “wake up” and approve the map.</p>

<p>It’s been more than five years since Cache was featured in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-cs2-active-duty-map-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Active Duty map pool</a>; the official rotation of balanced maps used in competitive play and tournaments. Cache’s last Major appearance was IEM Katowice 2019, before it was replaced by Vertigo before the start of the StarLadder Berlin Major later that year. Cache has been host to a number of viral moments, including the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQIX-ylS7YU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1v2 falling/no-scope AWP shot clutch</a> from Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev. It also was the site of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkM6QtnL1xM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infamous mishap</a> from streamer xQc which considered by many to be the worst Counter-Strike highlight ever.</p>



<p>While Cache will likely be playable very soon, don’t expect to see it at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming BLAST.tv Austin Major</a>. It may be some time before it re-enters the Active Duty map pool, especially considering the pool just underwent a change with the arrival of another remade classic, Train.</p>
