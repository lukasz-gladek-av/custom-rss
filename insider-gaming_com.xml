<p>Five games, including Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, are leaving Xbox Game Pass in November 2025. </p>



<p>All of the games, which you can see below, will be removed on November 16. That means not only will they not be available for subscribers, but the ability to save money on a purchase will be gone, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-games-leaving-xbox-game-pass-in-november">Games Leaving Xbox Game Pass In November</h2>



<p>As mentioned, five games are set to leave the Xbox Game Pass catalog later this month. In addition to Stalker 2, other games leaving the service include Football Manager 24, Football Manager 24 Console, Blacksmith Master (Game Preview), Frostpunk, and Spirittea.</p>



<p>Football Manager 24 is leaving as the latest installment, Football Manager 26, releases on November 4. The original Frostpunk also makes sense, as Frostpunk 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/frostpunt-2-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined the catalog</a> on September 18.  Lastly, Stalker 2’s departure comes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-new-game-releases-for-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just days before its launch</a> on PlayStation 5 on November 20. </p>

<p>As mentioned, the games are set to leave on November 16. Game Pass Subscribers can save up to 20% on the games, should they want to buy them. </p>

<p>The first full Super Mario Galaxy Movie trailer is reportedly coming later this month. In fact, it could be coming within the next few weeks.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/MyTimeToShineH/status/1985029599063843018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MyTimeToShine</a>, a movie outlet with accurate reports in the past, the next trailer for the upcoming movie is set to premiere in theaters ahead of Wicked For Good on November 21. Originally, plans seemed to call for it to debut in theaters before Zootopia 2, which launches on November 26.</p>



<p>In addition to its theatrical showing, the outlet adds that it should appear online beforehand.</p>



<p>“The trailer will drop online before November 21st, and then make its theatrical debut with Wicked For Good,” they said. “That releases a week before Zootopia 2. It could still play before Zootopia 2, but that won’t be its official cinema debut.”</p>



<p>Confirmed during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-announced-nintendo/">September’s Nintendo </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-announced-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">D</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-announced-nintendo/">irect</a>, the Super Mario Galaxy Movie is the sequel to the highly successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie from 2023. The sequel will see Chris Pratt return as Mario, along with Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Jack Black as Bowser, and Kevin Michael Richardson as Kamek.</p>



<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is scheduled to release in theaters on April 3, 2026. Its release will mark exactly three years to the day of the original’s launch.</p>
