<p>A new season is set to kick off in Marvel Rivals, with Season 4, Heart of the Dragon, bringing a bunch of Team-Up ability changes, which we’ve got all the details for.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 12</a>, big additions are coming to Marvel Rivals, which include a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-4-trailer-confirms-ps4-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch on PlayStation 4</a>, and the customary <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-4-buffs-and-nerfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buffs and nerfs</a> have been shared in the latest balance changes.</p>



<p>Another staple of a new season in Marvel Rivals is Team-Up ability changes, and we’ve got everything you need to know about the adjustments for Season 4.</p>

<p>A new season in Marvel Rivals is right around the corner with Season 4, Heart of the Dragon, poised to land, alongside the latest balance changes with a host of buffs and nerfs.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 12</a>, Season 4 of Marvel Rivals has some big additions, including a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-4-trailer-confirms-ps4-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release on PlayStation 4</a>, a new character, new maps, and plenty more.</p>



<p>Balance changes are just as important as any new content, however, and we’ve got all the details on the buffs and nerfs in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-4-early-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a>.</p>

<p><strong>As is customary at the start of a new season, a huge number of balance changes are being made in Marvel Rivals, with buffs and nerfs to several heroes.</strong></p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Invisible Woman, Jeff the Land Shark, </strong>and <strong>Ultron </strong>are receiving boosts, while <strong>Luna Snow </strong>is having the duration of her Ultimate ability reduced, and <strong>Loki </strong>is also affected by nerfs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[10 Most Iconic Brands From Fallout—From Nuka-Cola to Vault-Tec]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout%E2%80%94from-nuka-cola-to-vault-tec.1289517/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout is almost an indictment of consumerism and capitalism. It’s bursting at the seams with shady, titanic corporations that almost always had some kind of dubious or deceptive subplot tucked behind the scenes in the run-up to the nuclear war that wiped the United States off the map. </p>



<p>In this list, we’re breaking down the most iconic brands from Fallout, determining which of the many organisations and corporations in the Fallout Universe stand out amongst the crowd.</p>



<h2 id="h-most-recognisable-fallout-brands">Most Recognisable Fallout Brands</h2>



<p>There are quite literally hundreds of brands, labels, organisations, and corporations in Fallout, but which of them can be counted as the most iconic? Here’s our definitive list to settle that debate and give you a little more visibility of the most iconic brands from Fallout.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-nuka-cola">1. Nuka-Cola</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nuka-Cola is, without a doubt, the most recognisable and iconic brand in Fallout. It’s probably even more recognisable than Vault-Tec, which we’ll get to in a second. </p>



<p>In the Fallout Universe, Nuka-Cola is one of the biggest corporations, and its influence is felt far and wide across the post-apocalyptic wasteland. It’s the many millions of bottle caps from Nuka-Cola bottles that became the de facto currency after the bombs fell, after all.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-vault-tec-industries">2. Vault-Tec Industries</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Vault-Tec Industries was responsible for the construction of the vaults that housed many thousands of people as the bombs rained down across the United States in the Fallout Universe. </p>



<p>It’s easily one of the most iconic brands from Fallout – its mascot alone, the blond-haired Vault Boy, is one of the most recognisable characters in modern gaming. It might have been a relatively evil, disingenuous corporation, but that’s the point.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-super-duper-mart">3. Super-Duper Mart</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Super-Duper Mart is Fallout’s representation of Wal-Mart, and it’s easily one of the most iconic brands from Fallout. It’s primarily an ‘East Coast’ organisation, so it has only been present in Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76, but that’s enough for the brand to have left a lasting impression on players. </p>



<p>One of the earliest missions in Fallout 3 takes players into the heart of a Super-Duper Mart overrun by Raiders, and that’s a hugely memorable portion of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-west-tek">4. West-Tek</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>West-Tek is one of those Fallout brands that didn’t gain mass prominence until Fallout 76, when players got the opportunity to visit buildings that once housed this titanic technological corporation. </p>



<p>It might not be common knowledge, but West-Tek is one of the most iconic brands from Fallout – it’s the firm responsible for the creation of Power Armor, laser-based weapons, and some of the research into the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus).</p>







<h3 id="h-5-general-atomics-international">5. General Atomics International</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>General Atomics International is responsible for a series of robots that are commonplace across the Fallout Universe. Before the Great War, General Atomics International created the Mister Handy, arguably one of the most recognisable robots from the Fallout series – everyone who has played the games has seen one. It also produced Mister Gutsy, Robobrain, and co-created Liberty Prime.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-robco-industries">6. RobCo Industries</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>We couldn’t list Generic Atomics International and not mention RobCo Industries! This iconic Fallout brand was founded by none other than Robert Edwin House — that’s right, <strong>the </strong>Mr. House from Fallout: New Vegas. </p>



<p>As Fallout’s answer to Tony Stark, Mr. House’s corporation was responsible for the creation of a huge array of robots: Eyebot, Protectron, Sentry Bot, Securitron, Liberty Prime, and Assaultron. Not only that, but RobCo manufactured the Pip-Boy, one of the most instantly recognisable devices from the Fallout Universe!</p>







<h3 id="h-7-hubris-comics">7. Hubris Comics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Hubris Comics is another iconic Fallout brand that, even if you don’t know it, you’ve come into contact with it. In the Fallout Universe, Hubris Comics publishes a range of illustrated items that users can pick up to get buffs and bonuses – namely, the Grognak the Barbarian line of comic books. </p>



<p>From Fallout 3 to New Vegas and from Fallout 4 to Fallout 76, Hubris’ influence has been felt by millions of players in Fallout.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-poseidon-energy">8. Poseidon Energy</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Poseidon is an energy company, which almost immediately makes it an evil corporation in the Fallout Universe. As the world came grinding to a halt, it was iconic brands like this that squeezed every cent possible out of the citizens of the United States. </p>



<p>In Fallout, Poseidon boasted ownership of some memorable locations, like the Helios One plant from New Vegas and the Oil Rig that housed the Enclave. If that wasn’t enough, Poseidon also invented many of the franchise’s Plasma weapons. </p>



<h3 id="h-9-pulowski-preservation-services">9. Pulowski Preservation Services</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nuclear protection on a budget! Have you ever seen one of the tall, cylindrical, blue devices scattered around Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76? These are the Pulowski Preservation Shelters, and they make up the backbone of a gigantic scam. </p>



<p>Upon the impending threat of nuclear annihilation, one person could buy their way into one of these street-mounted shelters, but the only issue was that they didn’t work. They’re full of skeletons of the foolish citizens who were eager to hide in them to escape the nuclear fire.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-red-rocket">10. Red Rocket</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Red Rocket is a corporation and one of the most iconic brands from Fallout, without any shadow of a doubt. It operated a network of gas stations across the United States of America in the Fallout Universe, and in the wake of the apocalypse, many of them became makeshift shelters and small settlements for survivors. </p>



<p>They’re instantly recognisable, almost always because of the large model rockets in a ‘launch pose’ on the rooftops of the gas stations littered around the wasteland.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#817)—Clues and Answers for Friday, September 5]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-817-september-5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-817-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-friday-september-5.1289484/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s almost the weekend, and it’s time for another invigorating round of NYT Connections. If you’re nursing a killer streak, you’ll want to keep that going with today’s puzzle, and fortunately, I’m here to help you. Below, I’ve outlined the best NYT Connections hints for today (#817), as well as the answers, if you want the fastest solution possible.</p>



<p>Being a bit of a Star Wars nerd, today’s NYT Connections hints excited me, but once again, it was a case of the puzzle throwing a curveball to subvert expectations. Read on to get the NYT Connections clues you need to resolve today’s puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-september-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (September 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #817</p>



<ul>
<li>HAN</li>



<li>SOLO</li>



<li>FREE</li>



<li>ZING</li>



<li>RAM</li>



<li>KICK</li>



<li>STAG</li>



<li>BUCK</li>



<li>SINGLE</li>

<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>–<em>These words pack a sensory wallop—think of what gives a dish its lively edge or a personality its spark. You might find them in a food review or a boxing metaphor</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These all describe someone flying solo—whether at a wedding, on a dating app, or just living that independent life. No plus-one required.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These names belong to male animals, often used colloquially or in farming circles. If you’ve ever met a goat named Billy or a rabbit named Jack, you’re on the right track.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These are not just history test answers—they’re the ruling houses that shaped centuries of Chinese civilization. Think dynasties that built walls, wrote poetry, and changed the course of empires.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Being a bit of a history buff, I appreciated the nod we got to the <strong>obvious </strong>above. Admittedly, this was one of the easiest NYT Connections puzzles this week, and it didn’t take too long to figure it out.</p>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, September 5.</p>
