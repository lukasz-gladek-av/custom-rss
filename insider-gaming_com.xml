<p>A new 007 First Light leak has revealed that Grammy-winning musician Lenny Kravitz will be playing a villain called Bawma in the upcoming game. </p>



<p>007 First Light developers recently showcased new gameplay to the players with insights from the gameplay director and the senior level designer. It seems they had another reveal in the works for this month, which would showcase one of the villain players might face in 007 First Light. </p>

<p>Towards the end of the trailer, it was also stated that players who pre-order 007 First Light now will receive a free Deluxe Edition upgrade.

The game’s release date is set for March 27, 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Update Fixes Some Out-of-Bounds Map Exploits]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-update-patch-notes/</link>
            <guid>1379389</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has published a new update in ARC Raiders, one that addresses some of the most critical concerns players have about the game. In recent weeks, the patches pushed out by Embark Studios have been appreciated, but they’ve been firefighting some pesky issues that have made some player experiences fairly miserable.</p>



<p>The biggest concern has been around the game’s worst players glitching through walls or using ziplines to get out of the map in places, sometimes making them impervious to damage while being able to take down other players.</p>



<p>This patch addresses some of those issues.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-patch-notes-december-11">ARC Raiders Patch Notes – December 11</h2>



<p>The latest ARC Raiders patch was summarized by Embark Studios <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1999060771125248006">on social media</a>. It’s a small change, but one that might prove to be quite mighty:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Time to restart your client, there’s a new update rolling out! </p>



<ul>
<li><em>Removed zipline out-of-bounds exploit on Stella Montis</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed vaulting bug on Blue Gate</em></li>



<li><em>Corrected material issues affecting bullet/blocking &amp; ARC vision</em></li>



<li><em>Closed gap in Spaceport Launch Tower wall.</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>Patch Cadence Update:</p>



<p>Going forward, updates and store rotations will move to Tuesdays, and will not be on a weekly cadence. With the holidays approaching, the team are taking a much needed break to rest and recover, returning in January with more exciting updates. </p>



<p>We’ll continue to monitor and work on critical issues during this time, but for now… </p>



<p>Get ready for the Cold Snap update next Tuesday, packed with fixes and new content!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans were quick to comment about the other outstanding issues under the post, such as the broken Trophies on PlayStation 5, which are preventing some users from hitting 100% completion of the game. In a title where a completionist attitude is front and centre, this is understandably quite irritating.</p>







<p>Have you been hit by anyone using a map exploit in ARC Raiders? Let us know if you’re happy to see this change going in on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
