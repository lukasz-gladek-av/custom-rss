<p>Even though Monster Hunter Wilds isn’t out yet, its roadmap and future DLC content plans have been revealed. It’s not everything, granted, but this guide should give you an idea of what to expect in the beginning—including the arrival of Mizutsune.</p>



<p>It’s almost commonplace to let players know what future content is arriving before a game’s even launched. Capcom has copied this approach with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Sony State of Play</a> unveiled some ideas and plans from Capcom’s drawing board.</p>



<p>It’s not a <em>monstrous</em> amount of content announced, but enough to keep us all invested.</p>

<p><strong>Capcom has revealed Monster Hunter Wilds is getting a lot of free content to support the game with patches, Quests, cosmetics, and fresh creatures to encounter.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-mizutsune">Mizutsune</h3>



<p>I’ll start with the headline maker itself: Mizutsune. First revealed via a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/monster-hunter-wilds-launch-trailer-reveals-new-monsters-and-first-post-launch-title-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog post</a> about Monster Hunter Wilds, Mizutsune&nbsp;is described as a “majestic monster.”</p>



<p>It’s described as having “dance-like attacks and bubbles to attack with a balance of beauty and brutality.” We’re unsure if it’s a general monster or requires more than a bunch of sticks and rocks to bring it down.</p>



<h3 id="h-event-quests-amp-cosmetics">Event Quests &amp; Cosmetics</h3>



<p>Special Quests are being added, rewarding you with “in-game armor with special looks!” It remains to be seen what the Quests entail, but if Monster Hunter Wilds wasn’t already big enough, you need your busy hat on as there’s more work to be done!</p>



<h3 id="h-day-one-ps5-pro-patch">Day One PS5 Pro Patch</h3>



<p>The final key detail we know about Monster Hunter Wilds’ roadmap is a day-one update for PS5 Pro users. Capcom says: “Monster Hunter Wilds will be <strong>PS5 Pro enhanced via a day one patch</strong>, further enhancing immersion with ray tracing.”<a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54323767436_865f200b5c_k.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a></p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-mizutsune-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds">When is Mizutsune&nbsp;Coming to Monster Hunter Wilds?</h2>



<p><strong>Mizutsune&nbsp;emerges in Monster Hunter Wilds in Spring 2025, giving you ample to prepare for the creature.</strong></p>



<p>Capcom isn’t showing Mizutsune&nbsp;yet, but it’s clear the monster is a big deal—literally. Stay tuned for further updates on Mizutsune, where to find it, and how to trigger it in Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>



<hr>



<p>Is it right for companies to announce DLC and roadmaps before launch? Is any negativity offset by declaring the content to be free on release? I’m mixed on the idea, but the transparency is commendable—as is the cost of Wilds’ announced content.</p>

<p>Funko Fusion developer 10:10 Games has recently undergone restructuring within the studio which includes some layoffs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that 10:10 Games made changes with the last week as part of projects within the company wrapping up. We were told that the restructuring was being done to better meet the needs of current projects within the studio. What those projects are, however, remains unknown.</p>



<p>As far as the number of people let go, sources have indicated that it’s around 20 employees. 10:10 Games has yet to give clarification on the exact number of people who were laid off despite multiple requests.</p>



<p>Sources say that the company is assisting with those let go, but couldn’t verify whether that includes any sort of severance as of publishing.</p>



<p>Founded in 2021 by industry veterans Arthur Parsons and Traveller’s Tales founder Jon Burton, 10:10 Games is based in Warrington, United Kingdom. The studio released Funko Fusion, its first game, in September 2024. According to the latest public records and information from the studio’s website, 10:10 Games employed around 100 people before the layoffs. </p>



<p>Through the first seven weeks of 2025, the games industry has seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 1,000 known jobs lost</a> across 27 companies.  Multiple companies have yet to make headcounts public, meaning t hat it’s likely the number is well over 1,000 at this point. In 2024, the industry saw over 16,000 estimated losses.</p>
