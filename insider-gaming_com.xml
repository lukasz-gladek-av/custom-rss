<p>The latest Escape from Tarkov patch has brought snow back for the first time in almost a year. The next time you load Escape from Tarkov, you’ll be prompted to install an update, and this is the winter update that brings crunchy, crispy snow back to Norvinsk.</p>



<p>In addition, multiple fixes were issued for some critical bugs plaguing Escape from Tarkov players. Get the full list below.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-most-wonderful-time-of-the-year">The Most Wonderful Time of the Year</h2>



<p>As the festive window approaches, snow has started falling in Escape from Tarkov, blanketing the game in a layer of crisp white that makes almost all outfits useless, strips foliage from every map, and deafens players using loud headsets.</p>



<p>The team at Battlestate Games rolled out the latest patch earlier today, which includes snow, along with a bunch of bug fixes and changes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed the loading wheel icon showing throughout the starting mission;</li>



<li>Fixed the camera lock and character movement lock that occurred when using consumable items before the second cutscene on Terminal</li>



<li>Fixed the inability to complete a specific task in the Batya story chapter in PvE mode</li>



<li>Fixed the lock for weapon operations and looting that occurred after looting a character that got killed while using a stationary weapon</li>



<li>Fixed the abrupt interruption of consumable item animations in certain cases</li>



<li>Fixed the incorrect spawn points for Zryachiy and his guards on Lighthouse</li>



<li>Fixed the audio artifacts when quickly skipping trader dialogue lines</li>



<li>Fixed the item icon display issues when trading while using active filters</li>



<li>Smoothed out the BTR movement</li>



<li>Fixed the incorrect message layout in the Messages tab</li>



<li>Fixed several localization errors</li>



<li>Fixed several visual geometry bugs across all locations</li>



<li>Fixed several interface issues</li>
</ul>



<p>Battlestate Games has been firefighting a little since Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update was released on November 15. The supersized overhaul introduced a string of issues that are slowly being addressed, but it’s often like fighting a hydra. As soon as they patch another bug, two more pop up.</p>



<p>Such is life.</p>

<p>A new trailer for a Tomb Raider Remake has seemingly leaked online, possibly for The Game Awards later tonight. </p>



<p>Geoff Keighley <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> earlier this week that Tomb Raider will be part of The Game Awards show. With many players patiently waiting to hear about the franchise’s future, they might not have expected the developers to announce a remake at the event; however, it seems like that might be the situation. </p>







<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-remake-trailer-seemingly-surfaces-online">Tomb Raider Remake Trailer Seemingly Surfaces Online</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tomb-raider-new-game-trailer-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, a user called Play4Index has posted a new video on <a href="https://x.com/Play4Index/status/1999132304979955718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that appears to be a new trailer for a Tomb Raider remake. In the 30-second video, we see Lara Croft wearing the same blue and beige outfit, exploring a jungle. It is a cinematic trailer, where we know the character swinging around, climbing surfaces, cartwheeling through flaming booby traps, and firing her pistols. Towards the end, we see her facing a dinosaur, and the video ends abruptly. </p>



<p>What’s more, earlier today, a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-leak-spoilers-potential-box-art-and-some-info-of-tr1-remake-%E2%80%9Cretelling%E2%80%9D-has-leaked.1379143/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ResetEra leak</a> also hinted at a Tomb Raider Remake. This leak consisted of the box art for the title, along with some screens from the leaked trailer. On the box art, the supposed Tomb Raider Remake is titled Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. However, there is no official confirmation from the developers, and players will have to wait for the official announcement later today to know for sure whether this game is coming. </p>







<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-prime-video-amazon-sigourney-weaver-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alien star</a> is in talks to feature in Prime Video’s Tomb Raider series.

<p>It’s time to put on nostalgia glasses as Fortnite OG Season 7 brings back classic content from years ago. As usual, the official update’s patch notes outline all changes in Fortnite OG Season 7, and Insider Gaming has the full list.</p>



<p>Epic Games rarely misses with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kim-kardashian-fortnite-guess-what-players-saying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, and the company smashes it with the concept of bringing back entire seasons of older content. While new seasons continue to be littered with new memories and favorite moments, older seasons throughout the years have brought joy.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-og-season-7-release-date-all-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite OG Season 7</a> turns back the clock to 2018, so check out the patch notes in the new update.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-fortnite-og-season-7-december-11-update-changes">Biggest Fortnite OG Season 7 December 11 Update Changes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A new, but old chapter. Credit to Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s not a surprise to learn that the biggest switch-ups for Fortnite’s Season 7 content include a reworked map, unvaulted and vaulted weapons, returning skins, and much more.</strong></p>



<p>You can play the Season 7 content either in normal or Zero Build modes, and it’s mostly just new, returning content. The biggest visual and performance improvements fix some terrain issues and missing foliage. Outside of that, it’s mostly a welcome back for X-4 Stormwings, Stink Bombs, and other fun content.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-fortnite-og-season-7-patch-notes">All Fortnite OG Season 7 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>Here is the entire collection of Fortnite OG Season 7 Patch Notes that arrived with the December 11 update.</p>



<h3>Unvaults and Vaults</h3>



<p>“<strong>IN: </strong><em>Dual Pistols, Balloon, Stink Bomb, Scoped Assault Rifle</em></p>



<p><strong>OUT:</strong> <em>Clinger, Port-A-Fort, Chiller Grenade, Burst Assault Rifle, Six Shooter</em></p>



<p><strong>Available with Season launch: </strong><em>Suppressed Sniper Rifle, Scoped Revolver, Boom Box, Glider (consumable item)</em></p>



<p>In addition to returning items, the Season 7 map has returned with the Ice King’s glacier colliding with the Island once more! <strong>Polar Peak, Frosty Flights, and Happy Hamlet</strong> POIs and locations have all returned in all their frigid, OG majesty.</p>



<h3 id="h-x-4-stormwings-fly-once-more">X-4 Stormwings Fly Once More!</h3>



<p>Air superiority returns. Whether you’re flying solo or bringing your whole wing squad along for the ride, step into the pilot’s seat and fly combat-ready.</p>



<p>The<strong> X-4 Stormwing</strong> comes equipped with a mounted machine gun, built for intense dogfights but also for pressuring ground targets from above. Stay frosty though – firing for too long will overheat the weapon!</p>



<h3 id="h-improvements-changes-bug-fixes">Improvements, Changes, Bug Fixes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Ascenders and Ziplines have been added and updated in both OG Build and Zero Build, letting you zip, climb and rotate wherever the fight takes you!</li>



<li>Fixed a visual issue with certain items not displaying the grid-like effect when viewed on the ground.</li>



<li>Fixed a visual issue causing inconsistent shading on the Race Track when viewed from above.</li>



<li>Smoothed out sharp terrain edges and added missing foliage at following locations to better match OG: Fatal Fields, Snobby Shores, Salty Springs</li>



<li>Removed misplaced foliage from the cliffside near Junk Junction and multiple spots at Pleasant Park. No more inaccurate bush camping!</li>



<li>Corrected visible seams and terrain texture mismatches near Loot Lake and Dusty Divot so everything looks cleaner.</li>
</ul>



<p>Chill out and revisit the winter wonderland of OG Season 7, and share with us your favorite moments from this blast from the icy past!</p>



<h3 id="h-looking-ahead-infinity-blade-shing-shings-onto-the-og-island-later-in-the-season">Looking Ahead: Infinity Blade shing-shings onto the OG Island later in the Season!</h3>



<p>It’s that time again – the Infinity Blade returns in all its glory. You’ve got some time to <em>sharpen </em>your skills before it drops, bringing mythic leaps, sweeping slashes and flashy swings with it.</p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite Status</a> for the complete set of tweaks, fixes, and changes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The ‘World’s First Game Created 100% Through AI’ Has a Playable Demo]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ai-game-playable-demo-codex-mortis/</link>
            <guid>1379800</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Earlier today, a team developing a game called Codex Mortis circulated PR materials for the first playable demo of this ‘necromantic survival bullet hell’. Those PR materials proudly declared the game ‘the world’s first fully playable game created 100% through AI’, which is an interesting way to promote a title to journalists, but here we go.</p>



<p>In the documentation provided, you can learn how Codex Mortis has been created ‘entirely through AI algorithms and tools’.</p>



<p>This will be a fun one.</p>







<h2 id="h-unapologetically-100-ai">Unapologetically, 100% AI</h2>



<p>The PR materials circulated by one ‘Darek Crunchfest’, confirmed that a playable demo for Codex Mortis can be explored <strong>now </strong>on Steam. The game, assembled by a developer called GROLAF, doesn’t try to paint a pretty picture – this is a 100% AI-driven title, and it’s proud of that fact.</p>



<p>The game’s bio on Steam reflects that:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Death is your weapon. Mix five schools of dark magic, unleash devastating spell synergies, and raise undead armies in this necromantic bullet hell. Infinite builds, solo or co-op – embrace the forbidden and dominate. 100% AI-driven development.<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4095390/CODEX_MORTIS_Demo/#app_reviews_hash"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Crunchfest noted in the PR email: ‘Oh, and one more thing: it’s probably the&nbsp;<strong>world’s first fully playable game created 100% through AI</strong>.’</p>



<p>It’s easy to see that the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4095390/CODEX_MORTIS_Demo/">trailer on Steam is AI</a>. It’s by no means disguised and is probably the most blatant representation of AI imaginable. It even boasts plenty of classic AI tells and artefacts.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Codex Mortis | Official Demo Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E5Oxs8lPT8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In Codex Mortis, players must assemble a ‘death squad’ and go toe-to-toe with all kinds of demonic enemies while wielding powerful magical abilities and weapons. The goal is to collect ‘ancient pages’ before an immortal boss hunts the player down and eliminates them, which is a similar concept to Vampire Survivors, with which this game has been aligned.</p>



<p>The email even mentioned that:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Vampire Survivors meets Guild Wars-style builds.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you’re a fan of Vampire Survivors, you might even say that Codex Mortis doesn’t look that bad, but it depends on how troubled you are about the use of AI to fully create a game. For some, it’s not an argument, as artificial intelligence is enabling small developers to make their games much more efficiently, so that’s another side of the argument.</p>
