            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tens of millions of players have flocked to Roblox this weekend to participate in a special, limited-time event backed by the two biggest games in the Roblox ecosystem. Grow a Garden, joined by the more recently successful Steal a Brainrot, have linked forces in an ‘Admin War’ event that pushed Roblox’s concurrent player count to <strong>47 MILLION+</strong>.</p>



<p>This shatters the previous record set in June, originally spearheaded by <strong>just </strong>Grow a Garden. Steal a Brainrot is the latest monumental success in the Roblox space, and it continues to soar.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-admin-war-in-roblox">What is the Admin War in Roblox?</h2>



<p>On social media, Jandel (<em>Grow a Garden</em>) and SpyderSammy (<em>Steal a Brainrot</em>) have been engaged in a digital beef to promote an Admin War event in Roblox. This event has propelled Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot to the top of the charts and the history books alike, with more than <strong>30 million concurrent players </strong>enjoying these two games alone.</p>



<p>This has now cemented Roblox as boasting the record for the highest CCU in gaming history.</p>



<p>In a post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365329529675882496/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on LinkedIn</a>, Roblox Strategist James Purell noted that the recent PR issues that have set Roblox alight are doing nothing to slow the platform’s growth:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>Now Roblox is officially the largest gaming platform by concurrent users and also holds the record for highest CCU game in the world.</p><p>While Roblox corporate deals with PR issues, developers like Jandel and Sammy are building experiences that millions of kids can’t stop playing. They’re the ones pushing the platform forward with innovation and community building.</p><p>Yes, Roblox 100% needs to do better on safety, but these developers are creating the content that keeps 47M people engaged. They’re the real engine behind the numbers – not Roblox corporate.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>In a similar sentiment, Atlas Creative’s CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michaelherriger_roblox-hit-47-million-concurrent-users-this-activity-7365080265284567040-tD_J/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Michael Herriger</a>, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The future of gaming is happening right in front of us. Great job to all the devs and for Roblox for propping up great games.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>No game on the market can come close to Roblox right now, which is <strong>technically </strong>more of an ecosystem than a single title. It’s unfair to refer to Roblox as ‘a game’ when it’s the most diverse UGC-backed universe in the industry.</p>



<p>Those taking part in the Admin War between Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot are picking their side and soaking up the special event before the weekend is up and things return to normal.</p>



<p>Which side did you pick in the war between Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>COD NEXT, the monumental event that unravels the short-term future of the Call of Duty franchise, sits firmly on the horizon. It’s set to drop in a matter of weeks, unveiling everything coming in Black Ops 7 and beyond. This will follow the latest trailer and preview that was showcased during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering when COD NEXT 2025 will take place or how to watch COD NEXT when it surfaces, read on. I’ve got all the information you need, including predictions.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-cod-next-2025-being-streamed">When is COD NEXT 2025 Being Streamed?</h2>



<p><strong>COD NEXT will be streamed live on September 30, 2025. </strong>It’s set to feature several hours of Call of Duty content and will almost certainly boast the usual arrangement of COD creators and pro players streaming the game from a centralized location.</p>



<p>COD NEXT 2025 is set to take place in <strong>Las Vegas</strong>, and in typical COD NEXT fashion, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we’ll see trailers</a>, gameplay walkthroughs, and dev panels unfold during the event. The insights will be unparalleled, and we’ll come away from COD NEXT with all the knowledge we’ll need for Black Ops 7, which will be released worldwide on November 14.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-watch-cod-next-2025">Where to Watch COD NEXT 2025</h2>



<p>The best place to watch COD NEXT 2025 is, as always, via the official Call of Duty channels. Every year, Call of Duty NEXT rewards viewers with exclusive drops that they can redeem in-game, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Beta codes</li>



<li>Double XP tokens</li>



<li>Exclusive charms, skins, sprays, or emblems</li>
</ul>







<p>Here are the links you’ll need to watch COD NEXT:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/callofduty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty on YouTube</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/callofduty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty on Twitch</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Alternatively, you’ll be able to watch <strong>some </strong>of COD NEXT by tuning in to see if your favorite Call of Duty streamer is broadcasting live from the event in Las Vegas on September 30. This will afford you a first-person perspective of Black Ops 7, but you might miss things like the developer panels and trailers.</p>



<h2 id="h-cod-next-2025-predictions">COD NEXT 2025 Predictions</h2>



<p>It’s easy to predict that we’ll see stacks of Black Ops 7 multiplayer content at COD NEXT. We’ll likely explore the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-weapon-build-feature-makes-sharing-loadouts-easier/">create-a-class systems</a>, maps, modes (especially new ones like Skirmish), and potentially ‘extra’ deliverables like Ranked or the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7’s Zombies platform will be revealed in full, and like the multiplayer ecosystem, we could see some creator-driven activations that’ll allow Activision’s studios to dive deep into the fan-favorite mode.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that Warzone will also be explored at COD NEXT 2025. It’s the staging ground for anything related to Call of Duty, and with each new iteration, Warzone undergoes some dramatic changes. How will Warzone differ when Black Ops 7 comes around?</p>



<p>Finally, we’ll see a walkthrough of whatever content and updates are coming next for Call of Duty Mobile, which is by numbers the most popular COD game in the world.</p>



<p>What do you want to see most at COD NEXT 2025? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
