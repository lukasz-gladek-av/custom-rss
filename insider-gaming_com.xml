<p>Activision <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-new-maps-modes-updates-announcement#season-01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has confirmed</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 will begin on November 14, and, with it, comes what it calls a “massive content drop”.</p>



<p>According to the publisher, the start of Black Ops 6 Season 1 will add a “colossal amount of free content like all-new Multiplayer maps and modes, a terrifying new in-season Zombies map, as well as the introduction of Omnimovement and&nbsp;Black Ops 6&nbsp;weapons and Loadout features to&nbsp;Call of Duty: Warzone!”</p>







<p>The confirmation of the start of the first season comes after the date was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently leaked thanks to Little Caesars pizza</a> promo. </p>



<p>As far as what Black Ops 6 Season 1 will include, full details will come shortly before it’s start date. When it comes, Activision says it will break down “all the new maps, modes, weapons, features, and more across Multiplayer, Zombies, and&nbsp;Call of Duty: Warzone.”</p>

<p>Aside from Season 1’s start date, Activision announced the return of the Infected game mode that is available for all players along with confirming, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nuketown-black-ops-6-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">again</a>, that Nuketown will launch on November 1.</p>



<p>“Built by Veteran Treyarch Map designer Adam Hoggatt and released as part of&nbsp;Call of Duty: Black Ops&nbsp;in November 2010, this remaster remains extremely faithful to the original design and layout of the map, even down to the precise placement of parked vehicles and other scenery harking back to the original three-lane design,” Activision said. </p>



<p>“This is Nuketown in its most original form, with a bright and bleached desert landscape, and even a double rainbow to gaze at, taking you all the way back to where it all began.”</p>
