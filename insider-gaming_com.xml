<p>It’s been a great launch for Warhorse Studios’ Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 as the studio has announced that the game has sold one million copies in a little over a day on the market.</p>



<p>“Over a million of you have stepped into our world,” the studio <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1887155255130866099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on social media</a>. “We’re beyond grateful for your support – thank you for making [Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2] a triumph!</p>



<p>In Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, our Grant Taylor-Hill called the game a “masterpiece”. </p>



<p>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is beautiful in every aspect,” the review reads. “It’s deeply authentic and riddled with emotion and catharsis, and the way the story comes together is just perfection.”</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-interview-tom-mckay-on-becoming-henry-in-kingdom-come-deliverance">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">INTERVIEW: Tom McKay on ‘Becoming Henry’ in Kingdom Come Deliverance</a></h6>



<p>He also said: “This monumental medieval adventure will have you living a double life – but in this one, you’re a brave adventurer exploring the most faithful recreation of a real place I’ve ever seen. From ethereal sequences packed with tearjerker scenes to a phenomenal weather engine, and from genuinely interesting side activities to a neat little photo mode, I cannot find one major fault with this game.”</p>

<p>Nintendo has announced that the Nintendo Switch 2 direct will start at 9am ET/6am PT/2pm GMT on April 2, 2025.

<p>OverActive Media, the parent company behind the Call of Duty League’s Toronto Ultra, has published a statement following the recent Major tournament held in Madrid, Spain. In a press release, it was confirmed that Major I, the first sizeable tournament of the CDL 2025 season, was ‘the most successful Major (they) have ever hosted’.</p>



<p>It was revealed that 80% of attendees at the venue in the Spanish city were from <strong>outside </strong>the country and that 12,000 people in total flocked to the Caja Mágica arena.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-defining-moment">‘A Defining Moment’</h2>



<p>OverActive Media’s CEO, Adam Adamou, explained in the press release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>By bringing together top-tier talent, innovative strategies, and fresh ideas, we are strengthening our connections with fans while unlocking new revenue streams and growth opportunities. </p>



<p>The energy in&nbsp;Madrid&nbsp;and the success of our acquisitions reaffirm our commitment to building a global esports company that entertains millions while creating sustainable growth.</p>



<p>Call of Duty League Major I was the most successful Major we have ever hosted. We sold more than 12,000 tickets, with more than 80% traveling from outside&nbsp;Spain, driving tourism and significant economic impact for the local community. </p>



<p>The energy in the arena, the intense competition, and the global engagement made this event a defining moment for the Call of Duty League and a clear statement on the sustainable growth of our esports presence in&nbsp;Europe.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I had the pleasure of attending the CDL Major in Madrid and caught up with many of the best Call of Duty players in the world. I was able to sit down with Atlanta FaZe, the team that won the tournament after a gruelling Grand Final against the LA Thieves.</p>



<p>The CDL Major I event was a boon to kickstart the latest competitive season. More than 233,000 consecutive viewers tuned in from around the world, and the showcase proved that Europe can be one of the most lucrative regions to host further Call of Duty events. This was the first CDL Major to take place in Europe in the history of the tournament.</p>



<p>Next, the Call of Duty League will head back to the United States, with Major II taking place in Texas in March 2025.</p>



<p>Later this year, in the summer, Toronto Ultra will host another CDL event – the Call of Duty League Championship tournament in Canada.</p>

<p>Due to recent feedback, Pokemon TCG Pocket announced that players will receive 1,000 Trade Tokens as a Gift.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s trading feature has received a lot of criticism since its release, primarily due to the features’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restrictions</a> and the cost of trades (tokens). Many players have complained about the price being too high to perform a sufficient number of trades, and there aren’t many ways to earn them either. Due to this feedback, TCG Pocket has <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1887035219351368102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">decided</a> to gift players 1,000 free Trade Tokens while they investigate ways to improve the feature.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-free-1-000-trade-tokens-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-nbsp">How to Claim Free 1,000 Trade Tokens in Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The developers have made it simple for players to claim these free Trade Tokens. All they need to do is visit the Gifts menu, which players can access by clicking the icon on the top right corner of the home screen. Here, they will find a gift from the development team, which includes 1,000 Trade Tokens. Click on the ‘Claim’ button to add the tokens to your inventory.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-space-time-smackdown-emblem-event">Space-Time Smackdown Emblem Event </h2>



<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket has recently released its Space-Time Smackdown expansion, which introduces over 140 cards from the Sinnoh region, along with legendary Pokemon like Dialga and Palkia. The developers currently host an <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1886942825222168827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">emblem event</a> where players can earn emblems depending on their wins against other players. One win will provide a participation emblem, five wins will get you a bronze emblem, 25 wins will get you a silver emblem, and 45 wins will let you earn a Gold Emblem. Players can also complete other missions to gain items like Shinedust and more.&nbsp;</p>
