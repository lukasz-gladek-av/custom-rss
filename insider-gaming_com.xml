<p>In one of this year’s most dark discoveries, brand-new hit life simulator Inzoi lets you run over children. While the game is designed to mimic most aspects of day-to-day life, players are understandably baffled by the inclusion.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-inzoi-come-out-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a> has steadily gained momentum and hype throughout 2025. Eventually, it superseded Hollow Knight Silksong to become the most-<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-most-wanted-wishlist-game-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wishlisted title on Steam</a>. Despite a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-inzoi-have-denuvo-denuvo-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Denuvo</a> roadblock on the way, the new rival to The Sims has gotten off to a hot start. It allows you to escape your real life to live a more perfect existence through Inzoi.</p>



<p>However, Inzoi possibly offers a bit too much freedom as you can quite literally control a car and careen into children.</p>

<p>An NSFW post appeared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inZOI/comments/1jldd0w/i_dont_think_that_krafton_realizes_that_you_can/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-players-surprised-to-discover-you-can-run-over-children-despite-teen-rating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inzoi subreddit</a> on March 27. It initially contained a description saying: “You can drive into the elementary school and run over…unalive the children.”</p>



<p>Underneath the message is a video of the action itself. Amazingly, it’s exactly as the user describes: It’s a car driving into a small group of kids, and the force sends one of the children flying and ragdolling uncontrollably.</p>



<p>The action reportedly kills the child, and this discovery has understandably shocked everyone. Many comments suggest the developer (or the assistance of publisher Krafton) will cause this type of action to be removed.</p>



<p>“They stated they wouldn’t be fond of violent mods in the game and then accidentally added one themselves,” said one user, whereas someone else commented: “They’ll probably fix it soon. Steam doesn’t allow you to depict children being harmed in such graphic ways, according to their content rules, so they’ll patch it out fast enough.”</p>



<p><strong>Warning: You can check the video for yourself below, but it might be uncomfortable for some.</strong></p>

<p>We’re yet to hear an official response from Krafton on the video. Do you think this type of content should be allowed in Inzoi? Or is it a life-simulator living up to its intention? We’re interested to hear your thoughts on this down below and in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1777/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>It’s been a long time since many fan-favorite PlayStation franchises have been seen. This has a lot to do with Japan Studio’s closure in 2021 and Shuhei Yoshida’s departure as president of SIE Worldwide Studios.</p>



<p>Sony is fixated on delivering high-energy, big-time blockbuster games for PlayStation owners. Examples of this strategy include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/guerrilla-games-1-million-players-horizon-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-ghost-of-tsushima-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Tsushima (and Ghost of Yotei)</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-showrunners-address-spores-returning-for-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yuri-lowenthal-spider-man-3-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/returnal-developer-housemarque-teases-mystery-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Returnal</a>. However, it means a less-driven approach toward AA game development.</p>



<p>The gap between indie titles and AAA giants is larger than ever, and part of this is due to Shuhei Yoshida stepping down as SIE Worldwide Studios’ president, which in turn caused Japan Studio to close.</p>

<p>In a translated interview with <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001799.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AV Watch</a>, Yoshida explained: “I was in charge of the first party, so I was asked to make a game that was powerful enough to sell hardware. When you make something like that, the company pushes you a lot. The company wanted such things, and while we had to make them, the scale of development and the sales required were getting bigger and bigger.”</p>



<p>He added that company creators were coming up with great ideas, and while they were “very creative and interesting,” they were ultimately deemed AA. He said that “Japan Studio ceased to exist” soon after he stepped down as president—an event brought on by PlayStation’s corporate restructuring.</p>



<p>“At that time, the JAPAN studio was a team that was good at making AA, and it was a studio. In that case, it probably doesn’t match what the company and first party are looking for,” explained Yoshida.</p>



<p>Japan Studio was part of the most lauded titles in PlayStation’s catalog: Everybody’s Golf, Ape Escape, LocoRoco, Knack, Patapon, Gravity Rush, and many more. While other studios might pick up these franchises—like Bandai Namco has done with the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-everybodys-golf-hot-shots-announced-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everybody’s Golf Hot Shots</a> title—some of these games are now consigned to history.</p>
