<p>Escape from Tarkov has just been pulled offline by Battlestate Games for a whopping 24 hours, and potentially longer if the 1.0 rollout needs to be extended. This is to allow the teams at Battlestate to deploy the complete overhaul coming with the 1.0 version of the game, which is the culmination of more than 10 years of development.</p>



<p>Tarkov going offline is a significant moment for the game, as when it comes back up, nothing will ever be the same again…</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-tarkov-back-online">When is Tarkov Back Online?</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov will be back online when the 1.0 update has been deployed. Battlestate Games has stressed it will be 24 hours from 11:00 GMT, which means 11:00 GMT <strong>tomorrow</strong>, it should be ready to go. When you boot tomorrow, you’ll be loading a new version of Escape from Tarkov, and for the first time in eight years, it <strong>won’t be a beta</strong>.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 version comes with a new map, weapons, and equipment, and much more besides. The game will wipe and introduce a new campaign that players can follow to ultimately <strong>escape from Tarkov</strong>, securing one of four endings to wrap up the game’s core loop.</p>



<p>PvE players will need to wipe their game (but it’s not mandatory) if they want to complete Escape from Tarkov’s new story.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-error-262-in-escape-from-tarkov">What is Error: 262 in Escape from Tarkov?</h3>



<p>Don’t worry, this is just the error message Battlestate Games has applied to the Escape from Tarkov launcher while the 1.0 deployment is being rolled out.</p>



<p>This weekend, a Twitch Drops campaign will go live, with thousands of streamers coming forth to broadcast the 1.0 version for the first time. Typically, a Tarkov wipe heralds a monumental time for the game, and it skyrockets on platforms like Twitch. This will be no different, as this is the most significant event in the game’s storied history.</p>







<p>Love it or hate it, Escape from Tarkov is likely back and (we hope) better than ever. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re most excited about from the 1.0 Tarkov update.</p>
