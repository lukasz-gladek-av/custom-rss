<p>Another day, another dollar, right? Or in this case, another day, another round of much-needed NYT Connections hints and solutions. Today’s puzzle is waiting for you, and I’m assuming that you’re keeping up that all-important streak as we head towards the most exciting day of the year.</p>



<p>If you’re pressed for solving today’s NYT Connections puzzle and need the best hints and solutions around, simply read on.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-10">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 10)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #913:</p>



<ul>
<li>WHY</li>



<li>YES</li>



<li>DEAR</li>



<li>SWEET</li>



<li>YEAR</li>



<li>COPY</li>



<li>SUCKER</li>



<li>DUMMY</li>



<li>FAKE</li>



<li>GRACIOUS</li>



<li>YELLOW</li>



<li>CANDY</li>



<li>MERCY</li>



<li>LOLLY</li>



<li>DUPE</li>



<li>HEAVENS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Exclamations of politeness or astonishment</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Something not real or original</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Sweet treats and the people who fall for them</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Words that start with the same letter</em>, <em>kind of</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The Mega Dimension DLC for Pokémon<strong> </strong>Legends: Z-A has been released and it provides a welcome relief for those grinding for the Shiny Charm, removing a tiresome requirement.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-shiny-charm-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shiny Charm in Pokémon<strong> </strong>Legends: Z-A</a> is unlocked by maximizing the level of Mable’s Research Tasks, and, in the base game, obtaining it required completing one of the most tedious grinds in franchise history. However, that has now changed.</p>







<h2 id="h-mega-dimension-dlc-removes-tiresome-shiny-charm-requirement">Mega Dimension DLC Removes Tiresome Shiny Charm Requirement</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Reduced grind. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>To obtain the Shiny Charm in the base game of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, players had to complete almost all of Mable’s Research Tasks, and it was impossible to claim the reward without completing one task in particular.</p>



<p>Players had to grind through a whopping 1,000 victories in the game, which required repeatedly churning through the Z-A Royale to defeat trainers before the final reward was dished out.</p>



<p>The launch of the Mega Dimension DLC changes that, however, as additional Research Tasks are provided by Mable, making it possible to obtain the Shiny Charm without having to secure 1,000 victories.</p>



<p>Though the new tasks come too late for those who have already grinded through the requirements to obtain the charm, which significantly increases the likelihood of encountering Shiny Pokémon, it’s a welcome boost for those yet to complete the grind.</p>



<p>There’s still plenty to do, however, as the new Research Tasks require exploring Hyperspace Lumiose to catch new Pokémon, obtain new Mega Evolutions, and enter pockets of Hyperspace. However, they’re much easier to tick off than the 1,000 battles requirement.</p>
