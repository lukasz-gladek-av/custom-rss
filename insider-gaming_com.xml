<p>The in-game image and abilities of the Human Torch in Marvel Rivals have leaked online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As revealed by reliable leaker RivalsLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871707483691245587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the Human Torch is one of the upcoming heroes Marvel Rivals developers seem to be working on. In-game images and abilities of the character have surfaced online, hinting that he might be arriving soon. The character is seen wearing his Fantastic 4 uniform, with his whole body engulfed in flames. Additionally, his hair, eyebrows, and eyes match the colour of the fire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same thread, RivalsLeaks has also <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871707598703272309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared</a> the in-game abilities page for the Human Torch in Marvel Rivals. The character’s primary attack is the Fire Cluster, the secondary attack is Blazing Blast, and his Team-Up ability with Storm is called Omega Fire. Other abilities include Supernova, Plasma Body, Pyro-Prison, and Flaming Meteor. Check out what each Human Torch ability does below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Fire Cluster (Left Click): Launches a splittable fireball at the enemy</li>



<li>Omega Fire (X): This team-up ability allows Storm to consume the Human Torch’s fire tornado and add it to her hurricane. Alternatively, the Human Torch can also consume Storm’s Hurricane to create a fiery hurricane that enlarges and intensifies all the fire tornadoes found while the ability is active.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Supernova (Q): The Human Torch will release a shockwave that damages enemies within a radius. During the activation of this skill, flame fields will turn into flame tornadoes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Plasma Body (L-Shift) This ability allows the Human Torch to enter a state of accelerated ascent.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Pyro-Prison (E): Through this ability, players can connect flame fields to create a fire wall that can burn enemies to deal damage.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Flaming Meteor (F): This ability will make the Human Torch dive to the ground and stun nearby enemies.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Blazing Blast (Right Click): Players can create a flame field in a targeted area by launching a fireball through this ability.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Okay, so you thought January would kick off 2025 with a slew of new video game releases, right? Well, it’s a generally quiet time for the industry, though we are receiving a few big titles, like Spider-Man 2 and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on PC. But it’s February that will really jump-start gaming in 2025. Here’s a look at the biggest video game releases in February 2025!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-hottest-game-releases-of-february-2025">The Hottest Game Releases of February 2025</h2>



<p>I really cannot understate how massive the month of February 2025 is for game releases. It’s overloaded with some truly epic titles, the kind of games you could spend hundreds or thousands of hours playing without looking at the release calendar again. But they come one after another this month, which will take a toll on our sanity and wallets.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </strong>(PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – February 4, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Civilization VII</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch) – February 11, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – February 14, 2025</li>



<li><strong>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Nintendo Switch) – February 14, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch) – February 14, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Avowed </strong>(PC/Xbox Series X|S) – February 18, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 1</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – February 18, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S) – February 21, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – February 28, 2025</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-looking-forward-to-march-2025">Looking Forward to March 2025</h2>



<p>After a month like February, here’s hoping March isn’t overly packed with new video game releases. We could use some time to rest and recuperate and, of course, to finish all of those massive titles like Kingdom Come and Monster Hunter Wilds. But, here’s what you can look forward to in March 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Two Point Museum</li>



<li>Split Fiction</li>



<li>Tales of the Shire</li>



<li>Atomfall</li>
</ul>

<p>Battlestate Games has confirmed that Escape from Tarkov’s next wipe will hit tomorrow, December 26. This patch – which also includes Escape from Tarkov Arena – ushers in the 0.16.0.0 patch, and the 0.2.5.0 patch for the latter title. It’s set to take the game offline for around eight hours, and when it comes back up, hundreds of thousands of players will flood the game.</p>



<p>How many of them will be cheaters or malicious operators?</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov has had a tough time of late dealing with more than a few issues. The biggest concern is cheaters, and the epidemic reached such epic proportions that the game’s biggest streamers were turned off, with many players diverting their attention to the game’s ‘offline’ PvE offering.</p>



<p>This month, Tarkov’s viewer counts on Twitch hit their lowest point since the summer of 2019, when the game underwent a monumental boom on streaming and content platforms.</p>



<p>Regardless, Escape from Tarkov will undergo a sizeable upshift in the coming days as the next Tarkov wipe hits and countless players come back to the extraction shooter in droves. It’ll hit the top spots in the charts on streaming sites, and once again, players will start their stories in Tarkov, tackling those pesky early-game tasks.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Tomorrow, December 26, at 7:00 AM GMT / 2:00 AM EST we are planning to install patches 0.16.0.0 for </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EscapefromTarkov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#EscapefromTarkov</a><span> and 0.2.5.0 for </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TarkovArena" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#TarkovArena</a><span>.

<p>When Tarkov wipes tomorrow, it’ll bring about the 0.16.0.0 update, which introduces changes to Customs and adds in several new weapons, amongst other things. Battlestate is also tweaking the game’s weapon recoil mechanics, making some major visual adjustments.</p>



<p>It’s also expected that the Unity 2022 upgrade will be wrapped up in this patch.</p>

<p>It’s that time of the year when you finally treat yourself or someone takes pity on you and buys you that one piece of tech you’ve been eyeing all year. For many, that’s the Steam Deck. If you woke up and unboxed a Steam Deck, well, congratulations! But here are a few of the games you should check out first on your new PC handheld!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-games-on-steam-deck-for-new-owners">The Best Games on Steam Deck for New Owners</h2>



<p>The list of available titles for the Steam Deck grows seemingly daily, with new game releases and old titles finally receiving verification. Before long, everything will be playable on the handheld. But for now, you must still pick and choose, though it’s from an absolutely astounding library of games. Here are just a handful of what you can expect to enjoy on your new Steam Deck:</p>



<h3 id="h-balatro">Balatro</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>I think Tom would be rather upset with me if I didn’t mention Balatro. But more so than that, it’s an incredible roguelike deckbuilder with innovative gameplay, that borderline enthralling one-more-turn style of gameplay we love, and quite accessible mechanics that warrant a playthrough or ten. Oh, and don’t worry if you don’t know poker because Balatro is so simple to grasp!</p>



<h3 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h3>

<p>I’m not ashamed to admit that Stardew Valley is one of my all-time favorite titles to date. I used to play a ton of Harvest Moon, and then I graduated to Stardew on release day and never looked back. I’ve spent nearly 300 hours playing the indie farming simulator on Steam Deck alone, as it’s such a simple game to pick up and play with the handheld. It runs smoothly, the battery life is excellent, and the game functions better with a controller than with a mouse and keyboard, in my opinion.</p>



<h3 id="h-baldur-s-gate-3">Baldur’s Gate 3</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Don’t expect to play Baldur’s Gate 3 on Steam Deck for extended periods, as the massive role-playing game will burn through the handheld battery quickly. That said, the turn-based combat and easy maneuverability of the game work splendidly on the handheld controls of the Deck. If you want a game that will suck up countless hours of your free time without leaving the couch, Baldur’s Gate 3 is the go-to choice for many.</p>







<h3 id="h-hades-or-hades-2">Hades (Or Hades 2!)</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>I was initially unsure about Hades, as I was still relatively new to the roguelike genre upon its release. However, after too many recommendations, I gave it a shot and immediately fell in love. It’s a challenging yet satisfying action hack-and-slash in which you’ll power up your abilities and move over time, delving further into the Underworld as you go. It functions perfectly on Steam Deck, and the bite-size maps allow you to play on your own time.</p>



<h3 id="h-cult-of-the-lamb">Cult of the Lamb</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cult of the Lamb was my Game of the Year in 2022, and an absolute surprise that I wasn’t sure I’d enjoy until my wife bought it for me as an early birthday present. Well, I was hooked. I immediately sunk 50 hours into a single playthrough, and then I did it again on PC. Then, I started playing on Steam Deck and wound up with another four complete playthroughs on the handheld. It runs well and has impressive battery life. But the technical stuff, while fun, is only a small part of the experience. You can run a cult, build your base, and venture into the wilds with powerful weapons and spells!</p>
