<p>PlayStation has revealed the release date for Marvel’s Wolverine, and it arrives on September 15, 2026. </p>



<p>Marvel’s Wolverine is a highly anticipated game that players have been eagerly awaiting ever since the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-leaked-wolverine-clips-show-off-gameplay-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insomniac leaks</a>. The excitement grew even more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-gets-new-trailer-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when a brand-new trailer</a> was released in September 2025. Since then, fans have been waiting for one key piece of information: the release date. Fortunately, the developers have now provided that information as well.</p>

<p>Just a few months after Insomniac Games doubled down on the Fall 2026 release window for Marvel’s Wolverine, they finally have a release date. <span>A new post by the PlayStation account on&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/2026341407804330261" target="_blank">X</a>&nbsp;(formerly Twitter) reveals that Insomniac’s next superhero adventure is slated for September 15, 2026. Interested readers can wishlist the game now.</span> </p>

<p>Although not many narrative details about the game have been revealed, we have some insight into its plot. Wolverine is on a quest to uncover the mysteries of his past, willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goal. His journey is marked by brutal claw combat, intense rage, and unwavering determination, all aimed at discovering the truth about the man he once was. The game explores Logan’s darker, more brutal take on heroism, which is much different from Insomniac’s past games.</p>



<p>The gameplay videos have already showcased the fast and ferocious combat players can expect from the game. We also know about iconic Marvel characters who can be friends or foes; Mystique and Omega Red have been revealed so far. Additionally, the new adventure takes players around the world, allowing them to explore the island nation of Madripoor, the icy wilderness of Canada, and the bustling city streets of Tokyo.</p>
