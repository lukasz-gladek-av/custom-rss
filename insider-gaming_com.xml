<p>Activision has revealed the evolution of Verdansk, which was first released in March 2020 as the first Call of Duty: Warzone map. It‚Äôs coming back in just a few days, and fans are excited‚Ä¶ Mostly.</p>



<p>In a new video published online, Activision‚Äôs teams uncovered everything that went into creating Verdansk all over again, breaking down the technical upgrades made to make it feel like an all-new game while retaining the classic feel of Warzone. Of course, the game will use the new movement engine, so that won‚Äôt feel the same as it did five years ago.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-s-new-about-verdansk-2025">What‚Äôs New About Verdansk 2025?</h2>



<p>Verdansk has been rebuilt for 2025, five years after it first surfaced.</p>



<p>The team has upgraded the technology powering Verdansk in Warzone. It has better quality overall and better rendering, and things like grass, foliage, mud, and water are more accurate, realistic, and have better physics.</p>



<div><article><p><span>The map that started it all, rebuilt from the ground up üí•

Take a deep dive with </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BeenoxTeam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@BeenoxTeam</a><span> at this first look at Verdansk ‚Äì returning April 3 ü™Ç </span></p></article></div>







<p>Lighting has had a boost as well, with the global lighting ambience undergoing several changes. The team has added a new high-resolution sky box, upgraded bounces, light-map quality, and better transitions between interiors and exteriors. Shadows, backlighting, and indoor lighting have all undergone substantial enhancements.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-studio-is-making-verdansk-2025">Which Studio Is Making Verdansk 2025?</h2>



<p>It was noted that Beenox, Raven, and High Moon Studios all worked collaboratively on Verdansk 2025, bringing together the ‚Äòbest technology available today‚Äô to ensure the map is ‚Äòbetter than ever‚Äô. At the same time, it was stressed that it remains ‚Äòfaithful‚Äô to Infinity Ward‚Äôs 2020 creation which changed the face of the battle royale genre forever.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-verdansk-come-back-to-warzone">When Does Verdansk Come Back to Warzone?</h2>



<p>The Verdansk release date will arrive with Season 03 on April 3, 2025. It‚Äôs almost five years to the day since Warzone first launched, when COVID-19 was driving millions of people into their homes and onto Call of Duty.</p>



<p>It was a different world back then, and Warzone would come to make content creators overnight sensations and turn average gamers into battle royale beasts with the hottest meta weapons on the block. I have fond memories of Verdansk, but it helps that I had a great crew to play with and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-vibes-warzone/">the vibes were immense</a>.</p>



<p>All that‚Äôs left now is to kick off your Verdansk countdown and start deciding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-tac-map-reveal-pois/">where you‚Äôll land</a> when the map comes back to Warzone on April 3.</p>

<p>Pocketpair will consider releasing Palworld for the Nintendo Switch 2 if the console is ‚Äòbeefy enough‚Äô.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-is-palworld-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">Is Palworld Coming to Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p>Pocketpair communications director John ‚ÄòBucky‚Äô Buckley spoke about Palworld on the Nintendo Switch 2 during an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> at GDC San Fransisco. Bucky first talked about the console‚Äôs specs, stating that he has been ‚Äúwalking around GDC‚Äù, hoping that someone will reveal Switch 2‚Äôs specs to him. However, everyone he has interacted with has said, ‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt even seen them‚Äù. He stated they couldn‚Äôt make the game for the original Switch as Palworld is ‚Äúa beefy game‚Äù.</p>



<p>Bucky added that Palworld on Nintendo Switch 2 is ‚Äú100% worth considering‚Äù, provided the console is ‚Äúbeefy enough.‚Äù The developers already have experience with handheld optimisations with their release on the Steam Deck and are ‚Äúhappy with how it turned out‚Äù, even though there‚Äôs still some work to do. Pocketpair would like to get Palworld ‚Äúon more handhelds if possible.‚Äù</p>



<p>At the same time, Nintendo‚Äôs patent infringement lawsuit against Palworld continues, with recent updates stating that the former has received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new patent</a> that might help their case. Pocketpair recently spoke about the lawsuit, saying it ‚Äú<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-devs-were-shocked-by-nintendos-patent-infringement-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came as a shock</a>‚Äù for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pocketpair publishing has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-publishing-warn-not-more-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warned players</a> not to expect ‚Äòmore Palworld‚Äô. Also, the game recently released its much-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworlds-cross-play-update-is-now-available-on-all-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cross-play update</a>. What are your thoughts on Palworld releasing for the Switch 2?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
