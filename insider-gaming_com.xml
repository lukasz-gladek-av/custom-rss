<p>Ubisoft has announced that its new operating model features 5 Creative Houses, supported by a Creative Network. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Ubisoft has just announced a major restructure to the organization, with the new model focusing on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world adventures and GaaS-native experiences</a>. This has led to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of the Prince of Persia Remake</a> and several other titles. Moreover, several studios will be closed, and layoffs are expected across the company. Check out how the new model will function below. </p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-s-5-creative-houses-are-built-on-a-decentralized-model">Ubisoft’s 5 Creative Houses Are Built on a Decentralized Model </h2>



<p>As revealed in the latest <a href="http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, the new operating model for Ubisoft features 5 Creative Houses and will start from April 2026. It is supported by a Creative Network that will provide development resources, shared Core Services, and a reshaped HQ. The new decentralized model will lead to 3 significant changes: </p>



<ul>
<li>Firstly, the game development and go-to-market functions will be combined for a gamer-centric approach, and they will be fully responsible for brand development, content strategy, and editorial direction. </li>



<li>The new Creative Houses have been shaped by distinctive genres, which are led by “high-profile, incentivized teams with a unique set of expertise in those genres.”</li>



<li>Lastly, the teams will have full financial ownership and account for economic performance.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-s-creative-houses-have-been-divided-by-genre">Ubisoft’s Creative Houses Have Been Divided by Genre</h2>



<ul>
<li>The first Creative House is the newly formed Vantage Studios, which will work on Ubisoft’s largest established franchises, aiming to turn them into “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-assassins-far-cry-rainbow-six-billionare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual billionaire brands</a>“: Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. </li>



<li>Creative House 2 will focus on competitive and cooperative shooter experiences: The Division, Ghost Recon, and Splinter Cell. </li>



<li>The third Creative House will be centered around live experiences: For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla, and Skull &amp; Bones. </li>



<li>Creative House 4 will feature immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes: Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, and Beyond Good &amp; Evil. </li>



<li>The last and final Creative House will be dedicated to casual and family-friendly titles: Just Dance, Idle Miner Tycoon, Ketchapp, Hungry Shark, Invincible: Guarding the Globe, Uno, and Hasbro. </li>
</ul>



<p>On top of these, Ubisoft is working on 4 new IPs, including March of Giants. The division of these IPs across the Creative Houses will be revealed at a later stage. </p>

            <guid>1412188</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft published a document earlier today bursting with information regarding an ongoing restructuring effort at the titanic gaming company. This document included an outline of the new Creative Houses that have been established to drive forward the development of various categories of games.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the release also came with news of layoffs, cancellations, and delays. The Prince of Persia remake has been shut down, and according to a somewhat vague statement, the Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag remake has likely been delayed by <strong>up to a year</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-flag-to-remain-in-port-for-a-while">Black Flag To Remain in Port for a While</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag emerged in 2013 and is still widely considered one of the best games in franchise history. It plants players in the Caribbean at the height of the pirating buzz, giving them a ship, a crew, and a couple of assassins’ blades to boot. It remains unsurpassed in some areas, and the nature of the remake has been one of the most talked-about topics in gaming for years.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new release</a> published today by Ubisoft seems to contain critical information that fans who are waiting for the Black Flag remake will mourn:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In parallel, the Group will allocate additional development time to 7 games inorder to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation. This includes the unannounced title initially planned for FY26, that has been delayed to FY27.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From what we know, the Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag remake is the <strong>only game </strong>that fits that criteria. Information published exclusively by Insider Gaming last year stated that the project was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/">set to be released this March</a>, before the end of FY26. The game also remains unannounced, which further aligns it with the description above.</p>



<p>As the delay is pushing the game back to FY27, it could be <strong>up to a year </strong>before it surfaces. Of course, that also means it could be as early as May or June, depending on how long the pushback is. That detail hasn’t been established by Ubisoft or Vantage Studios.</p>



<p>This blow to Ubisoft fans is joined by the news that three new and unannounced IPs were also cancelled, alongside an unrevealed mobile game. It’s not a good time for Ubisoft, but this is fast becoming par for the company’s course.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has announced a major restructuring, with a new operating model centered on open-world adventures and GaaS-native experiences, supported by player-facing generative AI. </p>



<p>The news about Ubisoft’s organizational, operational, and portfolio reset was revealed, bringing bad news for fans. The restructuring has led to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of the highly anticipated Prince of Persia Remake</a>, along with five other games. Learn more about their new focus below.</p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-is-looking-to-create-a-more-gamer-centric-organization">Ubisoft is Looking to Create a ‘More Gamer-Centric’ Organization</h2>



<p>According to a recent <a href="http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a>, Ubisoft’s significant reset has been prompted by a more selective AAA market, increased competition in the shooter genre, and the challenges publishers face in creating brands amid rising costs. This has resulted in a new value-creation model designed to make Ubisoft “a more gamer-centric organization, structured around creative genres.”</p>



<p>The revamped Ubisoft model focuses on open-world adventures and a Games-as-a-Service (GaaS) approach, bolstered by targeted investments, deeper specialization, and cutting-edge technology. This advanced technology includes “accelerated investments in player-facing Generative AI.”</p>



<p>Yves Guillemot, the CEO, has announced that the company will shift its focus to a new three-year roadmap aimed at achieving cost reductions. As a result of this decision, several games will be canceled, multiple studios will be closed, and layoffs will occur throughout the organization.</p>







<p>In other news, Ubisoft wants Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six to become ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-assassins-far-cry-rainbow-six-billionare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual billionaire brands</a>‘. Additionally, the former Assassin’s Creed Boss is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-million-damages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suing the company</a>.

            <guid>1412179</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has canceled the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake.</p>



<p>The decision comes as the company has announced <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a major restructuring</a> for the company. It also means five other games were cancelled, including three new IPs and a mobile game. </p>







<p>Ubisoft says that the cancelations were a result of the games not meeting “the new enhanced quality as well as more selective portfolio prioritization criteria at Group level.”</p>



<h2 id="h-a-complete-ubisoft-restructure">A Complete Ubisoft Restructure</h2>



<p>The restructuring will see the company form five “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-to-staff-on-new-creative-houses-ubisoft-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creative houses</a>“, the first of which being the recently formed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-company-officially-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vantage Studios</a>. That studio oversees the Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises. </p>



<p>The other four creative houses will hold franchises like The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, Rayman, and others. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had reported</a> that the marketing plans for the game suggested a release in Mid-January. Even public company documents stated that the game was set to release by the end of the fiscal year.</p>



<p>The Sands of Time Remake was first announced in 2020, the game had an up and down development cycle. It was originally scheduled to release in January 2021 before being delayed to March 2021 in December 2020. Then, just a month before its March release, the game was delayed again to an unspecified date.</p>







<p>After that, Ubisoft went silent until it was announced that development was being moved to Ubisoft Montreal. When Ubisoft Montreal took over, development on the game&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was completely restarted</a>, which included a more ““realistic approach”. That included a graphical overall, new animations, and new mechanics for both combat and parkour.</p>



<p>In the announcement of the cancelation, the game’s developers said that although the game had potential, they never could reach the level of quality players deserved. Continuing the development, they said, <strong>“would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Prince of Persia as a universe and a legacy continues to matter deeply to us, and this decision does not mean we’re stepping away from the franchise,”</strong> the team said.</p>
