<p>It’s Wednesday, but don’t let a little midweek madness stop you from continuing your NYT Connections streak with another successful puzzle. I’ve got the hints and solutions you need to get through today’s puzzle as quickly as possible. Don’t forget to leave a comment or join the Insider Gaming Discord server to let us know how your streak is going!</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections hints you need today! </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-22">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 22)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #864:</p>



<ul>
<li>FASHION</li>



<li>WRITER</li>



<li>PASTA</li>



<li>SHAPE</li>

<li>WATER</li>



<li>GAS</li>



<li>CARPENTER</li>



<li>ELECTRIC</li>



<li>MOLD</li>



<li>TELEPHONE</li>



<li>CAT</li>



<li>RIGHT</li>



<li>ARMY</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>What keeps your home humming?</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Custom-made or cleverly reshaped</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Tiny workers with big titles</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Duplication in all its quirky forms</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 22.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Discovery Announces Sale Bid, Potentially Impacting Game Divisions]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-discovery-sale-potential-game-impact/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warner-bros-discovery-announces-sale-bid-potentially-impacting-game-divisions.1330480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery has announced it is officially up for sale, following the suspected breakdown of a deal between the firm and Paramount Global, which has dropped into the rearview. The news broke today that the board of directors at WBD has kick-started a ‘review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.’</p>



<p>In a press release, the firm revealed it had received ‘unsolicited interest from multiple parties for the entire company’. Earlier this year, Warner Bros. Games started <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-restructures-around-its-core-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a restructuring effort</a> to focus on core franchises including Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, Gme of Thrones, and the DC Universe, and if WBD <strong>is sold</strong>, those efforts will come into question.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-will-happen-if-warner-bros-discovery-is-sold">What Will Happen if Warner Bros. Discovery is Sold?</h2>



<p>If Warner Bros. Discovery is sold, the stock price will become volatile, content licensing deals and studio operations will be reshuffled, and brands might have their faces changed. This is all just as likely to impact Warner Bros. Discovery’s television and movie arms, such as HBO and Discovery+, as it is the <strong>gaming </strong>arms.</p>



<p>Under the Warner Bros. Discovery header sit multiple studios, all of which could be up in the air if a mega-sized corporation swoops in and buys the company. We could see studios shut down or split off, fragmented, or have their operations altered drastically.</p>



<p>This would be the natural course after the evaluation and review of spending, costs, and the portfolio under Warner Bros. Games.</p>



<p>Time and again, we’ve seen large companies swallowed up by <strong>even larger companies, </strong>and the action is almost always followed by project cancellations, layoffs, and studio shutdowns.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-potential-alternatives-maximize-shareholder-value" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> from Warner Bros. Discovery reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While&nbsp;Warner Bros. Discovery (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:&nbsp;WBD) continues to advance its previously announced separation of Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, its Board of Directors today announced it has initiated a review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, in light of unsolicited interest the Company has received from multiple parties for both the entire company and Warner Bros.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>This suggests the previously reported split has now evolved into an outright sale.</em></p>



<p>CEO and President, David Zaslav, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today’s evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally. We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward.</p>



<p>It’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market. After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think there will be drastic changes thrown into the mix if WBD is sold? What do you think this means for the studios under the WBD label? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
