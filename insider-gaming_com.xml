<p>The in-development remake of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion appears to be coming sooner than originally expected. This according to a new claim from known leaker Nate The Hate.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1899604247978840406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Nate The Hate said that he expects news on the remake to come either this month or in April.</p>



<p>“Release is likely to be sooner than the original June target,” he added. “But still working to get details on an updated release date.”</p>



<p>Previous rumors on the remake suggest that the game is in development at Virtuous Games and is being built in Unreal Engine 5. It’s also expected that the game will feature significant changes to the gameplay, including the blocking system. Earlier rumors suggest that the system will feature elements from the Dark Souls franchise. The games sneaking and stamina mechanics will also be updated for modern day.</p>



<p>It’s currently unknown what platforms the remake will release on. </p>

<p>The 3v3 tactical shooter Spectre Divide, the first game launched by Mountaintop Studios, will be taken offline within the next 30 days. Mountaintop Studios itself will close its doors at the end of this week.</p>



<h2 id="h-specter-divide-and-mountaintop-studios-to-shut-down">Specter Divide and Mountaintop Studios to Shut Down </h2>



<p>After its August 13th closed beta launch last year, Spectre Divide and Mountaintop Studios are shutting down just months later. In a letter from studio CEO Nate Mitchell, he <a href="https://x.com/SpectreDivide/status/1899943286158336111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a> the closure is attributed to a lack of “active players and incoming revenue to cover the day-to-day costs of Spectre and the studio.”</p>

<p>“Since the PC launch, we stretched our remaining capital as far as we could, but at this point, we’re out of funding to support the game,” Mitchell continued in his letter. “This means Mountaintop will be closing its doors at the end of the week.” Mitchell said that the team considered all options, including a new publisher, additional investment, and even a possible acquisition. In-game purchasing will be disabled and purchased made since the season one launch will be refunded.</p>



<p>During Spectre Divide’s first week, it attracted roughly 400,000 total players, and hit a concurrent player peak of over 30,000 in September. In contrast to traditional tactical shooters, Spectre Divide stood out with a Spectre clone that players could switch between. But the game fell off dramatically in just a matter of months, never cracking over 4,000 players since that peak. It saw a very small spike in returning players in February with a new season launch, but still fell short of desired player numbers.</p>
