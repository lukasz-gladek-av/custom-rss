<p>Black Ops 7 Vault Edition is the most premium way to experience and enjoy the newest Call of Duty release. We’ve got answers to all the crucial questions regarding its price, where and how to buy, and what you’re getting for your hard-earned dollars.</p>



<p>Treyarch is back with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. It represents the second year in a row where we’ve gotten a Black Ops release. Everyone’s looking forward to no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-skill-based-matchmaking-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skill-based matchmaking</a>, and there’s an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extensive roadmap of season one content</a> already announced.</p>



<p>If you’re already buying the new Call of Duty title, you should consider whether BLOPS 7’s Vault Edition is right for you.</p>

<p><strong>Black Ops 7’s most expensive version—the Vault Edition—costs $99.99 or £99.99.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve bought or seen previous Vault Editions, you’ll be somewhat pleased to see there’s no price increase. That said, it’s still a hefty wad of bills required to buy the priciest Call of Duty edition.</p>



<p>Should the cross-gen edition not meet your criteria, consider spending a bit more for the Vault Edition. Read on for reasons why you should consider doing this.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-black-ops-7-vault-edition">Everything Included In Black Ops 7 Vault Edition</h2>

<p><strong>The Vault Edition comes with a plethora of bonuses from the BlackCell Pass to new Skins, Mastercrafts, and Unlock Tokens in Black Ops 7.</strong></p>



<p>We’ve seen Ultimate Editions that don’t really justify their price tag. To be fair, Black Ops 7’s Vault Edition does come loaded with handy consumables and longevity benefits that reward you for playing the game.</p>



<p>Let’s check out the full extent of Vault Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>4 Operator Skins:
<ul>
<li>Harper</li>



<li>Karma</li>



<li>Reaper EWR-3</li>



<li>T.E.D.D.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>5 Mastercraft Weapons</li>



<li>8 Ultra Rarity GobbleGums</li>



<li>BlackCell Season One Battle Pass:
<ul>
<li>20 Tier Skips</li>



<li>1,100 CP</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Cross-Gen Bundle (PS4 &amp; PS5)</li>



<li>Mastercraft Collection</li>



<li>Operator Collection</li>



<li>Permanent Black Ops 7 Unlock Token</li>



<li>Ultra GobbleGum Pack for Zombies</li>
</ul>



<p>We said it didn’t skimp on the special items! You’re covered across Zombies and online multiplayer with a variety of one-time consumables. </p>



<p>Plus, while BLOPS 7 is cutting down on the over-the-top content and skins, you’ve still got some mindbending Mastercrafts to look forward to through the Vault Edition.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-black-ops-7-vault-edition">How to Get Black Ops 7 Vault Edition</h2>



<p><strong>The best way to get the Vault Edition is by accessing the platform of your choice through the Black Ops 7 site and pre-ordering it before launch to ensure you’ve got your copy locked in.</strong></p>



<p>Again, let’s cut the chatter for now, and let you know the best way to approach this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/gb/en/store/games/blackops7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 official website</a>.</li>



<li>Click <strong>Pre-Order Black Ops 7 </strong>in the top-right corner of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down, and make sure <strong>Vault Edition</strong> is selected.</li>



<li>Choose one of the five platforms available:
<ul>
<li>Xbox</li>



<li>Xbox PC</li>



<li>PlayStation</li>



<li>Battle.net</li>



<li>Steam</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>



<p>Note: The Vault Edition is a <strong>digital-only</strong> purchase. If you like your physical media, you’re out of luck with the Vault Edition.</p>
