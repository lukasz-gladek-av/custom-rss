<p>Schedule 1’s Community Vote 2 is now live, and players can choose between Hireable Drivers, Fishing, and Shrooms for the next major update. </p>



<p>Schedule 1 developers are building the game for the community, hosting new community votes for every upcoming major update. In the last vote, players had the option to choose between Rival Cartels, Police Expansion, and Shrooms, and after the voting period was over, the update finally arrived in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1s-new-beta-update-adds-a-rival-cartel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 2025</a>. Now, a second round of voting has begun for new features in Schedule 1. </p>







<p>From <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546744790793847544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">today</a>, September 1, to the upcoming weekend, Schedule 1 players will be able to participate in Community Vote 2 through the game’s main menu. The results will be announced shortly after the voting period is over, and they will also be displayed in the main menu. </p>



<h4 id="h-shrooms-return">Shrooms Return </h4>



<p>The new community vote brings back Shrooms as an option. This feature will allow players to manufacture and distribute a new drug type, Magic Mushrooms. The update will feature the “funky new drug”, unique equipment, new effects, and a new supplier. </p>



<h4 id="h-fishing-minigame">Fishing Minigame</h4>



<p>One of the newer options in the community vote is Fishing, which will introduce a fishing minigame. If this option wins the vote, players will be able to “reel in fish (and maybe some other&nbsp;<em>special</em>&nbsp;items)” that can be sold at Randy’s Bait &amp; Tackle. Moreover, the update will introduce new ingredients and effects. </p>



<h4 id="h-hireable-drivers">Hireable Drivers</h4>



<p>Lastly, we have a feature focused on convenience in Schedule 1’s community vote, specifically for hireable drivers. If this feature wins the vote, players will be able to transport items between their properties, businesses, and dealers. Moreover, players can designate automatic transit routes and specify the required conditions (e.g., number of items in the vehicle) for a route to begin. The update will also bring some QOL improvements to the delivery system.</p>



<p>In other news, we are yet to hear more about Schedule 1’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console port</a> since the update in April 2025. Which feature will you be voting for in Schedule 1’s community vote 2? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/two-new-amd-ryzen-cpus-spotted-at-online-retailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/two-new-amd-ryzen-cpus-spotted-at-online-retailer.1285800/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It looks like AMD is getting ready to add two CPUs to its current-gen Ryzen lineup. Spotted at an online retailer, the AMD Ryzen 5 9500F and Ryzen 7 9700F are new processors seemingly launching in the coming weeks or months.</p>



<p>Both are Granite Ridge CPUs for the AM5 socket, meaning that they will work with current AM5-compatible motherboards.</p>



<p>While full details on the new CPUs aren’t yet known, some specifications have surfaced. According to online listings, the Ryzen 5 9500F is <a href="https://www.shopblt.com/item/amd-100-000001406-ryzen-5-9500f-6/amd_100000001406.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">expected to feature</a> <strong>6 cores and 12 threads</strong>, with a maximum clock speed of 5.0 GHz. It will reportedly include <strong>38MB of cache</strong> and a <strong>65W TDP</strong>.</p>



<p>The Ryzen 7 9700F, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.shopblt.com/item/amd-100-000001902-ryzen-7-9700f-8/amd_100000001902.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">is listed</a> as an <strong>8-core, 12-thread CPU</strong> with a <strong>65W TDP</strong>. Neither processor will include integrated graphics, as indicated by the “F” designation.</p>



<h6 id="h-more-pc-parts-nvidia-cuts-prices-of-rtx-50-series-gpus-in-europe">More PC Parts: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-cuts-prices-of-rtx-50-series-gpus-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nvidia Cuts Prices Of RTX 50-Series GPUs In Europe</a></h6>



<p>As far as pricing goes, that remains up in the air. Shop BLT has the AMD Ryzen 5 9500F lists for $217 while the Ryzen 7 9700F is priced at $294. That said, with the state of the market and changes happening, seemingly, daily, no pricing information can be viewed as certain.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that while these retail listings may be accurate, the specifications are not confirmed. Until AMD provides official details, all of this information should be taken with a grain of salt. As of publishing, AMD has no events scheduled to announce its new processors.</p>



<p>AMD hasn’t responded to requests for comment on the new CPUs or when consumers can expect to see them released. Should a response come in, this article will be updated.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rocksteady-hires-former-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-director-for-same-role.1285779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rocksteady is looking at the head of a popular franchise to guide its next game into the future. According to his personal <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bill-money-1583b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn profile</a>, Bill Money has been working as game director at Rocksteady Studios since July 2025.</p>



<p>He joins the studio after spending 10 years at Ubisoft Singapore in the same role. </p>



<p>During his time with Ubisoft, Money led Assassin’s Creed Mirage, Valhalla, it’s Siege of Paris DLC, and Origins. Prior to Ubisoft, he was a creative director at Darkside Game Studios and a design director at WB Games Montreal. At WB Games, Money worked on Batman: Arkham Origins.</p>



<p>While it hasn’t been confirmed what game Money will be directing, it’s believed to be the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-working-on-new-batman-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio’s next Batman game</a>. Rocksteady hasn’t released a mainline Batman game since 2015’s Batman: Arkham Knight. Since then, they released Batman: Arkham VR for PC and PS4 in 2016 and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League in 2023. </p>



<p>Earlier this year the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-suffers-more-layoffs-as-suicide-squad-support-winds-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off an unknown number</a> of staff as support for Suicide Squad wrapped up.</p>



<p>As far as Batman is concerned, Warner Bros. has gone on the record multiple times stating that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was going to focus on its biggest IPs</a> moving forward. The next Batman game, whenever that comes, isn’t the only Batman title coming, either. LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025</a>, and is expected to release sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>What do you think the future of Batman games holds, and do you think Money is a good choice to lead the next game as director at Rocksteady? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>New details about the 2022 Saints Row reboot have surfaced online, suggesting that the game was originally intended to be a sequel to Saints Row: The Third. </p>



<p>For those unaware, a Saints Row reboot was released in 2022, developed by Volition and published by Deep Silver. The game featured a brand-new story and characters, featuring a crime-based adventure in Santo Ileso. However, fans of the series were not happy with this direction, with many expressing disappointment over the shift in tone and the narrative’s lack of substance. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-the-2022-saints-row-reboot-could-have-been">What the 2022 Saints Row Reboot Could Have Been</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The details about the Saints Row reboot originally being a sequel come from mrsaintsgodzilla21’s video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZfzp0NrM4Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> (via Synth Potato on <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1962204453500551604" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>). In this video, the creator discusses their 2019 visit to Volition’s development studio, highlighting every detail, story point, or other aspect that was cut or changed during the transition from a sequel to a reboot. The game was to be called ‘Saints Row Cinco” and would arrive as a direct sequel to Saints Row: The Third. </p>



<p>To make the Saints Row sequel a possibility, they would have to retcon all events from Saints Row 4 and even negate Johnny Gat’s death in the third installment. So, instead of an alien invasion, the Saints, along with The Boss, would have to exit Steelport and establish a new base in Santo Ileso. The sequel would have also featured all the Original Saint Members as the main characters in the sequel. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers intended to make this a fan service game, checking off all the things they had requested over the years. The Saints Row sequel would follow a 20/80 rule for its tone, where 20% of it would be inspired by Saints Row 3 and 80% by Saints Row 2. There was also a secret mission in the game, where players would have the chance to confront and kill Dex. The Saints Row sequel was so far in development that Pierce’s actor had recorded some of the lines for it, too. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-things-started-to-change">When Things Started to Change</h2>



<p>Things reportedly changed as soon as THQ Nordic acquired Deep Silver, with the former outright rejecting the sequel idea and forcing Volition to go back to the drawing board. For the new story, heavy restrictions were placed on what the characters would be able to say, including swear words. Then, a new version of the reboot was pitched, which would have retained all the original Saints; however, that was rejected by THQ Nordic as well. </p>



<h2 id="h-other-features-that-could-have-been-a-part-of-the-saints-row-sequel">Other Features That Could Have Been a Part of the Saints Row Sequel </h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other cancelled and rejected features for the Saints Row sequel were also revealed. Ultor was going to return instead of the Marshals, with the Skill Tree being split into wealth, fame, and muscle branches. Body shields were also going to return, but Deep Silver rejected them for being “too violent.” Criminal Ventures would have allowed players to customize the entire city, choosing what businesses to place in the open world. </p>



<p>They also had a ‘proclamation’ system, which allowed players to instill laws in districts under their control. These laws would vary from setting dress codes to enacting standoffs as a method of resolving conflicts. The game was also bringing back Cribs and customisation, where players could customise cribs and the church and place items where they wished. You could also purchase furniture from the store, but these features were cut. </p>



<p>Moreover, cheats would have been unlocked during the endgame, requiring players to find and unlock a massive secret genki pyramid to make them available. Also, New Game+ was cut. There are a lot more details in mrsaintsgodzilla21’s video, which you can find embedded below. Readers should note that as these details do not come from an official source, they should treat it with caution. </p>

<p>Once you’re done with Borderlands 4’s main content, the roadmap shows us what’s coming later on. We can see what 2K has planned in terms of DLC and all the extra content coming to the looter shooter.</p>



<p>We’re seeing roadmaps announced in advance quite regularly. It gives you an incentive to invest in a game, as you know more content is arriving post-launch. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a> senses this, and it’s why 2K has gone early with a look at the game’s full roadmap of content arriving in 2025 and beyond.</p>



<p>If you want to see Borderlands 4’s roadmap and future plans, you’re in the right space, fellow Vault Hunter.</p>

<p><strong>2K has indicated that Borderlands 4’s roadmap includes free and paid DLC, new story content, fresh gear, skins, bosses, events, and much more.</strong></p>



<p>To make this more digestible, I’ve whipped up a quick table so you can see the individual additions to <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/en-GB/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, and if they’ll cost you anything.</p>

<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-roadmap-release-window-explained">Borderlands 4 Roadmap Release Window Explained</h2>



<p><strong>We’re not sure when the majority of this new Borderlands 4 content is coming, but the official roadmap indicates the Horrors of Kairos Seasonal Mini-Event begins in October.</strong></p>



<p>2K hasn’t revealed the dates of release windows for the majority of the announced roadmap content yet. ‘Horrors of Kairos’ will likely tie into the spooky and kooky nature of Halloween. I’d also say it’s a safe bet that we’ll get some kind of Christmas-themed Borderlands 4 seasonal event, too.</p>



<p>The Story Pack and Bounty Pack content—which come with upgraded Borderlands 4 editions—are currently TBA. However, I’d expect 2K to give us more insight closer to the game’s full launch.</p>
