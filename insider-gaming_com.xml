<p>Asus has announced its new lineup of monitors with a special ability to purify surrounding air. The lineup of new VU Air Ionizer monitors features three models: the 23.8-inch IPS panel Asus VU249HFI-W, the 27-inch IPS Asus VU279HFI-W, and the 34-inch VA Asus VU34WCIP-W.</p>



<p>These monitors feature a no-filter VU Air Ionizer that Asus says can “remove up to 90% of airborne dust in three hours” to remove various allergens and improve general indoor air quality. </p>

<p>“The ionizer has an effective coverage area of 1m³,&nbsp;purifying&nbsp;air throughout&nbsp;a&nbsp;workspace for comfortable productivity,” <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-vu-air-ionizer-monitors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Asus said</a>. “With no filters&nbsp;required, ASUS VU Air Ionizer series&nbsp;monitors&nbsp;seamlessly combine air purification and&nbsp;cutting-edge&nbsp;display technologies in one streamlined design.”</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Monitor</th><th>Size and Ratio</th><th>Resolution</th><th>Refresh Rate</th><th>Panel Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Asus VU249HFI-W</td><td>23.8-inch/16:9</td><td>1920×1080</td><td>100Hz VRR</td><td>IPS</td></tr><tr><td>Asus VU279HFI-W</td><td>27-inch/16:9</td><td>1920×1080</td><td>100Hz VRR</td><td>IPS</td></tr><tr><td>Asus VU34WCIP-W</td><td>34-inch/21:9</td><td>3440×1440</td><td>100Hz VRR</td><td>Vertical Alignment</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As far as specs are concerned, each monitor—no matter the size—has a 100Hz refresh rate with a 1ms response time. Both the 23.8- and 27-inch displays have an IPS (In-Plane Switching) panel with 178° viewing angles. The 34-inch monitor is a 21:9 ultrawide VA (Vertical Alignment) panel with the same 178° viewing angles. The two 16:9 displays have a brightness of 250 nits while the 21:9 Ultrawide has a brightness of 300 nits. </p>



<p>For pricing, the 23.8-inch starts at $129.99 while the 27-inch display will cost $159.99. If you decide you want the Ultrawide air purifier, it will cost $359.99.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for your next fix of horror and hilarity, REPO might be what you need. The valuable-extraction title blends comedy and claustrophobic scares, and tackling it with more players is necessary if you want to sleep better.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lethal-company-coming-fortnite-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lethal Company</a> came along in late 2023 to stun the indie gaming community. It racked up a peak of nearly 250,000 players on Steam, and it still attracts thousands of players each month. Imitators have come and gone, trying to replicate its meteoric success, but REPO might be the one to crack the case.</p>



<p>It’s also an online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op game</a> where you need to “Locate valuable, fully physics-based objects and handle them with care,” according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, and if you have a lot of friends, you might be pleased at how many people can join up and play REPO at any one time.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-people-can-play-repo-in-online-co-op">How Many People Can Play REPO in Online Co-op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>My face when the McDonald’s milkshake machine works. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Up to 6 players can team up and play REPO together in a party.</strong></p>



<p>This gives REPO a slight edge over Lethal Company’s four-player squads. It also means even more chaos and calamity can ensue. </p>



<p>One of the biggest differences about REPO is keeping the cargo safe. Dropping the valuables or bringing any harm to them will decrease their value. This reduces your earnings, and disappoints your creator greatly.</p>



<p>Given that you need to use voice chat to communicate with your allies and negotiate obstacles, enemies, and other ungodly hazards, having more teammates could go either way for your survival chances!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-repo-solo">Can You Play REPO Solo?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, you can play REPO solo, but if you’re not privy to the game’s contents, you’ll understand why that’s a bad idea.</strong></p>



<p>Teamwork is <em>key </em>in REPO. Again, the more players with you, the faster you’ll find loot, and the more decoys and human shields you have to take the brunt of enemy attacks—grim, but true. Solo survival in REPO is extremely difficult, and even the game’s official description suggests you should: “<strong>Use teamwork to make sure that the precious cargo will safely reach its destination</strong>.”</p>



<p>REPO may get tweaked to be more accommodating to solo players as time goes on. Conversely, REPO may get options to broaden the player pool for each lobby. We’ll update this guide if developer semiwork makes such changes.</p>



<hr>



<p>Indie horror games are a popular genre on Steam. REPO is a breakout hit already in 2025, so let us know if you get the chance to play it and what you think.</p>
