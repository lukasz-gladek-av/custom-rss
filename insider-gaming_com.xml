<p>After getting a new trailer during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play</a> on Wednesday, the launch roster for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has made its way online.</p>



<p>As first spotted by <a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/news/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds-to-have-largest-sonic-racer-roster-including-sage-will-have-sega-characters-r2817/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sonic Stadium</a>, the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds roster briefly appeared online before it was removed. The game will launch with 23 characters from the series’ history, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sonic </li>



<li>Knuckles</li>



<li>Tails </li>



<li>Shadow</li>



<li>Amy </li>



<li>Eggman/Robotnik</li>



<li>Metal Sonic</li>



<li>Jet</li>



<li>Wave </li>



<li>Storm</li>



<li>Rouge </li>



<li>E-123 Omega </li>



<li>Vector </li>



<li>Charmy </li>



<li>Espio </li>



<li>Blaze </li>



<li>Silver </li>



<li>Cream </li>



<li>Zavok </li>



<li>Zazz</li>



<li>Big</li>



<li>Egg Pawn</li>



<li>Sage</li>
</ul>



<p>Most, if not all, of the roster can be seen in the trailer that was released. But the 23 racers won’t be the only ones available for players. According to the <a href="https://x.com/sonicparadise/status/1889866065804665120?s=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a>—again, it was removed after likely appearing early—Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will see “a ton more” drivers added to the game from across Sega’s different franchises.</p>



<p>There will also be 24 “main tracks” with 15 CrossWorlds that require Travel Rings to go to. Players will have 45 “unique original vehicles” to choose from for their races with 23 different power ups available to help you win the race.</p>







<p>A release date for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds hasn’t been announced, but when it releases, the game will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</p>



<p><a href="https://asia.sega.com/SonicRacingCrossWorlds/en/ClosedNetworkTest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A closed network test</a> is currently scheduled for February 21-23.</p>

<p>Embracer held its Q3 FY2025 earnings call on Thursday, and with it came high praise from CEO Lars Wingefors for the recently released Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. As part of his <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q3-october-december-2024-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-1175-million-above-management-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">prepared remarks</a> for the call, Wingefors said that the game’s launch success is a  “reminder” to the company about creating “great products”.</p>



<p>“The success of&nbsp;Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;is a reminder of our core – to bring great products to the market,” the Embracer CEO said. “High-quality teams need to have the resources and the time to execute their visions.</p>



<p>“When you have right teams, this trust benefits everyone, including gamers, employees and shareholders. I am convinced that we will remain among the industry leaders in our core business verticals in the future.”</p>







<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is one of the more successful titles from Embracer in recent memory. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over a million copies</a> in its first day, and, according to the publisher, is “fast approaching 2 million”.</p>



<p>Developer Warhorse Studios recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its post-launch plans</a> for the game, including free updates such as horse racing and hardcore mode. There are also three planned expansions coming to the game over the next year. Lastly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modding-coming-to-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official mod support</a> was confirmed as coming in the near future.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s official review</a>, Grant Taylor-Hill called Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 a “masterpiece” that was tough to “find one major fault” with.</p>



<p>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is beautiful in every aspect,” he wrote. “It’s deeply authentic and riddled with emotion and catharsis, and the way the story comes together is just perfection.”</p>

The first level, Tick-Tock Shock, was an unreleased level only featured during the PlayStation XP Tournament Final in London, England, last month. Players can finally check out this exclusive level and the other four new ones through the brand-new Vicious Void Galaxy. Each of them will provide a new Special bot. Check out the schedule for the upcoming Astro Bot levels below:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Tick-Tock Shock: February 13</li>



<li>Thrust or Bust: February 20</li>



<li>Cock-A-Doodle-Doom: February 27</li>

<p>Team Asobi has informed players that Astro Bot’s new update will feature more challenging levels than the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-new-dlc-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Winter Wonder</a> update and will test their skills further. Once completed, the new levels can be replayed through the Time Attack Mode with online rankings. However, players must complete the main game to access the latest content. All new levels will be available every Thursday at 6:00 am PT, 2:00 pm GMT, and 10:00 pm JST.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, Astro Bot will also receive <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/13/astro-bot-five-new-levels-and-special-bots-begin-rolling-out-today/?sf276380355=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new PS5 Pro support</a> along with the new levels. Players on the mid-gen refresh console will experience an enhanced version of Astro Bot that features “constant best resolution while still running at 60 frames per second.”</p>
