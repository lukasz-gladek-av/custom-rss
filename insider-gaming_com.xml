            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed the imminent arrival of a new four-player, cooperative shooter from Bad Robot Games, the gaming division of JJ Abrams’ Bad Robot. The title is being directed by Mike Booth, best known for leading the charge on Left 4 Dead, one of the best games in the genre and a cult classic.</p>



<p>The game was revealed as being in development for PlayStation 5 and PC, and while details are scarce at present, more will be revealed soon.</p>







<h2 id="h-mike-booth-is-back-in-the-studio-and-cooking">Mike Booth is Back in the Studio and Cooking</h2>



<p>In September, we covered the news that Mike Booth, the creator and designer of Left 4 Dead, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/left-4-dead-coded-shooter-coming-from-game-creator/">was developing a new shooter</a> ‘built on the foundations of what made L4D special.’</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, and Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed a partnership with Bad Robot Games that will serve as the creative pathway for that game to come to life.</p>



<p>On Reddit, Booth wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m Mike Booth (creator of Left 4 Dead), and I’m excited to share that I’m working on a brand new project —a 4-player co-op shooter built on the foundations of what made L4D special.</p>



<p>If you enjoyed the teamwork, tension, and replayability of my past games, you’ll probably find this one interesting. It expands on the co-op formula in ways I’ve wanted to explore for a long time.</p>



<p>We’re still in the early stages of development, but we’re opening up playtests to a limited number of players. If you’re interested in joining us on this next adventure and helping shape the game early on, we’d love to have you involved.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2025/sie-partners-with-bad-robot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new press release</a> on the Sony Interactive site, it was explained by Anna Sweet, CEO of Bad Robot Games:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Partnering with Sony Interactive Entertainment allows us to bring our new IP to life, with an expansive vision for this new universe.</p>



<p>With the support of PlayStation, we hope to deliver a bold, innovative experience that is truly special for players. I could not be more excited that Mike Booth is at the creative helm, crafting a cooperative adventure that will lead to unforgettable moments with friends.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 remain two of the most beloved zombie shooters ever released. They’re still popular today and are being kept alive by an extensive modding community that never ceases to innovate and optimise the game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/banjo-kazooie-mumbomania-is-a-playstation-only-game-playable-in-dreams/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Moon Studios’ William Butkevicius has used their free time productively to create a whole new Banjo-Kazooie game for PlayStation owners on PS4 and PS5. It comes with a couple of minor caveats: It’s not an official Banjo-Kazooie game, and you need to own a copy of Dreams.</p>



<p>It boggles the mind that there hasn’t been a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/banjo-kazooie-co-creator-gregg-mayles-resigning-rare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banjo-Kazooie</a> game in nearly 20 years. 2008’s Nuts &amp; Bolts remains the final BK game to see the light of day, and if you’ve got a hankering for a new release, a talented developer might have you jumping around the room.</p>







<h2 id="h-a-new-banjo-kazooie-game-on-playstation-sort-of">A New Banjo-Kazooie Game On PlayStation, Sort Of</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It looks like the real thing. Credit to Eupholace</figcaption></figure>



<p>William Butkevicius is a level designer at Moon Studios. They’ve been working on No Rest for the Wicked, but their spare time has involved a lot of ‘Dreams,’ it seems.</p>







<p>The PlayStation-exclusive title is considered one of the most sophisticated content generation games in the world, and the freedom and control you have to create your own levels and games in Dreams is nearly endless.</p>



<p>Butkevicius posted to X on December 3 with a fun message: “Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania is out NOW on Dreams for PS4/PS5!”</p>



<p>If you need convincing, there’s even a 1-minute and 43-second trailer showing off the game. It does indeed look like a deep Banjo-Kazooie game, and it looks terrific by every metric!</p>



<p>The way Banjo looks, the movement and mechanics, all the way down to the music—performed by <a href="https://x.com/thegamebrass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@thegamebrass</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Again, this is only for PlayStation owners, and you need to have a working copy of Dreams to play it. If you meet this criteria, this might be the closest you’ll ever get to a new Banjo-Kazooie title.</p>



<p>Is it about time the series makes a triumphant comeback? Would it be amazing to see Rare back at the helm?

<p>Roblox is now banned in Russia as it has been accused of distributing extremist materials and “LGBT propaganda”. </p>



<p>The popular gaming platform, Roblox, has been in the news recently for its age-estimation features, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-age-estimation-feature-users-concerned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some users concerned</a> about the requirement for children to upload photos of themselves to its AI tool. Now, Roblox is in the news again, for being banned in a country, accused of distributing extremist materials. </p>







<h2 id="h-roblox-negatively-impacts-the-spiritual-and-moral-development-of-children">Roblox Negatively Impacts the “Spiritual and Moral Development of Children”</h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-access-us-childrens-gaming-platform-roblox-2025-12-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a> report (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-banned-russia-lgbtq-propaganda-child-safety-measures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), access to Roblox has been blocked in Russia, with the country’s communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, stating that the platform was “rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children.” Russia is not the only country to block access to Roblox; Turkey also banned the title earlier last year over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-gets-banned-in-turkey-over-concerns-of-child-exploitation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concerns of child exploitation</a>. </p>



<p>A Roblox spokesperson’s response is also included in the report. The spokesperson states that they “respect the local laws and regulations in countries” where Roblox operates, and they believe the platform provides “a positive space for learning, creation, and meaningful connection for everyone.” They added that the platform has “a deep commitment to safety, and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform.”</p>







<p>In other news, there was a ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-roblox-shutting-down-roblox-ban-2025-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hoax campaign</a>‘ on social media and content platforms earlier this year claiming that Roblox would shut down in 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>High on Life 2 has just received a brand new gameplay showcase, revealing early parts of the title’s campaign. </p>



<p>The sequel to the popular Squanch Games was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/high-one-life-2-revealed-at-xbox-showcase-with-release-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed earlier this year</a> during the Xbox Showcase at the Summer Game Fest, with a release date set for February 2026. What’s more, the game is set to release on PlayStation 5, along with Xbox Series X/S and PC at launch. Now, let’s check out the title’s early campaign gameplay below. </p>







<h2 id="h-high-on-life-2-campaign-gameplay-reveals-pinkline-harbor-hub">High On Life 2 Campaign Gameplay Reveals Pinkline Harbor Hub</h2>



<p>The new High on Life 2 campaign gameplay comes through a new video posted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vpw9qg_AaM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> on YouTube. It showcases Pinkline Harbor, one of the three in-game hubs players will encounter earlier in the game. The latest video starts with the player meeting two guards while holding the same guns we saw in the previous gameplay trailer. The conversation options differ depending on the weapons they have, with each gun providing a response that suits their personality. </p>



<p>We then see the player character explore the Pinkline Harbor, grinding some rails on their skateboard, even receiving a new one from one of their newly made allies. The video also includes a side mission in which the player saves one of the NPCs from drowning with their suction weapon. The player then proceeds to grind rails and jump across roofs in the city with their skateboard, taking down one of the wanted posters of them in the process. </p>



<p>The High On Life 2 campaign gameplay ends when the player reaches the destination for the primary mission, Pinkbellies Bar and Grill. However, to get this location, we see the player find and use two Lugblobs to open the door. Interested readers can check out the new trailer below: </p>

<p>If you thought the Skill-Based Matchmaking conversation was going anywhere, you might want to boil the kettle. Not only is Treyarch adamant about having SBMM, but Black Ops 7’s playlist options will now feature SBMM modes more prominently.</p>



<p>The letters ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sbmm-cod-creator-debunk-conspiracies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM</a>‘ will forever be synonymous with FPS games. Skill-based matchmaking plays a huge role in modern-day matchmaking, and there was a lot of interest around Black Ops 7 after Treyarch revealed that it would feature a greater emphasis on ‘Open Matchmaking.’</p>



<p>Slowly but surely, the developer might be backtracking.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-season-1-moving-standard-matchmaking-to-featured">Black Ops 7 Season 1 Moving Standard Matchmaking To Featured</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Was it always going to happen? Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since launch, the Standard Matchmaking playlist option—which emphasizes SBMM—has been a regular playlist option. This will change with Black Ops 7 Season 1.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-patch-notes-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 patch notes</a> have revealed some interesting notes on SBMM:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’ve continued to see increased engagement with Standard Moshpit, so we’ll be featuring it in the Featured tab for players who prefer an experience with more similarly skilled opponents. With the main tab changing to Featured, the other tab will now become Party Games, which will include Prop Hunt, Sharpshooter, One in the Chamber, and Gunfight at the launch of Season 01, as well as the debut of Sticks &amp; Stones and Gun Game in Week 2.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In layman’s terms, players are apparently playing modes that prioritize SBMM for matchmaking. This is more player engagement here; therefore, Treyarch is now rewarding this by adding Standard Moshpit to the featured playlist—making it a center-stage attraction.</p>



<p>There have been suggestions that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-findings-show-sbmm-might-not-be-as-open-as-advertised/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM might not be as open as advertised</a> in Black Ops 7. This ‘Featured’ move doesn’t necessarily support this theory, but it shows that SBMM is becoming prevalent in Call of Duty once again.</p>



<p>Is this Treyarch u-turning on the idea of moving Black Ops 7 more toward open matchmaking? If you have thoughts on this or SBMM in general, head to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> for more gaming conversations.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Death Ball monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Gems, Crystals, Cosmic Orbs and much more.</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of intense anime-style battles and the popular gym class game dodgeball, then you need to check out Death Ball immediately. Death Ball is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sols-rng-codes-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> dodgeball game where players use an energy ball instead of a traditional ball. This is done not by throwing the ball as would usually be the case, but by using various abilities and movement skills. Players must try to parry the ball in order to hit an opponent instead of trying to catch it, as each hit and change of direction increases the speed and power of the ball.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Players initially queue into a massive arena with multiple other players, where the main objective is to be the last player standing after all of the competitors have been eliminated. The game also tends to get harder and harder as it progresses into the latest stages, making things like timing, reactions and general positioning that much more important. With a variety of Champions to choose from, each with varied abilities, Death Ball can offer hours of entertainment. Stronger weapons and Champions can be unlocked using the in-game currencies, and one way to get more of them is by using the following Death Ball codes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Death Ball codes are usually released either through the game’s official Discord server or through the Roblox game page. However, tracking both of these regularly can be a hassle, and moreover, they never notify the players when any of the previously released codes expire. That’s why we recommend that all players keep this page bookmarked, as we update the article as soon as any new codes drop, while expired codes are also promptly removed from the active codes list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
