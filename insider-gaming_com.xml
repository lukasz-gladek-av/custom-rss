<p>No one ever thought the day would come when we would return to the bombed-out, decrepit remains of Raccoon City. Resident Evil Requiem gives everyone one more round, and if you’re ready to load the chamber again, find out when the Resident Evil Requiem release date is and expected release times.</p>



<p>There’s always a special vibe when a new Resi game is on the way. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> isn’t <em>just</em> a new game; it brings back Leon Kennedy for his first new outing since Resident Evil 6 (not counting the remakes). Throw in Grace Ashcroft, a lot of combat, puzzles, and the odd zombie, and you know you’re in for a good time.</p>

<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem has set a date with destiny for February 27, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>When Requiem was first announced, there were so many questions: How will Grace differ from Chris, Jill, Leon, and everyone that came before? Then, with RPD being sighted, we wondered if Leon was going to make one final bow.</p>

</ul>



<p>So much has been learned since Requiem first came to light. Once the February 27 release date was locked in, it immediately became a date for the diary. Whether you’re taking a mysterious sick day or you’ve booked it off, everyone will be there on launch day for the next chapter in the mainline timeline. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-9-release-times">Resident Evil 9 Release Times</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It could change. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to the PlayStation Store, Resident Evil Requiem launches at 9 PM PT.</strong></p>



<p>Companies generally only post release time sheets on social media a day or two before launch. Right now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a> has done no such thing for Requiem. On the plus side, the PlayStation Store is known for posting an early look at a game’s launch time.</p>



<p>However, it must be said that this isn’t 100% accurate. It could change, and if it does, check back in as the guide is updated with new information to reflect this.</p>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has revealed a new themed booster set centered around Gen 9, called Paldean Wonders. </p>



<p>Earlier today, Pokémon TCG Pocket developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-teases-focus-of-next-set/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> the upcoming set with a video featuring people in Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly costumes. Players speculated that it might be a tease for a new Gen 9 set, and they were right. Check out more details on the new announcement below: </p>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-paldean-wonders-set-arrives-next-week">Pokémon TCG Pocket Paldean Wonders Set Arrives Next Week</h2>



<p>A new post on the official Pokémon TCG Pocket X account (formerly Twitter) confirms the arrival of Paldean Wonders, a themed booster set that features Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The new booster pack will be available in the game from February 25 at 5 PM PST.</p>



<figure></figure>

            <guid>1440385</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox Game Pass has another Free Play Days campaign this weekend, and it features a whopping four games, one of which could probably do with the injection of players to bolster a waning count.</p>



<p>That’s right, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> is free to play this weekend <strong>if </strong>you’re a Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, or Essential subscriber. This revelation was unveiled by Electronic Arts this week, but thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1r8kyti/preofficial_free_play_days_battlefield_6_chip_n/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on Reddit</a>, we know the other three games joining the lineup are Chip ‘n Clawz: vs. The Brainioids, Polterguys: Possession Party, and Sunderfolk.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-battlefield-6-for-free-this-weekend">How to Play Battlefield 6 For Free This Weekend</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 is in a bit of a sticky spot. The player count is dropping, viewership is in the toilet, and even the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-fails-revive-new-season/">launch of the new season</a> two update didn’t do anything to revitalize the first-person shooter.</p>



<p>That’s why there’s probably a lot riding on Battlefield 6 being the headline for this new Free Play Days drop.</p>



<p>Users across the Ultimate, Premium, and Essential tiers can enjoy what’s believed to be an unlimited run through Battlefield 6’s multiplayer offering, from today, February 19, to Sunday, February 22.</p>



<p>That includes all maps, modes, weapons, classes, and everything else you might lump into that spread. Additionally, Battlefield 6 is <strong>on sale</strong>, just in case you want to dip a little deeper and keep playing after the Free Play Days Trial is up.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 was a very strong shooter at launch, but it has backslid a bit over the last few updates, disappointing the community more than once. It’s up to you how long you play it this weekend, but there’s no risk involved, so you might as well give it a shot.</p>



<p>To play Battlefield 6 <strong>for free</strong>, you’ll need to have an Xbox Game Pass subscription at the required tier, and then it’s simply a case of navigating to the game in the store or finding it via a dashboard tile that’s undoubtedly going to be present to promote Free Play Days.</p>







<p>Are you going to give Battlefield 6 a shot during Free Play Days? Let us know your plans on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does WWE 2K26 Have Early Access?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-early-access/</link>
            <guid>1440382</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Wrestlemania season is upon us in WWE, which means the launch of a new accompanying title, and in the modern world of gaming, it’s understandable to be wondering whether WWE 2K26 has early access.</p>



<p>Set to launch officially on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-release-date-exact-start-times/" id="177609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 13</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K26</a> is the latest entry in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/2k-sports/" id="1233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2K Sports</a>‘ long-running franchise, with CM Punk on the cover for the first time in a decade.</p>



<p>If you’re impatiently waiting for the release of WWE 2K26 and are wondering if there are ways to jump in early, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-wwe-2k26-through-early-access">Can You Play WWE 2K26 Through Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Earlybird. Image via 2K Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, WWE 2K26 is available to play through early access, allowing players to jump in up to a week ahead of the full release, but there are some major caveats.</strong></p>



<p>Early access to WWE 2K26 is provided only by purchasing one of the premium editions of the game, which provide other benefits, including all DLC access and MyFaction rewards. However, the prices of these editions are significantly higher than the standard edition of the game.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-dev-confident-fans-will-like-new-ringside-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K26 Dev Confident Fans Will Like New Ringside Pass</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The King of Kings edition, centered around Triple H, is priced at $99.99, while the Attitude Era edition costs $129.99. Finally, the Monday Night War Edition of WWE 2K26 costs a whopping $149.99, over double the price of the standard edition.</p>



<p>That means you need to splash out at least $99.99 to secure the early access bonus to WWE 2K26, and it’s up to you to weigh the cost of whether it is worthwhile.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-wwe-2k26-have-a-demo">Does WWE 2K26 Have A Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>No public demo has been announced for WWE 2K26, and based on the recent history of 2K Sports, it’s extremely unlikely a demo will be made available before launch.</strong></p>



<p>This means there is no way to play WWE 2K26 early, even in demo form, without splashing out to secure one of the premium editions. Additionally, unlike rivals EA Sports, 2K does not tend to offer trial periods for newly-released sports games.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>Free-play weekends for certain platforms are possible, following the free-play weekend of WWE 2K25 in August last year, but, again, this is not guaranteed.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wraith-ops-demo-live-steam-no-battle-pass/</link>
            <guid>1440307</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Wraith Ops, a developing first-person shooter from Grassrootz Games and publisher Team 17, has just launched a demo <strong>exclusively </strong>on Steam. The shooter, which is ‘all about gunplay and gameplay first’, has launched the new demo as part of Steam Next Fest, the event that pays tribute to upcoming, developing games across a range of genres.</p>



<p>While the demo is pretty short, it gives a glimpse of what Wraith Ops promises: pure, unadulterated gun-toting action. As the game’s blurb states, there are no immersion-breaking cosmetics, no gacha mechanics, and no ‘silly killstreaks’, all of which are said in a jab at games like Call of Duty.</p>







<h2 id="h-wraith-ops-isn-t-the-next-call-of-duty">Wraith Ops Isn’t The Next Call of Duty</h2>



<p>To say that Wraith Ops is anything like Call of Duty would earn you a scolding from the game’s developer. It’s stressed everywhere on the Steam page and the game’s social channels that it exists as the antithesis of Activision’s first-person shooter franchise, despite bearing similarities.</p>



<p>But then, how different can a first-person shooter truly be from what’s already on the market?</p>



<p>Steam Next Fest has welcomed a small demo for Wraith Ops, which includes a mode called Arena, a 6v6, one-life mode, made playable across three maps: Airfield, Mall, and Submarine. Since the Gamescom demo went live in August 2025, Grassrootz Games has implemented <strong>876 </strong>bug fixes and tweaks, ready for the rollout of this new demo.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Wraith Ops has been neck-deep in the development pipeline for a <strong>very </strong>long time. The game’s social channels <span>launched in 2019, and its&nbsp;<strong>original demo</strong>, under the name ‘Project Wraith’, was listed on Steam as far back as</span> August 2021.</p>







<p>Are you at all interested in giving Wraith Ops a try on Steam? Let us know what you think of the game on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Denshattack! is an arcadey, platforming, sports-based racer of sorts, infused with high-octane speed, a kickass soundtrack, visuals that rival any of your favorite animes, and it’s impossible to put down. Another way of describing it is an on-rails skateboarding game where trucks are replaced with trains—and occasionally Ferris wheels.</p>



<p>I could describe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/denshattack/" id="3613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Denshattack!</a> in any number of ways, and it wouldn’t encapsulate just how manic this game is. Conceptualizing this game had to be due to a concoction of energy drinks, arcade nostalgia, an anime binge, and trying to hit high scores on the recent Tony Hawk remakes. </p>



<p>In Denshattack!, developer Undercoder has created something equal parts beautiful, ambitious, and insanely tough to put down.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite games I’ve ever played feature bite-sized sections of the same gameplay where I <em>have</em> to replay them to better my last performance, to the point it feels like life or death: Think Hotline Miami or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gran-turismo/" id="1132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gran Turismo</a> license tests.</p>



<p>The OG <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tony-hawks-pro-skater/" id="1325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk</a> games are also quintessential examples with their time-limit-driven runs. Denshattack! grabs this idea by the horns and steams off into the distance with it. As Emi Araki, you take control of a train: A train that can kickflip, manual, grind, all the while firing along a track at what feels like a million miles an hour.</p>

</ul>



<p>2001’s forgotten Airblade—a blatant attempt to cash in on the Tony Hawks hype—didn’t do much to push the needle in the skating genre, whereas Skate did, and Denshattack! feels like the next step-up in creativity (with carriages). Five minutes after jumping into the tutorial level, I quickly realised that the game is as hard as it is pretty.</p>



<p>It has Jet Set Radio’s endearing art style, the Tony Hawks ‘one-more-run’ attitude, and Thumper’s necessity for swift reflexes and reactive thinking to oncoming obstacles, just without the aid of a beat.</p>

<p>The press demo I was treated to included a handful of the opening levels and a much more advanced Trick Park, usually only available later in the game. Oddly enough, I thought this was a smart decision as it gave me a glimpse into the myriad of other controls and gameplay functions sure to befuddle my brain further.</p>



<p>You need to mentally cycle through a variety of controls, quickly learn what each danger sign means, and what the applicable prompt is. Even after 10 minutes, I was jumping <em>over </em>corners, careening into disaster, honking my train horn when I was supposed to hopping over onto another track, and doing tricks when I was supposed to be plummeting my train straight down from 50ft in the air.</p>



<p>These might be the most durable vehicles ever created.</p>

<p>One thing that became immediately clear is that you will need multiple runs to fully complete each level, and that’s exactly what I did. Every level has collectibles, forcing you to find hidden routes, shortcuts, and play the level differently; you need to score points and rack up combos, complete it as fast as you can, and try not to crash.</p>



<p>Levels quickly descend into anarchy as your train screeches through a city one second, before mounting a Ferris wheel, engaging in a Crash Bandicoot-style running at the screen sequence, evading lava, and clearing huge gaps over ginormous Tiki heads. If the whole game is going to be like this, how could I not want to play more?</p>



<h2 id="h-denshattack-preview-round-up">Denshattack! Preview Round-Up</h2>



<p>After reading through my own preview, I realise I’ve said virtually nothing bad about Denshattack! There was the odd bug and abnormality, which I was forewarned would be an issue, as the game is still in development as it heads to a 2026 launch. However, my snippet of gameplay has resonated with me for days, and I can’t stop thinking about it.</p>



<p>Denshattack! is a genuine challenge, and it’s fun. Anything I did wrong was my fault, and I wanted to learn from my mistakes to post a better score, smash my previous best time, and complete all the mini-objectives. I’ve barely seen any of what the full game has to offer, and I can say with absolute certainty that Denshattack! needs to be on your wishlist right now.</p>
