<p>Helldivers 2’s next Premium Warbond, Python Commandos, drops on December 2, 2025; introducing a minigun, new weapons, stratagems, and more. </p>



<p>Premium Warbonds is the paid battle pass system in Helldivers 2, which provides players with exclusive content, including cosmetics, weapons, and more. A few months ago, we received the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST</a> Legendary Warbond, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dust Devils</a> followed it next. Now, the next Premium Warbond has been announced, adding a highly requested weapon to the game: a minigun. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-weapons-and-stratagems">Helldivers 2 Python Commandos Premium Warbond Weapons and Stratagems </h2>



<p>Revealed through the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Helldivers 2 is getting one new weapon and three new stratagems thanks to the Python Commandos Premium Warbond. First up is the M-1000 Maxigun, a new minigun that has an ultra-high ammo capacity. Next up is the AX/FLAM-75 “Guard Dog” Hot Dog, which is a drone equipped with a flamethrower. It follows the player and coats their enemies with the fires of freedom. </p>



<p>Next up is another stratagem: the CQC-9 Defoliation Tool, essentially a chainsaw that can cut through trees and enemies. Last, we have the AR/GL-21 One-Two, which is a combination assault rifle and grenade launcher. It is a heavy weapon, but it deals heavy damage too, and basically puts two weapons in your primary slot. </p>



<h2 id="h-new-armors-and-capes">New Armors and Capes</h2>



<p>Let’s look at Helldivers 2: Python Commandos’ armors and capes; there are two new items in each category. The first armour is the RS-20 Constrictor light armor set, “the official uniform for the League of Patriotic Arm Wrestlers.” Next is RS-40 Best of Prey: “a heavy armor set patterned after legendary Helldiver, Ronald Mambo and his famously powerful and burly physique.” Both armours come equipped with Rock Solid passive, which makes the player more resistant to staggering and ragdolling attacks. </p>



<p>There are two new capes and coordinating player cards: Foe Rent Asunder, which is pre-tattered to give a battle-worn appearance, and Mark of the Constrictor, for Helldivers who strangle out any anti-democratic behavior they encounter.</p>



<h2 id="h-emotes-and-patterns">Emotes and Patterns</h2>



<p>Helldivers 2 Python Commandos Premium Warbond will add the Front-Leaning Rest Position emote, allowing players to “drop and give ‘em 20 anytime.” A new Chameleon Camo Pattern will also be included for FRV, Exosuit, Hellpod, and Shuttle.</p>
