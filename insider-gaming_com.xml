<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is giving free access to its Multiplayer and Zombies starting October 28th. Coincidentally, Battlefield 6 <span>begins its first season, which introduces its Battle Royale mode&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6s-new-battle-royale-mode/" target="_blank">REDSEC</a>, on the same day</span>.</p>



<p>With Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 releasing on November 14th, many players are looking forward to what’s in store for the new entry. While beta turnout was quite low, its predecessor, Black Ops 6, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received quite well</a> by fans and critics. However, the FPS throne seems to have been taken by Battlefield 6 this year, with its incredible graphics and fun gameplay. You’d think Activision would let Battlefield revel in it for a bit. Well, it turns out it wants to cause some competition.</p>

<p>A post from <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1982928103417753961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty’s Twitter/X account</a> confirms that Black Ops 6’s Multiplayer and Zombies are going free-to-play from October 28th to November 3rd. The trial will include all of the maps, including a few new ones like Gravity and Mothball. The Halloween event, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-the-haunting-2025-unveiled-poster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Haunting</a>, will also be available, which brings iconic killers like Jason and Predator to the fray. Unfortunately, the campaign is not free, but can be played with Xbox Game Pass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we’ve mentioned before, October 28th is also the day Battlefield 6 launches Season One. The event will bring new weapons and maps to enjoy. However, the biggest addition is REDSEC, the game’s Battle Royale mode. The mode is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-start-times-battlefield-redsec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to shadow drop</a> with Season One and has been rumored for quite some time. While not confirmed, it does seem rather interesting that Black Ops 6 would open its doors right when Battlefield is going all out with itself.</p>



<p>What do you think about Black Ops 6 going free-to-play? Think it’s a snipe at Battlefield 6? Which game do you prefer?

<p>Crash Bandicoot may be spinning his way onto Netflix with a new series, a new report claims. The iconic orange marsupial has been charming fans since the early 1990s, and now, he may get some more attention.</p>



<p>The franchise, owned by Toys for Bob and Activision, has had a few new entries in the new generation like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crash-team-rumble-release-date-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crash Team Rumble</a> and Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time! as part of a revival. While no new entries have been greenlit or revealed, a new report hints that one, albeit an animated TV series, is in the works at Netflix with the help of the team behind Sonic Prime.</p>



<h2 id="h-an-animated-crash-bandicoot-series-possibly-in-the-works-at-netflix-and-wildbrain">An Animated Crash Bandicoot Series Possibly in the Works at Netflix and WildBrain</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to a claim by <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/crash-bandicoot-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">What’s On N</a>etflix, Netflix is quietly working on a Crash Bandicoot animated series. Furthermore, it’s being made by WildBrain Studios, who previously did the Sonic Prime show. Other projects from the company include Johnny Test, The Snoopy Show, and Carmen Sandiego. Unfortunately, the report doesn’t reveal any other details like casting or release, so take it with a grain of salt. That said, Insider Gaming has reached out to Netflix, but has received no comment as of writing.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that no official announcement has been made on the project. However, a Crash Bandicoot series has been asked for, and even attempted at, for quite some time, as recently as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/01/rumour_looks_like_crash_bandicoots_cartoon_series_has_been_cancelled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2021 with Amazon</a>. During the production of the original 1997 title, Universal&nbsp;Animation Studios created an animated opening and ending that it hoped&nbsp;would inspire a TV series. It unfortunately didn’t come to be, though it did get <a href="https://youtu.be/6d5651XSuh0">uploaded onto YouTube</a> in 2015. Outside of that, the character appeared in Netflix’s Skylanders Academy as a cameo, played by Our Flag Means Death’s Rhys Darby. </p>



<p>Whether the news is true or not, Crash Bandicoot is a great choice for an animated series. The wacky world and colorful characters make for some awesome visuals. Plus, Mario and Sonic already got adaptations, so it’s high time for Crash to get his. Maybe we’ll get Spyro and Banjo-Kazooie next for mascot shows? Here’s hoping!</p>
