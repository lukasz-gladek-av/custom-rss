<p>To celebrate the arrival of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth of PC, Apex Legends is hosting a special event called Lunar Rebirth Collection on January 21, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a part of the Lunar Rebirth Collection event, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Items such as Buster Sword R2R5, Hop-Ups and Materia have returned to Apex Legends. Players will also be able to grab the 36 returning FF 7 Cosmetics Items and 6 Iconic Legends skins available for direct purchase in the store. There’s also a Lunar Rebirth Reward track, which provides players with additional rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-buster-sword-and-materia-return-to-apex-legends">Buster Sword and Materia Return to Apex Legends</h2>



<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth’s Buster Sword and Materia will be available to try in Apex Legends during the Lunar Rebirth Collection event. The Buster Sword can be used to deal damage through light and heavy attacks; players can also use its colossal size to block attacks. Additional abilities include dashing and the iconic Limit Break, whose meter fills whenever the player deals, takes or blocks damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rift Relics can provide players with Materia Hop-Ups, which increase effects and bonuses. Blue Materia can heal the player by absorbing the damage you inflict on enemies. Green Materia can emit a shock nova that damages and slows nearby enemies. Purple Materia increases the crit rate for the player. Lastly, the Red Materia allows players to summon a Nessie companion.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-pga-tour-2k25-editions-what%E2%80%99s-included.1085052/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-pga-tour-2k25-editions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Another PGA Tour title, another dilemma about which edition to buy. PGA Tour 2K25 has more editions than I have holes-in-one (zero, for what’s it worth), and each one has a unique selling point designed to pull you you in.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> is the next iteration of 2K’s next-gen golf game. 2K23 was a step up from 2K21, but 2025’s big dog is ready to eat. It’s sporting new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-courses-in-pga-tour-2k25-dlc-courses-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">courses</a> and revamped features across the board. It’s like the excitement of the new Driver season where you can’t wait to see what the big brands have been cooking up.</p>



<p>2K hasn’t just been hard at work on gameplay and longevity, we have new editions to peruse.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-pga-tour-2k25-edition">Every PGA Tour 2K25 Edition</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Decisions, decisions. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A Standard, Deluxe, and Legend Edition are available to pre-order for PGA Tour 2K25. </strong></p>



<p>Choosing a new launch’s edition is the equivalent of standing on a tee and deciding whether to slice the ball OB or snap hook it in the trees. All options are possible—and inevitable—but the choice is a tough one.</p>



<p>If 2K25 is your first foray into simulated golf or a new season in your accomplished career, we’ll help you with this agonizing decision.</p>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-standard-edition-explained">PGA Tour 2K25 Standard Edition Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Standard Edition. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>Standard is the basic edition of PGA Tour 2K25. It comes with the game—a cool pre-order bonus—and that’s it! If you’re mainly after 2K25 in its most basic and simplistic form (and cheapest), the Standard Edition is probably the one for you.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you get with the Standard Edition of PGA Tour 2K25:</p>



<ul>
<li>A base copy of PGA Tour 2K25.</li>



<li>Extra Butter x Adidas Pack
<ul>
<li>Chris McDonald Playable Character (Shooter McGavin from Happy Gilmore).</li>



<li>Extra Butter X Adidas Hat.</li>



<li>Extra Butter X Adidas Jacket.</li>



<li>Extra Butter X Adidas Shoes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-deluxe-edition-explained">PGA Tour 2K25 Deluxe Edition Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Deluxe Edition. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>Upgrading to the Deluxe Edition gives you a few extra yards off the tee—probably not, but you never know. I can say for sure you get the game, the pre-order bonus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a>, and a few more goodies. The Deluxe Edition might be digital-only, meaning you have to buy it from an online storefront if you want it.</p>



<p>This is everything included in 2K25 Deluxe Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>7-Day Early Access.</li>



<li>A base copy of PGA Tour 2K25.</li>



<li>Extra Butter x Adidas Pack
<ul>
<li>Chris McDonald Playable Character (Shooter McGavin from Happy Gilmore).</li>



<li>Extra Butter X Adidas Hat.</li>



<li>Extra Butter X Adidas Jacket.</li>



<li>Extra Butter X Adidas Shoes.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>The Birdie Pack
<ul>
<li>Titleist GT4 Driver.</li>



<li>Titleist Golf Ball Cosmetic.</li>



<li>FootJoy Premiere Series Shoes.</li>



<li>Umbrella Hat.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>The Starter Pack
<ul>
<li>1 Evo Tool.</li>



<li>5 Level-Up Tokens.</li>



<li>5 Club Fittings.</li>



<li>3 Ball Fittings.</li>



<li>1,800 VC.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Early Birdie Bonus (<strong>Pre-order Bonus</strong>)
<ul>
<li>TaylorMade SIM Driver.</li>



<li>Bad Birdie Golf Ball.</li>



<li>1 Level-Up Token.</li>



<li>500 VC.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>PGA TOUR 2K23 Standard Digital Edition.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-legend-edition-explained">PGA Tour 2K25 Legend Edition Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Legend Edition. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you didn’t think your bag could get any more full, in steps PGA Tour 2K25 Legend Edition. Again, this seems to be a digital-only edition. But getting it gets you six extra bundles to go along with Early Access and the game itself. This is for the ultimate golf enthusiast and also Tiger Woods fans.</p>



<p>I’ve rounded up the mammoth mountain of bonuses included in the Legend Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>7-Day Early Access.</li>



<li>A base copy of PGA Tour 2K25.</li>



<li>Extra Butter x Adidas Pack
<ul>
<li>Chris McDonald Playable Character (Shooter McGavin from Happy Gilmore).</li>



<li>Extra Butter X Adidas Hat.</li>



<li>Extra Butter X Adidas Jacket.</li>



<li>Extra Butter X Adidas Shoes.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>The Birdie Pack

<p>Announced today, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC will be playable on the Steam Deck on release day.</p>



<p>When Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC is released on January 23, 2024, Steam Deck owners <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1879895195178901895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can play the game</a> anywhere they want: on the train, in the park, on a flight, or in the car. The official announcement post also features the game running on the handheld console, and it seems the device can handle the title seamlessly, with no visible stuttering or performance issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To celebrate the arrival of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Steam Deck, Square Enix has revealed a limited-edition Fluffy Chocobo Steam Deck. The custom edition covers the entire handheld console in bright yellow Chocobo feathers. The game developers have stated that they don’t advise wrapping up “high-tech gaming gear in fur at home, ” so they have made the casing removable.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Apart from the Steam Deck, FF 7 Rebirth PC will be best experienced on a desktop where you can take advantage of enhanced features such as 120fps, refined lighting, improved environment detail, and more detailed textures. Depending on your setup, you can also benefit from improved framerates and image quality with NVIDIA DLSS.

<p>It’s not even been a full day since the Nintendo Switch 2 was revealed, and the pre-order sign-ups have already started popping up for the upcoming console. Best Buy was the first to join the fray.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sign-up-for-notifications-at-best-buy/1100-6528859/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameSpot</a>, you will see a new sign-up page for Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders if you go to <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch/nintendo-notifications/pcmcat1736965129196.c?id=pcmcat1736965129196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Best Buy’s website</a> right now. However, the signup doesn’t confirm the pre-order for you; instead, it sends out notifications when pre-orders go live, announcements regarding games for the upcoming console are released and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details such as pricing or availability have not been provided on Best Buy’s Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order sign-up page, as the company has yet to release that information. However, Nintendo will reveal the pricing, release date, games arriving for the console, and the device’s capabilities during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive Direct event</a> for the Switch 2 on April 2, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, only the console and some of its functionality have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a>. The Switch 2 will feature a larger console and joy-cons that snap to the device now instead of sliding in. The console’s colour has changed too, with the company going for an all-black casing with red and blue accents. Players can also have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-experience-announced-for-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on experience</a> with the highly anticipated Switch 2 in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hype for the Nintendo Switch 2 has been unreal, so much so that analysts have already claimed that the new console will sell <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-20-million-sales-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 20 million units</a> in the first year. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here’s a guide</a> on all the Nintendo Switch 2 leaks, rumours and other information.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vegas-falcons-support-cod%E2%80%99s-pro-scene-with-a-10-000-respawn-8%E2%80%99s-tournament.1084947/</guid>

<p>Call of Duty’s pro scene isn’t in a good place. From lengthy gaps between stages to Black Ops 6 being in a pit thanks to cheaters, the Call of Duty League isn’t all that appealing right now. That’s a huge sticking point for both fans and pro players, most of whom rely on COD’s competitive ecosystem to make a living.</p>



<p>To support the floundering esports scene, Vegas Falcons, which entered the CDL this season, has stood up a Respawn 8s tournament with a sizeable cash prize to keep the content flowing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-falcons-on-top">Falcons on Top</h2>



<p>Despite being at the bottom of the CDL standings, the Vegas Falcons are trying their darndest to help the scene out as much as possible. One of the biggest issues in the Call of Duty esports ecosystem is the lack of content. Outside of the CDL, there’s not much to watch, leaving the scene’s brands and creators to organise tournaments and events.</p>



<p>And the less said about Warzone, the better. It’s in a shocker of a spot right now.</p>



<p>Today, the Vegas Falcons revealed a $10,000 Respawn 8s tournament, set to run from today through the weekend (17 – 26 Jan). On <a href="https://x.com/VegasFalcons/status/1880057467968934354" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the organisation wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Introducing the Vegas Falcons Ladder</p>



<p>A pick-up game initiative designed to bring together the best talent to fight for $10,000 over 10 days. </p>



<p>Who will be crowned king ahead of Major I?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Major I is the most highly anticipated event of the CDL season thus far. It’s taking place in Madrid between January 30 and February 2, marking the first EU Major in Call of Duty League history. After that, things return stateside for Major II, which will take place in Texas, and then Major III, set to surface in Florida in April.</p>



<p>Do you think it’s fair that organisations have to scrape together to arrange events just to keep the fans switched on? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
