<p>Fallout 4 has some fantastic factions that make up the backbone of the game itself – without them, there would essentially be no story for the player to experience. However, there’s a point of contention within the community as to which Fallout 4 faction is ‘the best’. It’s mostly a subjective debate, but in this list, we’re seeing every major Fallout 4 faction ranked from worst to best. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ranking-fallout-4-s-factions">Ranking Fallout 4’s Factions</h2>



<p>Out of all the Fallout 4 factions, we’ve zeroed in on the ‘main’ groups that contribute the most to the story, so don’t be disappointed if your all-time favourite fringe faction doesn’t make the cut. Leave a comment stressing who you think should make the list and we’ll consider adding it!</p>



<p>Here we go – every major Fallout 4 faction, ranked <strong>from worst to best</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-the-railroad-worst">4. The Railroad (Worst)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Railroad might have some admirable goals in mind, but this basement-dwelling, secretive organisation that distrusts the player from the word ‘go’ is typically left standing in the nuclear dust in Fallout 4. They only care about helping synths, and that’s a huge sticking point for much of the Commonwealth. </p>



<p>There’s a sweet bonus in the ‘Ballistic Fiber’ mod you can unlock for siding with The Railroad, but it’s enough to save the faction.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-the-institute">3. The Institute</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Institute – arguably the most important Fallout 4 faction because of where it fits into the story, but it’s called ‘The Boogeyman of the Commonwealth’ for a reason. It terrifies people, and some of the experiments it carries out are nothing short of abhorrent. With that being said, the whole ‘preservation of science and rebuilding the world’ bit is positive and a huge redeemer for the faction.</p>



<p>There’s a huge amount of work needed in The Institute’s PR department, but the upkeep of a hyper-clean, flawless scientific facility some 200 years after the nuclear apocalypse is something that can’t be discredited.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Honourable Mention: Gunners</em></strong></h3>



<p><em>In Fallout 4, the Gunners are akin to the Raiders, but they’re more military-based in their appearance and how they operate, and they facilitate the backstory of one of the game’s best companions, MacCready. They often pair up with the likes of Assaultrons and bring the force of a well-trained unit to any fight.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-2-brotherhood-of-steel">2. Brotherhood of Steel</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Brotherhood of Steel is easily the most recognisable Fallout 4 faction – it’s probably the most iconic faction from the franchise, period. In Fallout 4, the Brotherhood of Steel ‘chapter’ that arrives to shape up Boston is unfortunately quite bigoted and fascist-like in how it goes about its mission, but there’s something valiant about wanting to rid an entire region of mutated, cannibalistic, and intensely violent creatures, right?</p>



<p>As a special mention, it’s worth stressing that their arrival in the Commonwealth Wasteland is one of the most epic moments in Fallout history.</p>

<h3 id="h-honourable-mention-atom-cats"><em>Honourable Mention: Atom Cats</em></h3>



<p><em>No Fallout 4 faction is cooler than the Atom Cats. They’re a real live bunch, you dig? With their customised suits of power armour and their ‘Greased Lightning’ vibe, they’re instantly likeable and probably way more chilled out than they should be, given their surroundings.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-1-minutemen-best">1. Minutemen (Best)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>As we see every major Fallout 4 faction ranked, we can’t help but list the Minutemen at the top of the pile. This selfless faction exists to unite settlements across the Wasteland, pulling together with community spirit and ensuring that everyone has a voice – and a home. There’s no sinister sub-plot, no underlying regime – it’s just regular folks trying to get by and share what they have with those that need it.</p>



<p>Out of every major Fallout 4 faction, the Minutemen are deserving of the top spot. They might not boast vertibirds or next-generation scientific technology, but they’re decent people, and they’re triers, and that’s all that matters. </p>

<p>Dead Space creator Glen Schofield has said that the team tried to pitch Dead Space 4 earlier this year, but the publisher was not interested.</p>



<p>The news came from a live stream by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU5PrEr1HjM&amp;t=5476s&amp;ab_channel=DanAllenGaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dan Allen Gaming</a> a few weeks ago, where he sat down with Dead Space creators Glen Schofield, Bret Robbins, and Cristopher Stone.</p>



<p>“We tried actually, the three of us, to [pitch] Dead Space 4, said Schofield. “I mean, we’re talking this year [that they pitched Dead Space 4]”, he continued. In response, Allen replied, “And what they didn’t budge?”</p>



<p>“Well, we didn’t go too deep; they just said we’re not interested right now, we appreciate it, blah blah blah, and we respected their opinion,” replied Schofield. He finished on the topic with “We have some ideas,” with the trio all saying they would return for a Dead Space 4. </p>



<p>The last game in the Dead Space series to be released was Dead Space 3 in 2013, with the original Dead Space receiving a remake by Motive Studio in 2022. </p>



<p>Since the Dead Space IP stopped with its game in 2023, Schofield released The Callisto Protocol in 2022 with his new studio Striking Distance Studios, which was considered a spiritual successor to the Dead Space series. The game failed to meet Krafton’s sales expectations of five million units, lowering their expectations to two million.</p>



<p>As for if we’ll ever see another Dead Space, it remains to be seen, but for now, it looks like its creators are all on board with jumping ship to EA if the project gets greenlit.</p>

<p>VALORANT coach Christine “potter” Chi has signed a three-year contract extension with Evil Geniuses. With the deal signed, potter will be under contract with Evil Geniuses through at least the 2027 season.</p>



<p>Evil Geniuses has officially completed its roster in the final days of 2024, gearing up for the 2025 VALORANT Champions Tour season in the Americas league.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-evil-geniuses-seek-return-to-championship-glory">Evil Geniuses Seek Return to Championship Glory</h2>



<p>Potter signed a three-year, “max-length” contract with Evil Geniuses through 2027. The only other coach in VCT Americas with a contract through 2027, per <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRmmWiBmMMD43m5VtZq54nKlmj0ZtythsA1qCpegwx-iRptx2HEsG0T3cQlG1r2AIiKxBWnaurJZQ9Q/pubhtml#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Global Contract Database</a>, is 100 Thieves’ Anthony “Zikz” Gray. Zikz, a long-time coach in League of Legends who switched to VALORANT, was potter’s assistant coach during EG’s unexpected world championship run in 2023. The assistant coach for EG last year, Mike “pho” Panza, has also returned for the 2025 season.</p>



<p>Evil Geniuses CEO Chris DeAppolonio, in a press release today, called potter the “lynchpin” of EG’s VALORANT program, . “There’s no one else I’d want at the helm. With Potter’s leadership and passion, EG will always contend for the VALORANT World Championship.”</p>



<p>The re-signing of potter completes EG’s offseason ahead of the start of the 2025 season. The team opted to re-sign returning players Derrek “Derrek” Ha, Nicholas “NaturE” Garrison and Phat “Supamen” Le. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/evil-geniuses-sign-yay-and-icy-to-complete-2025-valorant-roster/">Two new additions in Jaccob “yay” Whiteaker and Jacob “icy” Lange</a> were announced Friday. Excluding icy, who was on the team’s reserve roster at the time, potter is the only remaining name from the 2023 Champions roster.</p>



<p>The full field of 12 teams in VCT Americas all made changes to their starting rosters during this offseason period.</p>



<p>How do you think potter and Evil Geniuses stack up against other VALORANT teams heading into VCT 2025? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
