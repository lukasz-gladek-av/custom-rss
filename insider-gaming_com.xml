<p>If you live for wild shooters infused with skateboarding mechanics, then you need to be playing High on Life 2. The new sequel from Squanch Games is just as loud (if not louder) than the first game and also brings with it another big Trophy List.</p>



<p>Maybe there aren’t enough games about talking guns, and that’s what the whole galaxy should consist of? Then again, maybe not, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" id="170939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2</a> has a certain, can’t-look-away, need-to-hear-everything charm that few other titles deliver. We were quite complimentary in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/reviews/high-on-life-2-review-a-faster-funnier-sequel/" id="176022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2 review</a>, and if you do pick it up, you need to know the High on Life 2 Trophy List.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-high-on-life-2-trophies-amp-achievements">All High on Life 2 Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>As expected, the High on Life 2 list engages in tomfoolery with the names of the trophies and achievements. They play heavily into the game’s skateboard influence, and there’s even a nice touch on the classic 1991 ‘All your base are belong to us’ meme!</p>

<p>When you’re looking for a new game to play, how long it takes to beat is a valid aspect to consider. Starting a game can be a commitment, especially if you’re purchasing it, and it’s nice to know what you’re getting yourself into.</p>







<p>At the end of the day, everyone is different. Some of you might be looking for an expansive, hundred-hour RPG, whereas others might prefer a shorter, more condensed experience. If you’re wondering which category <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" id="170939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High On Life 2</a> falls into, then you’re in the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-high-on-life-2">How Many Hours To Beat High On Life 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There’s a lot to do. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>If you play High On Life 2 casually, focusing on the main campaign whilst exploring some of the open areas, you should expect to complete the game in around 10 hours. </strong></p>



<p>High On Life 2 is a fairly structured game. There are open maps to explore and collectables to find, but there’s a linear narrative that you’ll be following. As you hunt down more of the Big Pharma targets, you’ll head to new areas, but you don’t need to spend any time there that you don’t want to.</p>



<p>Instead, you’re more than welcome to focus simply on the main missions, and if you do that, you can easily complete the game in under 10 hours. It’s great if you’re just there for the plot, but there’s more of the game to enjoy if you’re willing to put the time into it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-high-on-life-2-completionist-run">How Long Is A High On Life 2 Completionist Run? </h2>



<p><strong>If you’re aiming to 100% High On Life 2, you’re looking at around 25-30 hours, assuming you embark on every side activity—and hunt down every Luglox.</strong></p>



<p>There’s a nice variety of activities to complete in High On Life 2, such as hunting down Skate letters or clearing Wanted Posters, but the real time sink will be finding every Luglox. </p>







<p>There are 199 to find across the three different maps, and they even include the tiny green ones that store some Pesos. Thankfully, they show up on your mini map when you’re near them, but more often than not, you’ll still need to search around.</p>



<p>Don’t worry if you missed any during missions, though, as thankfully, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/squanch-games/" id="2701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squanch Games</a> has added Luglox Exterminators. You can purchase a Luglox for 300 Pesos each, and it’s a great addition to ensure you won’t miss any and have to restart.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Today, the qualification stage for the Call of Duty League’s Major II tournament starts. It’s the bedding-in phase for one of the most highly anticipated Majors in recent years, and for good reason. It’s also something of an opportunity for OpTic Texas’ Shotzzy to redeem himself, <strong>many years</strong> later.</p>



<p>The Major II LAN is taking place in the United Kingdom, and it’s the first time that the Call of Duty League has come to the region since <strong>2020</strong>. When Shotzzy last played on British soil, he gave a memorable interview that still sits with him today, but not for good reason.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-cod-league-finally-comes-back-to-england">The COD League Finally Comes Back to England</h2>



<p>The United Kingdom has been crying out for a Call of Duty esports event for the longest time, and while they’ve had Warzone, they’ve always longed for a CDL event. In March, that’s finally happening, as DreamHack Birmingham plays host to the CDL Major II tournament.</p>



<p>It’s a monumental thing, and the hungriest fans in the nation will be sure to blow the roof off the place, given that it’s almost <strong>six years </strong>since the CDL last came to the British Isles.</p>



<p>In 2020, during the inaugural Call of Duty League season, Shotzzy, who at the time represented Dallas Empire, had an awful interview in London. It was dubbed ‘the most awkward esports interview ever’, and for good reason.</p>



<p>When I caught up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shotzzy-haunted-interview-london-cod-league-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with Shotzzy in Madrid in 2025</a>, he told me that he had to ‘get his get back on that interview’. At the time, the Call of Duty League still had no plans to revisit the UK, but in recent months, things shifted, and the CDL is finally coming back to England.</p>



<p>Shotzzy went on to win the Call of Duty League Championship in 2020, securing himself as one of the GOATs of esports with a world championship title in two games in his pocket. He has since gone on to win another two rings in the Call of Duty space, becoming one of a few to win <strong>two years </strong>back-to-back, and he now flies the OpTic Texas banner.</p>



<p>Will Shotzzy have the opportunity to redeem himself on stage in front of a crowd of British Call of Duty esports fans? Let’s hope so.</p>

<p>Animated projects based on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega </a>classics such as Streets of Rage, Shinobi, and OutRun are in development.</p>



<p>This news comes from Sega Sammy Holdings Inc., Sega’s parent company. The company just released<a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_q3_presentation_e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> its third-quarter earnings</a> for the fiscal year 2026. Not only did they cover gaming news and releases, but they also discussed their animated projects in the works.</p>



<p>For the upcoming plans and their animated section, several classic Sega games were listed as having upcoming animated releases. Streets of Rage, Shinobi, Eternal Champions, and OutRun are all listed with TBD titles in the animated section. It is not specified which of these releases will be adapted into a TV series and which will be made into films.</p>



<p>In 2024, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/golden-axe-animated-series-mike-mcmahan-comedy-central-matthew-rhys-danny-pudi-1235973820/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety </a>announced an animated series based on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/golden-axe/" id="1425">Golden Axe</a> was slated for Comedy Central.

<h2 id="h-golden-axe-and-streets-of-rage-also-have-games-in-the-works">Golden Axe and Streets of Rage Also Have Games in the Works</h2>



<p>In addition to news about forthcoming animated projects, Sega lists Golden Axe and Streets of Rage as properties with upcoming video game releases. There’s no word on when these games will launch. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/streets-of-rage-4/" id="469">Streets of Rage 4 </a>was released in 2020, developed by DotEmu. There hasn’t been a release in the Golden Axe franchise since Beast Rider in 2008.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>T1 Esports has signed a new partnership with an unlikely party, the <strong>South Korean Navy</strong>. In a story that dropped earlier today, it was confirmed that a Memorandum of Understanding has been penned between the two organizations, with T1 specifically joining forces with the Navy’s ‘Power Analysis and Evaluation Team’.</p>



<p>The heart of this partnership is centered around bolstering the Navy’s cognitive and analysis capabilities, and to do this, it’s going to lean on technology featured in the esports space, in which T1 is a key and critical player.</p>







<h2 id="h-t1-esports-x-south-korean-navy-is-an-interesting-concept">T1 Esports x South Korean Navy is an Interesting Concept</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mbn.co.kr/news/sports/5175686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MBN</a>, a South Korean outlet, was the first to report on the MOU signed between T1 Esports and the South Korean Navy, which represents one of the strangest partnerships in recent years in the esports industry.</p>



<p>It was written (translated by Google):</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Through this agreement, the two organizations plan to strengthen exchanges and cooperation in various areas, including: activating the gaming function of the Navy’s M&amp;S model; researching ways to utilize the creative tactics of esports teams to advance naval tactics; jointly researching tactical analysis and development based on game data; and co-hosting academic conferences and seminars.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a statement, T1’s Chief Operating Officer, Ahn Woong-ki, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Through this agreement, we hope to see the soft power of esports merge with the hard power of the Navy to develop into a national smart power.</p>



<p>T1 will continue to expand its cooperation with the Navy and actively support its efforts to strengthen its digital and cyber capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And speaking from the Navy’s perspective, Kim Hyung-jun, Head of the Power Analysis Test and Evaluation Division, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We expect that through this business agreement with T1, cooperation between the two organizations in the fields of M&amp;S and data analysis will be further strengthened.</p>



<p>This will serve as an opportunity to further solidify the foundation for development of the Navy’s future power.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>T1 is one of the most recognizable brands in the modern esports space. The organization’s League of Legends roster is one of the winningest in history, and last year secured its <strong>sixth </strong>world championship in little more than a decade.</p>

<p>REANIMAL constantly has you on the edge of your seat, and while you fight for survival and ways to escape, there’s a wealth of collectables to hunt down, including all the Masks to earn the Beneath The Mask Achievement.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tarsier-studios/" id="1858">Tarsier Studios</a>‘ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/reanimal/" id="170941">REANIMAL</a> is split into nine chapters, and Masks can be found in almost every chapter. Additionally, they’re easy to miss, as there is no way to return to a specific section. Instead, the game must be started from scratch if you fail to find everything the first time around.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for the Beneath the Mask achievement in REANIMAL, Insider Gaming has the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-reanimal-mask-locations-listed">All REANIMAL Mask Locations, Listed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to collect. Image via Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-chapter-1-mask-locations">Chapter 1 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Bird Head</strong></p>



<p>The first Mask to collect in REANIMAL is found in the Mill section of Chapter 1, after you have passed through the giant fan. The mask is available soon after your first encounter with The Sniffer.</p>



<p>When the Sniffer appears, run past the big door he closes and turn left, then interact with the wall to hoist your companion up to the platform. Continue to climb the platform, using the companion’s help, until you reach the top of the ladder.</p>



<p>Head left until you reach a door and follow the platform to a crack in the wall. Then collect the Bird Head inside.</p>



<p><strong>Worm Head</strong></p>



<p>The Worm Head mask is again found in the Mill, once you have stopped the boiler from spinning. Once that has been completed, go through the door to continue your progression.</p>



<p>Inside the room, open the locker on the right side to unlock a secret room, and head inside. The Worm Head is waiting inside.</p>



<p><strong>Conch Head</strong></p>



<p>The Conch Head is the final mask in Chapter 1, and is found near the train tracks. When standing alongside the draisine, head to the right-hand side, and enter the second door (the first one is a restroom).</p>



<p>Follow the platform up the stairs to reach a room with the Conch Head inside.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-2-mask-locations">Chapter 2 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Pig Head</strong></p>



<p>The Pig Head is the first mask in Chapter 1, available at the start of the village section.</p>



<p>Inside the Clothing Store, go to the left behind the counter. Here, crouch, and enter the hole in the wall found on the left-side. This leads to another secret room, where the Pig Head is found.</p>



<p><strong>Cone Head</strong></p>



<p>After surviving your close experience with the Sniffer, exit the cinema and go to the broken building on the right side of the main square. Keep an eye out for a citter that exits the broken building. It will enter a secret room on the right-hand side.</p>



<p>Using the crowbar, pull the planks off the door and enter. Hit the critter with the crowbar to kill it and collect the Cone Head.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-3-mask-locations">Chapter 3 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Deer Head</strong></p>



<p>The Deer Head is found soon after you kill the seagulls that are attacking you, using the crowbar. Once that’s done, climb to the top of both ladders to reach the flower field.</p>



<p>Go to the far left side of the flower field to find a scarecrow and hit it with the crowbar. Then, kill the critter that appears to collect the Deer Head from its dead body.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-4-mask-locations">Chapter 4 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Bucket Head</strong></p>



<p>In Chapter 4, the Bucket Head is found in the Orphanage section, and can be from the area with the petrified spider kids. While here, destroy them all to earn the Scared to Dust achievement. </p>



<p>In this room, head to the right-hand side of the room, crouch, and go through the bookshelf to reach a secret area. A critter will then run out of the room, into the area you were just in.</p>



<p>Exit the secret room back into the main room of the clock tower and kill the critter using the crowbar. Then, collect the Bucket Head from its body.</p>



<p><strong>Crown Head</strong></p>



<p>The Crown Head is found shortly after the Bucket Head, after the spider kids begin to attack you in the next area aftern the main room of the clock tower.</p>



<p>Inside the food hall, go into the middle of the room and kill all the spider kids that appear. When the spider kids climb down from the throne from the right side of the room, go behind the throne. One of the kids who appears is the spider king, identifiable by the crown on his head.</p>



<p>Using the crowbar, kill the spider king quickly, as he will leave the room if you don’t kill him quickly. Once he’s defeated, collect the Crown Head from the body.</p>



<p><strong>Plant Head</strong></p>



<p>The Plant Head is the final mask in Chapter 4 and is found just after you reach the point with the child wearing the bucket. Kill all of the spiders before advancing.</p>



<p>Once the spider kids are defeated, shimmy through the crack in the broken bed. Then, head through the door on the other side. Once through the door, walk back towards the camera and shimmy through a crack in the wall.</p>



<p>Pull out the Plant Head from the ground, then pick up the Plant Head.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-5-mask-locations">Chapter 5 Mask Locations</h3>



<p>There are no masks to find in Chapter 5 of REANIMAL.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-6-mask-locations">Chapter 6 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Fish Head</strong></p>



<p>Once you input the code on Cannon Island, the Fish Head is ready to claim. First, though, there’s a small cutscene to watch.</p>



<p>When it’s finished, go left and shimmy through the door of the bunker, and down the ladder to the bottom. From here, jump down to the beach below.</p>



<p>Head to the left-hand side of the beach to find a critter and kill it. Then, collect the Fish Head from the body.</p>



<p><strong>Package Head</strong></p>



<p>To get the Package Head, return to the boat after firing the cannon on Cannon Island, and enter the path that was previously protected by the Brook Horse until you reach a big opening.</p>



<p>Continue down the path, blowing up any mines by throwing the harpoon, and when you get to the end of the path, turn left and follow the cliffs until you reach the mines, which you need to blow up again using the harpoon.</p>



<p>Follow the path to reach a beach, drive the boat onto the beach, and collect the Package Head from the middle of the area.</p>



<p><strong>Diving Helmets</strong></p>



<p>There are two Diving Helmets to collect, both at the same point, which are found soon after the cutscene following the chase by Brook Horse.</p>



<p>Once the cutscene ends, wait for the characters to put down their costumes, and then pick up each of the Diving Helmets.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-7-mask-locations">Chapter 7 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Bush Head</strong></p>



<p>The Bush Head mask is obtainable right at the start of Chapter 7. After the cutscene ends, go forward into the next area, and head to the right-hand side to find a small metallic door.</p>



<p>Crouch to go under the door into the secret area, and pick up the Bush Head.</p>



<p><strong>Mine Head</strong></p>



<p>The Mine Head is obtained immediately after the Bush Head. Once you pick up the Bush Head, go down the ramp on the left and proceed forward past the two dead soldiers, then turn right and go past the shotrgun soldier.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the trench, turn right and shimmy through the broken wall, and collect the Mine Head in the area.</p>



<p><strong>Rabbit Head</strong></p>



<p>Once the Mine Head is collected, go further into the trench until you reach a soldier blocking the way. Approach the soldier to trigger an animation, run a safe distance away from the soldier, and then go past the exploding soldier to the opening.</p>



<p>Now, head left and shimmy through the broken wall to collect the Rabbit Head.</p>



<p><strong>Amphibian Head</strong></p>



<p>The Amphibian Head is the penultimate mask to collect in REANIMAL and can be collected once you reach the surgery room in the hospital in Chapter 8.</p>



<p>Find the desk on the right-hand side of the room, crouch, and go under the desk into the next room, then pick up the Amphibian Head.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-8-mask-locations">Chapter 8 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Gas Head</strong></p>



<p>The Gas Head is the final mask to find in REANIMAL, and is available to obtain once you have shot the hanging soldier, who drops a key.</p>



<p>Use this key to unlock the door on the right-hand side of the area and go through it, then look for the oven and interact with it to open the door with a crowbar. No, head back into the shooting range, and shoot the critter with a gun or rifle, and pick up the Gas Head.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-9-mask-locations">Chapter 9 Mask Locations</h3>



<p>There are no masks or any other collectables to find in Chapter 9.</p>
