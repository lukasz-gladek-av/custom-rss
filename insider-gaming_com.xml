<p>On social media, a Treyarch developer has written a transparent post explaining why Call of Duty’s movement seemed to slow down after 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. He also explained why certain mechanics aren’t all that effective in Black Ops 6, despite them having been a staple in the Call of Duty space for many years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-faster-is-not-always-healthier">‘Faster is Not Always Healthier’</h2>



<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/MaTtKs/status/1862340934832132335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitter</a>, Treyarch’s Matt Scronce confirmed – in a way – that movement mechanics were slowed dramatically after MW19 because ‘faster is not always healthier’. He explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Once prone and crouch speeds become too fast, you end up with mismatch between 1st and 3rd person POV leading to “snaking” which has been a massive problem in the past.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Modern Warfare’s movement mechanics were fast-paced and intense, with slide cancelling, snaking, and jump shots making up the meta that eventually worked into Warzone when it was released in March 2020. These elements remained, but players were forced to contend with slower, heavier games that felt nerfed in terms of movement.</p>



<p>Scronce’s comments were posted in response to a video comparing Black Ops 6 and MW19, showing how much slower the game has become over the years, particularly movement mechanics like jumping.</p>



<p>He wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve never personally been a fan of spamming jump during combat, so when we intentionally designed omnimovement mechanics, we adjusted sway/bob when jumping by default to ensure that wasn’t the most effective tactic during engagements. </p>



<p>If you want to spam jump while shooting, we have Perks and Attachments to increase effectiveness just like we do for slide and dive.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you’ve been relying on jump shots for all these years and wondered why you’re having no luck hitting your shots now when doing so, that’s your explanation in black and white.</p>



<p>Scronce signed off with a reassurance that Treyarch is always evaluating feedback and making improvements based on the community’s sentiment.</p>

<p>Delta Force is preparing to go head-to-head with the likes of Arena Breakout: Infinite and Escape from Tarkov in the extraction shooter world. Recently, it was revealed that the developers are willing to work with a relatively controversial mechanic to compete with the games that spearhead the genre.</p>



<p>When Delta Force’s extraction mode hits an end-of-season ‘wipe’, players will be able to decide if they want to opt in or not. That means that with each new season, players can carry their progress over rather than wiping and starting from the beginning.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-make-a-decision">Make a Decision</h2>



<p>For the extraction shooter community, a regular wipe makes sense. It ensures that things remain balanced, allowing players to all sit at the same level once every so often. In Escape from Tarkov, wipes typically occur once every six months, and when each wipe arrives, so too does a major game update that changes the playing field.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Escape from Tarkov’s developer, Battlestate Games, released a PvE mode in the game that allows users to play indefinitely without undergoing a wipe, and that was a hit with many players – particularly those who don’t have the time to grind once every six months.</p>



<p>Delta Force is following in those footsteps – in a way.</p>



<p>It was recently confirmed that when a wipe arrives at the end of each three-month season in Delta Force, players are given the choice to either wipe and start fresh or retain what they’ve earned and unlocked and keep playing as normal.</p>



<p>There’s a twist, though. If you choose to wipe, you’ll unlock exclusive rewards and abilities, one of which is the opportunity to spawn as a boss character and take enemies down using powerful weapons. </p>



<p>It’s entirely up to you.</p>



<p>Will you be wiping in Delta Force, or would you prefer to stick with the same gear forever? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you thought Fortnite didn’t have much left in the tank, you’d be sorely mistaken. Recently, the game reached new heights during the Juice WLRD finale event, racking up a whopping <strong>14.3 million </strong>concurrent players, a new all-time high for the game. </p>



<p>This new record effectively decimated the number secured by the arrival of Fortnite OG last year. When the game’s original map was reintroduced, just north of 11 million concurrent players found their way into the game, but that record has been left standing in the dust.</p>



<hr>







<p>Fortnite’s live events are nothing short of monumental, and they never fail to attract millions of users. </p>
