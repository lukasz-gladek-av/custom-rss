<p>Embark Studios has unveiled the slate of rewards coming later this month when the <strong>second </strong>expedition window opens in ARC Raiders. This is the mechanic that allows players to reset their account, going back to base and starting all over again with a ‘new’ character. It also yields exclusive unlocks, bonuses, and temporary buffs.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, what’s being unlocked the second time around isn’t amazing, which is proving to be a concern for the game’s die-hard fanbase.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-second-expedition-rewards-explained">ARC Raiders Second Expedition Rewards Explained</h2>



<p>On February 25th, the second <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/second-expedition-rewards-and-requirements">ARC Raiders Expedition</a> window will open, running until March 1st, when all Raiders participating in the event <strong>leave Speranza</strong>. The team at Embark Studios has made some major changes to how the Expedition works, based on feedback received from the community in recent weeks.</p>



<p>First, it will now cost way less to acquire the five extra skill points you get for leaving Speranza. Instead of one million credits per skill point, the requirement is now 600,000 credits per skill point. Additionally, if you missed the full allotment of bonus points during the first Expedition, you can now unlock those bonus skill points at a discounted rate of 300,000 credits per skill point.</p>



<p>That means if you did your Expedition last time with <strong>zero </strong>extra skill points, you can get <strong>TEN </strong>bonus points in February, provided you can rack up 4.5 million credits.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>With that being said, here are the other rewards waiting for you as the second Expedition rolls around:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Patchwork Outfit (Evolved)</li>



<li>Scrappy Cosmetics</li>



<li>The Expedition Indicator Icon (Upgraded)</li>



<li>24 extra Stash spaces</li>



<li>Bonus skill points</li>



<li>5 – 10% XP boost</li>



<li>6 – 12% Scrappy materials boost</li>



<li>60 – 70% Repair value increase</li>
</ul>



<p>The latter items are a range because you get <strong>a bigger boost </strong>if you’ve already completed your Expedition in December. If not, you get the <strong>lower </strong>end of the scale. It’ll face a consecutive boost <strong>again </strong>during the third Expedition, which should arrive in April.</p>



<p>Fans are disappointed that we don’t even get a new outfit for the second Expedition, just an ‘evolved’ one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nvidia Won’t Release A New Graphics Card This Year As It Focuses On AI]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-wont-release-a-new-graphics-card-this-year-as-it-focuses-on-ai/</link>
            <guid>1427185</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nvidia is reportedly opting not to release new graphics cards this year, and is looking at cutting back its GPU production. </p>



<p>In a new report from The Information (<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nvidia-delay-new-gaming-chip-due-memory-chip-shortage?rc=v4bmzs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paywalled</a>), it’s claimed that Nvidia has decided not to release its latest GPUs this year—the long-rumored GeForce RTX 50-series Super refresh—in 2026. Those who spoke to the outlet on the condition of anonymity say Nvidia is doing it to focus on AI chips and datacenters due to the RAM shortage.</p>







<p>The report ads that Nvidia is also going to cut production of the current RTX 50-series graphics cards due to the shortage. A shortage that has seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prices of memory soar</a> to the levels beyond anything that many have ever seen. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nvidia for comment on the report. As of publishing, a response ahadn’t been received, but this story will be updated should one come in.</p>



<p>The decision to cut back on graphics cards production comes as Nvidia’s profits continue to break records. The company’s latest earnings report in November saw a 62% year-over-year growth in revenue at $57 billion. Those profits have resulted in Nvidia being the largest company in terms of market cap with a value of $4.259 trillion. It’s likely that those numbers rise hire when they report their FY26 fourth quarter earnings on February 25.</p>







<p>Nvidia has also said that to help with the shortage, it would revive older hardware. Cards as old as the 30-series <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-to-re-release-geforce-rtx-3060-in-q1-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could be relaunched</a> to alleviate the shortage, though, by relaunching cards that are over a half-decade old, gamers are likely to miss out on current, modern-day features.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft’s Internal Town Hall Fails to Reassure Employees on Its Future]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-internal-town-hall-fails-to-reassure-employees-on-its-future/</link>
            <guid>1427182</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft held an internal Town Hall Q&amp;A meeting with employees yesterday to instill confidence in the company’s upcoming changes, but, according to over a dozen employees who spoke to Insider Gaming anonymously, it appears to have had the opposite effect.</p>



<p>The Town Hall featured a host to read out the questions, along with Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, Executive Vice President Cécile Russeil, Chief People Officer Sébastien Froidefond, CFO Frederik Duguet, and Chief Studios &amp; Portfolio Officer Marie-Sophie&nbsp;de Waubert, in a roundtable format.</p>







<p>According to those who spoke to Insider Gaming, employees described the Town Hall as an expert class in avoiding questions, with executives repeatedly sidestepping or recycling earlier statements.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming was sent a recording of the Town Hall under the condition that it would not be made public.</p>



<p>Ubisoft Yves Guillemot opened the Town Hall, once again reinforcing the decision for the 5-day return to office mandate, stating, “It’s a decision we have not taken lightly, but we feel strongly that it will bring more efficiency, innovation, and velocity. As it already has since we came back, three days per week. Working in person brings stronger performance, especially in the tech and creative industries.”</p>



<p>Yves addressed concerns about a supposed ‘hidden agenda’ to lay off employees, stating, “Our only objective is to get Ubisoft back on the right path as soon as possible, to share success and profits. I founded Ubisoft with my brothers, and as you can imagine, my goal is to continue to make it flourish for many years to come. It’s thanks to your strengths and collective talents that we will succeed.”</p>



<p>The host said that more than 300 questions were submitted for the Q&amp;A, with sources noting that some had 700-800 upvotes, 3-4 times the number from past Q&amp;A calls. When asked why they thought this was, many said it was due to the frustration, anger, and betrayal employees felt from the current announcements.</p>



<h2 id="h-return-to-office-mandate">Return to Office Mandate</h2>



<p>One of the biggest questions that had the most upvotes was around the Return to Office mandate that will see all employees across all studios return to office five days per week.</p>



<p>As has become a constant frustration with criticism of RTO mandates, the updated comment focused on whether Ubisoft has any actual data to support the claim that productivity and collaboration have increased since 3-day RTOs were enforced.</p>



<p>Chief Studios &amp; Portfolio Officer,&nbsp;de Waubert said, “What we hear, both internally and externally, is that when it comes to creative, the more people that are present together, the more all of those things we mentioned earlier improve from a collective perspective.”</p>



<p>Marie-Sophie&nbsp;went on to cite competitors like Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, Rockstar, etc. have already implemented RTO mandates. Marie-Sophie&nbsp;also cited companies outside of the industry, including Instagram, Paramount, and many others, that have also implemented RTO.</p>



<p>“Of course we will keep flexibility exceptions, but in a clear hybrid policy,” she said.</p>



<p>In response to a follow-up question about flexibility and how many “at-home days” will be granted, among other details, Froidefond said that these decisions will not be made until July.</p>



<p>A question around why Ubisoft won’t meet developers’ requests to have a 4-day RTO was also shot down by Froidefond, stating, “We have already explained this in the past, and our position remains the same; we are not considering a 4-day office workplace.”</p>



<h2 id="h-significant-headcount-reduction">Significant Headcount Reduction</h2>



<div><p>One question cited Insider Gaming’s recent prediction that the recent cost-cutting measures could see a reduction of 2000+ jobs, to which Frederik Duguet responded,</p><p>“First of all, we must state very clearly that we have never shared such numbers externally, and as I’ve just said, we won’t share any more decisions today. Again, it is, however, true that we will proceed with additional targeting restructuring as we need to resize the organisation and reduce our costs.”</p></div>



<p>Duguet later added that in May’s yearly financial results (which will end March 31, 2026), “We [Ubisoft] should expect our headcount in March to be <strong>significantly lower</strong> than it was in September”. No further elaboration on what “significantly lower” entails.</p>



<p>Ubisoft’s headcount in September 2025 was 17,097.</p>







<h2 id="h-acknowledged-lack-of-communication">Acknowledged Lack of Communication</h2>



<p>One positive from the call was that Ubisoft acknowledged the lack of communication about the announced structural changes, with Executive Vice President Cécile Russeil acknowledging that most employees learned about many of the upcoming changes from media reports. </p>



<p>Russeil acknowledged that the live Q&amp;A session that took place at the end of the day was the wrong decision, as employees found out about a lot of the details from media rather than the company itself.</p>



<p>“We heard you, and in the future, we will attach the press release with an internal email so that you get all of the information at the same time of media and investors.”</p>



<p>Duguet weighed in to mention that Ubisoft is a publicly traded company and “we have disclosure duties with our investors, which means, in concrete terms, that we cannot share anything that is sensitive internally at large before updating the market on these very elements.”</p>



<h2 id="h-selling-a-creative-house-assets-is-possible-in-the-future">Selling a Creative House / Assets Is Possible in The Future</h2>



<p>One of the biggest questions in the call revolved around Ubisoft’s Creative House structure and what will happen if a Creative House fails to be profitable.</p>



<p>On that, CFO Frederik Duguet said, “First, I would like to repeat that we are setting up the Creative Houses for success. We want them to win. It’s the whole purpose of what we’re doing. Of course, we should keep in mind that not all of them might not be profitable on day one, but the important element will be for the five of them to project into the next years and see to what extent they can continue to the overall Ubisoft performance improvement.”</p>



<p>He continued, “Now, if in some years from now a house is not profitable, if it underperforms versus management expectations, then ultimately we will look at the root cause. We will discuss with the GM and the team in charge to see whether there is a way to bring it to performance and profitability.”</p>



<p>“So, selling a house will be a possibility, but it shouldn’t be the first route to work on. If we open the perspective, and the options, if we find a powerful and motivated partner, and we agree on long term vision, and it comes with an important cash injection, with the force to invest in the future of the brands, if this is good for the house or Ubisoft, it is something to consider.”</p>







<h2 id="h-employee-sentiment">Employee Sentiment</h2>



<p>Those employees who spoke to Insider Gaming under the condition of anonymity say that the Town Hall did very little to reassure them about the future. </p>



<p>Many of the critical questions were seemingly dismissed or danced around, and did little to ease the feeling that the company faces uncertain times.</p>

<p>WWE 2K26 reintroduces classic features, as shown in a new gameplay trailer.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> will be released worldwide on March 13. Players who pre-order any premium version of the game will gain access on March 6. The first <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report from 2K Games</a> focused on new gameplay additions, including previously reported match types, new interactive environments, and AI customization that delivers greater realism than ever before.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="WWE 2K26 | Gameplay Ringside Report" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hDLny0qlnoI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<h2>AI Settings and Customization Features in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>The ability to simulate WWE matches is a massive draw in modern video games. As such, AI must control certain WWE Superstars so they act as they would on WWE Raw or WWE SmackDown every week. In WWE 2K26, a significant upgrade gives players greater control over how the AI handles certain professional wrestlers.</p>



<p>The new AI Sequences system, available in the Create-A-Moveset section, lets players string together a sequence of signature moves to tell the AI exactly how to use a specific WWE star. Once these sequences are configured, the AI will always attempt to execute the selected moves in the configured order. Also, AI has been retooled to display more natural reactions and authentic animations between moves.</p>







<h2 id="h-start-of-match-actions-return-in-wwe-2k26">Start of Match Actions Return in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>WWE 2K26 reintroduces “Start of Match Actions.” This means that at the start of every match, wrestlers will perform a brief sequence to enhance realism. Whether that is chain wrestling, a rock-paper-scissors-like system first added to the games over a decade ago, a handshake offering, the ability to trade blows and a striking exchange, or simply playing to the crowd, this adds more realism to each match and harkens back to the original WWE SmackDown vs. Raw from 2004, where there were also opening match sequences.</p>



<p>Entrances are also more interactive this year, allowing players to control key gestures, taunts, heavy pyro customization, and much more.</p>



<p>Not only is all of this added, but so is the ability to launch surprise attacks, stack tables, fight on barricades, use title belts as a weapon in new ways, and more. The additions of Booker T and Wade Barrett to the commentary table were touted as well.</p>
