<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> is updating some of the most popular game modes in major ways.</p>



<p>It’s WWE Royal Rumble weekend, and that means that there is a major push regarding marketing for the upcoming WWE 2K26 video game. <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/wrestling/wwe/cm-punk-liv-morgan-bron-breakker-talk-wwe-2k26-as-new-game-info-released">New information from The Takedown on SI </a>confirms several updates coming to the game modes. </p>



<p>In addition to confirming several updates previously reported by Insider Gaming, new details give plenty for longtime fans of WWE video games to be excited about, as it pertains to customization, replay value, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-universe-mode-gets-a-draft-and-more">WWE Universe Mode Gets a Draft and More</h2>



<p>Universe Mode has been a focal point of WWE video games since 2010. Sandbox mode in WWE games lets players be the promoter they’ve always wanted to be, setting up cards, creating rivalries, managing injuries, and more.</p>



<p>This year, WWE 2K26 not only adds a Draft to Universe Mode to increase realism, but also introduces a new Universe Creation Wizard, additional promo types to add more drama to your rivalries, a “Watch Show” mode for those that like pure sim experiences, and more.</p>



<p>MyGM Mode, which acts as a more short-term brand management sim, is also getting some improvements. There will be support for more match types than ever, including intergender and eight-man matches, more shows per season, and new management challenges.</p>



<p>MyRISE, the game’s version of MyPLAYER from NBA 2K, also features major improvements, including the ability to continue their career mode beyond completing the campaign. This year’s campaign will also feature new decision-based storylines in which your choice to keep your customized WWE Superstar as a babyface or a heel will affect the story.</p>



<p>The Island mode will also come to PC for the first time ever.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-creation-suite-options-spark-new-life-in-wwe-2k26">New Creation Suite Options Spark New Life in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>In addition to all of those updates, there are major improvements to the Creation Suite. For the first time, there will be 200 Create-A-Superstar save slots. This is double the existing amount and provides plenty of options not only to create your own stars but also to download popular stars from other promotions. Additionally, Community Creations now supports 2,000 images, advanced body/face morphing, and two-tone hair blending for maximized Superstar and arena customization.</p>



<p>The game is scheduled to release to the general public on March 13, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-pricing-revealed-for-all-editions/">if you pre-order a premium edition</a>, you can get Early Access. For more WWE 2K26, learn about the forthcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-is-going-to-have-a-ringside-pass/" id="173150">Ringside Pass.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/road-to-vostok-early-access-date-trailer/</link>
            <guid>1421290</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Road to Vostok, a highly anticipated first-person survival shooter from a lone developer, is hitting early access in April. This news follows years of development that have yielded multiple demos, scores of evolutions, and the emergence of one of the most exciting games in the hardcore shooter space.</p>



<p>Fans of games like Escape from Tarkov will be enthused by Road to Vostok. While it’s not an extraction shooter, it boasts a very similar aesthetic and core concepts, and it’s set in a ‘post-apocalyptic border zone between Finland and Russia.’</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-road-to-vostok-coming-out">When is Road to Vostok Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Road to Vostok, being developed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/road-to-vostok/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by a one-man Finnish team</a>, is the culmination of years of work. Before putting his head down and creating this all-new survival game, ‘Antti’ served in the armed forces and taught visual game design. His efforts have come to life in Road to Vostok, a single-player survival title with hardcore mechanics.</p>



<p>The game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1963610/Road_to_Vostok/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blurb on Steam</a>, where you can wishlist the game in anticipation of its early access release, tells you all you need to know:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Road to Vostok is a hardcore single-player survival game set in a post-apocalyptic border zone between Finland and Russia. Survive, loot, plan and prepare to cross the border into Vostok, a permadeath zone where one mistake can end it all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Antti uploaded a new trailer for Road to Vostok earlier today, confirming that the game will hit early access on <strong>April 7, 2026</strong>. It will be priced at €14.99, including a 25% discount that starts at launch and runs for two weeks, at which point it will become €19.99.</p>



<p>We’ve been covering Road to Vostok for years, and our impressions of the demos this solo developer has produced have always been stellar. It’s sure to be a hit with fans of games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-review-ultimate-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape from Tarkov</a>, which you can more or less gauge by the game’s new trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Early Access Trailer | Road to Vostok" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTFgTRsz43Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Road to Vostok has first-person shooter mechanics aplenty, but it also has a hideout system, multiple maps, in-game traders, dynamic events that unfold as the game’s lifecycle evolves, and a looter-shooter gameplay loop, all of which are applicable to Tarkov fans everywhere.</p>



<p>There’s weapon and character customization, weather systems, a day-night cycle, and survival mechanics that involve elements like eating and drinking, as well as inventory and health management.</p>



<p>If you’re eager to explore Road to Vostok when it launches, you won’t have long to wait, as it comes out on April 7th in early access. For now, there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/road-to-vostok-public-demo-2-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a demo on Steam</a> that you can explore right now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>News about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> is rolling in, and one of the most significant changes this year is the introduction of a Ringside Pass, which alters the DLC rollout and more.</p>



<p>WWE 2K26 is slated to release on March 13, and ahead of the 2026 Royal Rumble, news has begun to surface officially about this year’s WWE video game offering. As part of several news items released in a <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/wrestling/wwe/cm-punk-liv-morgan-bron-breakker-talk-wwe-2k26-as-new-game-info-released" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">write-up from the Takedown on SI, </a>it has been confirmed that WWE 2K26’s DLC will be funneled through a ringside pass.</p>



<p>Similar to other battle passes in popular video games, the Ringside Pass offers players additional incentive to play, and there will be XP earned across all offline game modes. The battle pass will include 60 free tiers and 40 premium tiers. Players who reach tier 40 of the Ringside Pass Premium Season will be able to unlock Superstars, cosmetics, customizations, exclusive content for game modes like The Island, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-more-superstars-than-ever-before-will-be-playable-in-wwe-2k26">More Superstars Than Ever Before Will Be Playable in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>Speaking of unlockable Superstars, newly released information confirms that WWE 2K26 will have over 400 playable characters. This makes this year’s offering historic as it contains the largest roster in history. Not only will modern-day stars like CM Punk and Cody Rhodes be joined by legends such as Andre the Giant and Bret Hart, but new Superstars will also join the roster, including Rey Fenix and Blake Monroe.</p>



<p>Furthermore, it has been confirmed that the King of Kings deluxe edition of the game will include the Standard Edition, Joe Hendry Pack, Ringside Pass Premium Season 1 and 32,500 VC, and more. The Attitude Era Edition will include access to Ringside Pass Premium Seasons 1-4, plus additional playable characters specific to the Attitude Era, such as Chyna ’97.</p>



<p>The Monday Night War Edition, the most expensive edition of the game, will include access to six seasons of the premium Ringside Pass, playable versions of some specific legends such as Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage, and there will be a playable arena for WCW Thunder from 1998.</p>

<p>WWE 2K returns to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a>, and with it comes a number of new features exclusive to the platform.</p>



<p>This year’s game will include several options that weren’t available to players in WWE 2K25.</p>







<p>Thanks to the design of the system, WWE 2K26 features touchscreen and mouse support on the console. There will also be the ability to play with a single Joy-Con as well GameShare and GameChat support.</p>



<p>Circling back on the mouse support, players will be able to use the built-in Joy-Con mouse within Creation Suite for face and body paint. </p>



<p>And one feature that was missing last year that makes its way to the game is image uploading and cross-platform community creations.</p>







<p>WWE 2K26 launches on March 13. However, if you buy one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-pricing-revealed-for-all-editions/" id="172964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more expensive versions</a> of the game, you will get access a week before everyone else on March 6.</p>

<p>Another major update listed is a fix to player movement issues, including excessive Sprint jumps and unintended movements. It is emphasized that this will not affect movement on a large scale but will address the specific issues reported by players.</p>

Also, the issue where destroying the B flag could potentially cause a blackout has been fixed.</p>



<p>Additionally, the update addresses a PlayStation 5 issue where ownership validation failed during system events, causing connectivity problems. Plus, the update has resolved an out-of-memory crash on Xbox Series S when loading Daily and Weekly Challenges.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Nioh 3 Have Early Access? Demo Status, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nioh-3-early-access/</link>
            <guid>1421185</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been a few years since the last Nioh game. Team Ninja has been sharpening its blades and skills with other projects, but it’s time for the company’s main Soulslike to return. The latest information on Nioh 3’s early access is interesting.</p>



<p>The question of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nioh3.jpg" id="147929" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh</a> being the best non-<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/fromsoftware/" id="87617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FromSoftware</a> series rages on. The Nioh franchise is dripping in Yokai-infested excellence, and each game is more refined than the last. Nioh 3 has gone bigger and bolder with its open-world approach, and it’s no wonder that so many of you want it now.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-there-nioh-3-early-access">Is There Nioh 3 Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Strike your anger down. Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Ninja is not offering early access as an incentive for Nioh 3 early adopters.</strong></p>



<p>Why should people who pay a bit more get to see those game-over screens sooner? This is the motto for Nioh 3, as even though the game has multiple editions, none of them feature an early access bonus.</p>



<p>There <em>are </em>cool perks, such as a Season Pass and exclusive gear, but you get to use them on Nioh 3’s launch day—like everyone else.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-nioh-3-have-a-demo">Does Nioh 3 Have A Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>If you simply need to play Nioh 3 before release, there is a lengthy demo you can download for free on all applicable gaming platforms.</strong></p>



<p>There’s no Xbox version of Nioh 3, sadly, but if you are on PC or PS5, you can download a free demo to give you a fairly hefty look at the game, how it plays, and if it’s for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-download-nioh-3-demo">How To Download Nioh 3 Demo</h2>



<p><strong>Go to the PlayStation Store or Steam, search for Nioh 3, and you can buy and download the free Nioh 3 demo.</strong></p>



<p>Thousands of players have already left glowing reviews for the Nioh 3 demo. If you want to try it yourself, follow these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Decide if you’re playing on PlayStation 5 or PC.</li>



<li>Go to the PlayStation Store on PS5 or Steam for PC.</li>



<li>Search for <strong>Nioh 3 Demo</strong>.</li>



<li>Add it to your library on either format.</li>



<li>Once it’s finished downloading, you can get stuck in!</li>
</ol>



<p>Here’s even more good news for you: Your <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nioh-3-demo-progress-carry-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3 demo progress will carry over to the full game</a>. It’s the equivalent of starting the full game and making a dent in potential progress.</p>



<p>Will the Nioh 3 demo keep you going until February 6? Or are you going to replay an older Nioh or wait patiently for the third game in the meantime?
