            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Today’s NYT Connections puzzle is a mighty forgiving one, but that doesn’t mean you don’t still want some handy hints to make things <strong>even easier</strong>. It’s almost the weekend, and, understandably, you might want to give your brain a bit of a rest today.</p>



<p>With that being said, I’ve got the latest NYT Connections hints and solutions for you below, so that you can get the fastest answers possible for today’s puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-23">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 23)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #865:</p>



<ul>
<li>DOGGY</li>



<li>FINE</li>



<li>PRIZE</li>



<li>SWAG</li>



<li>STONE</li>



<li>KITTY</li>



<li>BALL</li>



<li>DUCKY</li>



<li>BIRDIE</li>



<li>GO</li>



<li>SWELL</li>



<li>PURSE</li>



<li>MIXED</li>



<li>POT</li>



<li>PUCK</li>



<li>DANDY</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words all describe things going delightfully well, in a retro kind of way.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each of these can refer to a collection of winnings, often in games or competitions.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>You’ll find one of these in curling, another in badminton, and the rest in other Olympic sports.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word completes a common phrase ending in “bag.” Think dogs, surprises, and party favors.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 23.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-23-865">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 23 (#865)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– DANDY, DUCKY, FINE, SWELL</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – KITTY, POT, PRIZE, PURSE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BALL, BIRDIE, PUCK, STONE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – DOGGY, GO, MIXED, SWAG</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Trials Developer Ubisoft RedLynx To Lose 60 Employees In Layoffs, Become A Mobile Developer]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/trials-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoffs-mobile-developer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trials-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-to-lose-60-employees-in-layoffs-become-a-mobile-developer.1332004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft Redlynx, the developers of the Trails franchise, is set to lose up to 60 employees in the latest round of layoffs by parent company Ubisoft. </p>



<p>A statement posted on <a href="https://www.redlynx.com/restructuring-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the studio’s website</a> says that Ubisoft is moving forward with a <strong>“restructuring proposal for RedLynx as part of the company’s global efforts to simplify, reduce costs, and ensure a stronger prioritization and efficiency across the company’s worldwide studio network.”</strong></p>



<p>Redlynx says that it will negotiate with studio staff before making a decision on the proposal, which focuses “primarily” on the administration and production teams. These negotiations with the staff are scheduled to start on October 30 and will end by the end of November.</p>



<p><strong>“If materialized, this proposal would result in the reduction of maximum 60 positions,” </strong>they say.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-ubisoft-proposal-for-redlynx">What Is The Ubisoft Proposal For Redlynx?</h2>



<p>As far as what this proposal entails, it was said that Redlynx would “refocus” from being a multi-platform developer to one that’s “specialized in small screens”. </p>



<p>“This would enable it to position itself for sustainable success and optimize its resources to best leverage the studio’s unique expertise—starting with two unannounced mobile projects the studio is leading,” the statement reads.</p>



<p>Ubisoft RedLynx managing director Celine Pasula added that, “We are confident that, with the proposed changes, RedLynx would continue to play a meaningful role in Ubisoft’s future—driving technical excellence on mobile devices, and strengthening Ubisoft’s cross and multi-platform capabilities on small screens to expand our audience reach.”</p>



<p>The news of layoffs at Ubisoft RedLynx comes alongside the announcement that another Ubisoft studio, Massive Entertainment, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-is-laying-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having its own wave</a> of job terminations.</p>
