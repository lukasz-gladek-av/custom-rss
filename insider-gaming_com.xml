<p>Schedule 1 players have been warned about malware in some of the game’s most popular mods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/certain-schedule-1-mods-confirmed-to-contain-trojan-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, the official Schedule 1 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jx6vl8/urgent_psa_malware_found_in_2_popular_schedule_1/?share_id=AvZ_njVPdRrRpo99mWvCM&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> has released an “URGENT PSA” for its members, bringing their attention to malware found in popular mods. Players have been advised to uninstall these mods instantly, or they could get in trouble.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-mods-that-were-found-with-malware">Schedule 1 Mods That Were Found with Malware</h2>



<p>The first Schedule 1 Mod found with malware is Froggyp1’s “Increased Stack Size Limit.” The subreddit moderator has confirmed that the original creator has sold their account, and the new owner has introduced a version “which is VERIFIED to be a trojan.” The owner has been banned, and their malicious uploads removed; however, players should look through their files to be sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next Schedule 1 mod in question is “Backpack Mod Reupload,” and this time, even NexusMods have confirmed that it is malware. After deleting the files and changing their passwords, players can take two suggested actions: First, they can use reputable anti-virus or anti-malware software to search individual files for malware. The other way is to use online virus scanning services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the creator of Schedule 1 has provided <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a console port update</a> after imitations appeared on PlayStation. Also, its recent update added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-april-7-update-adds-pawn-shop-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Pawn Shop and a Boutique</a>.

<p>Borderlands director has stated that the movie flopped because of COVID, as you can’t create a large-scale movie on Zoom Calls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an appearance on <a href="https://puck.news/podcast_episode/director-eli-roth-will-kill-you-on-screen-for-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Town</a> podcast (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/eli-roth-on-why-the-borderlands-movie-sucked-you-cant-prep-a-movie-on-that-scale-over-zoom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>), Borderlands director Eli Roth elaborated on how COVID and Zoom Calls hindered the movie’s development. Roth explained that none of them could have predicted “how complicated things were gonna be with COVID,” and the complications became visible not just while shooting but in other processes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-movie-failed-due-to-covid-and-zoom">Borderlands Movie Failed Due to COVID and Zoom</h2>



<p>Roth added that it was total chaos for them, having to do reshoots and pick-up shoots, having six people across different sets, and having each one shut down when a city opened up. More complications were added when there was a COVID outbreak in the area, which meant they “couldn’t prep in a room together,” meet their stunt people or do any pre-visualisation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roth concludes, “ You can’t prep a movie on that scale over Zoom”. They thought that they would be able to pull off Borderlands with COVID and Zoom calls; instead, Roth explains, “We got our asses handed to us a bit.”</p>



<p>Borderlands movie had a disappointing release, standing at 10% on the Tomatometer on Rotten Tomatoes. Fans were highly disappointed with the deviation from the source material and some of the casting choices for their favourite characters. However, it wasn’t all bad, as Take-Two’s CEO recently stated that the movie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-borderlands-movie-disappointing-but-helped-sell-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helped sell games</a> even though it was ‘disappointing’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Borderlands 4 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to Nintendo Switch 2</a> in 2025.

<p>Call of Duty: Warzone skyrocketed in popularity in the last couple of weeks, thanks to the return of Verdansk. It was a grand reintroduction of the map, and millions of fans poured back into the battle royale title to see what – if anything – had changed from the last time it was in the game, in 2021.</p>



<p>Corsair is the latest tech manufacturer to unveil a Call of Duty-themed range to celebrate the return of Verdansk. The team uncovered a small but mighty range of products that includes a <strong>single keyboard keycap worth $79</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’re the ultimate Warzone fan, you’ll want to secure one.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-are-we-dropping">Where Are We Dropping</h2>



<p>Corsair’s brands have colluded to bring Warzone fans worldwide <a href="https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/s/call-of-duty#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a range of exclusive items</a>, including an on-theme Scuf controller, patterned DRAM, and a custom keyboard <strong>with </strong>a collectible keycap worth $79.</p>



<p>That’s right – it’s <strong>a single keycap for your keyboard, </strong>and it has a price tag of $79.</p>



<p>The keyboard comes from Drop, and it’s dubbed the CSTM80, a tenkeyless design with a nice camoflague detail around some of the keys. If you want to flex your Warzone fandom, you can purchase the <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-artisan-keycap-call-of-duty-warzone-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Drop Artisan keycap</a> that features a miniaturised rendition of the Verdansk Stadium encased in smooth resin.</p>



<p>That’s not all, though. If you purchase the fancy Warzone keycap, you’ll get a series of exclusive in-game items that you won’t find anywhere else. They’re all Corsair-themed if that’s your kind of thing.</p>



<p>Corsair has also introduced a new Stream Deck model to the existing lineup, which is the perfect companion for all those Warzone streamers out there.</p>



<p>Are you enough of a Call of Duty fan that you’d spend $79 on a single keycap? Let me know in the comments, or hit us up on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>DMZ: Nuclear Survival has just been revealed on Steam, but it has no release date. It’s an open-world, multiplayer survival game that two people in Japan have pieced together, and it looks pretty ambitious. In DMZ: Nuclear Survival, you’ll be charged with building an army and crafting bases while exploring an enormous map and messing around with history.</p>



<p>There’s one heck of a story behind DMZ: Nuclear Survival, but there are enough bizarre elements thrown into the mix to make me question the game’s validity.</p>



<p>For example, you can befriend and fight alongside bears, wolves, and <strong>ostriches</strong>. Interesting.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-make-use-of-the-past">Make Use of the Past</h2>



<p>The core premise of DMZ: Nuclear Survival is that the world has changed thanks to nuclear war, and the planet’s tectonic plates have shifted to form Pangea (again), a super-continent. For some reason, this has made it so that ancient ruins, ‘such as pyramids, terracotta warriors, and Roman temples’ are much easier to excavate.</p>



<p>Not only that, but players can pull relics and valuables from these locations across a procedurally generated map and use them to ‘resurrect powerful soldiers from ancient genes’.</p>



<p>That means alongside your strangely WWI- and WWII-themed private military contractors, you can have Roman soldiers and ‘Eastern martial artists’ fight for you. And bears – don’t forget the bears.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>DMZ: Nuclear Survival will reportedly launch with PvE <strong>and </strong>PvP modes, and dedicated servers will be able to support <strong>over 100 players</strong>. Also, this upcoming survival game will have an offline single-player mode, which is rare in this type of title.</p>



<p>With in-depth base-building mechanics, intense combat scenarios, untold exploration potential, and first-blush visuals that look pretty good, DMZ: Nuclear Survival is either going to be a hit with survival fans, or it’ll be some kind of weird rug-pull.</p>



<p>We’ve seen games like this emerge before with bold promises and nothing to really deliver.</p>



<p>You can wishlist <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3316500/DMZ_Nuclear_Survival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DMZ: Nuclear Survival</a> now, exclusively on Steam.</p>

<p>Sony has announced that it is going to increase the price of the PlayStation 5 (PS5) in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The announcement came via a PlayStation Blog post on Sunday evening.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Starting April 14</a>, the cost of the PS5 Digital Edition in all affected regions and PS5 Physical Edition in both Australia and New Zealand will see an increase. Sony says that the price increase is a “tough decision” due to a “challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates”.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-titanfall-3-rumors-return-and-what-is-xbox-planning-to-show-fans-this-year">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/podcast-titanfall-3-rumors-return-and-what-is-xbox-planning-to-show-fans-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Titanfall 3 Rumors Return And What Is Xbox Planning To Show Fans This Year?</a></h6>



<p>The new PS5 prices in the four regions are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Europe:&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>PS5 Digital Edition €499.99&nbsp;(Physical remains the same)</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>£429.99&nbsp;(Physical remains the same)</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Australia:</strong>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>PS5 Standard (Physical) Edition – AUD $829.95</li>



<li>PS5 Digital Edition – AUD $749.95</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>New Zealand:</strong>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>PS5 Standard (Physical) Edition – NZD $949.95 </li>



<li>PS5 Digital Edition – NZD $859.95</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The cost of the PS5 Pro will remain the same. And Sony is also lowering the price of the PS5 Disc Drive slightly. </p>



<p>Those new prices are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Europe:&nbsp;</strong>€79.99</li>



<li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;£69.99&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Australia:</strong>&nbsp;AUD $124.95</li>



<li><strong>New Zealand:</strong>&nbsp;NZD $139.95</li>
</ul>



<p>As of publishing, it’s unclear if Sony plans to increase the price of the PS5 in other regions such as the United States and Canada. Currently, the United States’ planned tariffs are on hold for 90 days. Should they be reintroduced, it could continue to upend the same market that led Nintendo to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delaying pre-orders</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-in-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aforementioned countries</a>.</p>

<p>Bongo Cat was released on Steam on March 5, and in the time it has been online, it has racked up a review rating of <strong>Overwhelmingly Positive</strong>. As I write this, 130,000 people are playing the game on Steam, but <strong>what even is it</strong>? The game’s description on Steam doesn’t give anything away, leaving many to wonder what Bongo Cat is and why it is going insane on Steam.</p>



<p>Here’s the description, which will make more sense once you’ve read through the explanation below:</p>



<p><em>‘Bongo cat needs your help. Bongo cat needz more hatz!!! Every time you press a key, Bongo Cat will punch your taskbar. Type, click, play, and work to collect more points. Which hats will you find?’</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-hatz">More Hatz</h2>



<p>If you remember the banana-themed game on Steam that was aptly named <strong>Banana</strong>, then you’ll understand some of the premise for Bongo Cat.</p>



<p>In Banana, players were presented with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/banana-steam-make-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a banana that they clicked on</a>. The more they clicked, the more banana skins (get it?) they earned, and the kicker was that they could take those skins and trade them on the Steam Marketplace. That’s how Banana managed to skyrocket to a peak concurrent player count of more than 900,000 Steam users.</p>



<p>What is Bongo Cat? Think of it as being <strong>Banana</strong>, but replace the fruit with a cat, and instead of doing nothing when you click on it, the cat slaps your taskbar. It sits over whatever you’re doing, and everything you do will earn another slap – clicking, typing, and so on. As you rack up points, you’ll earn new cats, hats, and other items, such as emotes and floating icons.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-point-of-bongo-cat">What’s the Point of Bongo Cat?</h2>



<p>It’s not enough to know what Bongo Cat is, you must also understand <strong>what the point of the game is</strong>.</p>



<p>It doesn’t really have much of a point, but the game’s <strong>feature list </strong>on Steam mentions that it will be ‘A friend while working hard.’</p>



<p>As you collect points, you can unlock items that range from Common to Legendary, and when you get them, you’re free to trade and sell them within the Steam Marketplace. </p>



<p>And now you understand why Bongo Cat is soaring in popularity – it’s because there’s a slight chance of making some money on the game.</p>



<p>If you want to give Bongo Cat a try, you get get it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419430/Bongo_Cat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for free now on Steam</a>.</p>
