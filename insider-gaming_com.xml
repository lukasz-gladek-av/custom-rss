            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The sale of EA to the Saudi Arabian-owned Public Investment Fund has been approved by shareholders. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the purchase</a> still needs government approval before it can go through.</p>



<p>Earlier in the year, EA announced that PIF would be purchasing a majority stake in the gaming company. The deal, set for $55 billion, would lead to PIF acquiring 93.4% of EA. While the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-it-will-keep-creative-control-if-saudi-arabia-sale-goes-through/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would still run things</a> as it would in the United States, it would be mainly owned by Saudi Arabia. Pushback from fans and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/electronic-arts-sale-facing-resistance-us-politicians/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even US government officials</a> have arose since the announcement, but nothing has been amended. Now, the company’s shareholders have moved forward with the deal, further solidifying it.</p>











<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>As of 2:03pm PT, EA's shareholders have officially approved EA's $55 billion sale to a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. </p><p>The deal will next need to receive approval from government regulators</p></div>— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/2003225658982576557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/2003225658982576557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet from journalist Stephen Totilo</a>, EA shareholders have approved the deal of the company being sold to Saudi Arabia’s PIF. The only thing truly left is for government regulators to approve the deal. No word as to when that deal will come in has been said as of yet. </p>



<p>Despite the buyout, EA will maintain creative control of the company. It’s not fully known what PIF will play within the company. EA did extremely well in 2025, with Battlefield 6 topping the charts in sales and it’s sports titles doing great, as well. Still, given the many warnings from government and fans, as well as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-bioware-employees-worried-about-more-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studios at EA like Bioware</a>, the direction the company can go is up in the air.</p>



<p>What do you think of shareholders at EA approving the sale? Do you think it will pass government regulators? Have thoughts on the whole sale, in general?
