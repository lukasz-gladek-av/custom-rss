            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After an earlier claim—or belief, depending on how you want to look at it—stating otherwise, some insiders have started to say that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is not coming out in 2026. In addition, it won’t be in attendance at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Last year at The Game Awards, Naughty Dog revealed its next title,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. The sci-fi set space fantasy looked way different than previous studio titles, minus some familiar faces. Hype for the title has been palpable, so when former gaming journalist Colin Moriarty appeared to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-2026-release-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claim the game</a> would release in 2026, many were excited. However, it seems it would be short-lived, as credible insiders have come to debunk the report, including Moriarty himself.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-at-the-game-awards-2025-insiders-state">No Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet at The Game Awards 2025, Insiders State</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I sympathize with being misquoted. He was speculating and people on the internet pretended he wasn't. Either way, this caused people to confirm to me it won't be out in 2026 and it won't be at TGAs. </p><p>I'm not interested in keeping score on who said what right on a podcast.</p></div>— Grubb (@JeffGrubb) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1992351916517683631?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>After Colin Moriarty’s comments went viral, some insiders <strong>quickly hopped onto social media</strong> to <strong>debunk the report of Intergalactic releasing in 2026</strong>. The first to do so was <strong>Jason Schreier</strong>, a notable name in the gaming industry. Commenting on a /GamingLeaksandRumours post, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p3zwoe/comment/nq8f5f9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he states</a>, “<strong>Can assure you that Intergalactic is not coming out in 2026.</strong>“</p>



<p>Then, video game journalist and insider Jeff Grubb <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1992351916517683631?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on Twitter</a> that not only would Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet <strong>not come out in 2026</strong>, but <strong>it won’t be at The Game Awards this year</strong>. Following suit, Colin Moriarty <a href="https://x.com/longislandviper/status/1992340284026331442">commented on social media</a> that his words, used in the report, <strong>were taken out of context</strong> and that <strong>it was his opinion</strong>.</p>



<p>Either way, it does look like Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will be quite a while away. Neil Druckmann himself, who is directing the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-will-fans-see-more-of-intergalactic-neil-druckmann-wont-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">couldn’t confirm</a> when we’d see the title again. It will be interesting to see when more will come out, though it’ll be exciting to watch gameplay. Naughty Dog’s track record is rather solid, so, whatever year it does launch, it’ll be one to watch out for.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stellar Blade 2 Going Multiplatform]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new recruitment post, Shift Up is planning to make Stellar Blade 2 multiplatform. Furthermore, it may hint at Stellar Blade coming to Xbox and Nintendo.</p>







<p>If you haven’t played Stellar Blade, you’ve definitely heard of it. Releasing in 2024, the Korean-made title by Shift Up made headlines for its insane graphics and action gameplay. Despite controversy regarding its protagonist, Eve, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-not-censored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stirred in all stages</a> of development, the game was a huge success, critically and fan-wise. It was nominated for several awards, including some Game Awards, especially for its soundtrack. Due to huge positivity, the company was quick to say more is on the way, even going so far as to say <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before 2027</a>. Now, a new development has been revealed, and it’s one that bodes well for the sequel’s future.</p>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-2-coming-to-various-platforms-says-shift-up">Stellar Blade 2 Coming to ‘Various Platforms’, Says Shift Up</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The news comes from <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/news/news.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=318&amp;page=1&amp;code=news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recruitment post</a> on Shift Up’s official Korean website. In it, the studio states that it is looking to build out its team for Stellar Blade 2. The title, said to be currently in development, plans to bring the epic action fans loved from the original for next-gen. On that note, Shift Up is aiming to have Stellar Blade 2 launch be multiplatform, expanding to other consoles and PC. </p>



<p>Interestingly enough, the original Stellar Blade was a PlayStation 5 exclusive, only seeing a PC release earlier this year. As of now, no port of the title has been announced for Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch 2. One has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-could-come-to-xbox-and-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored for a bit</a>, though nothing concrete has been said yet. With Stellar Blade 2 now multiplatform, perhaps this means we could see Stellar Blade break exclusivity and go to Xbox and Nintendo soon.</p>







<p>What do you think of Stellar Blade 2 going multiplatform? When do you think Stellar Blade will go to other consoles? Think it’ll release on Nintendo Switch 2?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-2026-release-report/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report claims that Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is releasing sometime in 2026. Even more so, information may be revealed at this year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Awards</a> in December.</p>







<p>When it comes to storytelling, no studio does it better than Naughty Dog. From the adventurous Uncharted series to the excellent The Last of Us titles, it has yet to really miss. At The Game Awards 2024, the studio unveiled its next title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Sporting an all-star cast led by Uncharted’s Tati Gabrielle, the title looks to go outside the studio’s grounded work and go out of this world, literally. While not much is known outside of a CGI trailer, it seems we won’t have to wait long to know more, if the report from a YouTuber is correct.</p>



<p>UPDATE: After this article was published, several insiders debunked the 2026 report. Furthermore, Colin Moriarty stated that his words were taken out of context and were speculation on his end. Our link to the new story can be found <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-2026-debunk-claim/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In a podcast with Dan Allen Gaming, former gaming journalist Colin Moriarty spoke on a matter of topics. One game in particular that came into focus was Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. The clip in question comes around the <a href="https://youtu.be/oKkiw9KpgKA?si=YsxaBuDLpL-oqeWx&amp;t=4187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">1:09:47</a> mark. Speaking on the game, Colin states,</p>



<p>“<strong>I believe we’ll see it at The Game Awards, I think next year it’ll be good to go</strong>,” states Moriarty. “<strong>Maybe they [Naughty Dog] will delay it, but based on the way they’re hiring and also things I’m hearing about people interacting with the game, and they’re also hiring for localization now, they’re getting into the end, and it’s a sign that everything is kinda locked down and content complete. I won’t be surprised if it was out this time next year.”</strong></p>



<p>Sony or Naughty Dog have not confirmed when Intergalactic will release, so take the news with a grain of salt. That said, Naughty Dog has been working on The Heretic Prophet since 2020, so it won’t be surprising to see more before the year’s end. It would be coming out in a packed year, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-gta6-fall-2026-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Wolverine</a> releasing, but the studio can hold it’s own. Funnily enough, the original Last of Us came out when Grand Theft Auto 5 was released, so it would be a neat coincidence for the two to battle it out for Game of the Year.</p>
