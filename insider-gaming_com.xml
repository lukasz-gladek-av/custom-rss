<p>GSC Game World has just revealed that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has sold one million copies since being released on November 20. In a post on social media, the team also revealed that ‘much more Stalkers’ played the game through the Game Pass subscription service.</p>



<p>STALKER 2 is a relatively divisive game that’s proving to be either a hit or miss for players worldwide. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my recent review for STALKER 2</a> branded it a major success that’s well worth your time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-success-in-the-zone">Success in The Zone</h2>



<p>In the post on social media, GSC Game World wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>No wonder it feels a bit crowdy in the Zone. </p>



<p>A million copies were sold, and much more Stalkers joined the artifact hunt with Game Pass. </p>



<p>This is just the start of our unforgettable adventure. The Heart of Chornobyl emanates stronger with each of us. </p>



<p>Thank you, Stalkers!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>STALKER 2 was a long time coming. On and off, the team was working on Heart of Chornobyl for more than a decade, undergoing many struggles and tribulations, least of all being the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which uprooted the studio and led to the tragic passing of some GSC developers.</p>



<p>It’s a big win for Game Pass, it seems. GSC hasn’t been forthcoming with the numbers, but stressing that ‘much more Stalkers’ are enjoying the game through the Game Pass service is an indication that it’s popular enough on the platform. Despite it being ‘free’ on Game Pass, the game sold like wildfire on some platforms – on Steam, it peaked at over 100,000 players on launch day.</p>

<p>As you explore The Zone in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>, you’ll come across an abundance of items to pick up, from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-to-do-with-pdas-in-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PDAs</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-use-artifacts-in-stalker-2-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Artifacts</a> to guns like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-find-lullaby-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lullaby</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/find-riemann-solve-safe-code-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riemann</a>. Speaking of guns, some that you find while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-fast-travel-in-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roaming the open world</a> may have a red shield icon indicating their broken status. </p>



<p>If you’ve come across these diminished weapons and are wondering what your options are, we have you covered. Here’s what to do with broken weapons in Stalker 2, as well as what we recommend depending on your desired outcome.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-do-with-broken-guns-in-stalker-2">What to do with Broken guns in Stalker 2</h2>



<ul>
<li>Repair it at a Technician</li>



<li>Take the ammo and leave it</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want to keep and use the weapon, we recommend having it<strong> repaired by a Technician</strong> like Lens in Zalissya. This should only be done if you really like and want to use the weapon, as it can be an expensive process. You can check out our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-repair-weapons-in-stalker-2-easy-best-method/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide on how to repair weapons</a> for a full breakdown.</p>



<p>You <strong>can’t sell broken weapons</strong>, and repairing them to sell is inefficient since you won’t make any profit. So, if you don’t want to use it, it’s best to <strong>take the ammo out of the weapon and leave it behind</strong>.</p>



<p>This all goes for broken weapons with the red shield icon, but you’ll also find weapons with a yellow shield icon.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-to-do-with-damaged-weapons-in-stalker-2">What to do with damaged weapons in Stalker 2</h2>



<p>A yellow shield icon in <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stalker 2</a> means the weapon is <strong>damaged but not broken</strong>. It can still be used, but it can also be sold for some quick cash. As expected, damaged weapons will sell for less, but it’s still not worth repairing them before selling, as it’ll only cut into your profits.</p>



<p>You can track a weapon’s health with the Durability stat, which is found at the bottom of the weapon tab when hovering over it in the inventory. </p>



<p>The best option here is to sell it if you’re not too fussed with the gun, but if you like the weapon and want to continue using it, get it repaired for safekeeping.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ghosts-of-tabor-psvr2-release-date-pushed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ghosts of Tabor, the high-energy extraction shooter built exclusively for VR, has been delayed from coming to PSVR2 until early 2025, the developer has revealed. It was originally intended to be released with the ‘December wipe’ but owing to a complex development path, the team has had to delay the launch by a few months.</p>



<hr>







<p>Ghosts of Tabor has been dubbed ‘Escape from Tarkov VR’ by some, and that’s damn close to being true. Since being released in March 2023, Ghosts of Tabor has turned heads in the VR space, pulling in thousands of positive reviews and really standing out as the go-to option for anyone seeking the most immersive extraction shooter experience possible.</p>



<p>In a post <a href="https://x.com/ghostsoftabor/status/1859658154792955972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a> and the game’s Discord server, it was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We know the excitement around the PSVR2 launch of Ghosts of Tabor is through the roof – and trust us, we share that excitement! However, I want to be completely upfront with you: porting Tabor to PSVR2 has proven to be more complex than we anticipated, both for us and our partners.</p>



<p>To deliver the experience you deserve, we’ll need a bit more time. We’ve allocated additional resources to make this final push and are working tirelessly to bring it to you as early as possible in 2025.</p>



<p>Pre-orders will open once we’ve secured a timeline and confirmed the launch date.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Ghosts of Tabor, players enter harsh environments hellbent on surviving, and to that end, they must scavenge resources, eat, drink, and fight other players, all while seeking to secure top-tier loot and successfully extracting from the map to land a win. It has been praised for its detail and depth, and from customisation to in-game trading, there’s plenty of meat on Tabor’s bones.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/team-falcons-wins-esports-org-of-the-year-at-saudi-backed-esports-awards.1042587/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/team-falcons-esports-org-of-the-year-saudi-arabia/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Esports Awards have ended for another year, and many trophies changed hands on the night. One award that has the esports community up in arms is the title of ‘Esports Organisation of the Year’, which went to Team Falcons.</p>



<p>Team Falcons was founded in 2017 but the brand made almost no waves at all until 2022, when the inaugural ‘Gamers8’ event took place in Riyadh. This Saudi Arabian organisation is backed by the nation’s government, and many have long been sceptical about the legitimacy of the organisation and its funding.</p>



<p>A while ago, The Esports Awards signed a three-year deal with Saudi Arabia’s Esports World Cup Foundation, pledging to host the event in Riyadh for the next three iterations.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-a-problem">That’s a Problem</h2>



<p>Team Falcons has investment from and ties to the Saudi Arabian government via the PIF and Savvy Games Group. The Esports World Cup, which took place earlier this year, is managed by ESL FACEIT, which is wholly owned by Savvy, and by extension, the Saudi government.</p>



<p>In August, Team Falcons won the grand championship at the Esports World Cup after winning more tournaments and fielding more teams than any other organisation in the world. Before, during, and after the event, Team Falcons was able to buy up some of the best esports players in the world to fill out rosters.</p>



<p>All this was achieved by an organisation founded in 2017, which didn’t really gain any traction until it started to receive sizeable investments from the Saudi government. It was part of what the community refers to as ‘esportswashing’, with the nation’s officials seeking to clean up the country’s image by investing heavily in esports and gaming.</p>



<p>Here are some facts:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team Falcons started winning in Dota 2 this year after picking up some of the world’s best players</li>



<li>Team Falcons’ Counter-Strike exploits have gotten nowhere despite splashing the cash to sign huge players (like s1mple)</li>



<li>Team Falcons did nothing in Apex Legends until the Esports World Cup after signing one of the winningest players in the space</li>



<li>Team Falcons produced little in the way of results in Rocket League until Gamers8 and the Esports World Cup</li>



<li>Team Falcons secured a spot in the COD League (Vegas Falcons) despite having an awful track record in the game’s multiplayer scene</li>



<li>Team Falcons has dominated Warzone tournaments thanks to signing the most capable players in the space</li>
</ul>



<p>Before the Saudi line was tapped into, the only thing Team Falcons was really any good at was Fortnite, and a lot of the team’s earnings in that space had come from Gamers8, the Riyadh-based event that was replaced by the Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>It’s surely becoming clear now how this is a problem with esports fans – it’s a matter of pouring as much money into the space as possible because there are no ‘financial fair play’ rules. </p>



<p>To win the Esports Organisation of the Year trophy at The Esports Awards, Team Falcons had to beat:</p>



<ul>
<li>Natus Vincere</li>



<li>Vitality</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Gen G</li>



<li>T1 Esports</li>



<li>Fnatic</li>



<li>Team Spirit</li>
</ul>



<p>Team Falcons’ crowning achievement for 2024 is winning an event that it flooded with teams to gain the maximum advantage possible. It also won that event, which is backed by the Saudi government, while being backed by the Saudi government, in Saudi.</p>



<p>But hey, congratulations on the award.</p>
