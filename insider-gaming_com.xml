<p>Obsidian Entertainment’s busy 2025 ends with the release of The Outer Worlds 2. If you’re committed to the series, you can upgrade to the Premium Edition to get more bang for your sci-fi buck. But doing so also comes with a great benefit and a bit of thinly-veiled banter.</p>



<p>With so many big releases toward the end of 2025, it’s easy to forget that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-explained-exact-start-times-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a> is sandwiched in between all of this. The first game was tremendous, and the sci-fi sequel is just as good, if not better. If you’re really keen, you can go all out for the Premium Edition.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-comes-with-a-flaw">The Outer Worlds 2 Premium Edition Comes With A ‘Flaw’</h2>



<figure><figcaption>DLC and more are coming your way. Image by the PlayStation Store</figcaption></figure>



<p>Chances are, you’ve already checked out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-the-outer-worlds-2-pre-order-bonuses-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all The Outer Worlds 2 Pre-Order Bonuses &amp; Editions</a>. The Premium Edition is the big, bad wolf of the pack. It comes with future DLC expansions, cosmetics, and a digital artbook and soundtrack. But one thing it doesn’t make clear is the Flaw you can gain from it.</p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 has many ‘Flaws,’ all of which give your character permanent attribute afflictions and benefits. The Consumerism Flaw is automatically presented to you for buying the Premium Edition.</p>



<p>“<strong>You’re the reason our marketing works. Promotions and sales have riddled your brain, and you’re more interested in buying the next big thing than in financial planning</strong>,” the Flaw’s description says.</p>



<p>If you accept the Flaw, you gain “-15% Vendor Prices” and “-10% Sell Value at Vendors.” It’s an optional Flaw, so you don’t have to take it, but Obsidian’s self-awareness and humor are very much appreciated on this one. Basically saying ‘We’re glad you bought our game’s most expensive edition, but praise capitalism!’</p>



<p>Have you picked up The Outer Worlds 2? Do you plan to? Let us know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, which is getting more popular by the minute.</p>

<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved is the name of the long-awaited Combat Evolved remake. It brings Halo to PlayStation for the first time ever. However, one of the game’s original developers has noticed some discrepancies in the game’s early footage and questioned the changes, as they alter the game.</p>



<p>Time stood still when the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-halo-dev-criticizes-lame-remake-changes/Combat%20Evolved%20Remake%20Officially%20Announced%20-%20Insider%20Gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Combat Evolved Remake was officially announced</a>. Bungie’s original creation was about to become celebrated once more. This time, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> owners would get to experience history with Halo making its blue-brand debut. Not everyone is as thrilled with the game’s first footage, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-combat-evolved-remake-makes-key-changes-from-original">Halo: Combat Evolved Remake Makes Key Changes From Original </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Which do you prefer? Image from Halo Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Alongside the remake announcement, we also got to witness a special <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-13-minute-gameplay-demo-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">13-minute gameplay demo</a>. It showed off the game’s glorious opening minutes. The graphics look stunning, and it’s the Halo you know, but better.</p>



<p>Well, most people seem to think so. One person who’s not as impressed is former Bungie game designer Jaime Griesemer. The now-creative director at Highwire Games was responsible for numerous roles at Bungie, including designing, developing, tuning, and scripting gameplay objects, missions, core combat principles, and the tutorial and demo.</p>



<p>After seeing the new gameplay, here’s what Griesemer had to say on X:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters. I intentionally placed rocks in the way so you had to fight them on foot. When you can just smash the crates out of the way it wrecks the encounters. But the worst part? They put trees in the landing area of the WooHoo Jump. Lame. @game_fabricator What have they done to beloved B30?!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>@game_fabricator being Marcus Lehto: Former co-creator of Halo, who was recently ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-battlefield-6-director-marcus-lehto-disappointed-with-devs-being-omitted-from-credits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disappointed’ that he and various team members were omitted from the Battlefield 6 credits.</a></p>



<p>Griesemer replied to many commenters on the post. He understood that “You can FORCE the Warthog through the gap in a variety of ways. I literally spent most of a day making it discouraging and difficult but not impossible. You’re welcome!” and that “On further analysis I’m sure it’s because the vehicles take damage and so you’re just as likely to destroy the hog as get it over the rocks. If anything that makes it -worse- because -none- of the vehicle tricks are going to work anymore.”</p>

<p>The talking point here isn’t necessarily the changes made to Halo: Campaign Evolved (as it’s being called) and its first few minutes, but what other tweaks Halo Studios AKA 343 Industries, have made throughout the game.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a big deal? Are you worried about other sections of the game being changed?

<p>We already know more changes are afoot, as it’s confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-library-level-changes-remake-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Library Level is ‘Being Fixed’ for Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>.</p>
