<p>Liquid Swords, the new studio founded by Just Cause creator Christofer Sundberg, has officially unveiled its debut game at the PC Gaming Show today. The earliest teasers for this game pointed to a gritty, narrative-driven open-world title that many likened to Grand Theft Auto 4 in its aesthetic, but now we know exactly what we’re getting into.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the PC Gaming Show, Sundberg and Liquid Swords were all over social media, posting screenshots and talking extensively about ‘Game 1’ coming out of the new studio.</p>







<h2 id="h-liquid-swords-asks-gamers-to-brace-for-impact">Liquid Swords Asks Gamers to Brace for Impact</h2>



<p>Founded by Christofer Sundberg, the co-founder of Avalanche Studios and the creative force behind Just Cause, Liquid Swords has just revealed its inaugural title, Samson: A Tyndalston Story.</p>



<p>This project has been in the works since 2020, and the early teasers posted online referenced a bleak cityscape, suggesting similarities to games like Grand Theft Auto and Max Payne. All we knew previously was that the game was being built in Unreal Engine 5 and that it would be a far cry from Sundberg’s previous titles, like the over-the-top, explosive action series, Just Cause.</p>



<p>The PC Gaming Show played host to the game’s first major trailer, which you can see below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Samson: A Tyndalston Story - Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NbFnkUlyZlo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the lead-up to the trailer dropping, Sundberg revealed that the team at Liquid Swords features talent from Avalanche, Rockstar Games, and other major studios, which makes for a promising road ahead, given the team’s pedigree.</p>



<p>The trailer uncovered a gritty crime thriller backed by gruff voices, muscle cars, and gorgeous visuals. It looks like a perfect contender for games like Grand Theft Auto, which is a very ambitious thing to suggest.</p>



<p>Do you think <strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story </strong>looks like your kind of game? Let us know what you’re thinking about Liquid Swords’ first title on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
