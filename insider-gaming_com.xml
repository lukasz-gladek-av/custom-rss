            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony has announced its brand new Inzone lineup of gaming products. Joining the new product lineup are Inzone H9 II headset, the E9 in-ear headphones, KBD-H75 keyboard, a gaming mouse, and two new mouse pads.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-wide-range-of-peripherals">A Wide Range Of Peripherals</h2>



<p>Starting with the headset, the <strong>H9 II</strong> is the follow up to the original H9. <strong>Retailing for $349.99</strong>, the new headset features up to 30 hours of battery life with quick charging that gives you up to three hours of use on a five minute charge. Other features include a detachable unidirectional 14000kHz super wide band microphone, Bluetooth connectivity, active noise cancelling, and 360 spatial sound.</p>



<p>Moving on to the<strong> $149.99 E9 in-hear headphones</strong>, there are a pair of wired earbuds that also come with a 3.5MM to USB adapter for more adaptability. Like the H9 II, the E9 also features 360 spatial sound while allowing audio setting customization through Sony’s proprietary <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/software/00279252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inzone Hub app</a>. The E9 has a pressure-free and ear hanger design that allows for more comfortable wear during long sessions.</p>



<p>On the keyboard front, <strong>the KBD-H75</strong> is a 75% form factor board that retails for <strong>$299.99.</strong> The KDB-H75 features magnetic hall effect switches that allow for customization of its actuation points ranging from 0.1-3.4mm. The gasket-mounted keys absorb the impact on press, making them feel quicker and smoother, and it features an 8000Hz polling rate.</p>



<p>The <strong>$149.99 Inzone Mouse-A</strong> gaming mouse can be both wired or wireless, depending on your preference. At 48 grams, it comes in as a lightweight option for those who like the control. Features of the Mouse-A include a 90-hour battery life, 8000Hz polling rate, 30,000 DPI, and the same quick charge feature as the headset. For the mouse, however, the quick charge is 10 hours of use after a five minute charge and only 1.5 hours for a full charge. </p>



<p>Lastly, there are two new mouse pads—Mat D and Mat F—each designed for different types of players. <strong>The $34.99 Mat D</strong> features a 4mm high-density rubber cushion that Sony says is geared more for battle royale and first-person shooters. <strong>The $59.99 Mat F</strong> is more geared for tactical control with 6mm cushion. Both have a cloth surface.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have full impressions of the newest lineup of Sony Inzone products in the coming days, letting you know if they’re worth the investment.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rod-fergusson-joins-2k-to-lead-bioshock-franchise.1273926/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rod Fergusson, who recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-gm-rod-fergusson-leaves-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced his departure</a> from Blizzard after five years, has revealed that he is heading to 2K to become the new head of the BioShock franchise.</p>



<p>In his post on <a href="https://x.com/RodFergusson/status/1957824815018213692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Fergusson said that he’ll be <strong>“heading up Cloud Chamber and overseeing development of the next BioShock game, along with franchise extensions like the in-development Netflix movie.”</strong></p>



<p>With Fergusson taking over, it was also revealed that the studio will be letting go an unknown number of employees as part of the changes.</p>



<p><strong>“While I’m excited to get started in the coming weeks, I recognize the studio restructuring is a difficult time for the team,”</strong> he said. <strong>“I’m deeply grateful for the work done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“For now, the firehose of onboarding awaits, and I look forward to sharing more when I can.”</strong></p>



<p>Fergusson joins 2K and BioShock after if it was recently reported that the next BioShock game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-bioshock-game-suffers-development-hell-failing-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in development hell</a> after failing an executive review. The original report said that 2K was “overhauling parts of the next&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>&nbsp;game and shaking up management after senior executives expressed they were unhappy with its development.” </p>



<p>That shake up now includes Fergusson as the head of the studio. </p>



<p>At the time of the news, a 2K Spokesperson told Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier that they were <strong>“working hard to set&nbsp;BioShock&nbsp;up for the best possible future. Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the new BioShock entry, it was also reported that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioshock-remake-shelved-this-year-claimed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remake of the original game</a> was recently shelved as part of the changes happening within the company.</p>



<p>What do you think of Fergusson, who most recently was the general manager on Diablo 4, taking over as head of BioShock? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>
