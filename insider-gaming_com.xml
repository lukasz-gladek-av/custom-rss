<p>One of the most blatant Pokémon rip-offs is now available to be wishlisted on Steam. Insider Gaming was recently contacted by the developers behind “Fay Keeper,” a brand-new creature-catching game where players collect and battle hundreds of creatures called “Fays.” The request was for a paid partnership – and in the current game industry climate it’s an opportunity that comes few and far between.</p>



<p>Yet, having looked at the game initially, we couldn’t help but feel inclined that the game is a blatant rip-off of Pokémon.</p>



<p>From the color pallet to the creatures themselves, the comparisons are strikingly similar, and although it’s clear that the developers want to capitalize on an itching Pokémon audience on the PC, I can’t help but feel the team is likely going to run into legal issues. You even get your very own “Faydex.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming compiled a couple comparisons between Fay Keeper and Pokémon below (click to enlarge) so you can muster your own opinions.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, the developers of the game have addressed them slightly on social media when asked by fans about the comparisons to Pokémon. BGS Studios doesn’t hide the fact that it takes inspiration from the classic franchise, but maintains that there will be enough differences between the titles to avoid any potential legal claims.</p>



<p>“Pokémon was a huge ref and the idea was for it to feel nostalgic, but me and the team are working on a lot of unique features that Pokémon games never had,” <a href="https://x.com/FayKeeper/status/1861816033549443480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one post reads</a>.</p>



<p>In another response to a question regarding copyright, <a href="https://x.com/FayKeeper/status/1861906032097718607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BGS Studios said</a>, “Although we took inspiration from a very nostalgic reference, every single pixel and line of code is being made from scratch by us. We’ll also have mechanics that were never in the original ref, so it will hit close while also being a different thing.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming did reach out to BGS Studios for further comment on the similarities, and to talk about any potential worries or concerns. Those attempts, however, have gone unanswered as of publishing.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong and his pal Diddy are two of Nintendo’s longest-serving mascots. The duo is due to hit screens again in Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, and the release date is close.</p>



<p>Nintendo has decided to halt production of new Donkey Kong for now games in favor of ports. Donkey Kong: Tropical Freeze was released 11 years ago now—representing the most recent “new” DK game. It was ported to Switch in 2018, and Nintendo has decided to go even further back and port <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-pre-orders-are-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong: Country Returns</a> to Switch as well.</p>



<p>I’m not sure if this is a case of the Switch being at the end of its lifecycle ahead of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-have-seemingly-surfaced-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Regardless, it never hurts to see Donkey Kong again! The big, lumbering mammoth of a monkey is here, and Country Returns on the Switch likewise.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-donkey-kong-country-returns-switch-release-date">When is the Donkey Kong Country Returns Switch Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Make way for Donkey. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Donkey Kong Country Returns release date for Nintendo Switch is January 16.</strong></p>



<p>Yep, get your fingers out and start counting. The HD port of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Donkey-Kong-Country-Returns-HD-2590475.html?nsuid=70010000084603#Overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Country Returns</a> is gearing up to grace the Switch mere days from now. I’d say it looked pretty decent back in the day on the Wii, but a 2024 Switch release is worlds apart. </p>



<p>It’s also getting extra levels featured in the 3DS port, along with all the original features:</p>



<ul>
<li>Over 80+ levels</li>



<li>9 Worlds</li>



<li>Boss Battles</li>



<li>Lots of collectibles</li>



<li>Time Attack levels</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Local co-op</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-switch-release-time">Donkey Kong Country Returns Switch Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>We expect Donkey Kong Country Returns on Switch to release at midnight everywhere.</strong></p>



<p>If games get a special release time, it’s usually announced ahead of launch. So far, we haven’t seen anything to suggest otherwise, so a midnight launch in your region is probably likely. Different timezones get to play Country Returns HD first—something I suffer from being in the UK—and DK fans will be going bananas for release day.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-donkey-kong-country-returns-switch-platforms">All Donkey Kong Country Returns Switch Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Yep, Nintendo Switch is the only platform Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is coming to.</strong></p>



<p>Not too much to add here if you don’t already know. Donkey Kong is one of Nintendo’s most cherished brands and lives on its consoles. You can play Country Returns on Wii and 3Ds, but the spruced-up, all-encompassing port is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch. </p>



<hr>



<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is one of several games being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-games-releasing-in-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released in January 2025</a>. It’s a fairly quiet month, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-nintendo-switch-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest Nintendo games coming out in 2025</a> are sure to shake the foundations a bit.</p>



<p>Let us know if you are picking up a copy of Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on Switch. Plus, what do you think, is it time for Nintendo to pull their finger out and announce a new Donkey Kong entry?</p>
