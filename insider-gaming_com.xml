            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/chill-guy-meme-copyrighted-creator/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you’ve been anywhere on social media in the last few days, you might have seen a new meme called ‘Chill Guy’. It has been represented by some of the biggest brands in gaming, such as Call of Duty, and parodies of it have appeared all over TikTok and Twitter.</p>



<p>It’s a brilliant and lighthearted meme that many are enjoying worldwide, but the creator of the character used in the meme has suddenly announced a copyright action. He stressed on social media that he’ll start issuing takedowns against certain profiles using the image ‘over the next few days’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-not-very-chill">That’s Not Very Chill</h2>



<p>On Twitter, @PhillipBankss shared an image of a cartoon dog in 2023. This character mulled around on social media for a while before skyrocketing as a viral meme image just days ago. For some reason, influencers and cryptocurrency brands got their hands on the image and started using it in a series of parodies to promote their products.</p>



<p>That’s the source of the creator’s anger, and it’s why the image has been copyrighted.</p>



<p>He admitted on Twitter that not everyone will feel the brunt of his takedown notices:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>just putting it out there, chill guy has been copyrighted. like, legally. I’ll be issuing takedowns on for-profit related things over the next few days</p>



<p>not like brand accounts using him as a trend, that’s kinda something i dont really care about (i do just ask for credit. or xboxes.). mainly unauthorized merchandise and shitcoins</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the meme goes, a brand or a creator will use the image with a caption reading ‘something, something, but you’re just a chill something’. It’s tough to explain, so here’s an example from Halo:</p>



<p><em>When Master Chief trades you his plasma pistol for your rocket launcher but you’re just a chill marine:</em></p>



<figure></figure>







<p>I’m getting old and appreciate memes less and less, but this one still makes sense to me.</p>



<p>To give PhillipBankss credit, he revealed that his social feeds and DMs were being spammed by crypto shills and at times nefarious brands using his image to get in on the trend and traffic. That’s who he aims to target with this copyright action, and the run-of-the-mill users sharing it on social and content platforms won’t be impacted.</p>

<p>STALKER 2 is finally here after more than a decade of on-and-off development, and it’s turning heads worldwide. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my review</a>, I rated STALKER 2 with a 9 out of 10 score, and many other publications have echoed that sentiment. Others, not so much – STALKER 2 is proving to be an extremely divisive game within the wider community.</p>



<p>On social, streaming, and gaming platforms, the entire STALKER franchise is undergoing a boost in popularity thanks to the launch of STALKER 2, which has been met with mixed opinions.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-they-re-not-bugs-they-re-anomalies">They’re Not Bugs, They’re Anomalies</h2>



<p>One of the most common pieces of feedback being levelled against STALKER 2 is that it’s riddled with bugs and performance issues. That’s not untrue, but it’s not as bad as people are making out. As someone who put 30 hours into a pre-release version of the game, I’ll say quite transparently that users have <strong>no idea </strong>the number of issues that GSC Game World patched out ahead of launch.</p>



<p>STALKER 2 will get better with time, and when modders step in to help GSC, the timescale for those improvements will be dramatically shortened.</p>



<p>On Twitch, <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/29106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">STALKER 2 saw massive growth</a> at launch, hitting a peak viewer count of 415,708 users. By comparison, Bethesda Game Studios’ Starfield, which before it was released was one of the most anticipated games in many years, hit a peak viewer count of 552,000 little more than a year ago.</p>



<p>On Steam, every STALKER game has seen a player gain in the last 30 days. </p>



<p>For instance, STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl has racked up a 40% growth in players, while Call of Pripyat has soared by 37%.</p>



<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl managed to pull in a peak player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1643320/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">113,587 on Steam alone</a>, but it’s widely expected that the figure will be doubled or tripled on Xbox and PC (Game Pass). STALKER 2 is free on the popular subscription-based platform, and that’s where the bulk of the game’s players will likely come from.</p>



<p>Despite the mixed opinions on social media, STALKER 2 really isn’t doing so badly.</p>



<p>It has 80.5% positive reviews on Steam, and on Metacritic, it has secured a score of 74 overall. That’s below the predictions, but it’s not at all representative of what one critic wrote: <em>‘Sadly, Stalker 2 is, by far, the most unstable game we have reviewed in a long time.’</em></p>



<p>GSC Game World has already emerged on social media promising that the repair work to patch up the game as much as possible will be ongoing in earnest to smooth out the rough edges of the release version. </p>

<p>Off The Grid, an all-new battle royale game splitting opinions everywhere has already held a massive tournament. Yesterday, 60 of North America’s most popular streamers dived into Off The Grid to win a portion of a $600,000 prize pool. It’s almost unheard of that a game so early in the development cycle hosts such a large tournament, but that’s crypto money for you, I guess.</p>



<p>By the time the dust had settled, a diverse roster of squads had picked up some sizeable prizes in Off The Grid’s All-Stars Invitational. The winners included retired Call of Duty pro players, Fortnite streamers, and the single biggest names in content creation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-backed-by-the-blockchain">Backed by the Blockchain</h2>



<p>Off The Grid has been splitting the community down the middle since it surfaced several weeks ago.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that Off The Grid is backed by blockchain technology and has heavy investment from cryptocurrency-focused firms, and that has been a sticking point with players everywhere. It’s a solid game, but the connection with crypto has been a hard pill for many to swallow, and that’s why the game is struggling to gain traction.</p>



<p>If it wasn’t for the developer stuffing the scene with money and prolific events like the All-Stars Invitational, Off The Grid would likely be passing under the radar.</p>



<p>During the recent tournament, 60 players entered the running in teams of three, with each game (of six) boasting a prize worth $60,000 for the top team, $20,000 for second place, and $10,000 for third-placed teams. Gunzilla, the game’s developer, has wasted no time enticing players to the platform with daily tournaments and cash prizes all over the place.</p>



<p>Here’s how it all went down, winners-wise:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Game 1</strong>: Team IceManIsaac</li>



<li><strong>Game 2: </strong>Team IceManIsaac</li>



<li><strong>Game 3: </strong>Team Holly</li>



<li><strong>Game 4: </strong>Team Huskerrs</li>



<li><strong>Game 5: </strong>Team IceManIsaac</li>



<li><strong>Game 6: </strong>Team IceManIsaac</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s a trend there, I think.</p>



<p>Team IceManIsaac was represented by the man himself, Skullface, and Aydan, some of the best battle players and champions in the world. Aydan has long been a superstar streamer in the Warzone space, and Skullface has claimed wins in the World Series of Warzone, so they’re well-placed to dominate any battle royale game like Off The Grid.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-ranked-play-cheaters/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/to-nobody%E2%80%99s-surprise-black-ops-6-ranked-play-is-full-of-cheaters-on-day-one.1041414/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-ranked-play-cheaters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Ops 6 Ranked Play has been added to the game in record time, and to the chagrin of competitive players worldwide, it’s already packed full of cheaters. On social media, clips have surfaced from pro players and streamers revealing them being matched against stacked hackers disrupting the game for everyone else – as always.</p>



<p>It took one day for cheaters to throw Black Ops 6 Ranked Play off the rails.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-time">Every Time</h2>



<p>Every time Activision’s studios release a ranked mode in a Call of Duty game, it’s infested with hackers.</p>



<p>For those not in the know, Ranked Play is a competitive ecosystem with more restrictions, a tighter map and mode rotation, and more rewards than regular, non-ranked multiplayer playlists. Players relish the opportunity to dive into Ranked Play as it allows them to unlock exclusive operator skins, calling cards, and more.</p>



<p>It’s also a breeding ground for cheaters, for some reason. Typically, the highest echelons of the Ranked Play leaderboard are reserved exclusively for cheaters, who year in, year out fly under the radar of Team RICOCHET’s anti-cheat mechanics.</p>



<p>It’s getting better, but it’s <strong>far </strong>from being perfect.</p>



<p>Chris ‘Parasite’ Duarte, one of Call of Duty’s first world champions, posted on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS</strong> EVERY GAME WHERE IS THE ANTI CHEAT TREYARCH</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last season’s CDL world champion, Dashy, posted a video of him slamming teams full of cheaters in Ranked Play, and Simp, one of the best Call of Duty players in the world, was sharing comments on Twitter about the trademarks of BO6 cheaters.</p>



<p>It seems like Ranked Play in Black Ops 6 is already cooked, and it’s another year back-to-back that cheaters have completely ruined the mode.</p>
