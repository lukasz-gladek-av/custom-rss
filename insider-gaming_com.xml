<p>Reanimal is releasing on February 13, 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Switch 2.</p>



<p>Tarsier Studios announced their upcoming title, Reanimal, at Gamescom Opening Night <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarsier-studios-new-game-reanimal-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier this year</a>, with a trailer that got many players excited. The developers are also experienced in this space, bringing players the first two Little Nightmare games and LittleBigPlanet 3. </p>







<h2 id="h-reanimal-release-date-set-for-february-13-2026-pre-orders-are-live">Reanimal Release Date Set for February 13, 2026; Pre-Orders Are Live</h2>



<p>The release date for Reanimal was spotted by Shinobi602 on <a href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1991512993218326945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). The release date announcement also comes with other news: first, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S demos for the title will go live today. Secondly, pre-orders for Reanimal are live as well, with the bonus being exclusive Foxhead &amp; Muttonhead masks. Digital Deluxe edition buyers will get a Season Pass for all 3 DLC chapters along with the pre-order bonus. </p>



<p>Reanimal is a co-op horror-adventure where players experience the story of a brother and sister who set foot in hell to save their friends. The region the players explore is filled with tension and a thick atmosphere as they traverse by boat and on land. Exploration is key, as the main path is only one part of the story, with many mysterious locations and their own stories to tell. The title is fully playable in single player and local &amp; online co-op, it also has “a shared, directed camera, designed to maximise claustrophobia and tension.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/one-of-tarkov-endings-cost-you-6-2-million/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-endings-will-cost-you-6-2-million.1359238/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov is now a fully released game, with Battlestate having pushed out the 1.0 version of the popular extraction shooter on November 15. One of the biggest selling points of the new version is that it has a story that players can work through to attain one of four endings, all of which are notoriously difficult to reach.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, one Escape from Tarkov creator revealed that they’d reached one of those endgame scenarios, and that getting out and escaping from Tarkov via that particular route was going to cost them a whopping <strong>500 million rubles</strong>, which is around $6.2 million.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-s-endings-are-nails">Escape from Tarkov’s Endings Are Nails</h2>



<p>Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, warned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-story-will-have-four-endings/">only a small percentage</a> of Escape from Tarkov players would ever successfully reach the game’s ultimate ending. The four endings that have been set up mark a major milestone for the extraction shooter, but many of the game’s fans won’t see them.</p>



<p>We now know why.</p>



<p>In an image uploaded on social media by Tigz, a popular Tarkov creator, it was revealed that one of those endings requires the player to hand over a whopping 500 <strong>million rubles</strong>, which is a staggering, dizzying amount of cash. It’s equivalent to $6.2 million, and the player will need to acquire those funds while spending on everything required to… Well, <em>acquire those funds</em>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>For the average player, this ending is almost impassable and unobtainable, as making that much money in Escape from Tarkov takes an immense amount of time, even if you’re a skilled player.</p>



<p>The point of Escape from Tarkov now is to be much more persistent, so it’s probably doable, but it’s a monumental grind that will wear most players down to the bone.</p>







<p>In the comments under the post, some users joked about the objective. One noted that it would be ‘Just a couple thousand good Scav runs.’ While another criticized it, writing, ‘Not even a fun quest or anything, just grinding, what a disappointment.’</p>



<p>Do you think you could stump up half a billion rubles to get out of Tarkov? Let the community know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you could.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/f1-skins-fortnite-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-do-f1-skins-come-to-fortnite-release-date-explained.1359232/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An F1 collab is speeding its way into Fortnite, giving the community a chance to immortalise another of the world’s most popular franchises. If you’re wheelie excited about this high-octane crossover, the official release date for the Fortnite and F1 content crossover is below and waiting in the pit lane.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s collaboration possibilities are endless. We’re not at the end of Chapter 6 yet, and we’ve already gotten wind of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-pass-leaks-reveal-back-to-the-future-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 Battle Pass leak, revealing Back to the Future content</a>! Before we get there, though, it’s time to take this to the track.</p>



<p>Let’s check out the F1 Skins release date in Fortnite, and what’s coming.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-amp-f1-skins-release-date">Fortnite &amp; F1 Skins Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Full gear. Credit to Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can expect to see the new F1 Skins arrive in Fortnite in-game on Thursday, November 20.</strong></p>



<p>The content arrives on this date as it coincides with the real-life 2025&nbsp;Las Vegas Grand Prix! All 10 F1 teams will feature in the drop, and you’ll be able to buy the content of your choice from the Fortnite store, as usual.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-f1-skins-amp-content-is-coming-to-fortnite">What F1 Skins &amp; Content Is Coming To Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>The ‘F1 Cosmetic Team Set’ is the headline addition as part of the exciting Fortnite and F1 crossover.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s what F1 had to say on the collab:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[It] will include branded <strong>Outfits</strong>, <strong>Gliders</strong>, and <strong>Pickaxes </strong>that feature bespoke team branding from all 10&nbsp;Formula 1 teams. The Outfits and cosmetic items are inspired by the current F1 teams, and players can also get Formula 1 branded ‘<strong>Back Bling</strong>’, plus an ‘<strong>Emote</strong>’ to celebrate Victory Royales in style.</p>




</blockquote>



<p>You can only imagine the confusion of the F1 consultant writing up this statement, likely trying to work out what Back Bling is, but they summed it up nicely. It’s all the usual skins, Gliders, Pickaxes, and more, that we’ve become accustomed to with all collaborations.</p>



<p>It’s also unlikely that Epic will suddenly drop the V-Bucks requirements for these bundles. Expect to part with a hefty wad of Fortnite cash if you want to sport a smart Red Bull Outfit or drop into the game with a Mercedes-embroidered Glider.</p>



<p>Who is your F1 team of choice? Is there any gear that will be a must-buy for you when it drops? Share your allegiance to the world via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Official Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>
