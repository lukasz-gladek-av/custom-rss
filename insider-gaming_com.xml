<p>PlayStation logos have started appearing on Starfield’s creation club website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by Okami13_ on <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/1900584005000368350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), a mod on the Starfield Creation Club website features a PlayStation logo along with a PC Game and Xbox logos, hinting that a PS5 release could be around the corner. These logos are supposed to signify what platforms this mod is available on, and it’s surprising to see PlayStation listed among PC and Xbox when the platform hasn’t even been officially confirmed yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Starfield mod in question with a PlayStation Logo is called <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/5eb39a17-916a-4220-85ff-b710174e184f/WIP___Ship_Decals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WIP—Ship Decals</a> and has been created by ValleysEdge. At the time of writing, the PlayStation logo is still visible on the mod’s page on Starfield’s official Creations website. The mod adds “work in progress” decals to your ship. Its installation size is 8.9 KB, and it was created on March 12.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have yet to hear anything official about Starfield coming to the PlayStation 5. All we have heard is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phil Spencer</a> stating earlier this year that no Xbox game stays put on the platform. Bethesda also recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-plans-starfield-not-saying-anything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> they have “a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year.” Could one of those things be a PS5 release? We will have to wait to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-and-fallout-4-are-also-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent claim stated</a> that Starfield and Fallout are coming to Nintendo Switch 2. Also, Starfield character artist has revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-character-artist-reveals-why-gore-was-cut-from-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why gore was cut from the game</a>.
