<p>Amazon’s God of War live-action series has now secured actors for both protagonists, Kratos and Atreus. </p>



<p>It seems like the live-action adaptation of God of War is shaping up nicely, with new castings being announced frequently. We already know that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ryan-hurst-comments-on-playing-kratos-in-prime-videos-god-of-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Hurst</a> will be playing Kratos, and most recently, the actors for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prime-video-casts-thor-and-odin-in-god-of-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thor and Odin</a> were revealed. Now, we have been informed about who’s going to play the son of the God of War. </p>







<h2 id="h-callum-vinson-to-play-as-atreus-in-god-of-war-adaptation">Callum Vinson to Play as Atreus in God of War Adaptation</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-live-action-series-cast-callum-vinson-atreus-1236656985/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> reveals that Callum Vinson will play the young god Atreus, making him one of the two main characters of the series. Vinson is known for playing characters in series such as Dead Ringers, Long Bright River, and Poker Face. </p>



<p>Atreus embarks on his own journey in both games, beginning with the revelation that he is a god and culminating in his coming to terms with this new identity. The dynamic between father and son is something that fans have cherished over the years, and it will be exciting to see how Hurst and Vinson portray this relationship on television.</p>



<p>The upcoming series will be written, executive-produced, and showrun by Ronald D. Moore. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-god-of-war-director-second-season-greenlit-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shogun’s Frederick E.O. Toye</a> is directing the first two episodes, and the series has been greenlit for two seasons. Cory Barlog is also an executive producer on the show. </p>







<p>In other news, Heimdall will be portrayed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prime-videos-god-of-war-series-casts-emmerdale-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Max Parker from Netflix’s ‘Boots’</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-prime-video-series-reunites-game-actor-with-mimir-role/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s Mimir will return</a> to the role in the live-action series.

<p>A recent announcement from Discord reveals new teen safety features that will be enabled by default for all users, set to launch in early March.</p>



<p>Recently, hackers claimed they had acquired <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/discord-hackers-claim-to-have-1-5tb-of-age-verification-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.5 TB of age-verification photos</a>, totaling 2,185,151 images, from Discord. However, Discord has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/discord-denies-recent-claims-about-1-5tb-of-data-being-stolen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied these allegations</a>, stating that there were around 70,000 users “that may have had government ID photos exposed.” Now, new safety measures have been implemented. </p>







<h2 id="h-discord-moves-to-teen-by-default-setting">Discord Moves to Teen-By-Default Setting </h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update</a> will make Discord a “teen-appropriate experience by default.” Which means that there will be updated communication settings, restricted access to age-gated spaces, and content filtering. After the update, existing users will need to use the age-verification process to get access to certain content and change settings. </p>



<p>For age verification, Discord users will be able to either “use facial age estimation or submit a form of identification”. The platform will also use an age inference model that runs in the background to determine whether the user is an adult. There are some other measures that Discord is taking with this process: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>On-device processing:</strong>&nbsp;Video selfies for facial age estimation never leave a user’s device.</li>



<li><strong>Quick deletion</strong>: Identity documents submitted to our vendor partners are deleted quickly— in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.</li>



<li><strong>Straightforward verification:</strong>&nbsp;In most cases, users complete the process once, and their Discord experience adapts to their verified age group. Users may be asked to use multiple methods only when more information is needed to assign an age group.</li>



<li><strong>Private status:</strong>&nbsp;A user’s age verification status cannot be seen by other users.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>







<p>Discord will also introduce new default safety settings for existing and new users. These include content filers, age-gated spaces, message request inbox, friend request alters, and stage restrictions. They are also holding recruitment for the Inaugural Teen Council, “a teen advisory body that brings authentic teen perspectives into how Discord shapes their experience.”</p>
