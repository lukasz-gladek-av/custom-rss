<p>Seth ‘Scump’ Abner, one of the most electrifying and popular former pro players in Call of Duty, has taken to his stream to talk about the state of Call of Duty. In a transparent statement, he echoed what so many content creators have said, suggesting that Call of Duty is in a horrible state right now – for many reasons.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 was supposed to be Call of Duty’s ‘saviour’, and it was solid for a while, but things are starting to fall apart. Check out what Scump had to say about Call of Duty below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-such-a-bad-spot-right-now">‘Such a Bad Spot Right Now’</h2>



<p>Scump is a Call of Duty world champion and arguably the most prolific pro player in the scene. He has spent a decade honing his following and his talents, and now that he’s tired from actively competing, he has become one of the game’s most-watched streamers. He’s still flying the OpTic banner after all these years, too.</p>



<p>During <a href="https://x.com/SpawnUpgg/status/1877025389077225639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent stream</a>, Scump explained how he and so many people feel about Call of Duty:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Call of Duty is just in such a bad spot right now, dude. I don’t think Call of Duty has ever been in a worse spot than it is right now. It’s kind of depressing, to be honest.</p>



<p>I was already concerned them releasing ranked so early and the CDL started up, and then we had like a month break from the CDL, so I was already a little concerned about all of that.</p>



<p>They dropped it so early and then they dropped it and it was so bad because of all the hackers.</p>



<p>… I don’t know, they just f***ed up.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He followed up by explaining that he’s dropping away from Call of Duty a little to stream other games. That’s something that Nadeshot did just a few days ago, pivoting away from Black Ops 6 to play Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 has been riddled with hackers for several weeks, and it seems like every creator and pro player is running up against them in Ranked Play. It’s making the game borderline unplayable for the more skilled players, and other elements such as poor network performance and tricky SBMM mechanics are inflicting pain upon the more average gamers.</p>



<p>Do you think Call of Duty is in a hole right now? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Developer Splash Damage has announced that the online co-op game Transformers: Reactivate has been cancelled just over two years after it was first announced. Alongside the game’s cancellation, the studio is also set to lay off an unknown number of developers.</p>



<p>The studio made the announcement in a post on social media on Wednesday while saying they are going to “refocus” on other projects.</p>



<p>“Today, we have some very difficult news to share, the decision has been made to end development of Transformers: Reactivate,” the statement reads. “This means we will be scaling down to refocus our efforts on other projects. Unfortunately, despite every effort, a number of roles across the studio are now potentially at risk of redundancy.”</p>



<p>The statement continues to say that the “decision did not come lightly”, and that it’s a “difficult” time for everyone at the studio. They then went on to thank Hasbro for their support before talking about the short term future.</p>



<p>“While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more,” they said. “We’re now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Splash Damage for clarification on the number of roles that will be impacted by the layoffs. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>



<p>Last year saw <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 15,000 known jobs</a> lost in the games industry. In just the first eight days of 2025, there have been a least four known layoffs, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-suffers-more-layoffs-as-suicide-squad-support-winds-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocksteady</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-gaming-layoffs-of-2025-have-happened/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netmarble F&amp;C</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-down-answered/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cs2-server-status-is-counter-strike-2-down-answered.1077192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-down-answered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With more than a million people playing Counter-Strike 2 on any given day, server status is an important factor to monitor. While it doesn’t happen often, CS2 has been down in the past due to a variety of reasons.</p>



<p>There’s nothing more frustrating (other than a costly missed smoke) than not being able to play CS2 at all. Here’s all the tools you need to be able to check on CS2’s server status and see if it’s down.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-cs2-server-status">How to Check CS2 Server Status</h2>



<p>There are a number of third-party websites that can relay Steam and Counter-Strike 2 server information to you. <a href="https://www.csgodatabase.com/csgo-steam-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CSGO Database</a> appears to be the most complete by our judgment. It provides the status of CS2 services like the API, player inventories and the matchmaking scheduler, as well as the status of all the regional servers. Additionally, CSGO Database provides current metrics for online players, active servers, and the total number of players searching for a match.</p>

<p>If there are any issues affecting server availability, <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/counter-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DownDetector</a> might provide some more insight. This website tracks the number of problems reported with CS2’s servers, showing spikes in reports over the past 24 hours and a “live outage” report. There’s also an option to switch to one of dozens of other countries. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-cs2-down">Why is CS2 Down?</h2>



<p>CS2 is subject to regular maintenance like any other persistent online multiplayer game. Problems with Steam servers routinely happen on Tuesdays when servers are taken down for maintenance. CS2 itself will go down for a small amount of time when new updates go live, and many players attempt to sign in right away after these updates, so the number of reported outages will spike.</p>



<p>On rare occasions, a larger issue that needs to be addressed by the developers will force CS2 down for a long time. In that case, Valve will typically post directly to <a href="https://x.com/CounterStrike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@CounterStrike on X</a> informing players of what’s going on.</p>



<p>What’s the longest that Counter-Strike has ever been down for you? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
