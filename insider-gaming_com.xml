<p>Escape from Tarkov has just been pulled offline by Battlestate Games for a whopping 24 hours, and potentially longer if the 1.0 rollout needs to be extended. This is to allow the teams at Battlestate to deploy the complete overhaul coming with the 1.0 version of the game, which is the culmination of more than 10 years of development.</p>



<p>Tarkov going offline is a significant moment for the game, as when it comes back up, nothing will ever be the same again…</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-tarkov-back-online">When is Tarkov Back Online?</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov will be back online when the 1.0 update has been deployed. Battlestate Games has stressed it will be 24 hours from 11:00 GMT, which means 11:00 GMT <strong>tomorrow</strong>, it should be ready to go. When you boot tomorrow, you’ll be loading a new version of Escape from Tarkov, and for the first time in eight years, it <strong>won’t be a beta</strong>.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 version comes with a new map, weapons, and equipment, and much more besides. The game will wipe and introduce a new campaign that players can follow to ultimately <strong>escape from Tarkov</strong>, securing one of four endings to wrap up the game’s core loop.</p>



<p>PvE players will need to wipe their game (but it’s not mandatory) if they want to complete Escape from Tarkov’s new story.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-error-262-in-escape-from-tarkov">What is Error: 262 in Escape from Tarkov?</h3>



<p>Don’t worry, this is just the error message Battlestate Games has applied to the Escape from Tarkov launcher while the 1.0 deployment is being rolled out.</p>



<p>This weekend, a Twitch Drops campaign will go live, with thousands of streamers coming forth to broadcast the 1.0 version for the first time. Typically, a Tarkov wipe heralds a monumental time for the game, and it skyrockets on platforms like Twitch. This will be no different, as this is the most significant event in the game’s storied history.</p>







<p>Love it or hate it, Escape from Tarkov is likely back and (we hope) better than ever. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re most excited about from the 1.0 Tarkov update.</p>

<p>It might be a sign of the times, or just a strange decision on Activision and Treyarch’s part, but the campaign aspect of Black Ops 7 cannot be paused, meaning you have to keep playing and progressing until the mission is over, or you reach a checkpoint.</p>



<p>Yes, this marks the first time ever that you can’t pause a Call of Duty campaign. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-voice-actors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>‘s campaign utilizes an always-online aspect, meaning the game is live at all times. This has several huge implications for your game and means progress and progression can be interrupted at all times.</p>







<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-can-t-be-paused">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Campaign Can’t Be Paused</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s pause for a minute, oh wait. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Black Ops 7’s campaign has attracted a lot of discourse because of the nature of its content. One thing that can’t be overlooked is the campaign being always online. In previous games, when you pause the game, the action stops. End of story.</p>



<p>That’s not the case here, and the action carries on—think of it like a FromSoftware game where you bring up a menu, but the world is still active. You can die, lose your progress, and go back to the start of the checkpoint. This isn’t ideal when you’re playing on Veteran difficulty, for example.</p>







<p>ModernWarzone also shared a clip of someone’s campaign journey, and while the user is trying to watch a cutscene, Black Ops 7 suddenly decides in that moment to drop the Daily Update.</p>



<p>This instantly derails any campaign momentum and throws you out to the main menu.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Since Black Ops 7 is an always online campaign without the ability to pause, even if playing solo, when there is an update pushed it will interrupt your campaign regardless of where you are and what's happening. </p><p>Glad I didn't lose any progress at least. <a href="https://t.co/ofOXPLSvQD">pic.twitter.com/ofOXPLSvQD</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1989121314154770702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Treyarch might enable some kind of offline workaround later on, but this is unlikely due to the game’s online integration and the addition of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-worlds-collide-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worlds Collide</a>.</p>



<p>Is this a bad move from Treyarch? Does this put you off playing the campaign altogether? Head to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> and let us know what you think of this decision.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has pushed out a new Escape from Tarkov 1.0 trailer, celebrating the imminent launch of the game after ten years in development. It comes just one day before the update (or release) is set to drop, bringing an end to ten years of testing. The highly anticipated release will come hand-in-hand with the exciting feature to <strong>finally </strong>escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Plenty is showcased in the trailer, which, in true Battlestate Games fashion, has the characters dying over, and over, and over again. It’s true to the game, at least.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-1-0-trailer-is-here">Tarkov 1.0 Trailer is Here</h2>



<p>All week, Battlestate Games has been writhing in nostalgia, sharing old trailers and tidbits from Escape from Tarkov’s ten-year development lifecycle. In an epic milestone, the team is finally pushing the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-release-date-start-time/">into a 1.0 state</a>, and it’ll be released worldwide <strong>tomorrow</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s the 1.0 trailer for your enjoyment:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape from Tarkov 1.0 Release Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OKh9HaTEUfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s an exciting time for fans of the extraction genre. From the launch of Escape from Tarkov to the skyrocketing success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-arc-raiders-map-open-breaking-new-ground/">ARC Raiders</a>, and from the superstar performance of the satirical <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-sells-1-million-copies/">Escape from Duckov</a> to the recent leaks concerning the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-leaks-online/">Far Cry extraction shooter</a>, there’s plenty to be enthused about.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov will be released tomorrow on Steam, which marks the first time that the extraction shooter has appeared on a platform outside of Battlestate Games’ proprietary launcher. It’ll hopefully attract an entirely new audience to the game.</p>







<p>Also, there’s a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-twitch-drops-campaign-confirmed/">Twitch Drops campaign</a> set to run from this weekend into early December that’ll reward users for watching their favorite streamers play the new update.</p>
