<p>Borderlands 4 is set to be released worldwide on September 12, and it’s the broadest and most ambitious iteration that Gearbox has ever created. In Borderlands 4, players are set to explore a seamless open world and be presented with more choices and options for gameplay styles than ever before.</p>



<p>I sat down with Randy Pitchford at Gamescom to learn all about Borderlands 4, from what it took to create it to where it goes post-launch. He made a bold statement about the sales of the series and how impactful Borderlands 4 will be.</p>



<h2 id="h-we-re-now-expert-at-making-borderlands">‘We’re Now Expert at Making Borderlands’</h2>



<p>When I caught up with Randy Pitchford at Gamescom, I came away with a wealth of information about Borderlands 4, the upcoming open-world shooter from Gearbox. As the CEO and creator of the franchise, Pitchford has been pivotal in pushing the brand forward for the last 20 years, working with a dedicated and talented team to make this series something legendary.</p>



<p>Pitchford reflected on that and looked to the future of the series beyond Borderlands 4:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re just now beginning to dig into what our post-launch is, and we’ve got some <strong>extremely exciting plans </strong>that I cannot wait to share and talk about.</p>



<p>We’re now expert at making Borderlands 4, and when you’re making a game, you kind of figure out how to make it as you ship it. That’s one of the reasons why our post-launch content tends to be so good.</p>



<p>Thinking about Borderlands ‘beyond the game’, it’s so wild to me. I remember I came to Gamescom with Borderlands 1, just trying to scream from the tallest mountain to get anyone to pay attention to it and nobody cared.</p>



<p>A lot of people predicted that Borderlands wasn’t going to work.</p>



<p>Now, here we are with the game franchise, <strong>we will break 100 million units with this launch, easy</strong>, all in with the franchise.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Borderlands is more than 15 years old as a series, and as Pitchford explained, he’s spent the last 20 years of his life building it and pushing it out to the masses. With each iteration, the franchise becomes more explosive and energetic, and Borderlands 4 represents the (for now) pinnacle of the series.</p>



<p>The last numbers suggested that the series was sitting at around 92 million units sold, which means that Gearbox is anticipating at least 8 million sales with Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re most looking forward to about Borderlands 4.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/crisisx-preview-not-the-day-before-not-good-gamescom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crisisx-preview%E2%80%94it-isn%E2%80%99t-%E2%80%98the-day-before-2%E2%80%99-but-it%E2%80%99s-really-not-good.1277541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As I wandered the show floor at Gamescom, I stumbled upon an enormous booth for CrisisX, an all-new open-world, post-apocalyptic survival shooter from HK Hero Entertainment (Hero Games). This title popped up on my radar a couple of weeks ago when it was dubbed ‘The Day Before 2’ by sceptical gamers worried about ambitious promises and the ‘too-good-to-be-true’ image of CrisisX.</p>



<p>Let me preface this by stressing that CrisisX boasts one of the largest open maps ever made, promises to accommodate 5,000 players per server, is <strong>free to play </strong>(with microtransactions), and comes from a developer that hasn’t released anything major <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>I played CrisisX at Gamescom, and I’m here to give you the full rundown.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-the-hell-is-toby">Who The Hell is Toby?</h2>



<p>I started playing CrisisX and was presented with a diverse selection of characters to choose from. At first, I was pleased to see a super detailed character customization screen, but things turned sour <strong>as soon as the game began</strong>. I was walked through a brief tutorial stage that introduced me to weapons and basic mechanics, and then I quickly uncovered how rough CrisisX is.</p>



<p>I’m sure the voice acting was AI-driven, and it was riddled with grammatical errors and nonsensical lines. The animations and visual platter were straight out of a mobile game from days gone by, and the enemies were low-IQ cannon fodder, presenting no real challenge.</p>



<p>At one point, while looking for a mode of transport (a poorly designed horse), I came across a hulking, stronger zombie enemy named ‘Toby’. Why he was named Toby, I’ll never know.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="CrisisX - Official Trailer | Gamescom 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mcAGdnjm64U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>CrisisX has a huge focus on the massive game map that can be explored at will. Within seconds, I’d opened this map, which is reportedly more than <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/the-day-before-2-everyone-is-skeptical-about-this-survival-game-promising-a-map-five-times-the-size-of-dayz-and-5-000-players-per-server/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">five times the size</a> of DayZ’s map, and been <strong>utterly overwhelmed </strong>by all the icons and possibilities of this gargantuan environment.</p>



<p>Where the map is complex and packed with markers, the gameplay loop is numbingly basic and uninspiring. You kill things, you loot things, you build things, and you collect things. The version of the game I played had no other users around, but the full product should have servers that accommodate 5,000 players.</p>



<p>Sure, you’ll need a huge map for that, but 4,999 other players vying to destroy my enjoyment of the already drab CrisisX is <strong>not an encouraging thought.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>Here’s a snap of the CrisisX map… Or a small part of it, at least.</figcaption></figure>







<p>I’m certainly not going to agree with anyone dubbing this ‘The Day Before 2’, though. That was a rug pull at best and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/signs-the-day-before-was-a-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nothing short of a scam</a> that lasted a matter of hours on the open market before being pulled and decimated by the shady developers who have since disappeared into the abyss.</p>



<p>For starters, <strong>I’ve played CrisisX</strong>, which is much further than I (and most other people) got with The Day Before.</p>



<p>CrisisX doesn’t have a release date yet, but it’s supposed to drop next year. Perhaps it’ll be sharpened by the developer before then, and we can enjoy whatever the finished product looks like.</p>



<p>Let me know if you’ve had your eye on CrisisX on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>EA Sports NHL 26 is just two weeks away from release, and more details about the game’s Be A Pro mode have surfaced ahead of launch.</p>



<p>After the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-26-be-a-pro-features-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive on the mode</a>, fans still had some questions about various features of the mode. While not all questions have been answered, there are some additional details about what will—and won’t—be in the mode.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/nhl-26-general-discussion-en/nhl-26-be-a-pro-reveal/12488006?after=MjUuNHwyLjF8aXwxMHwzOToxfGludCwxMjQ4Nzk4NSwxMjQ5NjMzMg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA forums</a>, community manager Aljo answered a few questions about tunnel walkouts, junior hockey, contracts, and more. </p>



<p>Regarding how your career starts, after the World Juniors kicks things off, you’ll be able to play in Euro leagues or the CHL. Once you are drafted, however, you can only play in the NHL or AHL, depending on your performance.</p>



<p>When it comes to tunnel walkouts, something that fans have been waiting to see come back, NHL 26 only has them in Be A Pro at the game’s launch. What’s more is they will only happen for specific moments, not every game. </p>



<p>The mode also won’t feature contract negotiations for your player nor can you view league injuries or transactions.</p>



<p><strong>“Be a Pro is more about the journey of your own player so that’s where the focus is,” </strong>Aljo said regarding injuries and transactions.</p>



<p>Lastly, Be A Pro will support custom rosters provided they are created before you start the mode.</p>



<p>NHL 26 releases on September 5—if you buy the Deluxe Edition—for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. Those who buy the Standard Edition get the game on September 12.</p>



<p>What do you think of what will and won’t be in NHL 26 Be A Pro? Let us know down below, and take the discussion even further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After much speculation, Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection has revealed its full lineup of games at Gamescom 2025. The collection plans to remaster many of the original Mortal Kombat titles, including the first ever game in the series.</p>



<p>While the series has been going strong since 1992, there weren’t many ways to play the originals on modern consoles. Now, with Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection, you can now play many of the older titles all in one place and with better graphics and controls. We knew that the game would at least cover the first three Mortal Kombat titles, but now we have the full roster.</p>



<h2 id="h-mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-brings-11-games-to-modern-consoles">Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection Brings 11 Games to Modern Consoles</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>As per the Gamescom trailer, shown above, 11 games from the franchise, ranging from 1992’s Mortal Kombat to 2003’s Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition, will be available. Surprisingly, two games in its lineup, Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat Special Forces, are some of the rarest to find and play, so longtime fans can finally get a chance to enjoy those games. The full roster of Mortal Kombat games can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mortal Kombat (1992)</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat II (1993)</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat 3 (1995)</li>



<li>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995)</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat Trilogy (1996)</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat 4 (1997) </li>



<li>Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero (1997) </li>



<li>Mortal Kombat Special Forces (2000) </li>



<li>Mortal Kombat Advance (2001)</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance (2002) </li>



<li>Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition (2003)</li>
</ul>



<p>No set release date has been announced for Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection, but it is slated to release in 2025. However, if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-release-date-accidentally-revealed/">a leaked Xbox store date</a> is real, it may come out on September 29th, 2025. The collection (or Kollection, as they say) will release on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.</p>
