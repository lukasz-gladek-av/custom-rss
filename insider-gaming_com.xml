            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Today, a San Francisco-based AI company has announced the launch of character.world, an AI engine that allows for the creation of ‘human-like’ characters with memories, personalities, and the ability to form relationships with users.</p>



<p>This technology is built on the Character Context Protocol (CCP), an open-source product from EGO AI, which allows for the seamless integration of powerful and authentic AI-powered NPCs across various games, apps, and platforms, including Discord and Twitch.</p>



<p>The announcement went hand-in-hand with the unveiling of almost $7 million in seed funding to further bolster these AI-driven creations entering the market.</p>



<h2 id="h-living-persistent-characters-who-can-make-games-richer">‘Living, Persistent Characters Who Can Make Games Richer’</h2>



<p>In a press release, the CEO of EGO, Vishnu Hari, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Games and digital worlds have always struggled with flat, scripted non-player characters (NPCs) that feel mechanical and forgettable. EGO AI is tackling that head-on with characters who act, react and remember like real players.</p>



<p>Our mission is to move beyond chat windows and give people living, persistent characters who can make games richer, worlds more alive and interactions more meaningful.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a short video presenting the abilities of EGO AI, the company showcased how a user can talk directly to an AI NPC powered by the CCP technology, getting an instant response that’s contextualized and makes sense. The AI NPC remembered the conversation and referred to it later, even recalling a topic when talking to the user <strong>outside </strong>the initial game.</p>



<p>Here’s the video:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>These are very early days for EGO AI, but investors are excited about the potential. In a statement, Adam Draper of Boost VC, one of the investors in EGO AI, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What excites me about Ego is their approach to one of gaming’s biggest challenges: creating characters that truly feel alive.</p>



<p>Their foundation model is a breakthrough in AI character behavior. We’re entering a new era where AI characters will carry personality, memory, and emotion—indistinguishable from human players—and Ego is positioned to lead it. And Vish is the most resilient founder in the space.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an extensive whitepaper, EGO AI explained everything that goes into the technology driving these AI characters and laid out the benefits, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>More authentic gameplay</li>



<li>Automatic population of game worlds</li>



<li>Automated play and balance testing</li>
</ul>



<p>Each AI character will have a personality, needs, emotions, and memory features that enable them to feel as human as possible, and EGO AI has promised that this is the ground floor for this technology.</p>



<p>It obviously has some concerning elements circulating around it, the most critical of which is the inherent threat to human actors who would otherwise play these roles. This will likely fire up a debate when EGO AI becomes more public.</p>



<p>Are you eager to see more technology like this surface, or would you rather stick to traditional methods of portraying NPCs? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-guns-battlefield-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-meta-gun-loadouts-in-battlefield-6%E2%80%94best-assault-rifle-smg-lmg-sniper-rifle-shotgun-class.1326289/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Having the best meta guns will give you a huge advantage in Battlefield 6. At the very least, you’ll be able to compete with everyone else who is also using the best guns. We’ve got top weapons you should be using in Battlefield 6, along with the ideal loadouts to go with them.</p>



<p>If you’re not keeping on top of the ‘meta,’ you’re going to fall behind. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> features a vast array of guns, but selecting the right one for each class is crucial. You might love the AK4D, for example, but it’s not as good as the most elite assault rifle in BF 6.</p>



<p>We’ve put together the best meta guns and loadouts for the top weapon in each Battlefield 6 class.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Starting off strong. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The assault rifle category isn’t as strong as other classes in Battlefield 6. However, it looks like the <strong>M433 </strong>is the standard in the AR category and the bar that other assault rifles need to live up to.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Baker 3.00X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong>&nbsp;Double-Port Brake</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Ribbed Stubby</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 36RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>M4A1 </strong>is currently the best Carbine—and potentially best weapon overall—in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>. An assault rifle usually ends up being the most dominant gun in FPS games. For us, there’s no question it’s the M4A1 Carbine that takes the crown instead. It fires well, hits hard, and this best loadout brings out its true potential.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Baker 3.00X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Standard Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 14.5″ Carbine</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Ribbed Stubby</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 36RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>It’s the MP5, always will be. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>PW5A3</strong>—AKA the MP5, let’s face it—rules the roost where SMGs are concerned. It’s consistently appeared throughout the course of FPS gaming history, and it’s here in Battlefield 6. It outclasses every other SMG up close, and it’s also quite handy at mid-range as well. If you need a gun that rapidly chews through bullets and tears through opponents in smaller maps, look no further than the PW5A3.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Iron Sights</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Compensated Brake</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 245MM Custom</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Ribbed Stubby</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 40RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>Don’t sleep on this. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best <strong>DRS-IAR</strong> loadout is a strange one, as it doesn’t even feel like an LMG in some ways. Our Magazine attachment gives it fewer bullets than our PW5A3 class, for example. But it’s still a powerful gun that can be just as powerful as an AR, and then some. If you’re looking for a different type of weapon, you should consider the DRS-IAR.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> CCO 2.00X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Double-Port Brake</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 20″ SDM-R</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Alloy Vertical</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 36RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> Magwell Flare</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>Boom. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you played the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, chances are you were blown away by it, by blown away, I mean blasted in the face repeatedly by the <strong>M87A1</strong> Shotgun. Its dominance and superiority have carried over into the full game, and there’s no question that the M87A1 is the Shotgun to use. It’s a one-shot weapon of mass destruction.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Iron Sights</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 20″ Factory</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Adjustable Angled</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 7 Shell Tube</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> Flechette</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>King of Sniper Rifles. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 has a decent amount of medium-to-long-range maps. This allows Sniper Rifles to flourish, and if you fancy your chances as a precision marksman, you need the <strong>M2010 ESR</strong>. It’s flexible as both a quick-firing quickscope rifle, or can dominate at a distance. Our M2010 ESR loadout is the one we feel gets the most out of the weapon, but don’t be afraid to tinker with the slots here. You may want a suppressor, but we do not.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> SSDS 6.00X</li>



<li><strong>Optic Accessory:</strong> Anti-Glare Coating</li>



<li><strong>Left Accessory:</strong> Range Finder</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 26″ Carbon</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 8RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> DLC Bolt</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> Match Grade</li>
</ul>
