<p>Starting December 1, the price of the Fortnite Battle Royale Battle Pass will increase to 1,000 V-Bucks, up from 950 V-Bucks. However, the real money cost of V-Bucks will stay the same. Players can still earn V-Bucks by progressing through the Battle Pass tiers. In addition, the price of the 25 Battle Pass Reward Bundle has been reduced from 1,850 V-Bucks to 1,800 V-Bucks.</p>



<p>Fortnite is making <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-crew-will-include-the-battle-pass-lego-pass-music-pass-and-more-starting-in-december" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several changes</a> to its Crew Subscription, along with increasing the Battle Pass price. Starting December 1, the Fortnite Crew will include the Music Pass and LEGO Pass at no additional cost, along with the existing benefits (Battle Royale Battle Pass, 1,000 V-Bucks, monthly Crew Pack outfits, and the bonus benefits of Crew Pack outfit styles, Rocket League’s Rocket Pass Premium). New Passes like the Fortnite OG Pass will also be added to the Crew Subscription.</p>



<p>Players who cancel their Fortnite Crew subscription can still claim premium rewards from the Battle Pass until the end of their billing cycle, but not for the remainder of the Battle Pass duration. Those who remain actively subscribed will not notice any changes in the system. Additionally, players who purchase the Battle Pass, LEGO Pass, or Music Pass separately from Fortnite Crew will still have the opportunity to unlock and claim premium rewards.</p>
