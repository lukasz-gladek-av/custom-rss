<p>An open-world action RPG set in the illustrious Game of Thrones universe has been revealed at The Game Awards. Game of Thrones: Kingsroad debuted via a trailer littered with recognizable characters and the iconic score from the hit HBO series.</p>



<p>Winter is coming to mobile next year.</p>



<hr>



<p>Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will occur in the midst of events that take place during the show’s third season, following the Red Wedding and the near destruction of House Stark. You play a bastard of the northern House Tyre, who is summoned back home following the unimaginable betrayal. During the game, you will travel north past the Wall, and as far south as King’s Landing.</p>



<p>During your travels, you will meet another famous Northern bastard in Jon Snow, as well as other characters from the show including Cersei Lannister, Jaime Lannister, and Varys. According to the game’s website, the player will be able to choose between three class types: the longsword-wielding Knight, the brutal axe-wielding Sellsword, or the cunning Assassin.</p>

<p>“Uncover the origins of organized crime in Mafia: The Old Country, a gritty mob story set in the brutal underworld of 1900s Sicily,” the game’s description reads. “Fight to survive in this dangerous and unforgiving era, with action brought to life by the authentic realism and rich storytelling that the critically acclaimed Mafia series is known for.”</p>



<p>While Mafia: The Old Country <a href="https://mafia.2k.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">is scheduled</a> to release in the summer, an exact date hasn’t been confirmed. It’s expected not to be released around Borderlands 4 or Grand Theft Auto 6. It was also confirmed via press release that the game will feature a linear story as opposed to being open-world.</p>

<p id="tw-target-text">Interestingly, the PC version had already been leaked months ago by the trustworthy billbil-kun. The insider stated that the port was already ready but that PlayStation would hold the release to coincide with the arrival of the second season of the series.</p>



<p>By default, the PC version should have several features such as support for widescreen resolution, new graphics options and more. The version is being led by Nixxes and Iron Galaxy, a studio praised for its good quality ports.</p>

<p>In a twist that nobody expected – because let’s be honest, Arcane is incredible – Fallout won Best Adaptation at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>Fallout debuted in April on Prime Video and quickly became one of the biggest launches ever on the platform. It proved to be a boon for the post-apocalyptic series, bringing millions of players into the fold across the whole franchise as viewers everywhere fell in love with the live-action adaptation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tough-competition">Tough Competition</h2>



<p>It has been a phenomenal couple of years for adaptations. Arcane has broken viewership records and turned heads thanks to a whopping $250 million budget, The Last of Us won Emmy Awards, and now Fallout has won the award for Best Adaptation at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>As a Fallout fan, I can speak to the accuracy and delivery of the Fallout TV series. It’s nothing short of phenomenal, and the world-building was spot-on. There are high expectations for the second season, which recently started filming at Amazon and Kilter Films.</p>



<p>Here’s a trailer for the Fallout TV show, just to give you an idea of the authenticity of it:</p>

<p>At The Game Awards in Los Angeles, CDPR revealed The Witcher 4 with a lengthy CGI trailer, rewarding the fans who have waited almost a decade to see what’s next for the monster-slaying series.</p>



<p>At the heart of the trailer sat Ciri, Geralt of Rivia’s ward and the protagonist of the upcoming title. In an interview, CD Projekt Red explained why Ciri is leading this single-player title, stressing that, ‘It was always about her.’</p>

<h2 id="h-an-amazing-layered-character">‘An Amazing, Layered Character’</h2>



<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-developer-cd-projekt-explains-why-it-went-with-ciri-over-continuing-with-geralt-as-protagonist?utm_source=threads,twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, The Witcher 4’s executive producer, Małgorzata Mitręga, explained why Ciri is heading up The Witcher 4, one of the most ambitious games that CDPR has ever made:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was always about her, starting from Saga when you read it in the books. She’s an amazing, layered character. And of course, as a protagonist we said goodbye to Geralt previously. So this is a continuation. I guess for all of us it’s like she was meant to be. That was always her.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The director of The Witcher 4, Sebastian Kalemba, expanded on that:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>She’s actually about to become the Witcher. </p>



<p>She’s about to actually form her own codex, but on her own terms. The way she actually deals with the monsters, the way she deals with quests, the adventures, it’s her own unique way. And also I think that she gives more room to be able to tell different stories here and there. </p>



<p>Of course, we want to give the opportunity for the player to explore more nuance because this is what we do. But she deserves that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was confirmed that she was always intended to be the protagonist of The Witcher 4. In Blood and Wine, The Witcher 3’s final expansion, Geralt of Rivia effectively retired, so for the true fans of the franchise, Ciri’s arrival as the next game’s main character makes complete sense.</p>



<p>The team at CDPR revealed that Ciri’s story was settled for The Witcher 4 almost ten years ago.</p>

<p>Dying Light: The Beast received a new gameplay trailer at The Game Awards 2024. No concrete date has been announced, just a window for the summer of 2025.</p>

<p>The game serves as a spin-off from Techland’s popular zombie franchise. Check out the synopsis:</p>



<p>“<em>After 13 years of enduring experiments, you escape and hunt down your captors to seek retribution, only to discover there’s far more at stake. While the region is not as populated as it once was, there are still people and factions here, as well as plenty of horrors. Some will ask for your help, others will want to kill you. And that’s not to mention the mysterious creature that’s turned the woods into its personal hunting grounds.</em>“</p>



<p>The adventure stars Kyle Crane, an individual who saved several people when the virus spread across the world. However, after several years in captivity and undergoing various experiments, Kyle’s DNA has completely fused with zombie DNA, allowing him to transform into a beast. That’s where the game’s subtitle comes from.</p>



<p>The game is structured with an open world and we’ll have various types of landscapes such as forests, industrial complexes and small villages. It will be possible to play alone or in co-op for up to 4 people and, yes, the mechanics of day and night will be present.</p>
