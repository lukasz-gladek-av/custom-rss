<p>Potential Nintendo Switch 2 fans were surprised by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high price point revealed after today’s Direct</a>, but it may end up costing even more for American buyers. Thanks to a high tariff rate imposed on Vietnam and Cambodia by President Trump, the cost of a Switch 2 could get much higher.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-reason-to-get-your-nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-in-right-away">More Reason to Get Your Nintendo Switch 2 Pre-Orders in Right Away</h2>



<p>On April 2nd, hours after the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct showcase, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his plan to impose a minimum 10% tariff on effectively all goods coming into the country. However, Trump has imposed higher tariff rates on countries with higher trade deficits with the United States.</p>



<p>What does that mean for Americans trying to buy a Nintendo Switch 2? Well it means that those that wait too long may be hit with a higher cost. Nintendo shifted production and sourcing of parts away from China and towards Vietnam and Cambodia in order to avoid tariffs on China. However, the United States will now tariff products from Vietnam <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1907531727683334384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at a 46% rate</a> and from Cambodia at 49%, significantly higher than the 34% rate that’s being implemented onto Chinese goods.</p>



<p>Nintendo though has reportedly stockpiled “hundreds of thousands” of units in the United States over the past few months, in anticipation of these tariffs, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7edbe449-0c44-462e-8787-7347d7ac7a18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Financial Times</a>. It’s unclear though whether or not the $450 price of the Nintendo Switch 2 ($500 for the bundle including Mario Kart World) already takes into consideration the increased cost brought on by the tariffs. It’s possible that if the stockpile runs low and the tariffs don’t relent, the cost of a Nintendo Switch 2 could get even higher. Insider Gaming has already reached out to Nintendo for comment on how the tariffs will affect consumers, and is still awaiting a reply.</p>



<p>Trump’s tariffs are already affecting the PC gaming side of the market, thanks to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/price-increases-for-game-consoles-and-pc-parts-likely-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 25% tariff on all computer imports</a> announced the same day. This includes desktops, laptops, and various parts, and likely will include video game consoles as well. In addition to the Switch 2’s price potentially getting higher, tariffs could also negatively affect consumer spending as a whole.</p>



<p>Do you think the Switch 2 price could get even higher in America because of tariffs? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1807/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
