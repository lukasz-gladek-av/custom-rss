<p>We return to Krat to battle more creatures and find out where everything began. The Lies of P Overture release is an extensive prequel with the DLC aiming to trace the outbreak’s origins back to its beginning.</p>



<p>Lies of P was one of 2023’s most surprising debuts. I hold my hand up and say I thought it looked like nothing but a Bloodborne clone—and a pale imitation at best. I have since gorged on humble pie and was utterly moved once I finally rolled the credits after a million and one deaths. </p>



<p>Lies of P is an unbelievable addition to the Soulslike genre, and the announcement of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-overture-prequel-announced-its-not-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lies of P Overture</a> prequel was music to my ears.</p>

<p><strong>Lies of P Overture is set to release during Summer 2025, but we don’t have an exact date to go with this timeframe.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Sony State of Play Event</a> is where we first caught a glimpse of Lies of P Overture. Again, it was surprising due to Lies of P’s ending. I won’t spoil anything, but it felt like the developers would likely be working on a fully fledged sequel.</p>



<p>Neowiz Games and Round8 Studio were actually working on prequel DLC! In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/lies-of-p-overture-launches-summer-2025-on-ps5-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Lies of P’s director discussed Overture and its goals.</p>



<p>“Do you remember the moment when you, as Geppetto’s most ambitious masterwork, woke up in the middle of the great Puppet Frenzy, a massacre that devastated the entire city around you? Now, you will venture back in time to experience the harrowing journey that birthed that fateful moment. Through Lies of P: Overture, we aimed to fully refine, forge and complete the story as we originally envisioned it,” said Jiwon Choi.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-lies-of-p-to-play-overture-prequel">Do You Need Lies of P to Play Overture Prequel?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, you need a copy of Lies of P to play the Overture prequel DLC.</strong></p>



<p>Many DLCs allow you to play the content without needing the base game. That’s 100% not the case here, and you need a working physical or digital copy of Lies of P.</p>



<p>What isn’t confirmed though is if this is post-game DLC, it can be started midway, or available from the second you boot Lies of P up for the first time. With Overture being a prequel, I’d lean toward the DLC being readily available, even if you’ve never played the base game of Lies of P before.</p>



<p>We’ll update this hub once we learn the accurate release date, as well as what’s needed to play Overture.</p>

<p>Did the Lies of P Overture DLC announcement catch you off guard too? Did you play or finish Lies of P? What have you made of the early Overture gameplay footage so far? Let us know.</p>

<p>Days Gone 2 is a sequel many gaming fans have wanted for a long time. Its sales suggested the debut title was a success, but 6 years later, we’re still twiddling our thumbs, waiting to get our Freaker on for Days Gone 2.</p>



<p>I’m glad I get to write about Days Gone as I think it’s one of the most underrated games of all time. I played it when it first came out, and I’ll never understand the lukewarm critical reception it got. Freakers and hoards are utterly terrifying, the story is consistently engaging throughout, and it’s a rock-solid survival title from start to finish.</p>



<p>Rumors circulated in late 2024 that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-circulate-that-days-gone-is-getting-ps5-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone PS5 Remaster</a> was in the works. This finally happened at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s February 2025 State of Play</a>. Now, the Days Gone 2 discourse is hotter than ever.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-a-days-gone-2-sequel-happening">Is a Days Gone 2 Sequel Happening?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Could it be? Credit to Bend Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As it stands, a Days Gone 2 sequel is not in development, nor is it on the cards—and there’s a good chance it will never happen.</strong></p>



<p>It breaks my heart writing this, and I hope I get to backtrack on everything I’m writing one day. But we believe developer Bend Studio has moved on and was working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-layoffs-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-service title before it was canceled by Sony</a>. This means outside of Days Gone’s Broken Road DLC—and now the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-remastered-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone Remastered</a> release—this may be all the <a href="https://www.bendstudio.com/game/days-gone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Days Gone</a> content we get.</p>



<p>Oh, and we also mustn’t forget its connection to Astro Bot—something <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/">Days Gone’s dir</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/">ctor</a> wasn’t keen on.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-hasn-t-days-gone-had-a-sequel">Why Hasn’t Days Gone Had a Sequel?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s been widely reported Sony was not the biggest fan of Days Gone when it first came out, despite the game selling very well.</strong></p>



<p>Days Gone took a long time to develop and probably cost a decent amount of money to make and market. But <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2023/12/20/playstation-game-sales-bloodborne-days-gone-7-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game World Observer reported</a> in 2023 Days Gone had sold close to <strong>7.5 million copies</strong>—bettering Bloodborne and 2016’s Ratchet &amp; Clank—and by now, it’s probably closer to 8 million—with the Remaster sure to give it a boost.</p>



<p>Despite this, Jeff Ross—a senior member of the Days Gone team—had this to say on there being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-sequel-sony-never-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no sequel</a>: “A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence <strong>it will never happen</strong>. <strong>Sony higher ups like Hermen were never fans</strong>, so you won’t hear about it at the PlayStation State of Play today or ever.”</p>



<p>I think the only way we’re going to see a sequel is if there’s interest. The Days Gone remaster needs to sell well, and people need to show they want another game. Plus, if Bend Studio’s rumored live-service title has been stopped, it means they’re free. Maybe they have some time to develop a certain Zombie-game sequel?</p>



<hr>



<p>In short, if <em>you </em>want a Days Gone 2 sequel, support it by buying it. Post about it on social media, make videos, and everything in between. What are your memories of Days Gone? Is it scandalous we’ve never had a Days Gone 2?</p>

<p>GSC has published the 1.2 patch for STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, releasing more than 1,700 bug fixes across all platforms. In a post accompanying the release, it was revealed that ‘all aspects of the game’ have been addressed, from AI and UI to weapon balancing and open-world exploration mechanics.</p>



<p>It’s one heck of a list, but that has become par for the course for GSC, which has worked tirelessly to optimise STALKER 2 since the game was released in December 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-major-update-1-2">Major Update 1.2</h2>



<p>One of the major areas addressed by GSC Game World in the 1.2 patch for STALKER 2 is the game’s AI engine and mechanics.</p>



<p>This update has swept the ‘A-Life’ ecosystem, with upgrades being applied to the accuracy, stealth, behaviour, and interactions of NPCs throughout The Zone. The team has also provided extended fixes and tweaks to the many mutants that roam this open-world title.</p>



<p>Many performance-based changes have been applied in the STALKER 2 1.2 patch, too. GSC has repaired some sequences that were causing FPS drops, and a major memory leak issue has been sorted out.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en/news/patch-1-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full list of improvements</a> is nuts – GSC has considered every little detail in this major patch. For instance, the team has looked at everything from visual glitches occurring when NPCs <strong>smoke</strong> to the visual clarity of PDA models in low-light areas. The granularity is insane.</p>



<p>Hundreds of fixes have been applied to the full suite of missions – both major and minor – that players explore as they traverse the story of Heart of Chornobyl. In December, I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">gave STALKER 2 a glowing review</a> despite there being a few issues that surfaced in some of the missions I uncovered.</p>



<p>Patch 1.2 was more about fixes than it was about <strong>additions</strong>, so don’t expect there to be too many new things to uncover the next time you log into the game. GSC added some extra controller features, and there’s a new ‘night music theme’ that’ll play when you explore Zalissya. Plus, some new notes have been scattered around the open world, but that’s about it.</p>
