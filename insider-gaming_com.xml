<p>With the PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro here, players have been eagerly awaiting details on what games will be getting PS5 Pro improvements, and how they’ll be implemented. One game that won’t be getting any sort of PS5 Pro upgrade, however, is Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>In a response to a <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fan on social media</a>, the game’s official account confirmed that players shouldn’t expect an update for the game.</p>



<p>“We currently have no plans for PS5 Pro patch,” the post reads. </p>

<p>The reveal shouldn’t come as a surprise as CD Projekt Red has moved on to work on the next installment in The Witcher franchise as well as a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. Still, the news wasn’t met without its fair share of disappointment.</p>



<p>“Please reconsider this decision,” <a href="https://x.com/ThatGuyNamedTre/status/1859264991620206790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one fan said</a>. “The demand for a Pro patch is high and would give everyone an excuse to do another playthrough.”</p>



<p>Said <a href="https://x.com/RightChandMan/status/1859315618752741738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another</a>: “Really hope this gets reconsidered! It’s one of the best modern games and it deserves a pro patch.”</p>

<p>EA Sports has released its latest title update for Madden 25, and it includes dozens of updates and changes for players.  </p>



<p>From a gameplay perspective, the biggest changes come in updates to various zone defense concerns such as deep fourth defenders, AI defenders not keeping their depth in zone, prevent defense issues, and more. The developers also add the Saquon Barkley backwards hurdle to the game after the Philadelphia Eagles running back <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qha5Sjamgr0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pulled off the move</a> against the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>



<p>Other changes with the update include playbook adjustments, player likeness updates, new X-Factors, new Superstar players, and more. You can check out the full Madden 25 title update notes below <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-25/news/title-update-november-20-2024?utm_campaign=mad25_hd_ww_ic_soco_ig_mddn25tu&amp;utm_source=instagram&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=82540&amp;ts=1732122408863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">courtesy of EA Sports</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-madden-25-title-update-details-november-20-2024">Madden 25 Title Update Details – November 20, 2024</h2>



<h3>Gameplay</h3>



<ul>
<li>Triggering the Saquon Spin Hurdle – To trigger the spin hurdle the ball-carrier must be Saquon Barkley, the defender must be incoming from a 45 degree angle in front of the ball carrier, the defender must be within a close proximity to the ball carrier, and the user must press the hurdle button with the right timing.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed an issue where users were able to create illegal formations by motioning the tight end after an audible
<ul>
<li><em><strong>DEV NOTE: </strong>This tactic was most effective when having the offense audible into formations like Trips TE or Bunch TE. Users could motion the tight end over to the same side as the trips receivers and create offensive overloads. The formations created were not legal formations and this functionality has been removed.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed the QB walking through the center on QB Kneel plays. The QB now is in the correct position to start and walks into the correct position behind the center</li>



<li>Fixed the defensive end lining up in the same spot as the defensive tackle in the 4-3 Over Solid formation</li>



<li>Addressed an issue where no power kicks would land at spots in the front of the landing zone that were difficult for the kicking team to recover
<ul>
<li><em><strong>DEV NOTE:</strong> There has been a change made to kick power and ball placement so no power kicks will now fall short of the landing zone. There will need to be at 25% power for the ball to make it to the landing zone</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed an issue with outside deep fourth defenders biting down on return routes instead of staying deep</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where deep zone defenders would not keep depth when they had no receiving threat in their zone and would allow Post Routes from the other side of the formation to get behind them</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where deep third defenders in Prevent defense were not all staying deeper than the deepest across the field</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the inside deep fourth safety would leave the slot receiver unguarded, going vertical in the Empty Bunch Verticals play</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the inside deep fourth safety allowed the slot receiver in bunch formations on a streak to run past him for a TD</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where Seam Flat defenders in the Dime 1-4 FS Zone Blitz play were not covering the correct sides of the field against the Gun Bunch Str Nasty: MTN Curls play</li>



<li>Alignment improvements in Cover 4 Quarters, Palms, and Cover 6 where the outside Deep Fourth, Quarter Flat, and 3 Rec Hook triangulate their positioning against Bunch Receivers to handle first inside, and first to flat, and deep threat</li>



<li>Fixed an alignment issue where defenders were lining up in the wrong position on Nickel 3-3 Odd Pinch 0 allowing the middle slot receiver to be left unguarded in Empty sets</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where outside cornerbacks and inside cornerbacks would align side by side against a nub-set tight end (TE aligned next to the OT with no WRs outside of the TE)</li>

<p><br>After first being announced in 2010, STALKER 2 is out now for Xbox Series and PC. And despite more positive reception than negative, there are still technical issues with STALKER 2 that have caused some problems for players. </p>



<p>In a statement on <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1859265478276894856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the game’s developers at GSC Game World expressed their joy of the game finally being available to players. That said, they did acknowledge that the game has some “rough edges” that will be worked on as they monitor the feedback of players.</p>



<p>“We understand that in such a game, there may still be rough edges: we literally haven’t released anything of this scale before,” they said. “We’re absolutely committed to being here, monitoring your feedback, and quickly fixing any issues that need our attention.”</p>

<p>They continued to say that over the next few days, they will be working on various hotfixes for the game and will release them “as precisely as possible” while still being as frequent as they can. After those are out, the focus will move to larger updates for the game.</p>



<p>“There will also be free in-game content — we’ll share its roadmap later in December,” they said. “We have big plans for the <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> universe. In a way, today is both a return and the beginning of a grand new journey.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grant Taylor-Hill reviewed the game</a>, and says that despite any technical hiccups early on, STALKER 2 is “the cream of the crop, and it’s a bar to which every developer in the genre should aspire to reach.”</p>
