<p>If you’re only going to be married to Marvel Rivals on Valentine’s Day, then the perfect costume bundle will be there for you if no one else will be. The 60th Wedding Anniversary Combo Bundle is releasing on February 14, featuring wedding outfits for both Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman.</p>



<p>Somewhere, Namor is crying, but you can’t tell because he’s underwater.</p>



<h2 id="h-mister-fantastic-amp-invisible-woman-celebrate-their-anniversary-in-marvel-rivals">Mister Fantastic &amp; Invisible Woman Celebrate Their Anniversary in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>Inspired by The Life Fantastic series and the 2005 Wedding Special comic, the new costumes in Marvel Rivals celebrate the 60th wedding anniversary of Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman. Both members of the Fantastic Four look their best in a stunning tuxedo and gorgeous wedding dress.</p>



<p>According to Marvel Rivals insider Miller Ross, both costumes will be <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller/status/1889706032676348258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">permanent additions</a> to the store. Each outfit can be bought on its own for 2,200 units, and includes the costume, an MVP animation, a nameplate, a spray, and an emote. The bundle that combines both of them is surely the better value, as you get both costumes and all the add-ons for just 2,800 units.</p>



<p>However, players also have the chance to pick up the bundle for free, by playing quickmatch at the same time and on the same server as a popular streamer. Streamers like Nadeshot, Emiru, and TimTheTatman <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/events/20250212/40956_1211432.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are all participating</a> from February 12 to 13.</p>



<p>In-game purchases like costumes and battle passes have been the focal point of revenue for the free-to-play game. While no official numbers have been released, Chinese outlet Gamelook <a href="http://www.gamelook.com.cn/2025/01/562110/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated</a> back in January that the game has pulled in “around 1 billion Yuan,” or around $136 million USD. This figure can be attributed to its large player base and consumer-friendly seasonal content plan, with developer NetEase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-heroes-every-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">committing to the release of two new heroes each month</a>.</p>

<p>Elden Ring Nightreign <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t going to launch</a> with the ability to play with just two players. However, that doesn’t mean it’s completely out of the question.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ungeek.ph/2025/02/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-they-are-considering-a-two-player-option/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ungeek</a>, Game Director Junya Ishizaki was asked about players who just want to play with one friend. Ishizaki says that, technically, players will be able to do that at launch. However, it’s not done in the traditional since.</p>



<p>Players will be able to queue up into the game with just one other person if they choose. They will then be matched up with a third random person to complete the required trio. So, while you can play with just one friend if you’d like, it won’t be the two-person run that many have asked about. </p>



<p>To that point, Ishizaki says that the team is thinking about it for a future update.</p>







<p>“Regarding having just two players, not three players or solo, it is something we are considering, but it is currently not in the game at the moment,” he said. </p>



<p>Announced at The Game Awards 2024, Elden Ring Nightreign is a standalone spin-off game set in the world of Elden Ring. Players will find themselves on a smaller map based on the region of Limgrave with enemies being randomized for each play.</p>



<p>The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on May 30</a> for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. </p>

<p>Capcom’s Monster Hunter Wilds carries on the series’ legacy of beast battling, and its file size and GB demands have mostly been revealed. Ironically, they’re not as monstrous as some of its contemporaries, and we think you might be pleased.</p>



<p>Few games deliver the thrill of the hunt quite like Capcom’s long-running series. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is a natural continuation of this, and its 2025 iteration is supersizing the scale and the sleekness of the slaying. One thought pops into the head though, is Wilds going to be too big?</p>



<p>I’m here to answer for this for you, but I can give you a quick spoiler: <em>It’s not bad at all</em>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gb-is-monster-hunter-wilds-on-ps5">How Many GB is Monster Hunter Wilds on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of meat on the bone. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Monster Hunter Wilds file size is 52.826 GB on PS5.</strong></p>



<p>First news of the confirmation came from reliable X account <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>. The user specializes in this information and usually manages to reveal a game’s file size well ahead of time.</p>



<p>A February 12 post seemingly locked in Monster Hunter Wilds’ GBs required. I have to say 53 GB (rounded up) is fantastic for a game that looks to be substantial and stunning. It’s common for many AAA titles with high polish to get close to—if not succeed—100 GB.</p>



<p>Wilds’ file size is a welcome change of pace.</p>



<div><article><p><span>🚨 𝙈𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝙃𝙪𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝙒𝙞𝙡𝙙𝙨

– 𝐃𝐨𝐰𝐧𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐒𝐢𝐳𝐞 : 52.826 GB
– 𝐕𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 : 01.000.010

– 𝑺𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒅𝒂𝒓𝒅 ($69.99)
Pre-Load : February 26
Release : February 28

</span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#PS5</a><span> </span><span></span></p></article></div>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gb-is-monster-hunter-wilds-on-pc">How Many GB is Monster Hunter Wilds on PC?</h2>



<p><strong>The official Steam page for Monster Hunter Wilds indicates at least 75 GB of storage is required.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds’ system requirements</a> explains “75 GB available space” is needed. Now, there’s a chance this total could be updated as we get closer to release. For now, it’s a safe approximation of the number, and could turn out to be the final number. </p>



<p>Or, Wilds might end up requiring less than 75 GB anyway. We’ll keep checking the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> if alterations are enforced.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-how-many-gb-monster-hunter-wilds-is-on-xbox">Do we Know How Many GB Monster Hunter Wilds is on Xbox?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, Xbox has not disclosed accurate details on Monster Hunter Wilds’ file size.</strong></p>



<p>If you check the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9p7pd6wp5ghx?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s Xbox store page</a>, under its “Additional Info,” it clearly states the approximate size is <strong>328.76 MB</strong>. It’s safe to assume this is a placeholder or typo, but I think we can discredit this as file size information.</p>



<p>This figure is sure to be updated, so stay tune for further updates.</p>



<hr>



<p>The file size requirements are actually not wild. It’s quite refreshing all things considered. Are you happy to see relatively tame GB sizes? Do modern games need to find a way to lessen the load on your platform storage?</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is likely going to be in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2025-is-the-year-of-the-rpg-upcoming-rpg-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 GOTY contention where RPG</a>s are concerned. So keen on top of the latest content such as its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-editions-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editions</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-denuvo-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Denuvo</a> status.</p>
