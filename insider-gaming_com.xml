<p>It has been revealed in a press release that Gamescom – the biggest gaming expo in the world – will remain in Cologne going forward, thanks to a new cooperative contract backed by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. Cologne has been the home of Gamescom since 2009, and in that time, it has grown to become something utterly monumental.</p>



<p>In a statement, the team at Koelnmesse said that the partnership between all involved parties has ‘proven to be a success story year after year.’</p>

<h2 id="h-not-going-anywhere">Not Going Anywhere</h2>



<p>With 15 years in the books in Cologne, it comes as no surprise to learn that Gamescom isn’t going anywhere for the foreseeable future. Last year, the event in Germany captured the attention of 335,000 visitors, including <strong>Insider Gaming</strong>‘s team. This year, we’re back – and we’ll be there in force with a full-team representation, so keep an eye open!</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/gamescom-remains-as-the-worldwide-largest-games-event-in-cologne-and-will-be-further-expanded" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the statement</a> released by the Koelnmesse team, it was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Cologne and Gamescom are the perfect match – a partnership that has proven to be a success story year after year.</p>



<p>Together, we have made Gamescom the world’s largest and most relevant games event while continuously setting new records. The long-term contract extension is an expression of this successful cooperation. </p>



<p>It gives us the opportunity to further expand Gamescom in Cologne together with the satellite events Gamescom Asia and Gamescom LATAM as well as Devcom and Gamescom LAN – and to make it a festival for a wide variety of pop cultures around the world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The commitment to keep growing Gamescom is a collaboration effort between the Germany Games Industry Association, Koelnmesse, and the City of Cologne. With a new contract being signed, Cologne’s government and the wider state of North Rhine-Westphalia have ‘pledged their support and extended funding measures for the future’.</p>



<p>Cologne’s mayor, Henriette Reker, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Cologne is the home of Gamescom and will remain so. This is good news, because Gamescom is an important economic factor for our city and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. </p>



<p>It strengthens the local economy through the hundreds of thousands of people who travel to Cologne from all over the world every year, creates jobs and consolidates Cologne’s role as one of Europe’s leading industry locations. But I am sure that Gamescom will also continue to benefit from Cologne as a creative media metropolis.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gamescom 2025 will take place from August 20 to August 24, with the Opening Night Live ceremony being held on Tuesday, August 19.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch 2 Direct went live today, finally revealing all the new features of the new console, and the community has been impressed with the GameShare feature.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The developers have arrived with a proper upgrade for co-op gameplay on the new console. The original Switch allowed players to play a game together by passing a JoyCon controller to them. Now, through the new GameShare feature, they can share the entire game with compatible devices locally.</p>



<p>With the help of Nintendo Switch 2’s GameShare feature, players can play games with multiple screens, even if only one person owns a compatible match. Players can temporarily share their games with not only Nintendo Switch 2s but also other Nintendo Switch systems, such as the original console and the lite version.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players will be able to use Nintendo Switch 2’s GameShare feature with up to three systems at a time. The newly announced GameChat feature will be available alongside GameShare, so players can freely communicate with each other while playing together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The GameShare feature will only be available for compatible games and will arrive via software updates for select titles in the future. The feature is also planned for specific games exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>
