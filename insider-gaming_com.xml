<p>When asked about the sequel in a recent interview, the director of ‘A Minecraft Movie’ stated, “It seems like there’s already talk about it.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-director-would-have-a-blast-making-the-sequel-nbsp">A Minecraft Movie Director Would Have a ‘Blast’ Making the Sequel &nbsp;</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/minecraft-movie-sequel-plans-director-jared-hess-jack-black-jason-momoa-1236362421/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/live-action-movies/minecraft-movie-director-says-sequel-will-without-a-doubt-feature-fan-favorite-character-alex-alongside-jack-blacks-steve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess was asked how he would deal with a sequel for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-mine-craft-movie-biggest-ever-video-game-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest-ever opening-day video game movie</a>. Hess stated that the team enjoyed creating this movie; however, the game world is so expansive that “there were so many things” they couldn’t tap into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hess added that he “would have a blast doing the sequel” for the Minecraft movie before stating that he is excited because “it seems like there’s already talk about it happening.” The director added that it would be a lot of fun to dive back into this world, and the audience is also seemingly going ”wild” for their post-credits scene, which hints towards a potential sequel.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-sequel-will-feature-the-newly-teased-character">A Minecraft Movie Sequel Will Feature the Newly Teased Character</h2>



<p>Hess already has a plan for the characters he will focus on in the sequel. <strong>Spoilers Ahead</strong> for those who haven’t watched the movie, as this references the post-credits scene.</p>



<p>In the post-credits scene of A Minecraft Movie, they teased Alex, an iconic character from the game’s universe. Hess has stated that “it’s Steve (Black) and Alex, and so that’s the one that we will be bringing to the table without a doubt” for the sequel.</p>

<p>The road to Room 46 is reached through one of several gaming platforms. Two of them are the PlayStation and Xbox, and we’re here today to let you know if Blue Prince’s journey can be explored as part of an Xbox Game Pass or PS Plus subscription.</p>



<p>Blue Prince is a game that wasn’t known by many at one point, but loved by those who did. It topped many early GOTY lists, and now that reviews are in, its Metacritic score is cause for some serious eyebrow raising. As of April 2025, Blue Prince is the highest-rated game of the year ahead of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-2-hardcore-mode-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-split-fiction-laser-hell-secret-level/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<p>Its mind-bending series of rooms and puzzles is cause for serious applause. It revolutionized the roguelike genre—like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gdc-awards-balatro-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro</a> did in 2024—to create a masterpiece. I don’t blame you if you’re eager not to miss out, so let’s check its Game Pass and PS Plus status. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cant-afford-a-nintendo-switch-2-buy-a-switch-1-nintendo-says/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders are opening up in various regions—not you, United States—today and tomorrow, meaning that, likely, millions of people are set to make the $450+ purchase on the new console. Unfortunately, however, there are plenty of others that won’t be able to afford the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-1.7503598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CBC</a>, which took place prior to the console’s pre-orders being delayed in the United States, Nintendo of America’s president Doug Bowser was asked about the console’s price and what players who can’t afford it should do. His response? Play the original Switch.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-nintendo-addresses-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-addresses-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Addresses Nintendo Switch 2 Game Prices</a></h6>



<p>“As we look at Nintendo Switch 2 and you think about the feature sets that I talked about … we believe that the pricing is appropriate for the value of the machine and the gameplay experience overall,” Bowser said.</p>



<p>“We recognize there are some people that may not be able to afford [the Switch 2’s] price point. That’s why we wanted to make the other Switch platforms available, so [people] still have an opportunity to come into our gaming universe, be a part of these characters in these worlds, and see value, if you will, in whatever rung of the platform they come in.”</p>



<p>While it’s not as direct as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_JVVUnCWnY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Don Mattrick’s response regarding</a> the Xbox One requiring a constant internet connection in 2013, it still isn’t something that’s likely to sit well with a lot of players. </p>



<p>What do you make of Bowser’s comments towards people who may not be able to afford a Nintendo Switch 2?
