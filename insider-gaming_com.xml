<p>Marvel Rivals is very slowly and tentatively moving towards establishing an esports scene, but more and more organizations are already looking to set up shop. A handful of prestigious legacy organizations are in the process of signing rosters, and more could be on the way as bigger Marvel Rivals tournaments spring up.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-esports-organizations-are-in-marvel-rivals">Which Esports Organizations are in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p>On February 26, Fnatic became the latest esports organization to <a href="https://x.com/FNATIC/status/1894796444390830146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enter</a> Marvel Rivals, signing a roster to compete in the upcoming EMEA Invitational. The six-person team consists of a handful of former Overwatch pros and a former Fortnite World Cup participant. Fnatic is a globally recognized esports organization, famous for its Swedish CS:GO dynasty and from earning over a half dozen trophies in European League of Legends.</p>



<p>Fnatic are by no means the only prestigious organization to jump right in to Marvel Rivals. OG, the European organization built on winning Dota 2’s The International twice, <a href="https://x.com/OGesports/status/1894792288699580668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> their Marvel Rivals roster hours before Fnatic did. Virtus.pro <a href="https://virtus.pro/en/articles/virtuspro-otkryvayut-sostav-po-marvel-rivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed</a> a decorated roster of Overwatch League veterans on February 19. All three of those organizations, alongside Twisted Minds, Team Peps, Luminosity, DUSTY, and the ECSTATIC roster, have been invited to the EMEA Invitational.</p>

<p>Several other organizations are currently considering Marvel Rivals rosters. Sentinels, one of the most globally recognized and successful brands in VALORANT, <a href="https://x.com/robmooreEsports/status/1892336173928108123" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> it would participate in Marvel Rivals. CEO Rob Moore said he sees “tremendous potential” in the competitive Marvel Rivals scene, and opened the gates for virtually anyone to try out. Sentinels will in all likelihood compete in North America. 100 Thieves, another prominent organization based in North America, has also <a href="https://x.com/100Thieves/status/1894809669660713006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> its interest. The invites for the North American Invitational have not been sent out yet.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has seemingly achieved sustainable popularity, maintaining a presence at the top of the Steam player charts since the game released. The team at NetEase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has prioritized a “coexisting” between casual and competitive play</a>. Back in January, the game’s director said they are taking a lot of references from games that have thriving casual and competitive player pools.</p>
