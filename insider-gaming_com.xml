<p>In a new clip uploaded on social media, Nadeshot unveiled the ‘signing’ of Chris Hemsworth to 100 Thieves, the esports organization he founded several years ago. It’s a promotional stunt to boost ‘Crime 101’, an all-new movie starring Hemsworth as the lead, supported by Halle Berry, Mark Ruffalo, and Barry Keoghan.</p>



<p>On February 10, a special one-shot livestream will take place <strong>between </strong>Nadeshot and Hemsworth, and a limited range of 101 Thieves x Crime 101 apparel will be available to buy directly from the ‘101 Thieves Compound’ in Los Angeles.</p>







<h2 id="h-chris-hemsworth-joins-100-thieves-for-now">Chris Hemsworth Joins 100 Thieves… For Now</h2>



<p>In a clip uploaded on social media, Nadeshot pretended he was having a tough time playing ARC Raiders. He suggested that he needed to sign ‘someone new’ to the team, rather than relying on <strong>old talent</strong>. The promo featured Nadeshot pretending to <strong>scout </strong>Chris Hemsworth using clips from Crime 101, the new movie hitting theaters on February 13.</p>



<p>As the clip closed out, Nadeshot welcomed Hemsworth to 100 Thieves. Then, the camera jumped to Chris ‘You Know Him Best as Thor’ Hemsworth, who corrected the creator:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thanks Nadeshot, but I think you mean <strong>101 Thieves</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure></figure>







<p>The post said that Nadeshot would ‘run some games’ with Hemsworth, which could be interesting.</p>



<p>But does Chris Hemsworth play video games? In Avengers: Endgame, he’s enjoying some Fortnite with his friends, Korg and Miek, but does the iconic Australian actor enjoy a session or two away from the big screen?</p>



<p>Probably not. He has made some throwaway comments in the past and was recorded playing an old Thor game on Xbox 360 <strong>years ago</strong>, but that’s all we know. If he’s nursing a secret ARC Raiders addiction, then who knows? Perhaps he can teach Nadeshot a thing or two.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[IEM Krakow Semifinals Represent a Clash of Titans in the Tauron Arena]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/iem-krakow-semifinals-titans-tauron/</link>
            <guid>1428859</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The stage is officially set for the penultimate stage at IEM Krakow this weekend. We’re about to see the final four teams battle for the lion’s share of the prize pool in Poland, welcoming scores of visitors to the Tauron Arena in Krakow, as many as <strong>22,000</strong>.</p>



<p>MOUZ enters the weekend riving an immense wave of momentum after totally dismantling G2, Team Vitality steps into the ring after a solid group stage, Team Spirit has batted down all comers, and FURIA has spent the last few weeks doing what FURIA does best, securing a clean high-tier finish.</p>



<p>But what are the most accurate IEM Krakow predictions looking like?</p>







<h2 id="h-which-team-will-win-at-iem-krakow">Which Team Will Win at IEM Krakow?</h2>



<p>If you’re a fan of Counter-Strike betting, you’ve almost certainly got a wager fluttering around on the outcome of IEM Krakow. If you’ve waited this long, hopefully you can get your slip in today, but if you’ve had a stake running this whole time, hopefully you’re still in play.</p>



<p>There’s a dense weekend of entertainment lined up at IEM Krakow. Here’s what the schedule looks like:</p>



<p><strong>February 7</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Team Spirit v. FURIA</li>



<li>Team Vitality v. MOUZ</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>February 8</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>TBC v. TBC (third-place match)</li>



<li>TBC v. TBC (grand final)</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s a whopping $400,000 prize on the line for the first-place team in Krakow, but at this point, every organization walks away with a sizeable chunk of cash in their pocket.</p>



<p>The four teams left represent a real test. MOUZ has come into the semifinals with some stellar momentum after tearing through G2, but the team has to contend with Vitality, an inherently challenging prospect. In 2025, Vitality scooped <strong>nine </strong>trophies across the Counter-Strike space, and it’s going to be a tough hill for MOUZ to climb.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, you’ve got FURIA v. Team Spirit, and that promises a different kind of battle. FURIA just wiped Aurora from the running with a monstrous performance (shout out KSCERATO), but Team Spirit has shown a resilient streak to get this far.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that Vitality remains the statistical favorite, but MOUZ could serve up a slight underdog edge to snatch the trophy. The safe money will be on Vitality, but there are only four teams to choose from at this point, so it’s not a huge pool if you’re making a Counter-Strike wager.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Star Addresses Whether The TV Show is ‘Fallout 5’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-star-addresses-tv-show-fallout-5/</link>
            <guid>1428856</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Fallout television series, backed by Amazon’s Prime Video, is one of the most beloved live-action adaptations ever made. It’s an award-winning show that boasts an original story fused with elements pulled straight from the post-apocalyptic game franchise, and it just wrapped its second season and is moving onto the third with immense gusto.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, one of the series’s most iconic stars addressed a fan theory. He recognizes that people are curious whether the Fallout TV show ‘is’ or perhaps is setting up for <strong>Fallout 5</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-the-fallout-tv-show-leading-to-fallout-5">Is The Fallout TV Show Leading to Fallout 5?</h2>



<p>We could have <strong>ten years </strong>of the Fallout TV show, including the two that we’ve already had. There’s an abundance of world-building for the showrunners to pull from, and production on the third season is already underway.</p>



<p>In December, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-todd-howard-confirmed-fallout-5-details/">made a bold statement</a> about <strong>both </strong>the future of the television show and Fallout 5, showing how they’ll intertwine:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a recent supersized interview breakdown with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/FalloutOralHistory-PartIII" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, Walton Goggins, who plays Cooper ‘The Ghoul’ Howard in the television show, echoed that sentiment, saying:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;In some ways, people have said, “Is it Fallout 5?” That’s way above my paygrade.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not clear what he’s referring to, but it’s <strong>most likely </strong>a nod to those who believe that the television show’s original content, which is set further in the future than anything ever created in the Fallout universe, is building up to Fallout 5’s story.</p>



<p>That original production was also addressed by Goggins:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They did their homework, and it was built into the DNA of the story that they created, and this isn’t like Fallout 1, Fallout 2, or Fallout 3… it’s its own thing. It’s original content within the Fallout world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Whatever happens, it could be at least another four or five years before we see <strong>anything </strong>to do with Fallout 5. Bethesda still needs to wrap development on Starfield’s second expansion (and whatever comes next), <strong>and </strong>deliver The Elder Scrolls 6. There’s a lengthy wait in store, but fans might be able to tide themselves over with upcoming releases like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fallout-3-remastered-out-now-shadowdrop-rumors-explained/">Fallout 3 Remastered</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bend Studio’s Cancelled Live Service Shooter Surfaces Online Again]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-cancelled-shooter-surfaces-online/</link>
            <guid>1428850</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bend Studio was forced to shut down the ongoing development of an unannounced live-service shooter last year amid restructuring and layoffs that led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-lays-off-around-30-of-staff-following-live-service-game-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30% of the company</a> disappearing. The game that was cancelled would have been a third-person, military-themed shooter, but we know little more than that about the abandoned title.</p>



<p>Recently, fresh files surfaced online from the project, taken from a former Bend Studio animator responsible for designing turrets, character gait, and some minor animations, such as throwing knives and deploying drones.</p>







<h2 id="h-mirror-pond-animations-appear-online">‘Mirror Pond’ Animations Appear Online</h2>



<p>It’s not a huge leap into uncovering Mirror Pond, which was the project name for Bend Studio’s cancelled third-person shooter, but it’s <strong>something</strong>. In the files pulled from a former animator’s portfolio, we can see a third-person perspective (which we already knew about) explored from a more technical standpoint.</p>



<p>What’s assumed to be a player character model walks across the screen, brandishing long firearms and traipsing with a traditional military movement pattern. In another clip, we see the same character throwing what looks like knives, before shooting something from a forearm-mounted device, and deploying a small drone mounted on their back.</p>



<p>There’s also a shot of a turret activating and firing at an unseen target.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>These files were uncovered by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-bend-studio-cancelled-live-service-title-mirror-pond-animations-surfaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">M</a>P1st, but no source was given.</p>



<p>It all points to Mirror Pond having been planned as a near-future third-person shooter of sorts, perhaps aligning with the bygone days of Syphon Filter. That’s one of the franchises that allowed Bend Studio to cut its teeth in the gaming world, and it featured spycraft, a third-person perspective, and techy gadgets.</p>



<p>In September 2025, Bend Studio opened up and started hiring again for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-hiring-for-a-new-multiplayer-game/">new, unannounced multiplayer title</a>. What that is remains to be seen, but it could be an attempt to recover the fragments of the cancelled live-service ‘Mirror Pond’.</p>



<p>Fans have long hoped that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/">a new Days Gone project</a> would surface, but as we all know, that’s very unlikely.</p>







<p>What do you think Mirror Pond would have looked like? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
