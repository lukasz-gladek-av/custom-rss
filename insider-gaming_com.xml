<p>The art director of Bungie’s Marathon, Joseph Cross, has suddenly left the studio. Just recently, the game was announced to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-march-2026-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released in March 2026</a>.</p>



<p>The FPS multiplayer shooter, revealed in 2023, is a new entry in the Marathon series, and a first-party title for PlayStation under Bungie. Originally set to launch on September 23, 2025, it was delayed due to a number of controversies, including, and most notably, art&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagiarism</a>. This month, Bungie re-revealed the game with new gameplay and promised it would ship in March 2026. However, one of the key members of the development team has left.</p>







<h2 id="h-joseph-cross-marathon-s-art-director-has-left-bungie-ahead-of-release">Joseph Cross, Marathon’s Art Director, Has Left Bungie Ahead of Release</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Earlier in the day, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-joseph-cross-stepped-down-marathon-franchise-art-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a> found that the Destiny 2 alum has updated his LinkedIn and got rid of the ‘present’ status for Bungie, showing 2025. Now, in <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-leaves-bungie-2000654665" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an article from Kotaku</a>, the outlet confirmed that Joseph Cross, Marathon’s art director, has left the studio. No official comment from Joseph Cross or Bungie has been made as of writing.</p>



<p>While unclear why Joseph left Marathon, there are a few different possibilities. One could be that his work was simply done and his direction wasn’t needed anymore. Another possibility is that he just didn’t want to continue working at Bungie. The Destiny studio has been in hot water recently with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-copyright-lawsuit-destiny-2-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-admits-live-service-games-smoothly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less-than-stellar sales</a>. Either way, it’s likely, if true, that a new art director will be named soon, especially coming up to its March 2026 launch window.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot Games Plans To Rebuild League of Legends as ‘League Next’, It’s Claimed]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rainbow Six Siege became Rainbow Six Siege X, and now, League of Legends could be set to become ‘League Next’. In a recent exclusive report, it was claimed that the worldwide phenomenon MOBA that is League of Legends could be staring down the barrel of the biggest update in the fifteen-year history of the game.</p>



<p>It was claimed that this overhaul, which would be released as the most major update in more than a decade, would be released in 2027, all being well.</p>











<p>League of Legends is one of the most popular games ever made. It has sat firmly at the top of the table in the esports space for many years, and it accommodates 100 million monthly users. It’s a sensational game that has stood the test of time, and Riot Games is constantly working to upgrade and enhance it for that staggering player base.</p>



<p>In a recent exclusive report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/riot-has-a-secret-plan-to-remake-its-league-of-legends-game?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=copy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Bloomberg</a>, it was claimed that sources close to the information have suggested a monumental shift is coming in 2027. Riot Games plans to release a version of League of Legends known internally as ‘League Next’.</p>



<p>It was suggested that this will be a vast reimagining of the game, addressing the game’s visual aesthetic, characters, arenas, and interface. It’s all part of a bid to make League of Legends more ‘accessible’ to newer, more uncertain players.</p>



<p>Recently, League of Legends developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-wasd-control-scheme-coming/">introduced WASD controls</a> to the game, which was also an extension of that mission to attract even more new players.</p>



<p>Bloomberg’s report wrapped with a note that, despite the size of the player base, numbers are dropping, and <strong>VALORANT </strong>makes more money overall.</p>

<p>Naughty Dog is forcing the developers working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet to work overtime. This, according to a new report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier.</p>



<p>In a story published on Thursday afternoon, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjA4NTY0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NjkwNDQxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0hDRFNLR0lGUEUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.jGluGdyZVa1EEBKJKLlY2aRo0tCwewmOk2TBd_9y2Iw&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schreier states</a> that the studio behind games like The Last of Us and Uncharted has <strong>“been pushing its staff to work long hours to get ready for an upcoming review of the demo by its parent company.”</strong></p>







<p>It’s said that requests began in October for staff to work at least eight extra hours per week with it being logged via spreadsheet. This was done to make up for time lost due to missed deadlines.</p>



<p><strong>“The employees were instructed not to work more than 60 hours a week,” </strong>Schreier writes. <strong>“Staff were also told to return to the office five days a week for this period, up from three previously, sending some employees scrambling to find alternative care arrangements for children and pets.”</strong></p>



<p>Those who spoke to Schreier under the condition of anonymity are worried that, if there’s already mandatory overtime over 18 months away from release, it might get worse in the coming months. As of writing, Intergalactic is scheduled to release in mid-2027. </p>



<p>Sony and Naughty Dog also declined to comment on the claims.</p>
