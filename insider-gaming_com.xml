<p>StarRupture has plenty of secrets hidden away on the map, and finding the Stabilizer Blueprint is a key part of progression, though it’s hard to pinpoint the exact location if you don’t know where to look.</p>



<p>Creepy Jar has plenty planned during early access of StarRupture, as shown by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starrupture-early-access-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed roadmap</a>, and there’s lots to enjoy before the eventual 1.0 release further in the future.</p>



<p>If you’ve reached a sticking point in StarRupture and don’t know where to find the Stabilizer Blueprint, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-the-stabilizer-blueprint-in-starrupture">Where to Find The Stabilizer Blueprint in StarRupture</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Here’s the spot. Image via Creepy Jar</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Stabilizer Blueprint in StarRupture is hidden away in a specific location a long way from the game’s starting point, so travelling to the location requires preparation.</strong></p>



<p>The exact spot, shown in the image above, is northeast of the starting point in the game. If you have a map and have already travelled near the location, it will be shown as a dark blue area on the map.</p>



<p>Before starting your travel, stock up on food, water, and weapons, as the trip can be perilous and weapons are required to defeat the arachnids that are waiting at the location.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-stabilizer-blueprint-in-starrupture">How to Get The Stabilizer Blueprint in StarRupture</h2>



<p><strong>Visiting the location where the Stabilizer Blueprint is found is merely the starting point to earn the reward, as there are a few steps to tick off before you can add it to your collection.</strong></p>



<p>The location is covered by a blue cloud, which needs to be cleared by destroying the blue spores scattered around the buildings, and you’ll also need to fend off the alien species that call the area home, which is why bringing a weapon was crucial.</p>



<p>Here’s a breakdown of the steps to take to claim the Stabilizer Blueprint in StarRupture.</p>



<ol>
<li>Destroy the blue spores around the location, found attached to buildings, and eliminate hostile aliens.</li>



<li>Loot all the buildings to collect valuable resources.</li>



<li>Head to the broken stairs and clear out more of the blue spores.</li>



<li>Follow the path of broken platforms and stairs around the tallest area in the location, clearing out the blue spores as you encounter them.</li>



<li>At the top, clear out the final blue spores and loot everything you can.</li>



<li>The Stabilizer Blueprint is waiting in a nearby Storage Box.</li>
</ol>

<p>Forget SBMM, the grittier competitors in the CoD community want Ranked and nothing but Ranked. The competitive mode is the usual hunting ground for more serious Call of Duty players, making a Black Ops 7 Ranked Play game mode a necessity—and release date info is known.</p>



<p>A casual game of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-discount-by-50-percent-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> is great (with or without SBMM), but Ranked is where the strong and the weak are separated. Ranked Play is a whole different bullet-filled beast. You can literally taste the sweat of try-hards and the feeling of isolation as players lose access to the meta gear they’d normally dominate a non-Ranked game with.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve been looking forward to BLOPS 7 Ranked since day one or feel you’re ready to make the step up, this guide has everything you need to know about Ranked Play.</p>







<h2 id="h-ranked-play-release-date-for-black-ops-7-explained">Ranked Play Release Date For Black Ops 7, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s going to get sweaty. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Ranked Play is dropping with Black Ops 7 Season 2’s start date, and this is expected to be February 5.</strong></p>



<p>Using <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-reloaded-starts-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded</a> and basic data from previous seasons (and the Battle Pass), it’s almost certain that Season 2 is kicking off on February 5. There are rumors that Season 2 could be just as big as Season 1 in terms of content, but it could even eclipse the game’s debut season!</p>



<p>Maps are great, new guns can change the meta, and you’ll never say no to a fresh game mode. However, the hardcore fanbase just wants Ranked Play, and Season 2 should be delivering it to your doorstep on launch day.</p>



<p>We’ll update you if there are any changes to this timeframe.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-isn-t-ranked-mode-in-black-ops-7-from-launch">Why Isn’t Ranked Mode In Black Ops 7 From Launch?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The body and mind are ready. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 didn’t launch with Ranked as it’s presumably a bid from Treyarch to get players used to the game first before launching a fully fledged Ranked Mode.</strong></p>



<p>Pros and elite-level CoD players can jump into Ranked and not struggle, for the most part. But if you give casuals the chance to hop straight into Ranked, it could be a humbling and even sour experience for those wanting to enjoy Call of Duty. It could put people off altogether.</p>



<p>This is why every Call of Duty title doesn’t get Ranked until a few weeks into launch. It also allows the meta to settle—so people aren’t abusing broken guns in Ranked—and gives Treyarch time to adjust accordingly, instead of on the fly.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 Season 2 should finally bring Ranked Play. It’s time to find your ideal loadout, team up with trusted partners, and prepare for the joy and agony of promotion and relegation in Ranked leagues.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout’s Most Iconic Feature Was Almost Scrapped Before Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-feature-almost-scrapped-before-launch/</link>
            <guid>1400209</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever played a Fallout game (since Fallout 3), you’ll know what we mean by ‘VATS’. It’s the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, the handy mechanic that allows users to pause or slow down time, target their enemies more specifically, and wreak accurate havoc mid-battle.</p>



<p>The iconic feature is a staple of the Fallout franchise and has been featured in every game since 2008’s Fallout 3. However, there was a time before the game launched all those years ago that the mechanic was doubted, and it was almost <strong>canned </strong>before it would have had a chance to thrive.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-might-never-have-had-vats">Fallout Might Never Have Had VATS</h2>



<p>In a recent interview, Bethesda Game Studios’ Istvan Pely, who provided lead artistic services across Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, dropped a bombshell. He said that before Fallout 3 came out, the concept of VATS surfaced and was almost scrapped before it made it into the final product.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The studio had to provide that we could pull off a totally different genre, the opposite of fantasy.</p>



<p>We had to work out how your characters abilities would factor into your ability to shoot. Your skills aren’t good, so when you shoot at things, you’re missing – but does that feel good?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then leaned into the topic of VATS:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There was a long period where it was like, ‘Is this even fun? Is this worth doing at all? Is anyone even going to use this?’</p>



<p>Bethesda only just got it working in time to ship the entire game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was revealed in the interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-3s-iconic-vats-system-almost-didnt-make-it-into-the-rpg-in-time-and-bethesda-was-worried-no-one-would-even-want-to-use-it-is-this-even-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EDGE magazine</a> that the biggest issues were camera positioning and avoiding clipping and object disruption when VATS was triggered in-game. It all came together in the end, but it wasn’t without intense effort.</p>



<p>Today, VATS is part and parcel of the Fallout experience. In Fallout 76, the popular MMORPG released in 2018, VATS ‘builds’ are hugely important for players, and there are several advantages to basing your entire character layout on the targeting mechanic.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elder Scrolls Online Gets Paid Battle Pass System 12 Years After Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-online-battle-pass-system-after-launch/</link>
            <guid>1400206</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Elder Scrolls Online players everywhere are digesting the recent news regarding the imminent arrival of the game’s <strong>first paid battle pass systems </strong>in more than <em>a decade</em>. The recent revelation regarding ‘Tamriel Tomes’ follows the developers admitting the popular MMORPG had become stale and too ‘predictable’.</p>



<p>The answer to that is to shake up the delivery of content, cosmetics, unlocks, and exclusive rewards via ‘Tamriel Tomes’. This new battle pass system follows the traditional model of having both a free and paid-for version, and it seems like each is bursting with rewards, but not all players are happy.</p>











<p>In a recent<a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/69141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> super-sized blog post</a>, the team at ZeniMax Online Studios explained the major changes coming to Elder Scrolls Online. The multi-million-user fantasy MMO surfaced in 2014 and has become a cash cow of a product since then, but that concept is about to be broadened by this new battle pass mechanic.</p>



<p>On April 2, 2026, the first Tamriel Tome (read: battle pass) will arrive, dubbed the <strong>Tome of Dawn and Dusk</strong>.</p>



<p>There will be a paid and free version of the Tome, and ZeniMax has promised that plenty of goodies, including free in-game currency, will be unlockable via the <strong>free version</strong>. The premium version of the Tamriel Tome will unlock more exclusive rewards but won’t offer players any advantage beyond better cosmetics.</p>



<p>As you can imagine, you’ll pass through the pages of the Tamriel Tome, unlock rewards as you go, and eventually complete every tier by ticking off in-game events, challenges, and special, seasonal LTMs.</p>



<p>In addition to cosmetics, the Tamriel Tomes grant players:</p>



<ul>
<li>Consumables (research scrolls, gear upgrade kits…)</li>



<li>Currencies (Gold Coast Bazaar Trade Bars, Seals…)</li>



<li>Collectibles (weapon and skill styles, furnishings…)</li>
</ul>



<p>Endeavours and Daily Login Rewards are being <strong>removed </strong>from Elder Scrolls Online in ‘Season Zero’, with most of those rewards being ported into the battle pass system. For those unclear on the topic, the ‘Gold Coast Bazaar Trade Bars’ mentioned above are also new. It’s a type of currency that you can earn and spend in an exclusive Gold Coast Bazaar Store to purchase <strong>only </strong>Tamriel Tomes items.</p>



<p>ZeniMax was quick to outline how ESO Plus members benefit further from the battle pass system. This premium subscription service has run for several years, and it’s not being forgotten with this new feature.</p>



<p>Those with ESO Plus can earn Tome Points at a boosted rate, plus they’ll earn Tome Points and Premium Tome Tokens <strong>for free </strong>based on their membership purchases. With a long enough membership, ESO Plus users can effectively get free Premium Tamriel Tomes.</p>







<p>How do you rate these changes coming to Elder Scrolls Online? Let us know what you’re thinking about Tamriel Tomes on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders is ‘Worse Than Call of Duty’ For Cheaters, Streamers Say]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/</link>
            <guid>1400191</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has a nasty issue that’s bubbling in the shadows, and it concerns cheaters finding their place in the game and ruining the fun for legitimate players. It’s not a widespread issue at present, but it’s bad enough that the game’s biggest streamers have voiced their concerns in the last few days.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever run around outside Speranza and found yourself the victim of a dubious death, you’re likely not alone. While Embark Studios has promised to work on these issues in the short-term, the PR damage is being done by streamers slamming the game on social media.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-have-a-cheater-problem">Does ARC Raiders Have a Cheater Problem?</h2>



<p>The recent spate of complaints regarding ARC Raiders’ apparent cheater problem was kicked off in earnest by Nadeshot. He posted something of an essay on social media complaining about the deep-rooted cheater-based plague impacting ARC Raiders, one of his favorite games in recent years.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Nadeshot/status/2007926647295492467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">He wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The egregious amount of cheating genuinely might be worse than peak Call of Duty. I’m not trying to bring negativity to the game because I know this type of dialogue can spread on socials like a disease but I genuinely cannot get through an entire raid without a Steam profile that is level 0 or an account that has multiple game bans and VAC bans on record.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He turned dramatic when he tried to convey his losses to readers:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m at war and I’m getting absolutely pummeled for 8 hours straight every day. Hours and hours of looting, crafting and investment of time and resources wiped out raid after raid, over and over again.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Days later, Shroud surfaced <a href="https://x.com/CDLHater/status/2008378029462925744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a clip</a> and declared that ‘50% of each lobby is cheating’ and asked, ‘What’s the point in playing?’</p>



<p>Embark Studios implemented a feature before launch that allows users to claim back their lost resources when killed by ‘confirmed cheaters’, but it’s a band-aid over a gunshot wound when it happens regularly enough to get under your skin.</p>



<p>Many have commented on social media claiming that, even after hundreds of hours in the game, they’re yet to see a single cheater or suspicious player. It’s a mixed bag right now, and it’s hard to say one way or another, but it’s no big secret that cheating has become an epidemic in recent years.</p>



<p>It was only a matter of time before cheaters found ARC Raiders, especially as there’s money to be made from RMT (real-money trading). On social media, blueprints and rare weapons can sell for a fair amount of cash, and that’s what’s fuelling a lot of the cheating issues in ARC Raiders.</p>
