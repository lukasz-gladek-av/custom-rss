<p>A new claim states that Fortnite has already begun work on its next anime collaboration, and it’s none other than Chainsaw Man. </p>



<p>Fortnite is known for collaborating with franchises and properties across all media of entertainment. Some of their most popular collaborations have been anime-related, with the game bringing in characters from Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-next-big-anime-collaboration-for-chapter-7-season-1-has-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bleach</a>, Jujutsu Kaisen, and more to the island across the years. It seems they will build on this foundation with another highly popular anime, Chainsaw Man. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-chainsaw-man-in-the-works">Fortnite x Chainsaw Man in the Works</h2>



<p>The Fortnite x Chainsaw Man collaboration’s claim comes from SamLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/2008156723803254943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter); the leaker had previously accurately revealed the Bleach collaboration. However, no other details were revealed, such as the release window, the included characters, or the mythics. But the players have already started making their character wishlists, with Denji, Makima, Reze, and Power as the top contenders. Some are also praying for Pochita to arrive as a Sidekick in the game. </p>



<p>Epic Games has already gone the OG anime route by bringing in names like Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, and Bleach, with One Piece being the only one remaining from the big 3. However, they have been targetting more recent anime as well, with Jujutsu Kaisen, Kaiju No. 8 and My Hero Academia along with Chainsaw Man expected to join the lineup soon. </p>







<p>In other news, Chainsaw Man’s director was working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chainsaw-man-director-is-working-on-a-new-horror-game-for-roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new horror game for Roblox</a> earlier in 2025. Additionally, Shroud has predicted that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-arc-raiders-fortnite-hot-take/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders will be ‘bigger</a> than Fortnite’.

<p>The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is reportedly set to receive new DLC in 2026, developed by Fool’s Theory. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-rumored-to-get-brand-new-dlc-in-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reports</a> about a new Witcher 3 DLC have been circulating online since June 2025, when it was claimed that the third major expansion for the game would be announced in 2025; however, it never was. New details have now surfaced online thanks to a Polish Noble Securities Analyst, which provide an expected release window for the DLC as well as The Witcher 4. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-3-s-2026-dlc-will-kickoff-a-proper-marketing-campaign-for-the-witcher-4">The Witcher 3’s 2026 DLC Will Kickoff a “Proper Marketing Campaign for The Witcher 4”</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-there-really-going-to-be-a-2026-witcher-3-expansion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Polish Noble Securities Analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke about</a> The Witcher 3’s new DLC releasing in May  2026. Chrzanowski has stated that The Witcher 3’s next paid DLC will arrive in May 2026 and will be developed by Fool’s Theory, who are also working on the Witcher 1 Remake. The new expansion is expected to “kick off the proper marketing campaign for The Witcher 4.” The analyst also predicted that The Witcher 4 will release in Q4 2027. </p>



<p>Eurogamer also followed up on the original source, Borys Nieśpielak, who stated that the information about The Witcher 3’s 2026 DLC has been verified by “several” independent sources. Nieśpielak also pointed to a statement from CD Projekt RED’s recent earnings call, which states that “Given our current progress, there is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year.” However, CD Projekt RED’s official response states that the company “does not comment on rumour or speculation”. </p>

<p>A new claim reveals that NVIDIA plans to re-release their GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs to counter the ongoing memory shortage. </p>



<p>The GPU market has been suffering from a memory shortage recently, ever since AI has blown up worldwide. We have already heard reports on how it’s going to impact NVIDIA, with some claiming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-prices-to-5000-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prices will get ridiculous</a> in 2026. Now, a new claim reveals how NVIDIA plans to counter this issue.</p>







<h2 id="h-nvidia-is-reportedly-re-releasing-geforce-rtx-3060-to-counter-ongoing-memory-shortages">NVIDIA is Reportedly Re-Releasing GeForce RTX 3060 to Counter Ongoing Memory Shortages</h2>



<p>The new claim about NVIDIA bringing back GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs comes from <a href="https://x.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hongxing2020</a> on X (formerly Twitter), via <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-to-bring-back-geforce-rtx-3060-q1-2026-tackle-memory-shortages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech</a>. The tweet from today only states that NVIDIA is re-releasing GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs along with an expected release window of Q1 2026. However, no additional details were provided, so we don’t know whether they will release one of the variants or both 12GB and 8GB versions when it is expected to arrive. Additionally, no pricing was revealed either. </p>



<p>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 was released back in 2021 and was built on the Ampere Architecture. The GPU was also packed with other gaming features such as Ray Tracing, NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and much more. There were 192-bit 12GB GPUs and 128-bit 8GB GPUs, both featuring GDDR6 memory configurations. The GPU launched at USD $329 when it was released, and players are hoping it returns at a similar price. </p>







<p>In other news, the memory shortage could lead NVIDIA to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-cutting-rtx-50-series-production-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut RTX 50 series</a> production this year. Additionally, an ARC Raiders backpack had single-handedly crashed the NVIDIA website last month. What are your thoughts on NVIDIA re-releasing RTX 3060 GPUs in 2026?

            <title><![CDATA[Can You Preload Hytale Early Access Before Launch?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-preload-hytale-early-access-before-launch/</link>
            <guid>1397119</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long wait for the release of Hytale is coming to a close, with the eagerly anticipated early access release now right around the corner, and if you have questions about the preload status, Insider Gaming has all the crucial information.</p>



<p>Hytale’s early access release is<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> set for January 13 on PC</a>, and thousands of players are expected to dive into the Minecraft-inspired title as soon as they possibly can, which may lead to strain on the servers.</p>



<p>That may lead to slow downloads for players, with preload a potential way to avoid such issues, and this guide explains whether the option is available for Hytale.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-hytale-have-a-preload-option">Does Hytale Have a Preload Option?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Roaring onto the scene. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no preload option available for Hytale. You will need to wait for the early access release on January 13 to download the game in full.</strong></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HytaleInfo/comments/1psbpco/preload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit </a>post covering the topic, a fan responded with details of the lack of preload available in Hytale, with a developer stating that it “would require more system to be built to decrypt downloads” and they “don’t have the capacity for it.”</p>



<p>The good news, however, is that it shouldn’t take too long to download Hytale when early access becomes available, as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">system requirements</a> for the game state an installation size of around 8GB. However, it’s recommended to have at least 10 GB of available storage, with 20 GB stated to be a safe bet.</p>



<p>As Hyutale procedurally generates a world that can continue to expand, the more you explore, customize, and build, the more memory will be required.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hytale-have-a-preload-option-in-the-future">Will Hytale Have a Preload Option in The Future?</h2>



<p><strong>Hytale may have a preload option in the future when major updates are rolled out, allowing you to download the newest content for the game before the servers are live with new content, but this is speculative at this point.</strong></p>



<p>Many live-services games allow players to pre-download major updates before they are able to play them, with major examples including Fortnite, and this approach means players are able to dive into enjoying content as soon as the servers are back online.</p>



<p>At this stage, however, it’s not known what approach Hytale will take, particularly in early access, given that new patches are expected to deploy bug fixes and new content regularly.</p>
