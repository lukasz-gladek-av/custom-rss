<p>In a new report, it has been claimed that ‘dozens of’ Rockstar Games employees have been fired for misconduct in a wave that might have been a twisted form of union busting. </p>



<p>The report originally published by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier claims that between 30 and 40 Rockstar Games employees in the UK and Canada were terminated, and they were allegedly <strong>all </strong>part of a ‘private trade union chat’ on Discord.</p>



<h2 id="h-blatant-and-ruthless-layoffs-at-rockstar-games">‘Blatant and Ruthless’ Layoffs at Rockstar Games</h2>



<p>Rockstar Games is preparing to launch Grand Theft Auto 6 in just a few months, all being well. The studio has been piecing together the open-world crime epic for years, and fans are eagerly awaiting the delivery of what will arguably be the largest game launch in history.</p>



<p>But the most recent bit of news involving Rockstar Games isn’t all that positive.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTkzOTg3MSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyNTQ0NjcxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNTBISEpHUFFRNkMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.9NYooKXrBMU_quRYMOSw6uACDogcIuS-E27t4GD8f2g&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> recently reported that Rockstar Games laid off 30 to 40 employees, labelling their dismissal terms as ‘misconduct’. However, a spokesperson of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) claimed that it’s an attempt at preventing unionization amongst the team members:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry. This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Take-Two refuted the claims, suggesting that all the firings took place because of ‘gross misconduct,’ but all the employees were dismissed at the same time, per reports, and all of them were found to be in a private chat on Discord related to unionization.</p>



<p>Rockstar Games has mostly avoided the waves of layoffs that have hit the industry over the last couple of years. Take-Two, the company’s parent firm, hasn’t fared as well. In April 2024, the gaming titan laid off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-take-two-layoffs/">around 5% of all employees</a> in a bid to streamline the business.</p>



<p>Do you think these alleged dismissals sound unlawful? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a></p>

<p>After a stellar launch, ARC Raiders has revealed its 2025 roadmap. Over November and December, new content like Arcs, quests, and a new map will come out for the multiplayer title.</p>



<p>Having only launched on October 30th, Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders has quickly become one of Steam’s hottest titles. The extraction shooter saw big success during its beta tests and, now that it’s out, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s hit over 264,000 players</a>. In a thank you note from the team, it revealed what fans can expect from the rest of 2025 and in the coming weeks.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap-reveals-new-map-events-and-weather-conditions">ARC Raiders 2025 Roadmap Reveals New Map, Events, and Weather Conditions</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Posted on <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official blog</a>, the ARC Raiders team detailed some of the new content being added to the game via a roadmap. For November (North Line), the fifth map, Stella Montis, will drop, as well as new Arcs, weapons, and quests. Large-scale community events are also being planned for both November and December. Finally, in December (Cold Snap), snowfall will be added to the game alongside a new Raider Deck, quests, and the Expedition Departure Window.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ARC Raiders team also shared a heartfelt thank-you note to those who played the game. The statement, <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in the blog</a>, can be found below:</p>



<p><strong>“We are so thankful to have you on this journey with us, and we will continue to refine and grow the game with your feedback in mind,” </strong>the ARC Raiders team states. <strong>“Keep your eyes on the horizon. This is only the beginning of what is in store for ARC Raiders.”</strong></p>



<p>With a launch like it had, ARC Raiders has the potential to be the next best multiplayer FPS. It will be interesting to see how it develops over time and what’s in store for players next. Either way, there’s a lot to look forward to for the game, and definitely worth checking out.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-patch-1-notes-october-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-2-patch-1-notes%E2%80%94new-story-adjustments-bug-fixes.1340746/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hades 2’s first major update, Patch 1, is now available on PC and Nintendo Switch 2. The patch notes bring some fixes for Boons and bugs, with the biggest addition being new story, <strong>expanding on the game’s True Ending</strong>.</p>



<p>Released in September, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a> goes bigger and bolder than its 2020 predecessor, with more areas, Gods, and a new protagonist in Melinoe. Fighting Chronos, the god of Time, the witch will battle again and again in order to stop him from destroying the world and rescue her family. The roguelike sequel had been in Early Access since 2024 but came out in full this year to huge praise. Now the highest-rated new game of 2025, Supergiant Games’ mythological epic is poised to be quite the contender for awards. </p>



<p>However, its True Ending was met with some disappointment. Fortunately, the team has revised it, as well as seen additions. During the patch’s preview earlier this month, it seems like the ending changes are a good thing for fans. Some have expressed delight in the somewhat controversial True Ending’s fixes on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1oetj2x/hades_2_ending_spoilers_i_was_wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media like Reddit</a>. Now, the additions and revisions are out for all for PC and Nintendo Switch 2. Along with the ending, fixes to the game’s many Boons and bosses, as well as plenty of bugs.</p>

    <div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts (EA) has removed a “controversial” Battlefield 6 skin from both the base Battlefield 6 multiplayer and REDSEC in response to backlash online: “Wicked Grin”</p>



<p>The Wicked Grin is black and blue skin with a sharp-toothed design on the mask.  It was announced as a new skin for players to unlock as part of Battlefield 6 Season 1, but immediately, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wicked-grin-skin-argument/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players took to platforms</a> like Reddit to voice their frustrations.</p>



<p>There were even players vowing not to revive anyone who was using the skin in-game. </p>



<p>Season 1 began on October 1, and within days, the skin was quietly removed as players continued to comment on the skin. There’s been absolutely no communication from EA on the decision.</p>



<p>In its place is a new “Standard Issue” military skin that you can see below, along with the Wicked Grin Skin.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to EA for comment on why the Wicked Grin skin was removed. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>
