<p>Ubisoft‚Äôs ‚ÄòProject U‚Äô, which was in development at Ubisoft Annecy has had its intro cinematic leaked online.</p>



<p>In November 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-project-u-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> that the game was put back into incubation following five years of development.</p>



<p>The footage, which was uploaded to YouTube by known leaker Shaun Weber shows off the games intro cinematic, which sets the tone for the game. You can watch the intro below (expected to soon be DMCA‚Äôd)</p>

<p>Project U, which was internally called ‚ÄòPathfinder‚Äô was set to be a new take on PvPvE, officially being announced in September 2022 as a ‚Äúnew kind of session-based cooperative shooter.‚Äù</p>



<p>According to sources, the game faced constant pushbacks and delays due to the games replayability, which also saw the games budget explode in size. Five years on, the game still wasn‚Äôt up to par, and Ubisoft pulled the plug on the project.</p>



<p>However, instead of cancellation the game entirely, it‚Äôs understood that the game went back to an internal incubation team because of Ubisoft‚Äôs belief that PvE games could still be successful. The team cited Helldivers 2 as being a particularly successful PvE game that could work well in today‚Äôs climate.</p>



<p>As for what Project U will turn into or if it will eventually be cancelled remains to be seen, regardless, it is nice to see (in my opinion at least), a little bit of the project made public.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Project U cinematic? Does it interest you in the game? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
