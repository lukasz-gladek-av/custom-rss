<p>The biggest Nintendo Switch games arriving in 2025 are sure to occupy your free time, and we’ve handpicked the best exclusives and some interesting third-party titles to look out for.</p>



<p>My Nintendo Switch hasn’t seen as much action in 2024—dare I say, it’s gathered a bit of dust. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-princess-peach-showtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Princess Peach Showtime</a>, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-vs-donkey-kong-princess-peach-showtime-sold-over-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario vs. Donkey Kong</a> haven’t scratched the itch, and there seems to be a bigger emphasis on remakes and remasters. Talk of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> continues to intensify, and it feels like a necessary step to bring more impressive exclusives and power-sapping third-party games.</p>



<p>2025 is ignoring this notion for now though, because it has some juicy Nintendo Switch games lined up. Forgotten sequels and big franchise sequels are also lined up, so let’s take a look.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-games-coming-in-2025">Nintendo Switch Games Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>Nintendo Directs and other presentations are almost certain to deliver shock announcements. Expect surprises and shadow drops throughout 2025, but for now, these games we know are pretty much locked in for 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Darn those Space Pirates. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>A torrid development period stunted <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-announced-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4</a>‘s progress. With the success of Metroid Prime Remastered in the distance now, the Nintendo community is clamoring for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Its reintroduction and long-awaited gameplay debut in 2024 reminded everyone why it’s so hyped. Samus is back with her trusty weapons, battling more Metroids and Space Pirates, all to another funky soundtrack. This could be Nintendo’s biggest ace up its sleeve, so here’s hoping it meets its announced 2025 release window.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Pokémon is the gift that keeps giving. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-releasing-worldwide-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> is the follow-up to 2022’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and it seems to be an entirely new story. The island of Hokkaido is replaced by a more populated and livelier Lumiose City. A single trailer is all we have, and even though it’s quite vague—we’re interested. I love Arceus, and it’s mostly what I’m looking for in a modern Pokémon game. But its sometimes empty and barren world—and lack of Trainer battles—left a gaping hole. Here’s hoping Pokemon Legends: Z-A can deliver, and bring an improved performance compared to the technical mishaps of Scarlet and Violet.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Puzzle galore. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>It feels like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-pre-orders-are-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> makes many of our fun 2025 lists—because Donkey Kong is fun. So much so, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a simple remaster, adding new content, but keeping the authentic feel of the Wii original. You’re assured of platforming paradise with more than a hint of a challenge. We’re ready for its bongo beats and banana stylings and it’s one of the first major games to hit the Switch in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A whole world to see. Credit to Monolith Soft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Xenoblade Chronicles has been a tremendously successful franchise for Nintendo. So much so spin-offs have sprouted from the main franchise, and the Wiiu was treated to Xenoblade Chronicles X in 2015. Like Donkey Kong: Country Returns—and countless other Wii and WiiU games, Nintendo has wanted to bring X to the Switch and is finally doing so with Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition. It’s an intense, JRPG encouraging you to explore its vast world, do important work for the BLADE organization, and fight waves of human enemies and titanic wild foes.</p>



<h3 id="h-civilization-7">Civilization 7</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What are you looking at? Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’m not partial to Civ games—or strategy titles in general—but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Civilization 7</a> is a massive third-party entry on this list, with the series <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-civilization-series-has-sold-33-million-copies-since-it-debuted-in-1991#:~:text=In%20total%2C%20there%20have%20been%2066%20versions%20of,were%20copies%20of%20Civilization%205%20plus%20the%20expansions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">estimated to have sold well over 30 million copies</a>. The traditional fare of world-building through different periods of human history is all here. You’re posed with events and decisions guaranteed to affect your world’s version of reality and history, and it’s important your thinking cap is on when deciding the fate of the human race!</p>



<h3 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Another round of horror awaits. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Little Nightmares saga is not for the faint-hearted. It inspires a new type of unsettling horror that low-budget jumpscare titles can only dream of. Little Nightmares features a new story, fresh, poor unwitting children, and the acclaimed addition of co-op. The second character can be computer-controlled, or you can invite a friend along to lap up the terror with you. It’s an IP going from strength to strength, and I’m expecting bad dreams to abound as a direct result of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>.</p>

<p>I’m hopeful of a Nintendo Switch 2 announcement in 2025, and if it happens, what games do you want to see? A new 3D Mario game? The next Zelda? Let us know your gaming desires.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/witch-path-of-exile-2-best-summons/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playing-a-witch-in-path-of-exile-2-these-are-the-best-summons.1070850/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/witch-path-of-exile-2-best-summons/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Witch was always a fan-favorite in the first Path of Exile, and that didn’t change with the launch of its sequel. People still gravitate toward the Witch for several reasons, primarily because she has powerful summons. With the right combination of skills and abilities, you can roam a map as the powerful Witch, clearing mobs of enemies without lifting a finger. But first, it’s best to learn the best summons in Path of Exile 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-choose-these-top-summons-for-witch-in-path-of-exile-2">Choose These Top Summons for Witch in Path of Exile 2</h2>



<p>Playing as a Witch proves more entertaining than you’d initially imagine. I mean, Chaos magic is downright fun to use and often quite powerful, but you’ll spend more time playing catch-up after your minions slay the entire zone ahead of you instead of casting a powerful bolt of magic.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>You have a handful of choices while playing as Witch, namely:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Skeletal Sniper</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skeletal Arsonist</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skeletal Frost Mage</strong></li>



<li><strong>Zombies</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skeletal Warrior</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>These are in order from “best” to “worst” of the ones we recommend you use. Some may favor Skeletal Warriors above Zombies. The latter is a weak, time-limited unit that decays quickly, but you can spawn more quickly, nearly endlessly, to have a constant flow of minions dominating the battlefield. They’re an excellent tool that works similarly to a meat shield between your squishy Witch and the countless hard-hitting enemies across Wraeclast.</p>



<p>Skeletal Sniper is perhaps one of the most effective and useful summons available, as they deal ranged poison damage that bursts into a cloud of noxious fumes designed to deal area-of-effect damage and lock down mobs. For a similar effect, albeit less effective and with fire, Skeletal Arsonists come in second place.</p>



<p>However, keep in mind that Path of Exile 2 is currently in Early Access. Grinding Gear Games is still working on balancing and will likely change the effectiveness of many abilities before and after launch.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-community%E2%80%99s-2024-indie-game-of-the-year.1070781/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Indie games are thriving like never before. From innovative gameplay to stunning visuals, the indie scene is a treasure trove of creativity, with standout titles across every platform. This year, games like Animal Well, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, Nine Sols, and UFO 50 captured our hearts and imaginations. Yet, even among such a stellar lineup, one game stood above the rest — not just as the best indie game, but as one of the year’s defining games overall. Say hello to Balatro, your 2024 indie game of the year.</p>



<p>In a poll on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forums</a>, Balatro emerged victorious, earning a commanding 72% of the votes. It outpaced contenders like Palworld, Harold Halibut, Animal Well, and UFO 50. And if you’ve played even a few hands of Balatro, the result should be no surprise.</p>



<h3 id="h-redefining-the-deck">Redefining the Deck</h3>



<p>At its base, Balatro is a poker game, but not as you know it. Developer <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LocalThunk</a> takes the familiar structure of poker and transforms it into something wildly original.</p>



<p>Players start with a traditional 52-card deck, but from there, the rules are upended. Instead of competing against other players, your goal is to hit specific target scores using creative strategies. The addition of Joker modifiers (special abilities that can alter the way cards behave) is a game changer. For example, modifiers might let you form straights by skipping numbers or treat hearts and diamonds as a single suit. These twists create an endless variety of deck-building possibilities, ensuring that no two runs are ever the same.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-high-stakes-endless-strategy">High Stakes, Endless Strategy</h3>



<p>The beauty of Balatro lies in its balance of simplicity and depth. Players must carefully manage their money and deck-building strategies to progress through the game’s eight antes. The Boss Blinds that present unique challenges to test your planning and adaptability, add an extra layer of complexity. Every decision feels meaningful, and one wrong move can spell the end of a run.</p>



<p>But that’s precisely what makes Balatro so addictive. It’s the perfect “just one more run” game, where every defeat only fuels your desire to improve and try again. Few games manage to capture this balance of challenge and replayability so effectively.</p>



<p>What makes Balatro truly special is how it reimagines a familiar concept and makes it feel entirely fresh. LocalThunk’s ingenuity and commitment to creating a unique experience shines through in every hand you play. It’s a game that keeps you on your toes, rewards thinking, and delivers endless hours of fun.</p>

<p>The Sports genre continues to tick along and produce annual entries. However, new sports IPs are constantly popping up, and legendary series’ are being revived. All of this happened in 2025, so let’s show you our Best Sports Game of 2024 winner and nominees.</p>



<p>Sports games are a genre that will never die. With so many sports and simulated interpretations of them, we’re guaranteed multiple releases each year. Plus, as most sports have annual seasons, it makes sense to see yearly iterations. I’m thinking of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-team-of-the-year-promo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC</a>, NBA 2K, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-25-was-the-best-selling-game-in-us-for-august-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden</a>, and a myriad of other popular franchises.</p>



<p>2024 featured a lot of these names, and our Best Sports Game of 2024 award winner came top of the league.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-sports-title-of-2024-winner-ea-fc-25">Best Sports Title of 2024 Winner — EA FC 25</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I can only imagine the greatness of this conversation. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>I feel it says a lot about the state of sports titles when EA FC 25 is the recipient of our Best Sports Game of 2024 award. EA’s latest soccer sim sequel isn’t bad by any means—and I’ve spent a couple of hundred hours with it already—but its lack of innovation is symptomatic of a genre that seems to thrive on the concept.</p>



<p>However, when it works, EA FC 25 is a fabulous addition to the long-running series. The 2024 iteration features the new FC IQ tactical system upgrades—which make a world of difference to your gameplay—and I’ve enjoyed the flexibility to mold my team and adapt to my ever-changing squad of players. </p>



<p>Also, Rush is a brand-new 5v5 game mode effectively replacing Volta’s ghost town. These matches are fast-paced, shorter, take place on smaller pitches, and encourage high-scoring games. Absent-minded teammates can detract from the experience, but it’s a great inclusion and something I hope EA builds on.</p>



<p>EA FC 25 features subtle tweaks across the board, and modes such as Pro Clubs have undergone their biggest changes in years. The main selling point for FC 25 is it plays a great game of soccer—the biggest (and best) sport on the planet. Yes, center-backs can somehow catch up to Mbappé&nbsp;with little effort, referees are card-happy, and certain shooting mechanics can be exploited—like every year—but I <em>always </em>want to play another match.</p>



<p>I feel other sports titles aren’t doing enough to make their presence known. For soccer alone, eFootball continues to be a shell of its former Pro Evolution Soccer self, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-ufl-achievements-trophies-list-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UFL</a> is the new kid on the block trying to make a name for itself. I’m hoping a sports game (old or new) brings 2025 to life and challenges the EA FC mantle.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-sports-games-of-2024-nominations">Best Sports Games of 2024 Nominations</h2>



<p>EA FC 25 hasn’t won by a landslide, don’t get this twisted. Other sports titles have more than adequately put their name in the hat. From improved follow-ups to returning legends, let’s check out the main contenders to the crown. </p>



<h3 id="h-wwe-2k24">WWE 2K24</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t go one-on-one with The Undertaker. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>WWE 2K24 feels like a series heading in the right direction. 2K22 was a welcome return after the 2K20 fiasco, and 2K23 was a step-up. Here, I feel WWE 2K24 is once again a gradual improvement over its predecessor, without being groundbreaking. The realism, presentation, and refined nature of the in-ring mechanics are as sumptuous as ever. However, a seriously lackluster Showcase Mode (for 40 Years of Wrestlemania, no less) and technical issues bring WWE 2K24 down, and the developer needs to address the same recurring drawbacks for it to earn a GOTY title match.</p>



<h3 id="h-ea-sports-college-football-25">EA Sports College Football 25</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Prestigious. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>A 2013 legal dispute halted the beloved <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-call-of-duty-release-college-football-25-is-still-the-best-selling-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports College Football</a> franchise quicker than a quarter-back running full-speed into an offensive tackle. It’s taken 11 years, but EA Sports College Football 25 has been a blessing for many who want an alternative to EA’s annual mire which is Madden. This is potentially the start of something beautiful. The College Football aesthetic is nailed down for every team and it features improved gameplay mechanics Madden could do with copying. However, its game modes aren’t the deepest, and it feels like EA was testing the waters with EA Sports College Football 25—a much-improved sequel could throw a flag on the field though.</p>



<h3 id="h-topspin-2k25">TopSpin 2K25</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A swift backhand to the sports genre. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>I had to do a double-take when I realized it’s been 13 years since I owned the last TopSpin game—2011’s TopSpin 4. I’m not sure why Tennis games haven’t been chased very hard over the years—given the popularity of the sport—but I’m glad 2K are now firing on all sports fronts—with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> on the way. I feel I can copy and paste many of the sentiments I did for the nominees. TopSpin offers great gameplay with its winning combination of punchy, racket-slapping shots and authentic tennis matches. But it’s rough around the edges in place: Stadiums and licensed players look great, but animations began to repeat frequently, and it needs a bit more depth in its content. Like EA Sports College Football 25, we’re glad to see it back, and hope it goes one better next time!</p>
