            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new developer diary video from Marathon provides players with a deep dive into the game’s Runner Shells. </p>



<p>With Bungie’s next first-person extraction shooter, Marathon, releasing in March 2026, the developers have been slowly sharing more details about the game. Last month, players were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-devs-reveal-pricing-battle-pass-details-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">informed</a> about pricing details, battle passes, new features, weapons, improvements, and more. Now, the developers are going straight into Runner Shells, the biosynthetic bodies you will be playing as. </p>







<h2 id="h-each-marathon-runner-shell-has-its-own-archetype">Each Marathon Runner Shell Has Its Own Archetype</h2>



<p>In the universe of Marathon, players are transferred into biosynthetic shells known as Runner Shells to navigate the Tau Ceti system. Each Runner Shell has its own archetype, which may include roles such as intel gathering, combat disruption, or combat healing. Additionally, these shells are designed with distinctive silhouettes, allowing players to identify them from a distance and strategize accordingly.</p>



<p>Players can experiment with different playstyles using the game’s cores, implants, weapons, and mods. Additionally, players can look forward to visual customizations that will be revealed at a later date.</p>



<h2 id="h-runner-shell-cores-and-impants">Runner Shell Cores and Impants</h2>



<p>Players can use Cores and Implants to customize their Runner Shell’s playstyles in Marathon. Cores are designed for one Runner Shell, mostly, where they can “buff or modify” the shell’s ability. Implants, on the other hand, can be used by any Runner Shell, and they grant additional stats and a random perk. Higher-tier implants also feature a bonus fixed perk. </p>



<p>For example, if players are going for a mobility build, with cores they can turn the Vandal’s double jump into a triple jump, and with implants they can increase its base movement speed, jump height, and heat capacity. Cores, implants, weapons, and mods can be combined with Runner Shells in Marathon to create unique play styles that best suit the player. Players can check out the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFzR8bN13FA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dev diary</a> to learn more about these systems. </p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-marathon-runner-shells-archetypes-and-abilities">Marathon Runner Shells Archetypes and Abilities </h2>



<p>Bungie has provided details on the base archetype and abilities of Runner Shells in Marathon. You can check them out below: </p>



<p><strong>Destroyer</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Combat specialist</li>



<li>Armed with a personal defense barricade, missile systems, and movement thrusters, Destroyer shells are designed to bring the fight to enemy threats.</li>
</ul>



<p>Assassin</p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Shadow agent</li>



<li>Synthetic smoke deployment and camouflage technology allow Assassin shells to plan unseen strikes or take cover during hostile engagements.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Recon</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Intel specialist</li>



<li>Recon shells excel at identifying threats and tracking movements using echo pulses, tracker drones, and holographic footstep trails.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Vandal</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Combat anarchist</li>



<li>Vandal shells traverse ground at incredible speeds, using their advanced movement and knockback cannon to disrupt combat.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Thief</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Covert acquisitions</li>



<li>With enhanced visors and piloted butterfly drone, Thief shells can locate and acquire loot, then use their grapple to push an advantage or make an escape.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Triage</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Field medic</li>



<li>Triage shells help keep themselves and allies alive using deployable healing drones, onboard reboot abilities, and combat buffs.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Rook</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Scavenger</li>



<li>The Rook frame is designed for scavenger mode, a unique way to play Marathon. As Rook, you’ll drop into a match that’s already in progress as a solo player. You won’t be able to bring a loadout, but you also aren’t risking anything, which makes Rook an excellent option for scavengers.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a post on social media, the teams at Deck Nine and Square Enix announced the impending reveal of the new Life is Strange game. Just days ago, it was discovered on a ratings site that this game will be titled ‘Life is Strange: Reunion’, but the post on socials contains a cryptic message that might <strong>debunk that</strong> in some way.</p>



<p>The team wrote, ‘Separate the real from the rumor,’ but it’s not clear if they’re talking about the content of the game or the suggestion that the plot for the game has already been uncovered.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-life-is-strange-reunion-the-next-game">Is Life is Strange: Reunion The Next Game?</h2>



<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure was the <strong>last </strong>game in the series, released in 2024 to a mixed reception. It told the extended story of Max Caulfield, returning to the fray and being voiced by the instantly recognizable Hannah Telle for the first time in almost a decade.</p>



<p>The short teaser released by Deck Nine in anticipation of the upcoming reveal of the next Life is Strange game didn’t give much away, but we at least know that Max Caulfield <strong>is returning</strong>. That was a point made at the <strong>end </strong>of Life is Strange: Double Exposure, so that’s hardly a surprise.</p>



<p>What <strong>was </strong>a surprise was when the world learned that Life is Strange: Reunion, the rumored next game, would see <strong>Chloe Price </strong>make a grand reappearance.</p>



<p>In the original Life is Strange game, released in 2015, players joined Max and Chloe as they explored a mystery taking over the small coastal town of Arcadia Bay. Over five episodes, Life is Strange unravelled, packed full of teenage angst, emotional sequences, and huge twists.</p>



<p>The game’s ending represented a fork, with players deciding to <strong>let Chloe die </strong>or to sacrifice the <strong>entire town </strong>and drive off into the sunrise. Years later, the canonical ending was made clear, as the story of Double Exposure confirmed that Chloe Price was alive.</p>



<p>We’ll know what the next Life is Strange game looks like in just a few days, when Deck Nine and Square Enix unveil it during a livestream on January 20th at 1 PM EST.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What are your expectations for the new Life is Strange game? Do you think it’s indeed a reunion between Max Caulfield and Chloe Price? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
