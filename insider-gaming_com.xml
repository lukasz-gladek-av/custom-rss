<p>The 2025 season for Valorant Challengers is just around the corner, and in a recent press release, Riot Games unveiled some new changes and updates to the format and schedule for the APAC region. Here is everything we know as of now. </p>



<h2 id="h-academy-teams-to-join-valorant-challengers-in-2025">Academy Teams to Join Valorant Challengers in 2025</h2>



<p>In its official press release, Riot Games expressed the desire to “deepen its development pipeline” and will implement Academy Teams into the Challengers Leagues across the APAC region (Asia-Pacific).</p>



<p>The goal is for this change to allow teams to scout for new talent beforehand, allowing them to test and develop their rosters. However, Riot Games made it exceptionally clear that they still want to give opportunities to new teams trying to join the VCT Pacific. </p>



<p>Academy Teams will be able to participate in Challengers, but they will not be able to qualify for Ascension Pacific.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-participating-teams">Participating Teams</h2>



<p>The following teams have opted to have Academy Teams in their regional leagues:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Challengers Korea – DRX, Gen.G, T1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Challengers Japan – Zeta Division, DFM</strong></li>



<li><strong>Challengers Southeast Asia – RRQ, Talon, Team Secret</strong></li>



<li><strong>Challengers South Asia – Global Esports</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The partnered teams who opt-in will be given a direct slot in their Challengers League for 2025.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-riot-releases-2025-apac-schedule">Riot Releases 2025 APAC Schedule</h2>



<p>Riot Games has also revealed the 2025 APAC Calendar which includes three splits that will lead into Ascension.</p>



<p>Academy Teams will have the chance to play alongside their respective teams during these tournaments but will not be able to participate in Ascension.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>More information about the upcoming 2025 schedule will be unveiled later on as we round the corner of the year. Will you be watching the 2025 VCT season?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-day-before-developers-fntastic-want-you-to-design-levels-wont-pay-you/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-day-before-developers-fntastic-want-you-to-design-levels-for-them-but-they-won%E2%80%99t-pay-you.1023318/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-day-before-developers-fntastic-want-you-to-design-levels-wont-pay-you/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The developers behind the failed extraction shooter The Day Before are asking people to design levels for its next game. Fntastic took to its Discord server (h/t <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-day-before-asking-community-to-work-on-their-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>) to announce a “contest” for people to design a map for its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fntastics-latest-game-attempt-fails-so-they-announce-another-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest attempt at a game</a>, ITEMS.</p>



<p>The catch is, the winner of the contest won’t be paid for their work.</p>



<p>“This contest is a chance for you to unleash your creativity by designing a map that, if it wins, will be added to the game in future updates,” the announcement read.</p>



<p>Rules for participating in the “contest” were then laid out, which includes stating that submissions can be 2D drawings, 3D models, or “any other style”. In addition to the map design, submissions need to also include images and artwork, a full description, the map’s theme, layoff, and “balance considerations”.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The kicker, as mentioned earlier, is that the person who creates the winning submission won’t receive any payment for the time put into designing the map. Instead, they’ll simply get a copy of the game — if it ever releases –, the map built for use in the game, and their name displayed “somewhere” on the map.</p>



<p>As of publishing, Insider Gaming has found that six maps have been submitted.</p>



<h2 id="h-fntastic-s-history-with-fan-submissions">Fntastic’s History With Fan Submissions</h2>



<p>Fntastic looking for fan submissions for its map designs isn’t something new for the studio. During the development of The Day Before, the studio regularly used unpaid volunteers for the development of its game. Those volunteers were located in various countries, including Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Finland, and more.</p>



<p>At one point, the studio claimed to be using over 100 full time volunteers.</p>



<p>What do you think of Fntastic holding a contest for maps for its new game? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forum.</p>
