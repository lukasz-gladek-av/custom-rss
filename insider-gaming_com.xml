<p>John Romero’s upcoming game, which was seemingly canceled back when Microsoft ended its publishing agreement with Romero Games and pulled funding, has been saved. Well, sort of.</p>



<p>During an appearance at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid&nbsp;(Madrid Video Game Show), the creator of DOOM revealed that work on the game was continuing. He then went into some more detail on the game’s state, and what’s been happening since the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/romero-games-denies-its-closed-after-game-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news broke in July</a>.</p>







<p>Romero revealed that the game has been “completely redesigned” and incorporates elements from the original version while still being a different game. That said, he wanted to make it clear that they weren’t “starting at ground zero” with the project.</p>



<p><strong>“We can take pieces out of and put into a brand-new indie game,”</strong> he said.<strong> “We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design.”</strong></p>



<p>He continued to say that the building the game is “more fun” than it was while also being a “much smaller game” overall. </p>



<p><strong>“It’s more fun for us because the people working on it were all directors of different departments, and they didn’t actually get to code or design or whatever,” </strong>he said. <strong>“[Now] we get to actually do that, do the thing that we’re really good at ourselves.”</strong></p>







<p>As far as the game’s features, Romero didn’t go into many specifics during his on-stage talk. That said, he spoke about Elden Ring being an inspiration for the game because it was a “really new experience”. His game, he says, is something that he’s never even played before, and making it something like that for players is the main idea behind the project.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Overwatch 2’s December Patch Overhauls Competitive Like Never Before]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Overwatch 2, despite a few ups and downs, remains one of the most popular hero shooters on the market. Since being released in October 2022 and going free-to-play, Overwatch 2 has remained a staple of the esports space, even with some drastic changes taking place to alter the face of the game’s core competitive leagues.</p>



<p>In the most recent update, the super-sized patch released on December 9, Blizzard made stacks of amendments to Overwatch 2, focusing quite heavily on the game’s competitive ecosystem. It was an overhaul, the likes of which haven’t been seen since the game launched.</p>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-2-s-competitive-revolution">Overwatch 2’s Competitive Revolution</h2>



<p>Blizzard’s latest Overwatch 2 update isn’t just about festivities; it’s a landmark moment for the game’s competitive platform. On December 9, the Winter Wonderland event was ushered in alongside a new patch, but the core of the update addressed the game’s ranked foundations.</p>



<p>The headline change is the ‘Challenger Tier’, a complete replacement for the long-standing Top 500 system that players have known and understood for years. The new framework transforms leaderboards into a season-long battle of skill.</p>



<p>It boasts an all-new scoring system that allows players to earn points based on their MMR, and certain bonuses can be unlocked for consistent performance streaks.</p>



<p>To get into the leaderboard, you’ll need to have a 4000 to 5000 Challenger Score, depending on the playlist you prefer to enjoy.</p>



<p>What’s exciting for the more pro players out there is that social integration is now a thing with this latest Overwatch 2 patch. Those players who are lucky enough to be verified can integrate their streaming and social profiles directly to their entry on the in-game leaderboard, and active competitors are highlighted, prompting fans to spectate their matches from within the client.</p>



<p>The new Wuxing University map is a competitive dream. Cassidy has been completely reforged to emphasize better survivability and versatility, and the competitive meta has been tweaked to no end. It really is the biggest update to the game’s core ‘esports systems’ since it was released over three years ago.</p>
