<p>It’s not a title we thought we’d be sharing today, but here we are. In a recent post on social media, The White House published an image of President Donald Trump, now embodying Halo’s Master Chief, saluting the American flag. In his hand is grasped an energy sword, and in the background sits the House itself.</p>



<p>The post was published in response to GameStop declaring the end of all console wars as Halo prepares to be released on PlayStation for the first time. In a way, The White House is probably suggesting that President Trump ended this war, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-commander-in-master-chief">Commander in (Master) Chief</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> was recently revealed by Halo Studios during the Halo World Championship event. As Halo Infinite comes to a close, other projects are emerging, including this Unreal Engine 5 reimagination of the game that kickstarted the series back in 2001 on the original Xbox platform.</p>



<p>Back in August, dataminers and eagle-eyed fans of the sci-fi franchise were finding references to PlayStation ‘compatible’ Halo games. We now know that the references were pointing to Halo: Campaign Evolved.</p>



<p>Sadly, some gamers are finding out about the existence of this game by way of The White House, using AI to generate an image of President Trump in full Spartan garb as Master Chief:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Donald Trump recently shared a video (not created by him) showing him flying a fighter jet and dumping a mysterious brown liquid over protestors in a jab at the No Kings movement. That was also an AI construct, and the sharing of the clip was met with backlash from more than a few people.</p>



<p>One such person who took offense to the clip was Kenny Loggins, the artist behind Danger Zone, a song synonymous with Top Gun and featured in the clip circulated by Trump.</p>



<p>Do you think The White House is wrong for using AI to replicate Halo like this, or is it not that deep? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-october-27-869/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-869-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-monday-october-27.1335502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a new week, and that means seven fresh opportunities to keep your NYT Connections streak going await. Today’s puzzle is a great way to get your brain whirring as you wake up for a new Monday morning, and whatever challenges the day will bring.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I’m here again with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions that you need to ace today’s puzzle. Read on to get hte answers you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-27">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 27)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #869:</p>



<ul>
<li>ONLY</li>



<li>CONNECT</li>



<li>OLIVE</li>



<li>BRANCH</li>



<li>FAB</li>



<li>FAN</li>



<li>JUST</li>



<li>TWIST</li>



<li>FANTASTIC</li>



<li>SIMPLY</li>



<li>CHERRY</li>



<li>SPREAD</li>



<li>RADIATE</li>



<li>MINT</li>



<li>PETIT</li>



<li>MERELY</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words all describe ways something can extend or disperse outward</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each of these words minimizes or qualifies something</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Classic bar-top embellishments</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Famous groupings or phrases that end in “Four”</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 27.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-27-869">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 27 (#869)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BRANCH, FAN, RADIATE, SPREAD</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – JUST, MERELY, ONLY, SIMPLY</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CHERRY, MINT, OLIVE, TWIST</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CONNECT, FAB, FANTASTIC, PETIT</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cancelled God of War Multiplayer Game Screenshots Emerge Online]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Screenshots of the cancelled God of War multiplayer game have surfaced online. The Bluepoint-led project, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-live-service-games-cancelled-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which was shelved</a> alongside a Blur Studio game, was never confirmed, but known to be worked on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it’s been revealed that <strong>screenshots from a in-progress build</strong> of the title have emerged online. Even more so, it confirms that the God of War project would have returned to an early time: during the original trilogy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-god-of-war-multiplayer-game-would-ve-returned-to-greece-screenshots-reveal">God of War Multiplayer Game Would’ve Returned to Greece, Screenshots Reveal</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mp1st has been a very reliable source of information for quite some time. From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-reboot-concept-art-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rare-cancelled-everwild-screenshots-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everwild</a>, they’ve been quite accurate with their reports. Now, the outlet has <strong>found screenshots of the cancelled God of War multiplayer title</strong>.</p>



<p>Its source has provided them with a ton of screenshots, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-first-look-at-cancelled-god-of-war-multiplayer-game-unveiled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available here</a>, and provide some interesting insight. It’s important to note that, while it may be true, take it with a grain of salt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most notable detail in the screenshot is that <strong>it would have taken place in Greece</strong>. The God of War series hasn’t been back to the setting since God of War: Ascension in 2013. Even more so, mp1st’s source told them that Hades would’ve been involved in some way. This means that the game would’ve taken place prior to his grotesque demise in God of War 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is the only information we have at the moment. As the project wasn’t officially confirmed, details, like gameplay and such, will likely be as hard to find as Pandora’s Box. Still, it’s interesting to see what the vision Bluepoint was going for with the live-service project. The future of God of War is a bit uncertain, but, with reports of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-filming-march-2026-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon TV show</a> starting up next year and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2.5D game</a>, it won’t be long before Kratos (or his brother) picks up those blades once again.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Minecraft Movie Launches “For Your Consideration” Awards Campaign]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/a-minecraft-movie-awards-campaign-warner-bros-oscars/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-minecraft-movie-launches-%E2%80%9Cfor-your-consideration%E2%80%9D-awards-campaign.1335250/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A Minecraft Movie is officially launching an awards campaign for consideration for upcoming ceremonies like the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. Yes, you read that right, and yes, it is official from Warner Bros. itself.</p>



<p>Released earlier this year, A Minecraft Movie brought the blocky world of Minecraft to live-action and the results were rather decent. However, the real success came from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-mine-craft-movie-biggest-ever-video-game-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its large box office</a>, which came as a result of successful marketing and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internet memes</a>. Now, there is now a chance we could hear “Steve’s Lava Chicken” sung on the Oscars stage or Jack Black thank ‘Chicken Jockey’ at his Golden Globes acceptance speech.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Credit to Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure>



<p>Warner Bros. has launched campaigns for many of its films to be considered for end-of-year awards like the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. While some films, like the smash-hits Weapons, One Battle After Another, and Sinners, are among the names, one is a bit out-there: <a href="https://www.wbawards.com/screenings/film/?film=aminecraftmovie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Minecraft Movie</a>. It’s not out there for movies, even okay ones, to do award campaigns, as it could snag some nominations if it’s lucky. However, Warner Bros. is putting everything up for the film, including it’s main cast and director.</p>



<p>The full list of contested categories can be <a href="https://www.wbawards.com/screenings/film/?film=aminecraftmovie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found here</a>. Notable ones include Best Picture, Jared Hess for Best Director, and Jack Black for Best Actor. Will it get any of those? Seeing how the race is, definitely not. However, personally, it does have a shot at Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Production Design, and Best Visual Effects. Depending on how some future movies do, you could even put “I Feel Alive” up there for Best Original Song. </p>



<p>While a weird campaign, it’s not surprising for Warner Bros. to do so. As mentioned before, A Minecraft Movie had a meteoric rise at the box office. In fact, it’s currently the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">third-highest-grossing film of 2025</a> behind Lilo &amp; Stitch and Ne Zha 2. A sequel is already greenlit and in production as of earlier this month. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see if it leads anywhere and, if it does, it will be quite entertaining for sure.</p>
