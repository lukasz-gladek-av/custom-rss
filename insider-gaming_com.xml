<p>At the end of September, it was announced that Electronic Arts, one of the largest game publishers in the world, was to be privately acquired by a consortium headed by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund. The investment group also includes Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, founded and run by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law.</p>



<p>In a letter to the United States Secretary of the Treasury, key politicians Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal have voiced ‘profound concern’ about the ‘foreign influence and national security risks’ of the impending acquisition.</p>



<h2 id="h-pushback-was-inevitable-in-the-ea-deal">Pushback Was Inevitable in the EA Deal</h2>



<p>If the last few years have taught us anything, it’s that lawmakers and regulatory bodies will always try to get their two cents heard as these immense acquisitions unravel. The Microsoft purchase of Activision Blizzard King was a great example of that, with the deal being scrutinized and challenged in the courts numerous times.</p>



<p>Electronic Arts is now facing a similar situation, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the consortium’s purchase</a> of the publisher being doubted by US lawmakers.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent email</a> to Scott Bessent, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, it was stated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We write with profound concern about the foreign influence and national security risks posed by the potential acquisition of American video game producer Electronic Arts (EA) by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake Group, L.L.C. (Silver Lake), and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners.</p>



<p>We urge you and the Committee to apply searching scrutiny to this unprecedented, proposed foreign privatization of a major American technology and entertainment company.</p>



<p>The proposed transaction poses a number of significant foreign influence and national security risks, beginning with the PIF’s reputation as a strategic arm of the Saudi government.</p>



<p>Saudi Arabia’s desire to buy influence through the acquisition of EA is apparent on the face of the transaction—the investors propose to pay more than $10 billion above EA’s trading value for a company whose stock has “stagnated for half a decade” in an unpredictably volatile industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The letter went on to detail the concerns around Saudi Arabia’s attempts to strengthen foreign influence within the United States, suggesting that a data privacy concern will arise from EA having collected the information of ‘millions of users’ over the years. There are also worries from US politicians that the deal will ‘eliminate transparency’ in the company’s operations.</p>



<p>In a final request, the letter asks that the CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) conduct a thorough investigation and review of the privatization of Electronic Arts, feeding back findings by November 4, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Liam Hemsworth stepped into the boots of Geralt of Rivia some time ago, replacing Henry Cavill, who departed the show because of creative differences with the showrunners. While the masses have voiced their concerns about this switch, Hemsworth has proven willing to give the character all he has, which is the sentiment he professed in a recent interview.</p>



<p>Love or hate the casting, The Witcher returns this month with a penultimate series, and Liam Hemsworth is now the star of the show. In an interview with IGN, he explained how he’s handling all the doubt circulating online.</p>



<h2 id="h-liam-hemsworth-has-given-everything-he-has-to-geralt">Liam Hemsworth Has Given Everything He Has to Geralt</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witchers-final-seasons-liam-hemsworth-and-showrunner-lauren-schmidt-hissrich-on-replacing-henry-cavill-and-crafting-a-really-good-payoff-to-the-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, Liam Hemsworth and Lauren Schmidt Hissrich (showrunner) sat down to talk about the upcoming series of The Witcher, which returns after a two-year hiatus between seasons.</p>



<p>For the last few months, fans of the show have been wrestling with the recasting of Geralt of Rivia, the instantly recognizable lead previously played by Henry Cavill. It was a sour move for many when Cavill departed the show, and plenty of viewers feel that Hemsworth doesn’t embody the character well enough.</p>



<p>Hemsworth disagrees:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was a unique situation, to come into a show that someone else has been doing for a period of time. There was obviously a lot of talk from fans and opinions, and I think that’s great. This show has very passionate fans that care about these characters and care about this world. I appreciate that. I understand it.</p>



<p>I poured everything I had into this character. I wanted it to feel grounded. I wanted it to feel authentic. I really hope the audience enjoys the character and my interpretation of it… I got to work with so many great actors and play this wonderfully complex character that has a huge fan base. And I hope people come along for the ride. I feel very grateful to have had this experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hemworth referenced that he’d played The Witcher games ‘years ago’ and tried to get back into them when playing Geralt of Rivia for the live-action series. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I had just started playing [Geralt] and I was like, ‘I don’t know how many minutes or hours I can spend walking around as this character right now whilst shooting the show at the same time.’ So I had a quick look at it and it reminded me of what I experienced years ago when I played it.</p>



<p>It didn’t feel like it was going to be hugely helpful to my experience at that time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth stressing that The Witcher show is based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-book-sapkowski/">on <strong>the books</strong></a><strong> </strong>and not <strong>the games</strong>.</p>



<p>Hissrich, the series’s showrunner, expressed how pleased she is with Hemsworth’s portrayal of Geralt:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You need someone who you can imagine can excel at these action scenes, who has such a physical presence that they could be both intimidating in the story, but also, Geralt has a huge emotional side as well… What I really loved about Liam’s work that I had seen is that he was able to organically blend those two things. He didn’t have physical scenes and then emotional scenes. He was able to really carry this specific, I guess I call it soul. </p>



<p>He has a soul that he brings into the role… To have that present even through action scenes when he’s fighting monsters, and it’s the same thing that’s present when he’s having conversations with Ciri or with Yennefer, that was a really special thing that we were able to capture. And when I had watched some of his work, specifically going back to Hunger Games, that’s something that I felt from him.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Witcher season four will be released exclusively on Netflix in its entirety on October 30. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you intend to invest any time in the show.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-kirby-air-riders-on-nintendo-switch-1-all-platforms-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Making a surprise return from the original entry on the Nintendo GameCube, Kirby Air Riders is yet another mascot racing game set to release on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>With that said, what about the prospects of the new game coming to the Nintendo Switch 1? Games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-exclusive-platform-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> have made their debut on both console generations. Is the same happening here?</p>



<p>Here is the answer to whether or not Kirby Air Riders will be on Nintendo Switch 1 or if it is a Switch 2 exclusive.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-kirby-air-riders-on-nintendo-switch-1">Is Kirby Air Riders on Nintendo Switch 1?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dyna Blade is not ready to go back to the original Switch. Image by Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately for those who have not upgraded their console yet, </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Kirby Air Riders is a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive</strong></a><strong>, and it is not releasing on Nintendo Switch 1.</strong></p>



<p>With the Switch 2 releasing just earlier this year, why would Masahiro Sakurai’s latest game not be available on the original Switch? Most of it likely comes down to performance. On the Switch 2, Kirby Air Riders may not be the most impressive graphically, but it runs at 60 fps, which might not be the same situation on the original console.</p>



<p>Of course, newer hardware is always more powerful than what came before, so we could definitely see a world where Sakurai and/or Nintendo wanted his first release since Super Smash Bros. Ultimate to be as smooth-running as possible. The Switch 1 is a great console, but its history of poor performance is well-known, even in Nintendo games.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-kirby-air-riders-ever-come-to-nintendo-switch-1">Will Kirby Air Riders Ever Come to Nintendo Switch 1?</h2>



<p><strong>While it is certainly possible that Kirby Air Riders one day comes to Nintendo Switch 1, it’s not something we would bet on.</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned above, the Switch 2 is, simply put, a more powerful console, and we’re not game developers ourselves, but we would wager a guess that the Switch 1 can’t handle <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/kirby-air-riders-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOoozuGVBxvh8fJftx43dJCineND4wXoWmBaXjdJiS58nTSdFgtbl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kirby Air Riders</a> quite as well.</p>



<p>Another thing to keep in mind is whether or not Sakurai and his team at Bandai Namco would want to put in the resources to port the game over to the original Switch post-release. You would imagine that the focus would be on supporting the game that is already available and then moving on to the next project.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you bummed out that Kirby Air Riders is a Switch 2 exclusive and likely won’t ever release on the original Nintendo Switch? Vent your frustrations in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Doom: The Dark Ages just got a new patch, Update 2.2, and the notes bring up some bug fixes and Steam Deck verification.</p>



<p>Released earlier this year, Doom: The Dark Ages brought the rip and tear of past titles to Medieval times. Reviews called the game a bloody good time, besting the previous Doom Eternal. While it wasn’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-steam-player-count-is-the-lowest-of-the-reboot-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as popular as others</a>, it remains one of 2025’s best shooters. Luckily, there’s more to enjoy thanks to Update 2.2, which releases today.</p>



<p>The patch, releasing on all platforms, aims to fix many bugs and Quality of Life (QoL) issues. Furthermore, Doom: The Dark Ages is now Steam Deck Verified, so the game can be played successfully on the portable console. More additions include adjustments to The Ripatorium and tuning of the Brink of Death system.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Could Sony’s MLB The Show franchise be making its way to PC? Rumors are circulating that the nearly 20-year-old series is set to release on the platform, thanks to a recently discovered job posting.</p>



<p>Sony San Diego Studios is looking for a Senior Graphics PC Programmer to work on a “AAA PC Title”. There are no other details about what this game could be, as the rest of the posting goes into what the role will involve, such as optimizing the game for real-time graphics on the system, as well as optimizing their PC engine. </p>



<p>While the job may be for a different IP, the fact that Sony San Diego hasn’t released a non-MLB title since 2017 has led to many speculating about the future of the series. The last game releases from the studio that wasn’t baseball came in 2017 when both StarBlood Arena and Drawn to Death were launched.</p>



<p>Since then, they’ve primarily been an MLB The Show studio, including releasing the series on Xbox platforms starting in 2021. The game even made its way to the Nintendo Switch in 2022. The latest installment, MLB The Show 25, was released for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>As far as MLB games available for PC, the last AAA baseball game released for the platform was MLB 2K12 in 2012.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony San Diego for comment on the job posting and whether it was for MLB The Show or a new IP coming to PC. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article and shared on social media.</p>
