<p>Episode 7 is the upcoming continuation of Amazon’s Fallout Season 2. The smash-hit adaptation is currently on pace to outshine and dethrone S1 as the superior series, so make sure you don’t miss Fallout Season 2 Episode 7, with this release date and start time hub.</p>



<p>Video game adaptations are hit or miss. The Last of Us Season 1 is a masterpiece, whereas Halo bombed. Arcane is sensational, but Return to Silent Hill is a dumpster fire of epic proportions. Fallout has been a revelation, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-rotten-tomatoes-score-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout Season 2</a> continues to deliver for Amazon and fans.</p>



<p>If you’re looking forward to the follow-up to Episode 6’s ‘The Other Player,’ here’s the latest Episode 7 info.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-fallout-season-2-episode-7-coming-out-release-date-explained">When Is Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s been a blast. Credit to Amazon</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 will release on January 28, carrying on Season 2’s regular weekly release schedule.</strong></p>



<p>Episode 6 was released on January 21, so Episode 7 is coming on January 28. Shows on Amazon and Netflix are very consistent with episode release patterns, and Episode 7 should be no different.</p>



<p>However, Insider Gaming will be on the ball and the first to update you if any Radroaches or Deathclaws decide you need to take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apply-for-fallout-shelter-reality-show-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(Fallout) shelter</a> for another week.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-season-2-episode-7-start-times-amp-date">Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 Start Times &amp; Date</h2>



<p><strong>Pacific Time-based viewers can start watching Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 from midnight on January 21, and it will be available later for everyone else around the world.</strong></p>



<p>While it would be good if the sun could somehow light up the planet in the same way worldwide, we have to settle for time zones, regions, and scattered releases.</p>



<p>Check out if your region is listed below and what time you can start watching Episode 7.</p>

            <guid>1412863</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Konami’s Silent Hill 2 has been brought to life through Return to Silent Hill. The 2026 movie adaptation looked quite impressive in its prerelease trailers and screenshots, and Pyramid Head looks as dangerous as he should, but all the effort appears to be in vain.</p>



<p>The 2024 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/konami-says-more-silent-hill-remakes-are-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> gave the franchise new life. It recaptured some of the love and nostalgia from the late 90s and early 2000s era. Silent Hill f went in a different but equally compelling direction. It was full steam ahead for a new Silent Hill movie, but unfortunately, Return to Silent Hill has gotten lost in the fog.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-reviews-are-in-for-return-to-silent-hill-and-it-s-not-good">The Reviews Are In For Return To Silent Hill, And It’s Not Good</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The reviews are just as horrifying. Credit to Davis Films, Electric Shadow, Supernix, and WIP.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Currently, Return to Silent Hill has a jaw-droppingly low score of just <strong>6% on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/return_to_silent_hill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rotten Tomatoes</a></strong> based on 17 reviews. There’s a chance more reviews will be added, but it’s hard to see a route back for the movie—and further reviews could bring the score down further.</p>







<p>Critics have described it as a “Massively disappointing adaptation of a classic horror video game,” “An atmospheric, supernatural horror thriller that offers no surprises, thrills or palpable scares,” and “An adaptation that fails to improve upon the source material or do anything particularly new and interesting.”</p>



<p>This makes it the worst-reviewed Silent Hill movie in the franchise, and this isn’t saying much.</p>



<p>The 2006 adaptation with Sean Bean is a Scorsese epic, in comparison, with its 33% Rotten Tomatoes score (and generally isn’t a bad watch), whereas 2012’s Silent Hill: Revelation sees reception plunge to 8%.</p>



<p>Return to Silent Hill beats them all, as it stands. This is likely to affect box office numbers, and it could be the final nail in the coffin for any future Silent Hill movies.</p>



<p>If you already have tickets booked for Return to Silent Hill, please let the community know what you think of it.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-could-spend-up-to-800-million-on-the-witcher-4-its-estimated/</link>
            <guid>1412860</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An analyst has predicted that CD Projekt Red could end up spending close to $800 million on the development and marketing of The Witcher 4. </p>



<p>The Witcher 4 will be the next big instalment from CD Projekt Red, and we already know it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t release in 2026</a>. The new trilogy will follow a 6-year plan. As we wait for more news about the title, analysts have predicted the budget that the developers might be targeting for this game. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-4-could-cost-close-to-400-million-with-an-additional-400-million-to-be-spent-on-marketing">The Witcher 4 Could Cost Close to $400 Million, With An Additional $400 Million to be Spent on Marketing </h2>



<p>The estimate of The Witcher 4 costing $800 million comes from a post on Polish platform <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Strefa Inwestorów</a> (via <a href="https://clawsomegamer.com/analyst-estimates-800-million-budget-for-the-witcher-4-10x-higher-than-cost-of-the-witcher-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Clawsome Gamer</a>). The prediction comes from a Noble Securities Analyst, Mateusz Chrzanowski, who has stated that The Witcher 4 could cost PLN 1.4 billion (USD 388 million) to make, and that CDPR could spend a similar amount on marketing, bringing the total cost of the title close to $800 million. </p>



<p>Additionally, the analyst has predicted that the trilogy’s budget has increased from PLN 2.1 billion (USD 583 million) previously to PLN 3.2 billion (USD 861 million). </p>



<p>Additionally, the report discusses the budget and release window for Project Orion (the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel). It seems this title could cost around PLN 1.5 billion (USD 416 million) to develop, largely due to the apparent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2-could-feature-online-multiplayer-new-job-listing-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer integration</a>. This integration has also apparently pushed the release date to Q4 2030, which will be Cyberpunk 2077’s 10th Anniversary. </p>



<p>Readers should note that these are analyst predictions and not official numbers from CDPR, so take this information with a grain of salt. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s shares have plummeted by over 30% today after news of a major restructuring broke. </p>



<p>Ubisoft recently announced a significant restructuring that will focus on a new operating model emphasizing&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world adventures and games-as-a-service (GaaS) experiences</a>. This news has evidently affected the company’s stock, leading to a considerable drop in share value today.</p>











<p>As revealed on <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/UBI:EPA?sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyk4Gd_56SAxVsXmwGHf2pLt8Q3ecFKAN6BAghEAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Finance</a>, Ubisoft’s shares have decreased by 33.78% today (as of the time of writing). The day began with a share price of 5.26 EUR, which has now fallen to 4.44 EUR. Over the past six months, the shares have declined by more than 50%.</p>



<p>The drop comes immediately after the announcement of an organizational, operational, and portfolio reset, which led to the cancellation of highly anticipated titles like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia Remake</a>, among others. The restructuring has also led to the closure of multiple studios and layoffs across the organization. </p>



<p>Ubisoft’s new operating model now features a decentralised structure with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-operation-model-features-5-creative-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 Creative Houses</a>, each divided by distinctive genres. The goal is to make the company “a more gamer-centric organization, structured around creative genres.”</p>



<p>Additionally, their new model will be supported by targeted investments, deeper specialization, and cutting-edge technology, which includes “accelerated investments in player-facing Generative AI.”</p>







<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-beyond-good-evil-2-survives-ubisofts-project-purge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s exclusive report</a> reveals that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has survived the latest round of project cancellations. Additionally, the restructure has likely led to the Black Flag remake being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed by up to one year</a>.

<p>The world of Hytale continues to get bigger and better, pushed by regular updates from Hypixel Studios and modders around the world, the latter of whom have revealed work on a significant collab.</p>



<p>Along with the reveal of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-update-2-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second major update</a> following Hytale’s early access launch, modders have revealed some early work of plans to bring Pokémon into the game, and it looks fantastic.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-modders-adding-pokemon">Hytale Modders Adding Pokémon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gotta catch ’em all. Image via Pokefind on X</figcaption></figure>



<p>A teaser showcase of completed work from the Pokéfind team was <a href="https://x.com/PokeFindMC/status/2013976180232192067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X</a>, revealing models for the Kanto starters and their complete evolution lines, featuring the likes of Blastoise, Charizard, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur.</p>



<p>Pokéfind has already found a home in Minecraft, offering a variety of experiences, including a Pokémon Survival mode, a custom-built Pokémon region, Pokémon Skyblock, and Pokéwars, and the plans are to offer similar experiences in Hytale.</p>



<p>The social media post stated the team behind the mod is “beyond excited” to bring Pokéfind into Hytale, teasing that “big updates” are coming.</p>



<p>No timeline has been shared for when players will be able to jump into the game, and, due to licensing, it’s unlikely the mod will be available on official channels like Curseforge. Instead, additional steps are likely to be required to access the game.</p>



<p>Pokéfind is easy to play on Minecraft, however, so there shouldn’t be any issues for players jumping into the mod when it is made available, and you can keep an eye on the team’s progression in development by following the social media account.</p>

<p>Hypergryph has revealed that Arknights Endfield’s PayPal channel is undergoing maintenance, as reports about hacks have started emerging from players. </p>



<p>The latest free-to-play, sci-fi gacha, action RPG by Hypergryph and Gryphline, Arknights Endfield, released today for PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile devices. However, it seems a significant issue has arisen on launch day, with players complaining that their PayPal accounts are being used to make unauthorised purchases. </p>











<p>Players across <a href="https://x.com/Unreal_Dreamer/status/2014193328430952555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) are reporting hacks involving PayPal purchases in Arknights: Endfield. A user named <a href="https://x.com/Naruvt0/status/2014217652751983045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Naru</a> has shared information about unauthorized transactions made on a victim’s PayPal account, all linked to Gryph Frontier PTE. LTD. The charges appear in multiple currencies, including USD, JPY, CAD, and EURO, and victims are being charged multiple times for a single purchase.</p>

<p>The official Arknights Endfield <a href="https://x.com/AKEndfield/status/2014188503891099888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account has announced that they are currently conducting temporary maintenance on the PayPal payment channel due to reports of issues. Players are advised to use alternative payment methods during this time.
