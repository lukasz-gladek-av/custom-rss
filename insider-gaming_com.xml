<p>A major expansion is on the horizon for World of Warcraft players with the long-awaited release of Midnight, with the release date for WoW Midnight now right around the corner.</p>



<p>The release date for the expansion was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-release-date-announced/" id="160714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first revealed back in November</a>, meaning fans have been ticking down the hours waiting for the next big slew of content in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/blizzard/" id="1092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard</a> masterpiece.</p>



<p>If you’re eagerly awaiting the WoW Midnight release date, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>

<p><strong>World of War Midnight is set for release on Monday, February 2, so the countdown to launch is well and truly on.</strong></p>



<p>Midnight brings the long-awaited arrival of housing to WoW, something players have been clamouring for, and it’s expected to be a busy release period. Naturally, that may come alongside server stress, so prepare yourself for potential problems.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>WoW has the capacity to deal with the majority of server stress issues, however, so there shouldn’t be too many major problems.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-wow-midnight-early-access">When is WoW Midnight Early Access?</h2>



<p><strong>Early access for World of Warcraft Midnight is set for Thursday, February 26, giving players an extra weekend to dive into all the brand-new content.</strong></p>



<p>Like many other games, however, entry to early access comes at a cost, as it requires an additional purchase. Given the cost of maintaining WoW access, players may want to consider holding out for the full release.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-wow-midnight-start-times">What Are The WoW Midnight Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>WoW Midnight is set to be released at 3 PM on March 2, with the early access launch coming four days earlier at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>That means a late afternoon launch for those in the United States, while those in Europe face a late night. Meanwhile, those in Asia and Oceania have to wait until the next day.</p>



<p>The exact release times have been shared by Blizzard and are available in the table below. We’ve separated the main release time and early access into different columns.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">World of Warcraft Midnight Release Time</th><th data-align="center">WoW Midnight Early Access Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">3 PM – March 2</td><td data-align="center">3 PM – Feb. 26</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – March 2</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – Feb. 26</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">6 PM – March 2</td><td data-align="center">6 PM – Feb. 26</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – March 2</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Feb. 26</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – March 3</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Feb. 27</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Slay The Spire 2 is ready to enter Early Access, just like its predecessor did all those years ago. It’s the perfect time to take on community feedback and balance the various cards and characters, but there’s one thing on everyone’s mind—will the sequel have multiplayer?</p>







<p>It was one of the most requested features for the original Slay The Spire, and for good reason; who wouldn’t want to ascend the Spire with their friends? Well, now’s the time to find out whether Mega Crit took on the fan feedback, and to see whether <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2/" id="3528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slay The Spire 2</a> will have multiplayer during Early Access.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-have-multiplayer">Does Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Have Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stand together! Image by Mega Crit.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Slay The Spire 2 will have multiplayer during Early Access, as you and up to three friends can face the Spire together. </strong></p>



<p>This is thanks to the brand new online Co-Op mode, which brings a whole new level of complexity to the game. From multiplayer exclusive cards to powerful team synergies, you and your friends can work together to ascend the Spire and beat the game. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-indie-games-coming-in-2026/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-indie-games-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8 Biggest Indie Games Coming In 2026</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, this is brand new to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-exact-start-times/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-exact-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slay The Spire 2</a>, with the original game not having any form of multiplayer or co-op available. Whilst you can still play the game solo, there’s no denying that strategizing with three friends will be a thrill like no other—but can you do it from the same device?</p>







<h2 id="h-does-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-have-split-screen-co-op">Does Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Have Split-Screen Co-Op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Helpful notes. Image by Mega Crit.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>At the moment, it doesn’t seem like Slay The Spire 2 will have split-screen co-op during Early Access. </strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mega-crit/" id="3619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Crit</a> have only mentioned that the game will have online co-op, and there remains no mention as to whether there will be anything to do with split-screen. However, the likelihood is that whilst it remains in Early Access, co-op features will remain exclusively online.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What Is Pokémon Pokopia? </a></li>
</ul>



<p>That’s not to say that it won’t change in the future, though. As the game rolls out on different platforms once Early Access is complete, there’s a chance that local multiplayer features could be added. Until then, though, you’ll have to team up with your friends across different devices. </p>

<p>Will you be teaming up with anyone to take on the Spire? If you’re looking for someone to battle alongside, why not look for some friends in the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" id="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>? </p>

<ul id="block-d0bea02d-4b9f-4991-b9db-3b35778ff3bf">
<li>Words that are three letters and under do not count.</li>



<li>Words that reveal the correct theme appear in blue.</li>



<li>The Spanagram turns yellow when found.</li>



<li>Finding three words that don’t fit the theme will reveal a hint to help you find the proper words.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The sequel to the incredibly popular deck-building roguelike Slay The Spire was officially announced back in April, 2024, and now almost two years later, its release date has officially been announced. </p>







<p>However, that comes with a major caveat: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2/" id="3528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slay The Spire 2</a> is first releasing in Early Access, with an official full release date still unconfirmed. But if you’re eager to tackle the mysteries of the Spire, then you won’t have to wait long, as Early Access is right around the corner.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date">What Is The Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will you play as? Image by Mega Crit.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mega Crit announced that Slay The Spire 2 will enter Early Access on March 5, 2026, though the full release date remains unknown. </strong></p>



<p>Whilst it might sound confusing to some, the original Slay The Spire was actually released in the same way. It arrived in Early Access, and after almost two years’ worth of community-led finetuning and balancing, the game was officially released as the complete package.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What Is Pokémon Pokopia?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Mega Crit mentioned on Slay The Spire 2’s Steam page that they expect to follow a similar schedule with the sequel. So, if all goes according to plan, Slay The Spire 2 should ideally officially launch as a complete package by late 2027 or early 2028. Of course, these dates are speculation, so don’t put too much trust in them, but fingers crossed that it arrives sooner rather than later.</p>



<h2 id="h-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-start-times">Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>You’ll want to be up and ready in the morning, as Slay The Spire 2 will be launching in Early Access on Steam at 10 AM PT on March 5.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>Of course, not everyone diving into Slay The Spire 2’s Early Access will be native to the PT time zone, so for everybody else, Insider Gaming has adjusted the release time for your convenience. If you don’t see your time zone, let a staff member know, and it’ll be added! </p>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 23, 2026, Quordle is the #1491 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-quordle-daily-game">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 24</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>
