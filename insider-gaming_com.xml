<p>Mistfall Hunter, a unique and highly anticipated extraction RPG, is set to drop in July 2026. Until now, it had been planned to release <strong>only </strong>on PC and Xbox platforms, but thanks to a new update, it has been confirmed that it will also be released on <strong>PlayStation 5 </strong>when the global launch hits in July.</p>



<p>This ambitious extraction title comes from Bellring Games, and it’s the studio’s first game. It’s being published by Skystone, and it’s arguably the most sizeable title the company has ever handled.</p>







<h2 id="h-mistfall-hunter-is-coming-to-ps5">Mistfall Hunter is Coming to PS5</h2>



<p>Bellring has just confirmed that Mistfall Hunter, the exciting third-person extraction title, is coming to <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, Xbox Series XS, and PC when it drops in July 2026. The team hasn’t provided a specific <strong>date </strong>for Mistfall Hunter’s impending release, but that’ll come soon enough.</p>



<p>Mistfall Hunter is one of the most energetic extraction titles emerging in 2026, which already boasts a wide spectrum of titles making up the genre. In case you’re uninitiated, here’s the spiel from the game’s listing on Steam:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Mistfall Hunter is a third-person action PvPvE extraction RPG. Combine skills, talents, and gear for each class in thrilling combat! Whether you team up or go solo, one thing remains certain—only by fighting your way through can you return with a full haul. Good luck, Gyldhunter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Being mostly an arcade-based title, Mistfall Hunter promises high-octane battles and a class-driven system that promotes a range of playstyles. It’s an RPG title with progression paths and accommodation for up to three players on a single team.</p>



<p>As you can imagine, the game’s extraction loop revolves around getting into a map, looting, winning fights, and successfully extracting again, back to the safety of a hideout somewhere.</p>



<p>In a recent blog post on Steam, the team at Bellring also confirmed that July’s launch window will include new weapon archetypes, a themed mode, a fresh difficulty level, a battle pass, a progression ladder, <strong>and </strong>more monsters, amongst other things.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Ammo Glitch Shut Down by Hotfix]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ammo-glitch-shut-down/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has released a hotfix designed to target the recent ammo glitch that has led to some <strong>duplicating endless amounts of ammunition</strong>, amongst other things. This hotfix also addresses issues with recent Headwinds quests disappearing from quest logs even if you hadn’t completed them.</p>



<p>In the last few hours, we’ve seen content creators from TheBurntPeanut on down abusing the ARC Raiders ammo glitch to run rampant across the game, also leaning on the duplication glitch that allowed for endless grenades to be farmed.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-update-addresses-dupe-glitch">ARC Raiders Update Addresses Dupe Glitch</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2021602130323227105" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new post</a> on social media, the team at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">Embark Studios</a>, the driving force behind 2025’s breakout extraction adventure title, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve just deployed a new hotfix to address additional reported issues:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Fixed an inventory slot mechanic duplication glitch</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an infinite ammo weapon glitch</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where some quests were missing from the Headwinds update</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where partially incomplete quests appeared after yesterday’s update</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The team is dedicated to investigating and squashing exploits and we’ll keep you in the loop, thank you for your continued diligent reporting. No need to download, please restart your game!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The update addresses key concerns that arose after yesterday’s update. Many users reported the Headwinds quests disappearing, despite not having completed them, which caused widespread confusion.</p>



<p>This is record time for Embark Studios to address a pressing concern, which fans have praised the team for. The ‘unlimited ammo glitch’ in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a> emerged <strong>very recently</strong>, and while streamers had their fun with it, it has now been shut down by this hotfix.</p>



<p>Similarly, the duplication exploit that used an inventory trick to generate endless items has also been eradicated.</p>



<p>But some are wondering how long it will be before the next issue surfaces.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-skys-remnant-update-notes/</link>
            <guid>1432366</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hello Games has blessed us with yet another super-sized No Man’s Sky update, and like all the others that came before, this one is totally free to consume. At the top of the table sits the new <strong>Gravitino Coil </strong>multi-tool attachment, which allows you to manipulate gravity and throw things around at will.</p>



<p>Beyond that, there are stacks of new elements for the Colussus vehicle, including <strong>spider legs</strong>, and countless quality-of-life upgrades, such as <strong>better clouds</strong>.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know about the No Man’s Sky Remnant update, out <strong>now </strong>on all platforms.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-man-s-sky-remnant-is-silly-huge">No Man’s Sky Remnant is Silly Huge</h2>



<p>Like the last dozen or so updates to hit No Man’s Sky, the infinitely sized space-faring survival game, Remnant is bursting at the seams with content, as revealed first by Hello Games’ recent social media post:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>No Man's Sky Remnant</p><p>🔫Gravity Gun<br>🦺Industrial Yards<br>📡Radar<br>🛻Off-road Haulers<br>🧑‍🏭Waste Processing<br>🧑‍🚀Armour<br>🤖Capture Sentinels<br>🚒Customisable Vehicles<br>☣️Volatile Waste<br>🏗️Excavation Tech<br>🚛Exocraft Furnace<br>🚚Salvage Expedition<br>🕷️Spider Vehicles<br>🙋‍♂️Toot Your Horn Emote</p><p>Out Now! <a href="https://t.co/uDAhvzs2RM">pic.twitter.com/uDAhvzs2RM</a></p></div>— Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/2021585282890440845?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The Remnant update’s patch notes open with a configuration menu for your Colossus vehicle, allowing you to manipulate your desired build to accommodate any scenario or terrain imaginable. These amendments include cabins, chassis attachments, running gear, and paint finishes.</p>



<p>With Remnant, players can equip their Colossus with a flatbed module, off-road wheels, ‘spider legs’, mobile furnaces, and <strong>more</strong>, including special cabins and cockpits.</p>



<p>For something more stationary, Hello Games has introduced a new industrial waste construct that allows users to pick anything up with their gravity gun and feed it <strong>into </strong>the processing machine. What pops out the other end is nothing but <strong>valuable resources</strong>.</p>



<p>Talking about the gravity gun, Hello has added the <strong>Gravitino Coil attachment </strong>for the in-game Multi-Tool with Remnant. This allows players to magnetise, repel, toss, transport, and arrange any physical objects that aren’t bolted down.</p>



<p>Users on Nintendo Switch can, for the first time, assemble and pilot a ‘corvette-class starship’, furnishing it to their liking and lording it over the rest of the universe.</p>



<h2 id="h-no-man-s-sky-patch-notes-remnant-update">No Man’s Sky Patch Notes – Remnant Update</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here sits the full spread of patch notes for the latest No Man’s Sky update:</p>

</ul>



<h3>INDUSTRIAL WASTE COLLECTION AND SALVAGE</h3>



<ul>
