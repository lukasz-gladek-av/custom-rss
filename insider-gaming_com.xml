<p>Mortal Kombat 3, stylized as Mortal Kombat III, is now greenlit at Warner Bros and New Line, according to the screenwriter.</p>



<p>The Mortal Kombat film series is rather new, starting in 2021. The newest entry, Mortal Kombat II, is currently in post-production, having been delayed to May 15th, 2026. However, it seems the reception from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-mortal-kombat-2-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its huge red-band trailer</a> was enough to get another entry going before the sequel hits theaters.</p>



<h2 id="h-mortal-kombat-3-confirmed-by-screenwriter-at-comic-con">Mortal Kombat 3 Confirmed by Screenwriter at Comic-Con</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Jeremy Slater, screenwriter for Mortal Kombat II, announced at New York Comic-Con that Mortal Kombat 3 is officially in the works. Furthermore, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/mortal-kombat-iii-jeremy-slater-writing-new-line-1236582473/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exclusive news from Deadline</a> confirms that New Line and Warner Bros will return to distribute and produce the film. As the sequel isn’t out, no story details or casting have been confirmed. Even more so, there is no release date for the film, as it’s in the writing stages. </p>



<p>At the Comic-Con panel, Jeremy Slater stood with the cast and crew of Mortal Kombat II, like Karl Urban and Tati Gabrielle. As he was telling the audience about Mortal Kombat II, he revealed the third entry’s existence. He says,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Our friends at New Line and Warner Bros. are so happy with this movie,” Slater remarks. “They are so excited. They are so convinced that there is a giant fanbase waiting for it that they have already hired me to start writing the next installment of Mortal Kombat.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a pretty good sign when Mortal Kombat III is greenlit before Mortal Kombat II is even out. While the delay from October 2025 to May 2026 is a big leap, it seems Warner Bros. is happy with the film enough to do another. The original Mortal Kombat film did quite well at the box office, so perhaps we can see the series get another lease on life in film.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever gotten into an argument with a friend over who is the greatest of all time between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, then we suggest taking a few minutes to check out the popular Roblox title Neo Tennis. As the name suggests, Neo Tennis is a sports game where players are pitched against each other in 1v1 or 2v2 tennis matches. There are global as well as seasonal ranking systems in the game, adding further reason for players to grind out Neo Tennis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With special in-game abilities and custom rackets to acquire, the competition level can be quite high, which is why some Neo Tennis codes could prove to be useful. Although cosmetics and in-game currency can be highly sought-after items from these Neo Tennis codes, getting a unique racket is an experience on its own. To get free rewards in this game using Neo Tennis codes, continue reading on.</p>

<h2 id="h-expired-neo-tennis-codes">Expired Neo Tennis Codes</h2>



<div><p>As of the writing of this article, there are no Neo Tennis codes that have expired. Although the lack of codes could be a cause for concern among aspiring players, considering that the game came out relatively recently, they don’t need to be overly worried. Moreover, with just how popular the game has become recently, new Neo Tennis codes are surely on the horizon, and players are urged to wait patiently for the next drop.</p><p>In the meantime, we recommend that all active players of the game keep this page bookmarked, as we update this article with the latest codes as soon as the developers release them. Be it through their Discord server or through the socials, rest assured that our page will be updated soon after the codes come out.</p></div>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-neo-tennis-codes">How to redeem Neo Tennis Codes</h2>



<p>Redeeming codes in Neo Tennis is a fairly simple process, with no major steps needing to be completed before players can get their hands on the rewards on offer. Although many Roblox games nowadays impose requirements on players before giving them the ability to redeem codes, Neo Tennis has done no such thing. Redeeming Neo Tennis codes is as simple as navigating through the menus and inputting one of the active codes into the correct text box. Here’s a step-by-step guide for beginners:</p>



<ul>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Neo Tennis</li>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-megan-fox-matpat-cast/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/five-nights-at-freddy%E2%80%99s-2-adds-megan-fox-matpat-to-cast.1322728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 has revealed three new cast members at Comic-Con, with two directly related to the series.</p>



<p>A sequel to the original 2023 film adaptation, Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 plans to up the stakes and deliver some quality scares. The story will seemingly see the animatronics of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria unleashed to the public. New to the film are the Toy animatronics from the video game’s sequel. Now, confirmed at Comic-Con, we have a fresh new look at them, alongside who will be voicing them.</p>



<h2 id="h-megan-fox-matpat-cast-as-toy-animatronics-in-five-nights-at-freddy-s-2">Megan Fox, MatPat Cast as Toy Animatronics in Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>During a panel for Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 at New York Comic-Con, it was announced that the Toy animatronics will have some well-known actors attached to them. As Toy Freddy, the role will be played by VA Kellen Goff, who voices Glamrock Freddy in Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach. For the role of Toy Bonnie, MatPat, former host of Game Theory and FNAF icon, will voice the robotic bunny. Finally, and perhaps the most out-there, Transformers actress <a href="https://x.com/FNAFMovie/status/1976815880626679994?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Megan Fox</a> will voice Toy Chica.</p>



<p>Megan Fox’s addition to Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 is an interesting one, though not too far-fetched. Previously, the Jennifer’s Body actress voiced Nitara in Mortal Kombat 1. She has stated to be a fan of games, so being in FNAF is a no-brainer. MatPat (Matthew Patrick), interestingly enough, already cameoed as a waiter in 2023’s Five Nights at Freddy’s film. Still, given his contributions to the fandom, it’s a great role for him, especially considering his acting background. </p>



<p>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 is set to hit theaters on December 5th, 2025. A new poster, showing off the Toy characters, is <a href="https://x.com/FNAFMovie/status/1976814091596619866?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">above</a>. If the film is anything like the original, fans are in for one fun ride.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FBC: Firebreak still isn’t having the success Remedy was hoping for, despite the massive new update, the studio confirms.</p>



<p>As Remedy Entertainment’s debut with multiplayer, FBC: Firebreak released earlier this year to not-so-shining reviews. Set in the Control universe, the title was met with many complaints for its opening and lack of substance. Last month, a new update, called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breakpoint</a>, aimed to fix those issues and add more content like new Crises and weapons. While it seemed like it would do the trick, Remedy has confirmed that it has not done that just yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-fbc-firebreak-did-not-meet-internal-targets-at-remedy-studio-confirms">FBC: Firebreak Did Not Meet Internal Targets at Remedy, Studio Confirms</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Remedy</figcaption></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=b4d23a32-03e7-49e5-bbc3-93ec062699a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an investor’s post</a> on the company’s website, Remedy Entertainment confirms that, despite the overhaul, FBC: Firebreak has not met internal targets for sales. The news comes before the studio’s actual investors’ reports, set for October 29th. In a statement from CEO Tero Virtala, he states,</p>



<p>“Remedy is recognizing a non-cash impairment of capitalized development costs and allocated purchased publishing and distribution rights related to&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>,” says Virtala. “While we balance future investments to the title, we continue developing and improving the game in line with our updated long-term sales forecast.”</p>



<p>The aforementioned non-cash impairment is up to 14.9 million EUR, with a majority of it representing the game’s development costs and publishing and distribution rights. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-launch-deemed-unsatisfying-and-underperformed-major-update-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disastrous launch</a> of FBC: Firebreak is one the studio wasn’t expecting and perhaps had too much faith in. Curiously, it seems Remedy wants to continue working on the title despite its continued failure. The company is known for crafting some amazing experiences like Control and Alan Wake, so it is possible. However, it may not be worth it for FBC: Firebreak, which currently has players in the double-digits.</p>



<p>What do you think about FBC: Firebreak’s failure for Remedy? Did you play the title at launch? Return to it after the Breakpoint update? Did you enjoy the game?

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Breached by Notorious Hacker Group, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-breached-by-hacker-group-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-breached-by-notorious-hacker-group-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1322659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent hours, it has been claimed that Nintendo has been ‘breached’ by Crimson Collective, a notorious hacker group that most recently claimed responsibility for an attack on Red Hat,  breaching the prolific technology firm and stealing 570 GB of data. The group has been tracked for the last couple of months, and it has now been claimed that they’ve breached <strong>Nintendo</strong>.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, a screenshot uploaded by Crimson Collective seems to show a repository of Nintendo folders, but the legitimacy of the breach is yet to be addressed.</p>



<h2 id="h-has-nintendo-been-hacked">Has Nintendo Been Hacked?</h2>



<p>On social media, an image has surfaced, allegedly coming from the Crimson Collective hacker group, that shows a library of Nintendo folders. At face value, these folders contain information regarding new games, development assets, production admin files, and backups.</p>



<p>It was mentioned by <a href="https://xcancel.com/H4ckmanac/status/1976895206273220758#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hackmanac</a> on socials that hackrisk.io has been tracking the purported breach, and in a comment accompanying the screenshot, Crimson Collective wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Who said we did not have Nintendo topics files?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nintendo has suffered from several key breaches historically, including a massive leak that circulated between 2018 and 2020 and saw source codes for classic games emerge online. In 2020, a Nintendo Network ID breach occurred, impacting more than 300,000 user accounts.</p>



<p>We’ve reached out to Nintendo for comment, but at present, it’s worth taking this with a pinch of salt. We’ll know soon if this is a legitimate breach. If it is, fans are now concerned that a mass wave of Nintendo’s unannounced projects could be cast into the open without warning.</p>
