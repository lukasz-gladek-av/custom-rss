<p>A new announcement has arrived for Horizon Hunters Gathering, a tactical co-op game coming to PS5 and PC. </p>



<p>Horizon has been in the limelight a lot lately, firstly for the Sony Tencent lawsuit, which was settled with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-clone-lawsuit-settled-with-light-of-motiram-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Light of Motiram delisted</a> late last year. The other was Horizon Steel Frontiers, a new MMORPG from PlayStation and NCSoft, coming to PC and Mobile devices. Now, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-isnt-the-only-horizon-multiplayer-game-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other Horizon multiplayer game</a> has been announced. </p>







<h2 id="h-horizon-hunters-gathering-announced-for-ps5-hunters-combat-game-modes-and-more">Horizon Hunters Gathering Announced for PS5: Hunters, Combat, Game Modes, and More</h2>



<p>From the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JubgL46Xkmk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a>, it seems that Horizon Hunters Gathering is set in the same universe but features a brand-new art style. The title will feature a growing roster of Hunters, where up to 3 players can team up in a battle against the deadly machines. The first Hunters that will be available during the playtest are Rem, Sun, and Axel. Each hunter has distinct melee or ranged playstyles and weapons. </p>



<p>There is a deep focus on the game’s combat, making it tactical, reactive, and deeply skill-based, based on the skills you have learned in the Horizon series. The game is somewhat like Monster Hunter World, set in the Horizon universe, featuring challenging, replayable hunts. </p>



<p>The developers have revealed 2 modes for now: Machine Incursion and Cauldron Descent. Machine Incursion is a high-intensity mission where you face waves of machines emerging from underground gateways, led by a boss. Cauldron Descent is a multi-stage mode where Hunters battle brutal machines in ever-changing rooms, passing through hidden doors for power and rewards. </p>



<p>Horizon Hunters Gathering will also feature a narrative campaign that takes players through new mysteries, characters, and threats, and the story is “fully canon”. Players will also explore a variety of environments with different atmospheres, challenges, and opportunities. There’s also a social hub for players to chill out, visit vendors, upgrade gear, and team up. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[WARDOGS Reveal Trailer Uncovers 100-Player Tactical Warfare]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As the tagline indicates, WARDOGS is <strong>not </strong>an extraction shooter or a battle royale. It’s a 100-player, three-team tactical first-person shooter with some insane destruction mechanics. It’s a multi-format, cash-driven title that empowers players to rack up the dollars for participating in massive, open-ended battles.</p>



<p>The game’s first trailer has just dropped, and BULKHEAD, a British studio, has unveiled the future of this impressive shooter that’s coming soon in early access.</p>







<h2 id="h-wardogs-looks-great-but-will-it-deliver">WARDOGS Looks Great, But Will It Deliver?</h2>



<p>In WARDOGS, players assume the role of a mercenary dropped into enormous battles with up to 100 players. They’re tasked with killing, securing control of vast areas, and basically causing havoc, all in the interest of making cold, hard cash.</p>



<p>It’s being developed by BULKHEAD and has been kept mostly under wraps for <strong>years</strong>, but now the game’s inaugural trailer is here and it looks fantastic:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="WARDOGS - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OCnEi5npoTE?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>WARDOGS promises it all: destruction, vehicular combat, progression, and base-building mechanics. It has elements that take you across a vast array of combat styles and scenarios, from using rocket launchers to down jets to sitting in a treeline as a sniper-spotter duo, picking off enemies hundreds of meters away.</p>



<p>The game’s blurb on Steam tells you what to expect:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>WARDOGS is a TACTICAL ALL OUT WARFARE FPS where one hundred players split across three teams fight over the control zone. Set in the derelict industrial mountains of Eastern Europe on a destructible battlefield where teamwork pays and cash is king.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When you start playing WARDOGS, you’ll have $10,000 to kit yourself out. That money must be spent on a loadout including weapons, equipment, and vehicles, and everything you buy goes towards winning the match you’re placed in. Everything you do in that match generates more cash, and guess what you do there? <strong>You get more goodies</strong>.</p>



<p>Once a match ends, you’re back to $10,000. That’s the core gameplay loop of WARDOGS.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a player-driven sandbox that allows you to play how you want, when you want, and with whom you want. You can go it alone or team up, blow everything to smithereens, or take a stealth approach. It’s entirely up to you.</p>



<p>WARDOGS will enter a testing period soon, and you can sign up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1867240/WARDOGS/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to participate on Steam</a>. The game’s early access release is expected to arrive later this year.</p>
