<p>Ubisoft has issued a response, somewhat, to recent reports regarding a deal with Saudi Arabia.  </p>



<p>Late last week, French newspaper Les Echoes (<a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/letonnant-deal-dubisoft-avec-larabie-saoudite-2144626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paywall</a>) reported that Ubisoft had reached an agreement with the Saudi-backed Savvy Games Group to develop new content for 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage. The Savvy Games Group is financially backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF)</p>



<p>In a response given to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-claiming-its-signed-a-saudi-deal-for-fresh-assassins-creed-mirage-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Ubisoft wouldn’t confirm nor deny that a deal with the group had been reached.</p>



<p>“We’ll decline to comment,” a Ubisoft spokesperson told the outlet. “We are focused on finishing&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>&nbsp;and excited for players to get to play it on 20th March.”</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-nbsp-xbox-developers-direct-us-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">PODCAST:&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developers-direct-us-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developers Direct Us: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>Ubisoft is currently in the middle of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-explore-all-company-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“exploring company options”</a> in order to turn things around for a company whose value has continued to fall in recent years. Those options also include a potential deal with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese company Tencent</a>, where both companies are in talks for a new venture centered around Ubisoft’s current assets.</p>



<p>At the time of the latter’s report, Insider Gaming understood that no decision or direction had been reached at the time. The belief is that the company is waiting on the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows before making any sort of decision about its future.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is currently scheduled to release its Q3 FY2025 earnings on February 13. It’s likely some sort of update on where things stand for the company will be announced during the call.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ubisoft’s lack of a denial regarding the reported deal with Savvy Games Group for Mirage DLC?

<p>Rise of the Ronin releases for PC via Steam on March 11, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rise of the Ronin, Team Ninja’s popular open-world RPG, was released for PS5 in March of last year, and precisely a year later, we are receiving a PC port for the game. The new title will feature several new features that aim to enhance the PC user experience. Additionally, there is a pre-order bonus that features armour sets, weapons, and combat styles.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-rise-of-the-ronin-pc-features">Rise of the Ronin PC Features</h2>



<p>Rise of the Ronin PC will be released with 8K resolution support and DirectX 12 support. Players will be able to play the game on ultra-wide and super-wide monitors. The game will feature support for 120 FPS, ray tracing, 3D audio, customisable keyboard and mouse controls, and a UI menu with mouse clickability. Graphically, players will see support for AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution, Nvidia DLSS and Reflex, and Intel XeSS graphics technology.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-rise-of-the-ronin-pc-pre-order-bonus">Rise of the Ronin PC Pre-Order Bonus</h2>



<p>As mentioned earlier, players can pre-order Rise of the Ronin PC for $49.99 and receive some bonus rewards. The rewards include an Iga Ninja Armor Set (a four-piece set), Iga Ninja’s Katana and four combat styles: Hayabusa-ryu for Katana, Hayabusa-ryu for Naginata, Nioh-ryu for Katana and Aisu Kage-ryu for Katana.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, it is worth noting that the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340990/Rise_of_the_Ronin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">listing</a> for Rise of the Ronin PC did not mention a PSN account requirement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sniper Elite Resistance mission list takes us through every scenario. Main character Harry Hawker is the star of this show and you take the expert infantry marksman through a few intense missions as he looks to thwart Nazi oppression.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> is one of 2025’s first big hitters. While it’s a little rough around the edges, this is unmistakably a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-sniper-elite-games-in-release-order-release-dates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite</a> game. It has the hallmarks we’re accustomed to: Gory killcams, long-range precision, dangerous AI, and expansive levels.</p>



<p>The final of these items is what we’re most curious about. Knowing how many missions it has can influence someone into buying Resistance. Or, if you’re already playing it, sometimes it’s good to know how many missions you’ve got left.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-missions-in-sniper-elite-resistance">How Many Missions in Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Behind Enemy Lines, fitting. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Sniper Elite Resistance has nine main missions to complete.</strong></p>



<p>This total is <strong>slightly misleading though</strong>. Although nine missions are advertised, the first mission is relatively short and can be completed in 20-30 minutes—depending on your familiarity with <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite</a>. Whereas the ninth and final mission is a traditional Epilogue—akin to Sniper Elite 5—which is over in no time at all.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-sniper-elite-resistance-game-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resistance’s game length and time to complete</a> isn’t as extensive as its predecessor. However, there’s still plenty to keep you busy.</p>



<h2 id="h-complete-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-list">Complete Sniper Elite Resistance Mission List</h2>



<p>Here’s every Sniper Elite Resistance Mission, along with a quick look at how many Collectibles each one has.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Mission Number</th><th data-align="center">Mission Name</th><th data-align="center">Number of Collectibles</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">#1</td><td data-align="center">Behind Enemy Lines</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">#2</td><td data-align="center">Dead Drop</td><td data-align="center">20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">#3</td><td data-align="center">Sonderzüge Sabotage</td><td data-align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">#4</td><td data-align="center">Collision Course</td><td data-align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">#5</td><td data-align="center">Devil’s Cauldron</td><td data-align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">#6</td><td data-align="center">Assault On Fort Rouge</td><td data-align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">#7</td><td data-align="center">Lock, Stock And Barrels</td><td data-align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">#8</td><td data-align="center">End Of The Line</td><td data-align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">#9</td><td data-align="center">All Or Nothing</td><td data-align="center">0</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Again, you can see from the Collectibles list Mission 1 and 9 are nowhere as deep as the others. The first mission is still a decent-sized, linear affair designed to welcome you into the fray.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-propaganda-challenges-in-sniper-elite-resistance">How Many Propaganda Challenges in Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<p><strong>There are seven Propaganda Challenges to unlock and complete in Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>You unlock Propaganda Challenges by finding a unique poster in certain levels. This grants you access to special exercises including Stealth Challenges, Sniping Challenges, and a Combat Challenge.</p>



<h2 id="h-complete-sniper-elite-resistance-propaganda-challenges-list">Complete Sniper Elite Resistance Propaganda Challenges List</h2>



<p>Take a peek at every Propaganda Challenge in Sniper Elite Resistance, as well as what they entail, and their score requirements.</p>

<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket has warned against ‘inappropriate conduct’, which includes ‘real money trading’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-warns-players-not-to-trade-for-real-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, Pokemon TCG Pocket players have been warned against using real money to trade, and the devs could even suspend the player’s account for doing so. Today, players received a new notification in the ‘Messages’ section of the application. Here, instead of a new announcement, they were issued a warning for players violating their Terms of Use, which includes data tampering, real money trading and other behaviour. Check out the full warning below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are aware that some players have engaged in data tampering, real money trading, and other behaviours that violate the Terms of Use. If we confirm that a player has engaged in behaviour that violates the Terms of Use, we will warn them, suspend their account, or take other action. We will continue to strive to provide an environment where everyone can safely and comfortably enjoy their experience”. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s trading feature will be released on January 29, 2025. The new feature will include some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">limitations</a>, such as only being able to trade between friends, not all rarities being included, items having to be consumed to trade them, a new currency being introduced, and more. It is believed that all these limitations have been introduced to restrict the use of real money trading in TCG Pocket.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pokemon TCG Pocket recently revealed their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-space-time-smackdown-expansion-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space-Time Smackdown Expansion</a>, which includes over 140 cards from the Sinnoh region featuring the legendary Pokemon Dialga and Palkia.
