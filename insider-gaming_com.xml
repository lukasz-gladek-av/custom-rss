<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plethora of weapons</a> to enjoy, but one of the most efficient guns in the game is the AEK-973, a three-round burst DMR that hits hard and can drop enemies in seconds.</p>



<p>To make the most of the Marksman Rifle, here’s the best Black Ops 6 AEK-973 loadout to use, including the attachments, Perks, Equipment, and more.</p>



<ul>

<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-aek-973-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-aek-973-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best AEK-973 attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:&nbsp;</strong>Volzhskiy Reflex </li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>For the best AEK-973 loadout in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a>, you’ll want a clean Optic like the <strong>Volzhskiy Reflex</strong> and the <strong>Suppressor </strong>Muzzle to keep you off the enemy radar when firing the gun.</p>



<p>Next, the <strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong> provides a boost to bullet velocity and damage range, allowing you to secure kills at long distances. The <strong>Commando Grip</strong> improves the AEK’s handling stats so that you can ADS and fire faster after sprinting. Lastly, but certainly not least, the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> mod gives the Marksman Rifle a major increase to its fire rate, meaning the 3-round bursts come out faster, allowing you to get a faster TTK.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-aek-973">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for AEK-973</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Ninja</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Vigilance</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4:</strong>&nbsp;Flak Jacket</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Impact Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<p>When it comes to Perks, we’ve gone with <strong>Ninja </strong>for quite movement, <strong>Forward Intel</strong> for extra minimap information, and <strong>Vigilance</strong> to keep you aware of your position being exposed. These combine to give you the <strong>Recon Combat Specialty</strong>, which is very useful for seeing the enemy team’s position on the map.</p>



<p>We’ve then selected <strong>Perk Greed </strong>as the Wildcard, which means you can pick a fourth Perk, for which we went with <strong>Flak Jacket</strong>, as Lethal Equipment can be deadly without it.</p>



<p>Speaking of Lethals, the <strong>Impact Grenade</strong> is great for flushing enemies out of tight spaces, while the <strong>Stim Shot</strong> regenerates your health to get you back in the fight and survive longer.</p>



<p>The <strong>Trophy System</strong> is one of the best Field Upgrades in the game as it protects the team when capturing an objective, hence why we’ve picked it in our best AEK-973 loadout.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-aek-973">Best Secondary for AEK-973</h2>



<p>The <strong>Grekhova </strong>is the best Secondary weapon for the AEK-973, as its a full-auto pistol that performs extremely well at close range. This covers you in close-quarters combat, which is not where the AEK-973 excels.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-aek-973-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock AEK-973 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the AEK-973 by reaching <strong>Level 34</strong> in Black Ops 6. You can do this in Multiplayer or Zombies, as progression is shared across these modes. Once Warzone is integrated, you’ll also be able to level up in the Battle Royale too.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-the-aek-973-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the AEK-973 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The AEK-973 is one of the best Marksman Rifles in Black Ops 6. It may not be the top of the meta, as those spots are occupied by the strong SMGs and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-assault-rifles-in-black-ops-6-ranked-best-ar-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assault Rifles</a>, but the three-round burst DMR can outperform any weapon when it’s used to its strengths.</p>



<p>Hold long lines of sight and try not to run and gun too much, this weapon excels when used in positions of power such as high ground and head glitches.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-aek-973-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to AEK-973 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <strong>Swat 5.56</strong> is the obvious alternative to the AEK-973, as it’s also a 3-round burst DMR. It performs similarly to the AEK, but has better accuracy and slightly worse mobility stats. If you want something even more deadly that requires pinpoint accuracy, give our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-quickscoping-sniper-loadout-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best quickscoping LW3A1 Frostline loadout</a> a go.</p>

<p>Using Black Ops 6’s best Assault Rifles is a surefire way to rack up a high Elimination count, boost your KD, and finish as MVP. Thanks to statistics and hours of gameplay, we’ve put together a handy list showing you how each AR stacks up, as well as the best Assault Rifle loadout in BLOPS 6.</p>



<p>I like to use a rapid SMG at close quarters, or if I fancy the layout of the next map, I’ll switch to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-quickscoping-sniper-loadout-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best quickscoping loadout</a> for quickfire, snappy sniping, and killfeeds. One constant for me is that no matter what happens, I’ll eventually end up with an Assault Rifle back in my war-torn mitts.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has a plethora of Assault Rifles at its disposal, and it’s time to weed out the best from the rest and put a bonafide carnage causer in your loadout.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-assault-rifle-ranked-in-black-ops-6-from-best-to-worst">Every Assault Rifle Ranked in Black Ops 6 from best to worst</h2>



<p>For a lot of these entries, I’m using the most recent stats from meta-specialist <a href="https://www.wzranked.com/bo6/meta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wzranked</a>, and the personal experiences of the team to determine the best Assault Rifles in Black Ops 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-xm4-best-assault-rifle-in-black-ops-6">1. XM4—Best Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>XM4 Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Taking the top spot is the very reliable and remarkably faultless <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a>. The Assault Rifle is a staple of first-person shooter gaming, has been seen the world over, and is currently dominating the Black Ops 6 landscape. It performs excellently across all AR criteria, it comfortably has the highest usage of any AR—its immediate availability being a big reason—and it continues to be a reliable killer while you unlock the rest of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6’s weapons</a>. Until something changes, <strong>this is the best gun in BLOPS 6</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-ak-74">2. AK-74</h2>



<figure><figcaption>AK-74 Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Honestly, I think the <strong>AK-74 is closer to the top spot than it seems</strong>. I love the brute-force nature of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AK-74</a>, and it’s only the haphazard nature of its recoil holding it back from being the king of the jungle. If you reduce its vertical and horizontal recoil as best as you can, the AK-74 is a straight-shooting monster—and its firepower alone is enough to take second place. It’s unlikely Treyarch ever reduces its recoil for this reason, but you never know!</p>



<h2 id="h-3-as-val">3. AS Val</h2>



<figure><figcaption>AS Val Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hot take incoming: I think the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-as-val-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AS Val</a> should be classified as an SMG, not an Assault Rifle. As it stands, the AS Val is an Assault Rifle, and this makes it one of the best Assault Rifles in the game. Its default magazine leaves a lot to be desired, but there’s no doubting its DPS potential if you’re accurate with your shots. A better mag and a harness on its recoil easily make the AS Val one of the most diverse weapons in all of Black Ops 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-4-gpr-91">4. GPR 91</h2>



<figure><figcaption>GPR 91 Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I can’t put my finger on what it is, but when I used the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-gpr-91-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPR 91</a> in the Campaign, <strong>it slapped</strong>. Now, it’s not an AR I’m going to choose over anything I’ve ranked higher, but if you’re struggling for some inspiration, or feel your playstyle has become a bit uninspired and mundane, I’d recommend taking the GPR 91 out for a spin. It needs a firepower boost to stand a chance of cracking the top three, but it’s also not a bad choice either.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-ames-85">5. AMES 85</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ames 85 Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I feel the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ames-85-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ames 85</a> earns its place in our Assault Rifle ranking list. It’s snappy, I find it terrific at longer-range firefights, and it’s a solid AR all around. It’s one of those; I don’t think it’s remarkable in any category, and I feel I see it being used more in online multiplayer than it warrants. That being said, if you do prefer engaging at a distance, try out the Ames 85. Plus, if it does get buffed, you already have a headstart on its attachments.</p>



<h2 id="h-6-model-l">6. Model L</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Model L Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I find the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-model-l-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-and-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Model L</a> performs similarly to the Ames 85 but doesn’t deliver quite as consistently, although it’s another AR better suited to long-range assaults. Again, it’s rare you find unusable weapons, and with the right attachments, anything is a deadly weapon. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as they say, and the Model L feels like it might click with a certain audience—just maybe not myself. </p>



<h2 id="h-7-goblin-mk2">7. Goblin Mk2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Goblin Mk2 Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Eh, I don’t have much to say about the Goblin Mk2 really—nothing positive at least. It’s a semi-auto AR—putting it more in line with a Marksman Rifle than an AR—and even then there are better Marksman Rifles. <strong>The Goblin reeks of a gun stuck near the bottom of the meta</strong> for the longest time, until it receives a hefty buff, and suddenly becomes god-tier—à la the KSP 45 from Black Ops Cold War.</p>



<p>Here’s our official ranking of every Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6:</p>



<ol>
<li>XM4</li>



<li>AK-74</li>



<li>AS Val</li>



<li>GPR 91</li>



<li>Ames 85</li>



<li>Model L</li>



<li>Goblin Mk2</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-best-assault-rifle-loadout-in-black-ops-6">What is the best Assault Rifle loadout in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The XM4 is our number one pick for the best Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6—for now—but if you’re after the perfect loadout to use for it, we’ve got a great setup detailed below:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic</strong>: Kepler Microflex</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: 5.56 Nato SMJ</li>



<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Bankroll</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-which-is-the-fastest-assault-rifle-in-black-ops-6">Which is the fastest Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The <strong>AS Val</strong> has the best fire rate of any AR in Black Ops 6. Combined with its shorter mag by default, the AS Val rips through enemies, and I’d label it as more of an SMG than I would an Assault Rifle. Nevertheless, the AS Val shreds through ammo clips in seconds and is worth considering if you can get its furious fire rate under control.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-is-the-most-powerful-assault-rifle-in-black-ops-6">Which is the most powerful Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>No surprise here as the <strong>AK-74</strong> is the most naturally hard-hitting Assault Rifle in all of Black Ops 6. The AK series is notorious for being outrageously powerful and dropping opponents in fewer shots than most. The only downside is that it kicks like a mule with another mule strapped to it. Slapping the Gunfighter Wildcard on this bad boy might not even be enough to control it—nor would a leash. If your recoil control is better than most, the AK-74 has to be worth consideration.</p>
