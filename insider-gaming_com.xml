<p>Another small patch for VALORANT has been deployed, with patch 10.03 giving the minimap a visual upgrade and updating the effect of slow abilities. The smaller patch size is due to the soon-to-start <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-masters-bangkok-2025-teams-schedule-prize-pool-where-to-watch/">Masters Bangkok event</a>, and the patch will deploy a day later than usual due to a Riot holiday.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-valorant-10-03-patch-notes">Full VALORANT 10.03 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>The slowing abilities of Chamber, Skye, and Harbor will now slow dash abilities. Dash abilities include Jett’s Tailwind and Neon’s Slide. Previously, agents like Jett and Neon could dash at full speed even if they were caught by a slow, but now <strong>slowing abilities will slow a dash by 50 percent</strong>. These abilities now all slow dashes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Chamber’s Trademark</li>



<li>Skye’s Trailblazer</li>



<li>Harbor’s Cascade and High Tide</li>



<li><a href="https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Status_Effect#Concuss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concussive</a> abilities:
<ul>
<li>Astra’s Nova Pulse</li>



<li>Breach’s Fault Line and Rolling Thunder</li>



<li>Cypher’s Trapwire</li>



<li>Deadlock’s Sonic Sensor</li>



<li>Gekko’s Wingman</li>



<li>Harbor’s Reckoning</li>



<li>Neon’s Relay Bolt</li>



<li>Tejo’s Special Delivery</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The minimap visuals have been updated, providing “increased gameplay clarity and fidelity.” The minimap now uses shading to clearly show elevated spots across the whole map, as well as ziplines.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-valorant-patch-10-03-bug-fixes">VALORANT Patch 10.03 Bug Fixes</h2>



<ul>
<li>Fixed issues where explosive damaging utility could kill sentinel trap abilities like Vyse’s Arc Rose from vastly outside its intended radius.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where you could not move/use the buy menu while the remake vote screen is displayed. This new voting widget also color corrects the confirmation button to be green and the decline button to be red.</li>



<li><strong>(Console):</strong> You can now add and edit friend notes for your Riot friends.
<ul>
<li>You can use the friends list search field to filter your friends list by player name or tag.</li>



<li>When you have more than four party invites, the friends list will now hide them so you can still see your friends. You can click ‘Show More’ to display any hidden invites.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>(Console): </strong>Fixed an issue where Remake-ended matches in Competitive queue would display incorrect end-of-game screens after the game.</li>



<li><strong>(Console): </strong>Fixed an issue where navigating players on the Leaderboard would sometimes highlight multiple players.</li>



<li><strong>(PC): </strong>Fixed an issue on the Premier tournament bracket screen where match score was occasionally displayed in black.</li>



<li><strong>PC: </strong>Fixed an issue where the Premier tournament bracket was not properly centered on some ultrawide displays.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nightreign incorporates a lot of what made the original so special. But one element players fight tooth and nail over is each other. I’m here to tell you if Elden Ring Nightreign features any PVP or if it’s solely PVE.</p>



<p>I got to experience the debut <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/after-technical-problems-more-elden-ring-nightreign-test-sessions-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign Network Test</a>. I was blown away by how incredible it was and how much it differs from Elden Ring. It looks the same on the surface, but the overall feel, speed, and complexity make it a tough and tantalizing proposition.</p>



<p>You’re encouraged to team up, traverse The Lands Between, and take down familiar FromSoftware bosses. But some players want a break from AI to take on real people. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> having PVP would scratch this painful itch, so let’s see if it’s possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-pvp-in-elden-ring-nightreign">Can You PVP in Elden Ring Nightreign?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No time for PVP right now. Credit to FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign doesn’t include any PVP and the only combat in the game is played out in classic PVE fashion with human players against enemy AI.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, if you’re big into PVP, Nightreign might not be the Souls game for you. In an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with IGN</a>, game director Junya Ishizaki talked a lot about Nightreign and what the team wants to accomplish with it.</p>



<p>The topic of PVP came up when interviewer Tristan Ogilvie asked: “Are there any other sort of modes planned, like a PvP battle royale or anything like that?” Ishizaki responded: “<strong>Currently there are no plans</strong>. We wanted to first and foremost concentrate on this three-player co-op experience. So that’s the main focus for now.”</p>



<p>Nightreign will launch with no PVP features unless something changes between now and launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-pvp-be-added-to-elden-ring-nightreign">Will PVP be Added to Elden Ring Nightreign?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s no confirmation from FromSoftware about adding PVP to Elden Ring Nightreign in the future but never say never.</strong></p>



<p>Alluding to the IGN interview above, Junya Ishizaki was quoted saying “<strong>Currently</strong>” when it came to PVP ideas. This doesn’t mean the developer won’t look to add PVP in a future update. The sole focus is on delivering a complete and coherent three-player experience with working functionality.</p>



<p>But we know more content is going to be available at launch. Furthermore, additional content is arriving post-launch. PVP may eventually get added if the team can implement it effectively.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for any further updates on Elden Ring Nightreign’s PVP status.</p>

<p>Check out the latest Elden Ring Nightreign details and questions including if you can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-with-two-players-or-solo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play it Solo or with two players</a>.</p>



<p>Can Nightreign be the start of something special for the Souls genre? Or are you hoping this is a one-and-done deal for FromSoftware so it can move on to a new project?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-ubisoft-is-confident-on-releasing-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-on-march-20-2025.1111971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Insider Gaming sources have said that the publisher and the developers are now confident that Assassin’s Creed Shadows will launch on March 20, 2025.</p>



<p>Of course, never say never of another delay, but Ubisoft has made preparations to increase its marketing of Assassin’s Creed Shadows ahead of its March 20, 2025 launch, including finalising the embargo dates for the games review.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows reviews will be live on March 18, 2025.</p>



<p>Speaking with several developers working on the game, they said that they felt confident that it will be ready for its March release date, with one source stating that the game is now “pretty much done”.</p>



<p>As mentioned during Ubisoft’s latest earnings call, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-in-line-with-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadows is currently on par with that of Assassins Creed Odyssey</a> in terms of its pre-order numbers. “Early previews have been positive, praising its narrative and immersive experience, with both characters playing critical roles in the game’s storyline, as well as the quality and complementarity of the gameplay provided by the dual protagonist approach,” Guillemot said in the most recent earnings call.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Shadows currently has around 300,000 pre-orders, said sources and Odyssey’s day one player numbers were between 400-450,000; a gap of around 100-150,000 that needs to be made up in the next four weeks.</p>



<p>In comparison, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-sales-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws, a game that failed to meet Ubisoft’s expectations</a> had less than half the pre-orders Shadows currently has in the same time period before launch, it was said.</p>



<p>Looking at the data, if Shadows continues the same trajectory as Odyssey throughout launch, it’s estimated that the game could sell approximately 3.5 million units in its first month. Valhalla, which was the series’ most successful Assassin’s Creed game had some eight million players in its first month, with more than 65% being attributed to past-generation consoles at the time.</p>

<p>FromSoftware games have always had an element of multiplayer. Elden Ring Nightreign also encourages this, but playing with two players is the dream for many duos. We’ve got the latest details on Nightreign’s party-formation features. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is a breath of fresh air from the minds at FromSoftware. This isn’t to say the company’s work is bad—not by a long shot—but Nightreign has a different feel. The take-your-time exploration of Elden Ring, Sekiro, and Bloodborne is replaced by frantic battling and a constant race to clear bosses and level up as fast as possible.</p>



<p>A typical lobby involves three of you wailing away at tanky foes. But let’s see if it’s possible to play Nightreign as just two players or even one.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-elden-ring-nightreign-two-player">Is Elden Ring Nightreign Two Player?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Three players might be advisable. Credit to FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign currently doesn’t permit you to play with two players.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-join-the-elden-ring-nightreign-network-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Network Test</a> gave us a glimpse into <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nightreign</a>‘s potential. However, we also learned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightreign is suited to a Trio</a>. This direction comes at the behest of game director Junya Ishizaki.</p>



<p>He explained: “The reason that we went with a three-player focus was that we wanted to retain that sense of accomplishment you get from battling a boss together or from conquering a map together and that sense of enjoyment, but we wanted to recreate that in a fresh way.”</p>



<h2 id="h-will-elden-ring-nightreign-add-a-two-player-mode">Will Elden Ring Nightreign Add a Two Player Mode?</h2>



<p>Junya Ishizaki has said even though the Network Test didn’t allow for two-player teams, FromSoftware is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-considering-allowing-just-two-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">considering allowing two players</a>.</p>



<p>“Regarding having just two players, not three players or Solo, <strong>it is something we are considering</strong>, but it is currently not in the game at the moment,” explained Ishizaki.</p>



<p>Technically, you can invite a friend and play a game of Nightreign together. But you still have to partner up with a third person to complete the matchmaking process. If the third person leaves for whatever reason, it becomes you and your friend battling as a duo!</p>



<p>We’re still a while out from Nightreign’s full release, so we’ll have to see if FromSoftware changes its mind before the anticipated launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">Can You Play Elden Ring Nightreign Solo?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Elden Ring Nightreign can be played Solo if you’re not up to having partners</strong>.</p>



<p>Even though you can’t in two-player, Solo is an option. I wouldn’t say it’s smart (or feasible) to play Nightreign on your own though, so tread carefully around The Lands Between. </p>



<hr>



<p>Will you be put off buying Elden Ring Nightreign if it debuts without a two-player mode? Or are you tough enough to take on the Nights on your own?</p>



<p>If you missed out on the initial test runs, fear not, more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/after-technical-problems-more-elden-ring-nightreign-test-sessions-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightreign Test Sessions</a> may be coming to give you a chance to get involved.</p>

<ul>
<li>Players will earn Gold Points if they pre-order a downloadable product before the end of the bonus period.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Gold Points can be earned if players purchase a packaged version of software released before the expiration.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Also, suppose players purchase Nintendo Switch (OLED model) White/Customized, Nintendo Switch Customization, or Nintendo Switch Lite Yellow/Turquoise/Grey/Coral/Blue from the My Nintendo Store before the reward expiration date and time. In that case, they will be able to earn Gold Points after the shipping date.
