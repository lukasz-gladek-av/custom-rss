<p>Bethesda Game Studios has revealed that Fallout 76 is <strong>finally </strong>getting a native version of the game in 2026, with a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X &amp; S version being released in a few months. This announcement came amid the news that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-getting-anniversary-edition-november/">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a> <strong>and </strong>a Switch 2 version are also incoming.</p>



<p>Not much information was given away, but this is something that Fallout 76 fans have been wanting for a very long time. What’s next on the list is crossplay, but we doubt that it’ll ever come.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-76-current-gen-upgrade-coming">Fallout 76 Current-Gen Upgrade Coming</h2>



<p>During the Fallout Day broadcast, Bill LaCoste, lead producer, revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Early next year, a native version of Fallout 76 will be coming to Xbox Series S and X and PlayStation 5. This update will take full advantage of their hardware capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fallout 76 is the most up-to-date Fallout game on the market, taking the form of an open-world MMORPG that took the rulebook tied to Fallout and threw it clean out the window in 2018. It has since become the cash cow of the series, and Bethesda Game Studios has kept the game pumped full of updates.</p>



<p>It’s easy to assume what will arrive with the current-gen upgrade of Fallout 76, of course.</p>



<p>We can envision higher base resolutions, a higher frame rate (60 FPS upgrade, most likely), cleaner textures, and faster loading times. That’s usually the run-of-the-mill stuff associated with current-gen upgrades, and Fallout 76 on <strong>consoles </strong>has long needed them.</p>

<p>During the Fallout Day Showcase, Bethesda Game Studios unveiled a <strong>new trailer for Fallout 4</strong>, ten years after it hit the market in 2015. The trailer, which was kind of better than anything published before the game came out, revealed that an ANNIVERSARY EDITION is coming to the market on November 10.</p>



<p>The Anniversary Edition of Fallout 4 will come with all expansions, plus Creations is being added to the game, bringing a whole host of curated expansions, mods, and other upgrades and changes.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-4-anniversary-edition-announced-by-bethesda">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Announced by Bethesda</h2>



<p>Today’s Fallout Day bonanza included a stunning announcement: Fallout 4 is coming back with an Anniversary Edition. It has been ten years since the best-selling title dropped, and it’s still one of the most popular Fallout experiences ever made.</p>



<p>The Anniversary Edition comes with all DLCs and expansions released for the game in the years that followed the launch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vault-Tec Workshop</li>



<li>Far Harbor</li>



<li>Automatron</li>



<li>Nuka-World</li>



<li>Contraptions Workshop</li>



<li>Wasteland Workshop</li>



<li>Vault-Tec Workshop</li>
</ul>



<p>More than 150 Creations will be added to Fallout 4 via the Anniversary Edition, and Bethesda also revealed that the game will feature <strong>unreleased items</strong>, just to keep things feeling fresh. These items will be discoverable through a new menu, added in an upcoming update to Fallout 4 – you won’t need the Anniversary Edition to obtain this content.</p>
