<p>There’s a good chance you’ve never heard of Brown Dust 2 until recently. I certainly hadn’t, but trusty social media has managed to make Neowiz’s game—the publishers of Lies of P—go very viral for obvious reasons.</p>



<p>Sometimes you must tread carefully with a story, and Brown Dust 2 might be the very definition of this. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-full-trophy-list-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lies of P</a> publisher Neowiz’s Brown Dust 2 is a gacha-based RPG, encouraging players to spend money on random spins to obtain incredible gear and desired characters. </p>



<p>The gameplay and graphics seem serviceable enough, but the characters serve as the centerpiece of recent social media attention. The game has blown up out of nowhere, and it’s not hard to see why.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.neowiz.com/game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Neowiz</a> has garnered a solid reputation in the last 12 months for being part of Lies of P. The incredible soulslike defied expectations to deliver a compelling and coherent action experience. A DLC follow-up is on the way in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-overture-prequel-announced-its-not-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lies of P Overture</a>—with a full-blown <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-sequel-could-be-open-world-according-to-new-job-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel</a> likely to happen.</p>



<p>The company is also responsible for countless mobile titles, including Brown Dust 2. It might shock you to learn that Brown Dust 2 came out in 2023! But it’s only now that all eyes are on the RPG. Why though? Because of the Iron Monarch Wilhelmina.</p>



<p>The official YouTube announcement trailer for the character has an eye-popping description below the video: “Introducing our queen who’s become one with her tights!” True, tights were a popular fighting garment during the Middle Ages, so it’s not too farfetched-ish.</p>



<p>But Wilhelmina’s first few seconds of being shown to the world involve an extreme close-up of her derrière, followed by the character emphatically pulling on her tights and letting them slap against her skin. She juxtaposes this by comically taking her fighting stance and posing straight after.</p>



<p>The trailer also features several other Brown Dust 2 female characters. New skins are advertised for them, with poses, positions, and outfits that will make you aware of your surroundings very quickly. The <a href="https://x.com/BROWNDUST2_EN/status/1909895275902317020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">April 9 X reveal trailer</a> has already been viewed <strong>18 million times</strong> on X and counting, with the figure rising all the time.</p>

<p>It makes sense that other people want to capitalize on the success of Schedule 1. The indie title continues to eclipse all expectations and is one of the most successful games of 2025. Its creator has now commented on other games copying its title, and also given a hint toward a console port.</p>



<p>The days and weeks are going by, and Schedule 1 is showing no sign of slowing up. The player base is reveling in the chance to deal <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-the-best-starter-weed-recipe-to-sell-in-schedule-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drugs</a> and show up thugs. An ongoing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-rival-drug-dealer-simulator-says-there-is-no-lawsuit-amid-review-bombing-investigation-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigation</a> can’t stop it, and with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-april-7-update-adds-pawn-shop-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new updates adding a Pawn Shop</a> and more value-adding features, it’s hard not to love Schedule 1 right now.</p>



<p>Other companies feel this way as they’re using its name. Schedule 1’s developer has taken to X to address the ongoing movement, and also given hope to PlayStation and Xbox fans.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/Tyler_TVGS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tyler1</a> is the main developer at TVGS—the maker of Schedule 1. This is the company’s first game, and they probably didn’t expect this level of success.</p>



<p>On April 11, Tyler took to X to comment on a recent trend concerning the game: “Hi everyone, As you may be aware, there have been some games on the PlayStation store appearing over the past few weeks with the name ‘Schedule I’ in them. Just confirming these are not affiliated with me in any way.”</p>



<p>You get a lot of ‘smaller’ games appearing on the PS Store in the same fashion as Steam. It can be easy for games to slip through the cracks. But as Schedule 1 isn’t on PlayStation, it gives other games (with the name) a chance to be on there. Whether they get to keep the name remains to be seen. But Tyler1 also commented on Schedule 1’s platform status and plans.</p>



<p>“I’d love to port Schedule I to console when the game is at the right stage for that, but I will announce it to the Schedule I community well before it happens,” he says.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Hi everyone,

<p>Search volume for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1 console port</a> is high. The people want it, the people need it, and it’s clear TVGS wants to make it happen. We’ll keep on top of this to see if a Schedule 1 console port does eventually happen.</p>
