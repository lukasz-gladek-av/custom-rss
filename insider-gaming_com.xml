<p>With 2025 finally here, one big question is on everybody’s mind: is 2025 the year we finally get a GTA 6 release? Outside of the wild fan conspiracies we saw in 2024, it’s been relatively quiet for GTA 6 since its initial reveal in December 2023, with no official announcements from GTA developer Rockstar Games. It’s led to many rumours and rumblings that GTA 6 has already been internally delayed, with a delay announcement rumour to be coming soon.</p>



<p>The biggest and latest rumor of a delay came in September 2024, with the lack of official announcements seemingly making the rumor more valid. It eventually prompted Take-Two Interactive to squash the rumor in its Q2 earnings call in November 2024, which was the most significant amount of information we received since the game’s initial announcement. At least at the time of the earnings call, the publisher confirmed that the game was still to launch in Fall 2025.</p>



<p>At face value, Take-Two’s comments are reassuring, but history has told us that Rockstar Games tends to postpone its games, and it won’t be the first time that Take-Two has had to adjust its financial forecasts due to such a delay.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-history-of-delays">A History of Delays</h2>



<p>Rockstar Games’ last two major title releases, GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 saw significant delays from their initial announcement to their final release date.</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2, Rockstar Games’ latest major title saw two delays from its announcement trailer to its final release. Announced on October 18, 2016, the game was initially planned to be released in the second half of 2017 but eventually released on October 26, 2018, with Rockstar Games saying that the game needed additional development time for polish.</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 saw a delay, too. From its planned Spring 2013 launch, the game would eventually launch in September 2013. Although it was a small delay, Rockstar Games asserted that it was needed due to polish. In fact, it’s been a recurring theme for Rockstar Games in the past 15 years, with almost every one of Rockstar Games titles, from GTA 4 to the original Red Dead Redemption, seeing delays. While GTA 6 has yet to meet the same fate, it isn’t difficult to imagine that Rockstar Games will continue its trend, especially in the games industry’s current climate. </p>



<h2 id="h-take-two-s-packed-lineup-in-2025">Take-Two’s Packed Lineup in 2025</h2>



<p>It’s already been widely discussed, but another point to consider is Take-Two’s already-packed lineup for 2025, even without a GTA 6 release. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, Civilization 7, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-mafia-the-old-country/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, and annual releases like NBA 2K and WWE 2K make 2025 arguably one of Take-Two’s most stacked years of all time, and that’s without what will be the biggest game release in the past decade.</p>



<p>So why is having its most stacked game release lineup ever an issue for Take-Two? Well, unfortunately, it boils down to revenue and investor expectations year-over-year. Investors expect continuous growth, and piling so many big releases into one year could be an eyebrow-raising decision for investors, especially if Take-Two’s 2026 lineup is on the weaker side of big game releases. Of course, we all know that Take-Two’s money-maker will be GTA Online for GTA 6, but if that will come on launch or not is currently unclear.</p>



<p>But from a purely financial point of view, would Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country sell millions more copies if GTA 6 is delayed into 2026? It’s a question that investors will likely be pondering. While a GTA 6 delay will undoubtedly cause Take-Two’s share price to fall by a few percent, Take-Two’s financial year will still be strong, and with the prospect of GTA 6 having a cemented release date, its share price will continue to rise.</p>



<p>Although I think that Take-Two will ultimately let Rockstar decide if more polish is needed, it’s certainly a point to be raised that this is, at its core, a business, and GTA 6 is going to make the company billions over the years to come. An additional six-month delay isn’t the end of the world for Take-Two, and if the extra polish is needed, well, I don’t mind waiting a bit longer, either.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance is the newest free game on the Epic Store. The medieval RPG can be redeemed between today and tomorrow at 13:00 BRT.</p>



<p>This is the perfect way to get hands-on with the franchise before Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 arrives on February 4, 2025.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/pt-BR/p/kingdom-come-deliverance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Redeem here -&gt; Kingdom Come: Deliverance on the Epic Store</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>As the second game will serve as a sequel to the story of Henry, the protagonist, having prior knowledge of the story and gameplay systems are key aspects to getting the most out of Warhorse’s new game.</p>



<p>Check out the plot for the first game:</p>



<p><em>“Thrust into a raging civil war, you watch helplessly as invaders storm your village and slaughter your family. Narrowly escaping the brutal attack, you grab your sword to fight back. Avenge the death of your parents and help repel the invading forces!”</em></p>



<p>The game is widely regarded as the perfect game for anyone who loves the Middle Age. Unlike traditional RPGs, Kingdom Come provides a more immersive experience that comes slightly closer to a simulator, even though it’s not one.</p>

<p>The PS Plus Essential games for January (2025) <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">have been revealed</a> and, well, there was certainly a better way to start the year. The three games awarded to subscribers in the lowest tier are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</li>



<li>Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered</li>



<li>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-the-games-from-ps-plus-essential-january-2025">The games from PS Plus Essential: January 2025</h2>



<p>The list certainly isn’t going to fill anyone’s eyes, after all, we’re talking about one of the biggest flops of 2024 and two old games. The games will be available starting January 7th.</p>



<h3 id="h-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-ps5-nbsp"><strong>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League | PS5&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Take down The Justice League yourself in single-player or team up with friends in multiplayer co-op in this genre-defying, action-adventure third-person shooter from Rocksteady Studios, creators of the critically acclaimed Batman: Arkham series. Featuring an original narrative set within an expansive open-world city of Metropolis, the game puts the four DC Super-Villains on a collision course with an invading alien force and DC Super Heroes who are now laser-focused on destroying the city they once vowed to protect.</p>



<h3><strong>Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered | PS4&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Feel the thrill of the chase and the rush of escape in Need for Speed Hot Pursuit. Unleash a savage sense of speed both as an outlaw and a cop in the world’s hottest high-performance cars. Outsmart the heat or take down lawbreakers with the tactical weaponry at your disposal in a heart-pumping, socially competitive racing experience. Updated with enhanced visuals, cross-platform multiplayer – including the asynchronous competition powered by Autolog – plus all additional DLC content, this is the ultimate edition of Criterion Games’ critically acclaimed Need for Speed debut. It’s time to reignite the pursuit.</p>



<h3><strong>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe | PS4, PS5&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is an expanded re-imagining of the critically acclaimed, award winning indie game The Stanley Parable from 2013. Everything that was in the original Stanley Parable is here, preserved just like it was back in 2013. But The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe also dramatically expands the world of the original game with new content, new choices, and new secrets to uncover. The labyrinth has just gotten bigger. In addition, the game has been visually upgraded to reflect modern technology while faithfully preserving the tone of the original game. Accessibility features have also been added to the game, including localization of in-world text, colorblind options, and content warnings. And just as before, the impeccable voicework of Kevan Brighting will accompany you every step of the way.</p>

<p>Gray Zone Warfare, the realistic tactical shooter (with extraction elements), continues to turn heads since entering early access in April 2024. It launched to a boom that saw the game sell 500,000 copies in just four days, with many players familiar with games like Escape from Tarkov getting in on the action.</p>



<p>Since being released in early access, Gray Zone Warfare has maintained a steady course, with developer MADFINGER Games working to polish the product and push out a major update, Night Ops. Recently, the team confirmed that the game has sold one million copies – and a further 500,000 ‘edition upgrades’ have been secured.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>MADFINGER transitioned into the tactical shooter space a while ago, producing Gray Zone Warfare in April 2024 as the fruit of its labour. The game is years in the making, and it offers an unparalleled open-world tactical shooter experience, casting players into the dangerous, fictional world of Lamang and forcing them to survive against all odds.</p>



<p>It was one of the best-selling games on Steam in 2024, where it’s exclusively available. The ongoing performance of the title allowed it to hit the one million sales milestone relatively quickly, notching up the number just eight months after launch. That’s not bad going for a game with no pre-existing fanbase made by a company new to the genre.</p>



<p>I sat down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with MADFINGER’s CEO at Gamescom</a>, learning about what’s next for the game. He has preached multiple times that the game is ‘only 20% finished’ and that there’s plenty on the horizon, and being privy to some of those plans, I can say for sure that there’s a lot in the pipeline for this tactical shooter.</p>



<p>If you’re not enjoying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-flea-market-locked-for-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest Tarkov wipe</a> or if you want a more unique extraction experience mixed in with a persistent world, unbound by timers, then check out Gray Zone Warfare – you won’t regret it.</p>

<p>Robin ‘ropz’ Kool has officially left FaZe Clan after three years on the organisation’s Counter-Strike roster. On social media, the superstar competitor penned an emotional message to fans and followers as he departed on amicable terms from FaZe Clan.</p>



<p>The Counter-Strike pro player’s next steps are undefined at present – or at least, they’re unconfirmed to the wider public. Most recently, the 25-year-old player found a second-place finish at the Perfect World Shanghai Major, falling in the grand final against Team Spirit in an emotional series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-moving-on">Moving On</h2>



<p>Ropz <a href="https://x.com/ropz/status/1874247750922977693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">took to social media</a> to post an emotional message, prompting responses from hundreds of his peers across the industry:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a 12 year old boy who dreamt of being in FaZe. That boy was me. Fast forward a decade, I am proud for not only reaching that dream, but also creating history within it. </p>



<p>Today I am officially leaving FaZe to start another journey. It was an absolute joy and pleasure to represent this team alongside all the amazing people, who became like family to me. Memories for a lifetime, one of the best 3 years of my life. </p>



<p>No words will do justice to how much this meant for me and how special everything was, this was a decision I made against my heart and a part of me will always love this team and organisation. </p>



<p>Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a relatively short time, ropz became one of Counter-Strike’s winningest players, racking up approximately $1.5 million in winnings since entering the scene in earnest with mousesports in 2017. His first big win was at the ESG Tour in Mykonos, Greece in 2017, where he netted a $120,000 prize with mousesports after defeating Team Liquid in a close GF.</p>



<p>Following that win, the player was instrumental in both mousesports and FaZe Clan’s success, storming to victory in the likes of:</p>



<ul>
<li>Intel Grand Slam</li>



<li>PGL Major Antwerp</li>



<li>IEM Cologne/Katowice</li>



<li>Thunderpick World Championship</li>



<li>ESL Pro League</li>



<li>CS Asia Championship</li>
</ul>



<p>Except for a BLAST Premier event, ropz has claimed almost every prize possible in the Counter-Strike space. He has ranked in the HLTV Top 20 Players seven times and has picked up half a dozen MVP awards for his efforts. </p>



<p>And it all began when ropz kickstarted a career as a Call of Duty content creator.</p>

<li><strong>Outstanding Story-Rich Game: </strong>Black Myth Wukong</li>



<li><strong>Sit Back and Relax Award: </strong>Farming Simulator 25</li>
</ul>



<p>Black Myth Wukong cleaned up at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamawards/2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The 2024 Steam Awards</a>, continuing an award spree that was most recently fuelled by two wins at The Game Awards, hosted by Geoff Keighley early in December. It beat Space Marine II, STALKER 2, Balatro, and Helldivers II to the ultimate prize.</p>



<p>There were some deserving wins here, though. Metro Awakening winning the VR Game of the Year award is a solid shout – it might not be the ‘next game’ in the series that fans were hoping for, but as a standalone VR title, it’s nothing short of stellar and deeply authentic.</p>



<p>Elden Ring’s Labor of Love award was handed out mostly because of Shadow of the Erdtree, which was so popular upon release earlier this year that it became a contender for Game of the Year awards at The Game Awards (and other showcases). </p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption’s Best Soundtrack trophy seems strange when compared to the competition, but it’s a popularity vote at best. It wasn’t a good year for gaming OSTs, it looks like.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, it was revealed that Putin had ordered Russian tech manufacturers to work on ‘homegrown’ gaming consoles. The goal is for the country to compete against PlayStation and Xbox in the home console stakes, but it seems that things aren’t going as planned. </p>



<p>In a recent update posted by Habr.com, it was stated that the ‘Skolkovo Foundation’, tasked with developing the core foundation of the consoles, is having some technical issues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-something-truly-breakthrough">‘Something Truly Breakthrough’</h2>



<p>In a quote <a href="https://habr.com/en/news/869822/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">picked up by Habr.com</a> (and circulated by Tom’s Hardware), it was said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I hope that my colleagues will approach this task with full responsibility and come up with something truly breakthrough. After all, it is obvious to everyone: Elbrus processors are not yet at the stage of development that would ensure equal competition with PS5 and Xbox, which means that the solution must be non-standard.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was a quote taken from Anton Gorelkin, the Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy. His reference to ‘Elbrus’ is a nod to a Russian-developed processor unit. The transparency of the statement confirms that the tech the country has created isn’t yet on par with the hardware created by Xbox and PlayStation.</p>



<p>The Elbrus processor has been pieced together by the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies, but it’s not a patch on the hardware being created by the likes of Intel and AMD. </p>



<p>Gorelkin repeated the desire to create something sovereign, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/putin-russia-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per Putin’s wishes</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This platform should primarily serve the goals of promoting and popularizing domestic video game products, expanding their audience beyond PCs and mobile gaming.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The most recent reports suggest that the Russians are working on two consoles, one a ‘not very powerful’ device and the other a cloud-based streaming-focused unit with a $45 price tag. In a first-look image published just days ago, it was revealed that the $45 unit features an Xbox-styled controller with a small remote and a USB dongle.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/27/12/2024/673f81ca9a79477d7dd76e72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">article by RBC.ru</a>, the goal of the hyper-cheap gaming solution was detailed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The MTS console will operate on the principle of cloud gaming on its own MTS Fog Play system — a platform for so-called foggy gaming. The system was originally designed to allow owners of “weak” computers to play games with high system requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In August, it was confirmed that Tango Gameworks had been ‘saved’ after being acquired by KRAFTON, the super-sized publisher behind games like PUBG, InZOI, and Dark and Darker. In a recent social media post, the Tango Gameworks team—which faced closure before being acquired—announced a small rebrand.</p>



<p>Tango Gameworks will henceforth be known as ‘Tango Gameworks Inc.’ under the KRAFTON banner.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-and-better-for-it">Back and Better For It</h2>



<p>When KRAFTON acquired Tango Gameworks, it was on a knife-edge after being shut down by Microsoft. KRAFTON swooped in at the final hour and saved Tango, securing the Hi-Fi Rush label (amongst others) and saving the studio from decimation at the hands of Microsoft.</p>



<p>Back then, the team at KRAFTON said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As part of this strategic agreement, KRAFTON intends to collaborate with Xbox and ZeniMax to ensure a smooth transition and maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks, allowing the talented team to continue developing the&nbsp;Hi-Fi Rush IP&nbsp;and explore future projects.</p>



<p>KRAFTON intends to support the Tango Gameworks team to continue its commitment to innovation and delivering fresh and exciting experiences for fans.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On social media, the team posted:</p>











<p>This was the team’s first post on social media since announcing the firm’s shutdown in May 2024.</p>



<p>It’s not yet known what the team at Tango Gameworks Inc. will focus on next, but IPs like Ghostwire Tokyo and The Evil Within were previously created by the studio. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-ps-plus-premium-games-you-need-to-play/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-ps-plus-premium-games-you-need-to-play-in-2025.1072080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-ps-plus-premium-games-you-need-to-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>PS Plus Premium in 2025 should be another year of classic titles in an ever-growing library. Month by month the Premium tier becomes more tantalizing, and I’ve picked out some of the best games you definitely to try out in 2025. </p>



<p>I’ve gone through periods of being subscribed to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps-plus-24-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS Plus</a> Premium, then downgrading my subscription, and eventually coming back to try many new games I’ve missed. Sony’s most expensive tier in the three-tiered PS Plus model isn’t for everyone, I get it. If you have a proclivity to game and miss the classics—or want to try out titles from yesteryear—Premium was born for this.</p>



<p>Narrowing this down to seven was difficult. I could probably come up with a second new list of recommendations, but these might be the best of the best. I’ve factored in variety, impact on gaming, and personal bias: You should find <em>plenty </em>to love.</p>



<h2 id="h-7-ps-plus-premium-games-to-play-in-2025">7 PS Plus Premium Games to Play in 2025</h2>



<p>The volatility of PS Plus Premium’s catalog does mean this list isn’t stable. Therefore, I encourage you to download these games and play them as quickly. <strong>Games are removed from the service regularly</strong>, and it isn’t a one-way influx of new titles. Check our list, read it twice, and find out which ones are naughty and nice—only joking, they’re all nice.</p>



<h3 id="h-ape-escape">Ape Escape</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Timeless. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Did you know 1999’s <strong>Ape Escape was the first software to require a DualShock controller</strong>? It’s a regurgitated fact, but one I find fascinating to this day. The accessory was mandatory to tame the madness of monkeys. 2024’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a> celebrated Ape Escape by dedicating a full level to the classic franchise, and the OG title has aged quite well. It’s still funny, possesses charm, and will keep you entertained for a few hours. </p>



<h3 id="h-dark-chronicle-dark-cloud-2">Dark Chronicle / Dark Cloud 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t sleep on this. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>The confusion on my face was palpable as I opened this as a gift on Christmas Day nearly twenty years ago. Yet, it became one of my favorite gifts as I sank countless hours into the surprising JRPG. Known as Dark Cloud 2 in America and Dark Chronicle elsewhere, Level-5’s release switches between two main characters and features a blend of dungeon-dwelling combat and city-building mechanics. It’s unique and still has cool ideas seldom seen in modern JRPGs.</p>



<h3 id="h-dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Just no. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Capcom decided to see what happens if you take classic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-confirm-new-resident-evil-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a>-style gameplay but swap zombies with dinosaurs. The result is a legendary survival-horror game fans have been begging to get the remake treatment for years. Like old-school Resi, the main character Regina has to survive, find supplies, and fight off enemies, but try not to become dinosaur chow. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-fans-dino-crisis-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dino Crisis fans are desperate for a new title</a>, but until this happens, play the original on PS Plus Premium.</p>



<h3 id="h-doom">DOOM</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Where it all began. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>I joined the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-can-run-the-original-doom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM</a> train a bit later than most—thanks to 2012’s BFG Edition—and I’ve been hooked ever since. I get passionate talking about my love for DOOM. PS Plus Premium has the first releases—which would go on to define the first-person genre for the next 30-plus years—and almost every FPS game you’ve played has likely been influenced by DOOM’s badassery. The guns, the music, the demons, the levels; DOOM is in the GOAT category, and all journeys start somewhere.</p>



<h3 id="h-god-of-war-3-remastered">God of War 3 Remastered</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Kratos isn’t scared, I promise you. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>My favorite God of War game turns on a dime. 2018’s reboot and 2022’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-receives-a-ps5-pro-enhanced-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ragnarok</a> are masterpieces in their own right, but there’s something about GOW 3 Remastered that hits differently. I understand recent GOW fans have probably never had the chance to experience the wonders of Kratos’ true origins. His heartbreaking and hellacious bloody and violent story culminates in a Greek tragedy of epic proportions in God of War 3. Do yourself a favor and play the whole trilogy, and you can appreciate the spectacle and grandeur that sets the scene for the “Dad of Boy” Norse deviation.</p>



<h3 id="h-jak-and-daxter-the-precursor-legacy">Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Platforming perfection. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>This might be a hot take, but I feel <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-jak-and-daxter-movie-is-planned-at-sony-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jak and Daxter</a> died after its first release. Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is one of the games I’ve fully completed the most times. Naughty Dog’s first crack at something other than Crash Bandicoot results in one of gaming’s memorable double acts. Jak is a mute but strong protagonist, and Daxter, is a scene-stealing, anything-but-silent Ottsel. The Precursor Legacy elevated the 3D platformer genre to new heights on the PS2 and is the franchise’s highlight—before it takes a literal dark turn in Jak 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You feel like a lawyer. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>HOLD IT! You don’t think this entry deserves to be on the list? OBJECTION! I think it does, so TAKE THAT! Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy is about the finest example of the PS Plus Premium package I can think of. I’d never in my life stopped for a second to think about the Phoenix Wright series and one day, cycling through Premium’s offerings, I saw the trilogy. I gambled, downloaded it, and 30 hours later, myself and my fiancé couldn’t get enough. Its interactive storytelling hybrid is utterly gripping—as is every case—and it’s great to see how the mechanics innovate and are reinvented with each sequel.</p>



<h3 id="h-syphon-filter">Syphon Filter</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Ahead of its time. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Had Konami’s Metal Gear Solid 1 not come out a year earlier, I think the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-syphon-filter-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Syphon Filter</a> would’ve received more attention and love—not that it hasn’t already. Syphon Filter’s blend of espionage action and well-designed levels mesh seamlessly. Its “Danger” system, use of gadgets, and varied mission parameters ensure Syphon Filter is another release well ahead of its time—it simply can’t compete with MGS1’s story. Nevertheless, Syphon Filter—and its main two sequels—are on PS Plus Premium, with trophies, and there’s a reason they were symbolic of the PS1 era.</p>
