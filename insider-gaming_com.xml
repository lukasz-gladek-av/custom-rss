<p>The Mecha Break Release Period is great news to the hundreds of thousands who wishlisted the manic mech title. The beta is proving to be a hit, and the full Mecha Break release could be groundbreaking.</p>



<p>Amazing Seasun Games is an ambitious studio focused on making fun and different games. You only have to look at the difference between Snowbreak Containment Zone—a fully-fledged sci-fi shooter—and Mecha Break to see this. But it’s the latter drawing a lot of eyes in 2025.</p>



<p>Did you know Mecha Break’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mecha-break-announces-open-beta-and-new-game-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open beta</a> hit a monumental <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mecha-break-beta-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">317,000 concurrent players on its first day</a>? Sleep on it if you dare. Let’s get stuck into the latest on the multiplayer mech shooter.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-mecha-break-is-coming-out">Do we Know When Mecha Break is Coming Out?</h2>

<p><strong>Mecha Break doesn’t have a specific release date, but it’s been confirmed the game is arriving in Spring 2025.</strong></p>



<p>The general release period was confirmed by developer Amazing Seasun Games via an <a href="https://x.com/MechaBREAK/status/1888331963536400723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X post</a>. They let players know: “Mecha BREAK launches Spring 2025!”</p>



<p>I have to think the open beta feedback will have a bearing on launch plans. If there’s a lot to work on, don’t be surprised to see the release window get pushed back. Very rarely are games brought forward, so expect <a href="https://mechabreak.seasungames.com/index/en/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mecha Break</a> to launch in the months of <strong>March, April, or May</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-mecha-break-platforms">Mecha Break Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Xbox Series X|S and PC players can enjoy Mecha Break at release, and the mech shooter is also coming to PlayStation 5 later on.</strong></p>



<p>In the same post concerning the release window, the developer confirmed its initial platforms: “Play on Steam, Windows PC via the Xbox App, and as a console launch exclusive with Xbox Series X|S.” A curious fan quizzed the Mecha Break X page on the status of a PlayStation 5 launch.</p>



<p>If you are on PS5, don’t worry, a future release is on the cards: “<strong>We look forward to bringing Mecha BREAK to PlayStation players later in 2025</strong>.” </p>







<p>It’s disappointing for PlayStation users, but at least a port is coming! Nintendo Switch players must sit this one out for good—unless the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> can handle it.</p>



<hr>



<p>Mecha Break is one of many incredible games scheduled for 2025. From Soulslike titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> to the Devil May Cry-inspired action title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lost-soul-aside-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, and FPS royalty with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>. If you do play Mecha Break, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-earn-mecha-break-twitch-drops-all-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to get free Twitch Drops</a> for it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-gameplay-is-being-leaked-online-as-early-copies-are-already-in-players-hands.1116930/</guid>

<p>Early physical copies of Assassin’s Creed Shadows have already found their way in players hands, resulting in early gameplay of the game being streamed and uploaded online.</p>



<p>According to X (formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/DannyStevens__/with_replies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@DannyStevens__</a>, copies of the game are obtainable via Facebook Marketplace. Insider Gaming were unable to find any copies on Facebook’s UK marketplace, Stevens’ claims were backed up with pictures of the games case, the install screen, and several gameplay photos. Those images have since been deleted.</p>



<p>After searching for the game online further, it seems that Ubisoft is aware of the situation and is currently DMCA striking a lot of the content posted online. Inevitably though, some gameplay and images will fall through the cracks, so be aware if you’re sensitive of spoilers.</p>

<p>It’s unclear on why copies of the game have started to be sold at such as early stage, as typically, physical copies begin leaked around 2-3 days before launch. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows was delayed twice</a>, including a recent delay that moved the game from its February 14 release to March 20, so it’s possible that the game had already been printed on masse.</p>



<p>It was said that the second delay was needed to give the game “additional weeks” to implement changes based on feedback received from players during testing.</p>



<p>Marc-Alexis Côté said, “since November, we’ve been thrilled to share our progress through Gameplay Overviews, and the overwhelming excitement has truly inspired us. “Each week has brought valuable feedback from our community. While we’ve already made remarkable strides, we believe a few additional weeks are needed to implement that feedback and ensure an even more ambitious and engaging day-one experience.”</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is scheduled to release on March 20, 2025 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. Ubisoft sources tell Insider Gaming that the company is now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confident on its new release date</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-pga-tour-2k25-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>PGA Tour 2K25 is 2K’s newest golf sequel, and its Xbox Game Pass and status is up in the air—like a well-struck golf shot. That’s why we’re here today to let you know if you need to pay your green fee, or if this one’s on the house.</p>



<p>The golf game market is hotter than it’s ever been. EA Sports PGA Tour is the up-and-coming Pro making a big impression, but the PGA Tour 2K series is the evergreen veteran of the links. Take-Two’s newest golf title is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a>—carrying on the company’s trend of biannual releases.</p>



<p>2K’s franchise has a healthy following of fans—myself included—but let’s see if the audience can grow thanks to the Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pga-tour-2k25-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play PGA Tour 2K25 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A warm welcome indeed. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>PGA Tour 2K25 isn’t available as a day-one release on Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</strong></p>



<p>Consider <a href="https://pgatour.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PGA Tour 2K25</a> a private membership. Not a single PGA Tour 2K25 trailer or prerelease gameplay video has made any mention of the sports title coming to Game Pass. It’s hardly a shock though. Few (if any) sports titles come to Game Pass on day one. I also can’t recall any 2K sports title doing this either.</p>



<p>You must go through each <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pga-tour-2k25-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25 Edition</a> and agonize over which one you want. Each Edition is TaylorMade for a different type of PGA Tour 2K fan. You must consider if you want the base game, extra content on top, or everything and more!</p>



<h2 id="h-will-pga-tour-2k25-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will PGA Tour 2K25 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Historical data suggests PGA Tour 2K25 isn’t coming to Xbox Game Pass later on.</strong></p>



<p>A quick browse of recent history shows neither PGA Tour 2K23 or 2K21 have come to Game Pass. I’m not sure if it has anything to do with it, but you <em>can </em>play EA Sports Tour on Game Pass. There might be some exclusivity rights there, maybe?</p>



<p>Either way, if you’re hoping to play PGA Tour 2K25 through Xbox Game Pass, my advice would be to not sit around in the grandstand and wait for Game Pass to take the first shot.</p>

<p>What will you do? Are you prepared to dive into your pocket to try out the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-courses-in-pga-tour-2k25-dlc-courses-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">courses</a> and features? Or will you wait for a sale and bide your time for PGA Tour 2K25?</p>
