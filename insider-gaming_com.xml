<p>It’s been officially announced that Netflix is set to buy Warner Bros. in 2026 as part of a whopping $82.7 billion deal. Not only will Netflix acquire the rights to numerous Warner Bros. IPs, such as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, and DC Comics, but it’ll also acquire all of Warner Bros. Games studios.</p>



<p>Warner Bros. has been no slacker in the gaming industry, either. Some major studios will be shifting to Netflix’s ownership, though whether the acquisition will affect their development remains to be seen.</p>







<p>This acquisition is certain to send shockwaves across every corner of the entertainment world, and the gaming sector is no exception. Warner Bros. Games oversees eight major studios, all of which are now set to feel the effects of Netflix’s takeover in one way or another.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-studio-owned-by-warner-bros-games">Every Studio Owned By Warner Bros. Games</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>In total, Warner Bros. Games oversees eight major studios—all of which will now come under Netflix’s ownership.</strong></p>



<p>These teams span a wide range of scale and specialties. From blockbuster franchises like Mortal Kombat to the critically acclaimed Batman: Arkham series, each studio has played a role in shaping some of gaming’s biggest hits. With such a diverse line-up moving to a new parent company, the industry will be watching closely to see how Netflix steers their future.</p>



<p>Here’s a breakdown of every studio currently operating under the Warner Bros. Games banner:</p>



<h3 id="h-avalanche-software">Avalanche Software</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The magical world of Harry Potter. Credit to Avalanche Software.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Avalanche Software have been around since 1995, and they’ve produced a variety of games over the years. Their most recent release was the incredibly popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, though they’d had some success developing some Disney titles throughout the 2010s, such as Disney Infinity and Toy Story 3. </p>



<p>In regard to their upcoming projects, all eyes are on a sequel. There’s long been speculation that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-a-priority-for-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy 2 is in development</a>, with the studio admitting that it’s a priority going forward.</p>







<h3 id="h-netherrealm-studios">NetherRealm Studios</h3>



<p>There’s one major franchise that people think of when NetherRealm Studios is mentioned: Mortal Kombat. The team is widely regarded as royalty in the fighting-game genre, and their other flagship series, Injustice, delivers the same high-impact combat through a DC Comics lens.</p>



<p>While a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-3-film-confirmed-warner-bros/">Morta</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-3-film-confirmed-warner-bros/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">l K</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-3-film-confirmed-warner-bros/">ombat 3 movie</a> is officially in development, the future of the games themselves remains uncertain due to Warner Bros. Games’ acquisition. Speculation has been swirling for years about NetherRealm’s next project, with fans divided between two possibilities—a follow-up to Mortal Kombat 1 or a long-awaited Injustice 3. Whatever their future holds, fans will be hoping the Netflix merger doesn’t impact development.</p>



<h3 id="h-rocksteady-studios">Rocksteady Studios</h3>



<p>The Batman: Arkham series reshaped the landscape of modern superhero games, and Rocksteady Studios is the team that made it happen. Prior to Arkham Asylum, the studio’s only release was Urban Chaos: Riot Response on the PS2 and Xbox—but their work with Batman propelled them into industry stardom.</p>



<p>Their most recent project, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, landed with a mixed reception, yet Rocksteady remains a major force with the potential for a significant comeback. As for what comes next, nothing has been confirmed. Rumours continue to circulate about a return to Gotham with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-working-on-new-batman-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Batman title supposedly in development</a>, but until an official announcement arrives, the studio’s next move remains firmly under wraps.</p>



<h3 id="h-tt-games">TT Games</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Fire up the Bat Signal. Image via TT Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>TT Games, or Traveller’s Tales, encompasses four major subsidiaries, though they all work together under the same umbrella. These are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Traveller’s Tales</strong>. Primary Division of TT Games.</li>



<li><strong>TT Fusion</strong>. Division focused on porting games to handheld platforms.</li>



<li><strong>TT Games Publishing</strong>. Division focused on handling publishing duties.</li>



<li><strong>TT Odyssey</strong>. Mobile games developer.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re somehow not aware, these guys are responsible for the hugely successful and childhood-defining LEGO games. Its upcoming title, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, is slated for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026 release</a> and will probably be the first Warner Bros. game published following the Netflix acquisition announcement.</p>



<h3 id="h-wb-games-montreal">WB Games Montreal</h3>



<p>It’s no secret that Warner Bros. Games Montréal has had a mixed run in recent years. The studio supported Rocksteady on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and before that developed Gotham Knights, another Arkham-adjacent project that met with a fairly lukewarm reception.</p>



<p>Despite this, it appears the team isn’t finished with the DC universe just yet. Reports suggest they’re now working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wb-games-montreal-is-working-on-a-aaa-live-service-title-based-on-dc-comics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new AAA live-service title set within the DC Comics world</a>. Exactly what form that will take is still unclear, but fans will be hoping it avoids the pitfalls of previous superhero live-service attempts—particularly the comparisons to Marvel’s Avengers.</p>



<h3 id="h-wb-games-boston">WB Games Boston</h3>



<p>Warner Bros. Games Boston is best known for its work on MMO-RPGs, such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online and The Lord of the Rings Online.</p>



<h3 id="h-wb-games-new-york">WB Games New York</h3>



<p>WB Games New York works with developers to build online features and communities for video games. It’s not directly involved with developing a standalone video game. </p>



<h3 id="h-wb-games-san-francisco">WB Games San Francisco</h3>



<p>A Division of Warner Bros. Games that specifically works on mobile releases and titles, utilising IPs such as Harry Potter and the DC Universe.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-warner-bros-games-amp-netflix-merger">What Is The Warner Bros. Games &amp; Netflix Merger?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix has officially acquired Warner Bros.</a> and all of its subsidiaries in a blockbuster deal reportedly valued at $82.7 billion—one of the largest entertainment acquisitions in history. The move marks a seismic shift in the media landscape, placing an enormous collection of globally renowned properties under the Netflix banner and signalling the company’s most aggressive expansion into traditional film, TV, and gaming yet.</p>



<p>The deal grants Netflix ownership of an expansive catalogue of IPs, ranging from Harry Potter to the full DC Comics universe. This also encompasses Warner Bros.’ prestigious film and television library, animation houses, HBO programming, and various production entities across the globe.</p>



<p>Crucially, the purchase includes Warner Bros. Games, bringing all eight of its studios—and their respective franchises—into Netflix’s growing gaming portfolio. That means Netflix now owns teams behind major titles such as Mortal Kombat, Batman: Arkham, LEGO games, Middle-earth, and more.</p>

<p>The Witcher’s Ciri actor has stated that she spent some time considering whether they should leave the series, along with Henry Cavill. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Witcher series first had Henry Cavill playing Geralt of Rivia; however, he had to leave the show before it ended, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-season-four-first-clip-hemsworth-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liam Hemsworth</a> stepping in to wrap up the rest of the seasons as Geralt. Henry Cavill’s leaving was shocking news to all the fans, and it seems it was a shock to cast members as well, because one of them considered quitting along with him. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-s-ciri-didn-t-know-henry-cavill-was-leaving-until-a-day-before-the-news-broke">The Witcher’s Ciri Didn’t Know Henry Cavill Was Leaving Until a Day Before the News Broke</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/tv-interviews/freya-allan-interview-the-witcher-netflix-ciri-henry-cavill-3915069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NME</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/the-witcher-ciri-actor-says-she-considered-quitting-the-show-with-former-star-henry-cavill-hes-the-geralt-i-grew-up-with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), The Witcher’s Ciri actor, Freya Allan, opened up about considering quitting with Henry Cavill. Allan spoke about how season 3 of the show was difficult for everyone and how she was only informed about Henry Cavill quitting one day before it was announced to the public. Allan added that she cried as she wanted to complete the series with the guy who had played her “adoptive father”. </p>



<p>Allan added that, for the first time, she began to see what life would be like away from The Witcher and spent a “solid amount of time” considering whether she should quit her role as Ciri alongside Henry Cavill. However, as we all know, she ultimately chose to stay back and make the most of every moment. Allan also talked about how she was inspired to take on Henry’s role after he left, who was always so “knowledgeable and loyal to the books, push for certain lines to be included.” </p>

<p>Legendary game developer Tim Cain has returned to the gaming industry spotlight to team up with Obsidian Entertainment once again, and they’ve confirmed that they’re working on a new game already.</p>



<p>If you didn’t know, Tim Cain helped mastermind the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-revealed-what-makes-fallout-special/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a> franchise and co-directed The Outer Worlds, amongst other work. The developer semi-retired several years ago, but has announced that he’s back into the swing of things with Obsidian, and is developing a mystery game.</p>

<p>In a December 5 ‘Cain On Games Update’ on his YouTube channel, Cain discussed what was happening in his life regarding game development and the next steps:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m back at Obsidian. I’m there, full-time employee, and in person. So not remote. I’m not a contractor anymore.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Cain explained that while he will have his name attached to at least one other game coming up—due to his relaxed contractor status in recent times—he is now firmly on Obsidian’s books. Cain explained that he’s not at liberty to discuss the new project, and it gives more questions than it does answers:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I also can’t talk about the project I’m working on at Obsidian, just because that’s covered under NDA. Don’t bother guessing, you’re not gonna guess right.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Cain explains that he’s “A lot less retired now,” and this new game will likely be the center of his focus moving forward.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video and everything said by Cain about the life change.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Outer Worlds and The Outer Worlds 2 have been the two main games Cain has worked on in the last 10 years. It’ll be interesting to see what the new title is, but it’s hard to imagine it’s not something to do with an RPG!</p>
