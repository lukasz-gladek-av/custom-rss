<p>LEGO has announced that a new Legend of Zelda set is coming in 2026, though details on what exactly it entails are scarce.</p>



<p>The partnership between LEGO and Nintendo has seen a host of epic sets released, including the Legend of Zelda Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set and a host of Super Mario sets, and the catalogue is being expanded upon next year.</p>

<p>A short video on the LEGO website shows a minifigure of Link, with Zelda blurred in the background, standing still as an ominous shadow approaches.</p>



<p>The video ends with a message for builders across the world, telling them to ‘Build the Legend’ and confirming a new set is coming in 2026. However, that’s all the details that are available for now.</p>



<p>LEGO and Nintendo are set for a big year in 2026, as it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed back in March</a> that Pokémon sets are coming next year—coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the franchise.</p>



<p>Other Nintendo franchises that have received LEGO sets include Animal Crossing, Donkey Kong, and LEGO recreations of the iconic Nintendo Entertainment System and the original Game Boy.</p>

<p>Epic Games has denied that gambling mechanics are being added to Fortnite in user-created experiences, despite their own explanation confirming their addition.</p>



<p>Leaks first emerged to state that “gambling” was coming to UEFN, which was confirmed in the latest patch notes, but there appears to be some confusion about the clarification of “gambling” in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-epic-games-denies-gambling-added-to-fortnite">Epic Games Denies ‘Gambling’ Added to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New addition. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Epic Games approached Insider Gaming to request a correction to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-adding-gambling-in-future-update-leaks-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our article about the addition of “gambling” in Fortnite</a>, stating that gambling is against the Fortnite Developer Rules.</p>



<p>Section 1.11 of the Developer Rules states that developers cannot “implement gambling content, raffles, or casino-style games,” which are “prohibited whether or not they involve real money or virtual currency.”</p>



<p>Additionally, section 1.15.5 states that “teach or prominently feature images or activities that are typically associated with real-world gambling, casino-style games, or games of chance that offer a prize, even if they are not directly simulating a gambling experience, are not permitted in any form.”</p>



<p>Epic Games explained that, instead, the addition is for “paid random items” and that developers must “disclose the actual numerical odds of what the player may receive before the player makes a purchase.” However, Epic Games denies that gambling and paid random items are the same.</p>



<p>Despite Epic Games’ arguments, the above still constitutes gambling. Any paid-for item with a chance of a specific reward is still gambling, just as loot boxes in other titles qualify as gambling.</p>



<p>This is confirmed by legal action in countries like Belgium, where the Belgium Gaming Commission <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43906306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned loot boxes in 2018</a> and declared the content to be “in violation of gambling legislation.”</p>



<p>This article will be updated if Epic Games provides any further details on the addition.</p>
