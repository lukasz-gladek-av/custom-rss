<p>The early access launch of Path of Exile 2 has been delayed due to database</p>



<p>The game was originally scheduled to launch at 2pm EST. Just before that time, and with a larger than expected number of players eager to jump into the game, developer Grinding Gear Games decided to do “last minute database upgrades” in order to allow the game’s servers to handle the influx of players. </p>



<p>The delay comes hours after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-ii-queue-warning-issued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developers warned of long queue times</a> for players on launch day.</p>



<p>After the database configuration was deployed, the <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865098006934229066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">team said</a> that it would only take a “half hour” to get access restored to the game. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case after another issue was found within the game.</p>



<p>First, there was a crash that “would have affected a majority of users” that was fixed and being deployed before final checks. Following stating that the release was “relatively imminent”, yet another problem arose for the game.</p>



<p>“We’ve run into a configuration problem and need to restart the realm,” they said. “The problem we ran into was due to adding more database shards in the last minute to try to support the massive player numbers. Unfortunately there was an issue which caused multiple characters to have the same character id.”</p>



<p>As of publishing, not only is the early access launch delayed but the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3594080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a> has been going offline due to players looking for updates.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will provide an update when Path of Exile 2 is functioning and available.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the actors with the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies mode have quit the game, according to a new claim. In a post on <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1865103558414340269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Call of Duty leaker GhostOfHope says that they have left the game due to a lack of protection against AI.</p>



<p>“Almost all of the actors that feature in the Zombies crew in Black Ops 6 Zombies have pulled out of working over the lack of AI protections in their contracts,” Hope said. “This has resulted in some of the disappointing recasts we are now seeing early on (Ex: SAM on Citadelle), with some likely still to be recast in future maps etc.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision for comment on the report. As of publishing, no response has been received.</p>



<p>Concerns of AI protection for video game actors is nothing new. SAG-AFTRA members are currently striking against game studios for that exact reason after negotiations with studios failed to deliver any sort of guarantees for actors. The strike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially began</a> in July after 18 months of negotiations, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sag-aftra-strike-with-video-game-voice-and-performance-artists-to-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continues without a deal</a>.</p>



<p>One of those studios the union is in negotiations with just happens to be Activision Blizzard as well as EA, Insomniac, Take-Two, Warner Bros. Games, and more.</p>
