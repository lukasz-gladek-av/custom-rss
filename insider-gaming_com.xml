<p>Playing a new RPG or open-world game in 2026 could prove to be a big time commitment, but it’s probably worth it, so who cares? 2026 is serving up even more long-form gaming through new role-playing titles and open-world sandboxes, but no one wants a time sink, which is why Insider Gaming has singled out the best in the genres announced so far.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of crossover with open-world games and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gaming-best-rpg-game-of-the-year-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPG</a> games. Similarities include open (or at least semi) environments, quests, leveling up, exploration, and fighting. It’s a style of gameplay that doesn’t get old, especially for those special few who make everything feel new.</p>



<p>2026 is shaping up to be an epic year of gaming, and these prospective releases will help.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-open-world-amp-rpg-titles-coming-in-2026">Best Open-World &amp; RPG Titles Coming In 2026</h2>



<p>Everything on this list has been outed for 2026. It doesn’t mean all games will release in 2026, as that’s just how the media industry works. Delays are common, and one VERY anticipated game sticks out on this list like a sore thumb. Read the list as though every game is releasing, there are no issues, and you can carry on about your day like everything is perfect.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will be the first to cover any video game delays if they happen.</p>



<h3 id="h-nioh-3">Nioh 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p>While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nioh-3-demo-progress-carry-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3</a> isn’t completely open-world, it retains its usual RPG elements from its level-up system to picking certain stats to upgrade, along with quests, bosses, and the usual slew of RPG requirements. Team Ninja has also made Nioh 3 the most open in the franchise’s history, meaning the game’s devilish difficulty will be accompanied by a new sense of freedom not yet seen. It’s great to see Nioh back, and let’s hope you don’t want to see the back of it for being so tough it hurts.</p>



<p><strong>Current release date: February 6.</strong></p>







<h3 id="h-monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was aptly one of the wildest stories of 2025. Capcom’s long-running series broke an outrageous amount of new ground and catapulted the MH name into the upper echelons of mainstream gaming. 2026 cranks things down slightly with the release of Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection. It brings back the less-heralded series, but with MH being as popular as ever, there might not be a better time to jump into a new Monster Hunter RPG.</p>



<p><strong>Current release date: March 13.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Pearl Abyss</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pearl Abyss is back with Crimson Desert. The open-world title is a spiritual successor to Black Desert Online and will have you running and riding across the pristine lands of Pywel. Unlike its predecessor, Crimson Desert is a single-player-driven experience, focusing on your adventure with Kliff&nbsp;and his allies. It wouldn’t be a shock to see Crimson Desert in RPG GOTY conversations come the end of 2026, hence IG’s recommendation.</p>



<p><strong>Current release date: March 19.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via TT Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>KA-POW. Stop the count, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> is winning it all! It’s probably not the case, but DC fans can dream as The Dark Knight readies himself for another dark night in the dank, dangerous streets of Gotham. LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight isn’t your conventional LEGO title, and it might be all the better for it. Resembling a Rocksteady Arkham game more than a LEGO clone, there’s promise for Legacy of the Dark Knight, and it doesn’t look like a Joker.</p>



<p><strong>Current release date: May 29.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-fable">Fable</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A new Fable has grown beyond being just a fable; it should finally be a 2026 reality. Playground Games is a connoisseur of high-speed racing that looks to send you speeding across the horizon (pun fully intended), but the talented team has broadened its horizons (ok, might be overkill) by being tasked with a new Fable. It’s been 16 years since Fable 3, and the time for waiting needs to be over. It’s a central figure in the Xbox Developer Direct 2026, and a release this year should happen.</p>



<p><strong>Current release window: 2026</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-chrono-odyssey">Chrono Odyssey</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Chrono Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>A “late-2026” release window is on the cards for Chrono Odyssey, so this one could be borderline. However, what is certain is that Chrono Odyssey looks otherworldly, and the MMORPG’s open world could be addicting, it’s <em>that </em>type of game. It’s been in beta, so it’s not like it’s a new entity suddenly dropping out of thin air, and Chrono Odyssey could explode overnight—unless you’re onto it now thanks to this list, eh?</p>



<p><strong>Current release window: 2026</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-diablo-iv-lord-of-hatred">Diablo IV: Lord of Hatred</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Blizzard</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s a lot of hatred in Diablo 4, isn’t there? After 2024’s Vessel of Hatred comes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-lord-of-hatred-coming-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lord of Hatred</a> in 2026. It was announced at The Game Awards 2025, and the fan-favorite Paladin class is making a heroic return. Diablo 4 players will have Mephisto locked into their sights when the ARPG’s new content drops in April. D4’s endgame is getting overhauled, and there will be plenty of new features to look forward to.</p>



<p><strong>Current release date: April 28, 2026</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Unknown Worlds Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s safe to say that Subnautica 2 hasn’t been able to swim away from its controversy. The unbelievable hype has been washed away somewhat by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-says-it-wasnt-because-of-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subnautica 2 delay</a>, followed by the ongoing lawsuit between <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/subnautica-2-developer-unknown-worlds-sues-former-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds and former leadership</a>. On the other hand, Subnautica 2 looks to be an extension of everything that made the original so great, and remains the number one game on ‘the ‘Most Wishlisted Upcoming Steam Games.’ The lawsuit could affect its date, but 2026 is on the cards for now.</p>



<p><strong>Current release window: 2026</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Remember the sentence earlier on saying: “One VERY anticipated game sticks out on this list like a sore thumb,” where delays were possible? Grand Theft Auto 6 will dominate all media in 2026. Movies, TV, Games; it doesn’t matter. The big caveat being IF it comes out in 2026. ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When is GTA 6 coming out</a>?’ might be the most asked question on Earth. The November 5, 2025, Grand Theft Auto 6 delay announcement broke everyone’s hearts, and there have been suggestions that it could be pushed back to 2027. </p>



<p>You never know with Rockstar Games and GTA.</p>



<p><strong>Current release window: 2026 (Hopefully!)</strong>.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve got a missing game that should be on this list or you vehemently disagree with IG’s selections, the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> is the perfect place for your guidance or grievances.</p>

<p>Heartopia has plenty to get stuck into as you explore an idyllic life in a new location, but the wording inside the game can be quite confusing, especially when it comes to the Resident’s Request Office.</p>



<p>Starting off in Heartopia results in an avalanche of information being thrown your way, which you will naturally want to get rid of as soon as possible so you can focus on playing, but that can result in you inadvertently skipping past some important details.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for the Resident’s Request Office in Heartopia and have no idea where to look, Insider Gaming has got you covered with this guide.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-is-the-resident-s-request-office-in-heartopia">Where is The Resident’s Request Office in Heartopia?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Push the button. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Resident’s Request Office in Heartopia is not a location you can actually visit in the game, which has caused a lot of confusion.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, the Resident’s Request Office is a menu you access in the game to track your progress, as it acts as a hub for both Daily and Weekly Requests. </p>



<p>To access the Resident’s Request office, <strong>click on the calendar-like icon on the top-left of the screen, </strong>which is located next to the map.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-the-resident-s-request-office-in-heartopia">How to Use The Resident’s Request Office in Heartopia</h2>



<p><strong>The Resident’s Request Office in Heartopia is extremely handy for keeping track of mini objectives in the game, which can earn you neat rewards.</strong></p>



<p>Each day, a fresh batch of requests will be made available, and more requests are available every week. Completing them provides a range of rewards, including Gold, Wishing Stars, and Contribution Medals.</p>



<p>Contribution Medals are the most important of these rewards, as they tally together to increase your D.G. Member Level, unlocking additional features like additional Hobbies, extra plots by your house, and more.</p>

<p>Tides of Tomorrow has been delayed to April 2026, just over a month before its previous release date. </p>



<p>Digixart and THQ Nordic’s next title was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-tomorrow-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> back in June 2025 during a PlayStation State of Play event, where the developers spoke a bit about the game’s unique multiplayer system. The title received a release date for February 2026, but that has been delayed to April due to feedback from the demo; more details below. </p>







<h2 id="h-tides-of-tomorrow-gets-a-new-release-date">Tides of Tomorrow Gets a New Release Date</h2>



<p>A new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2678080/announcements/detail/493840283288472149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> from the developers of Tides of Tomorrow reveals that the game is now set to release on April 22, 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The developers considered renaming the title to Tides of the Day After Tomorrow, but decided against it. Instead, they are now delaying the release to work on the feedback they received from the demo. </p>



<p>Tides of Tomorrow’s demo and ongoing beta received extensive feedback, prompting the devs to delay the game. The additional time will be used to “respond to player input and implement improvements.” The extra time will allow the developers to “ensure the best possible experience for the upcoming narrative-driven adventure.” </p>



<p>While players wait for the upcoming title, they can check out the 40-minute <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3951580/Tides_of_Tomorrow_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">demo</a> on Steam, which lets them explore a location from the game’s opening act. As this is a narrative-driven adventure, the demo can be replayed to uncover new gameplay, storylines, and consequences. The game also features a unique multiplayer experience where players can follow a friend or a favourite streamer, and the system will generate a tailored experience by combining your choices with theirs.</p>
