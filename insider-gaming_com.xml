<p>Blizzard has announced that Blizzcon 2025 won’t be happening. Instead, the event will make its return after a two-year hiatus in September 2026.</p>



<p>“We’ve come a long way since our first event in 2005,” Blizzard <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24178650/blizzcon-returns-in-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in its statement</a>. “Over the past nearly 20 years since its inception, BlizzCon has inspired us to innovate, push the boundaries of creativity, and deliver once-in-a-lifetime moments. It’s important that we put on an event worthy of our community.”</p>

<p>That event will take place from September 12-13 in Anaheim, California. Blizzard says that plans for next year are already in motion with events like the opening ceremony, in-depth panels, the Darkmoon Faire, friendly competition, and hands-on gameplay.</p>



<p>Blizzard says that the goal is to create an “unforgettable experience” for everyone who takes part in it, and they are working to “meaningfully elevate” the convention.</p>



<p>“We are building this event just like we build our games: with a deep commitment to our players, with respect for your connections to our universes, and as a celebration of the strength of the bonds formed through shared adventure,” they said.</p>



<p>Since 202, Blizzcon has only been held twice: an online-only version in 2021 and a return to an in-person event in 2023. Blizzcon 2024 was cancelled in April 2024, with no official reason given. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blizzcon-2024-canceled-by-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company’s statement</a> at the time said that the decision was “not made lightly” and they planned on bringing it back in the future.</p>

<p>ZA/UM Studio, the developers behind Disco Elysium, have announced their new game. Currently known as Project C4, this new game is an RPG that features a “mind-warping story of espionage and team-building in an original yet achingly familiar setting.”</p>



<p>A press release announcing the new game gives players more details on what to expect:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The world of [C4] is rife with shadowy characters who help move the pieces for competing geopolitical powers in a game of concealed conflict. The player sets out to complete a desperate assignment which will put them at risk of losing their life, or much worse – being exposed for what they really are.</p>



<p>As an Operant serving a questionable global power, the player finds themselves locked in a vicious, clandestine struggle for truth and influence. Yet it is the mind that takes centre stage in Project [C4]. More vulnerable and more powerful than the physical world, it can be erased, changed, reordered, and of course significantly altered through regular use of psychoactive substances amongst other means. Players must steel themselves with whatever comfort they can in order to survive the violent canvas of the real.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>You can check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz9apwrMKi8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">short teaser trailer</a> for yourself below. More information on the game will be revealed at a later date.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[All REPO Platforms—Can You Play REPO on PS5, Xbox, or Nintendo?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-repo-platforms/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-repo-platforms%E2%80%94can-you-play-repo-on-ps5-xbox-or-nintendo.1131231/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-repo-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>REPO has exploded onto the scene with its combination of fear-inducing enemies and uncomfortable environments. Its synergy with slapstick comedy and multiplayer chaos is the tip of the iceberg. PC players are enjoying it, but PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch owners are wondering about extra REPO platforms and if it’s on consoles too.</p>



<p>Many breakout hits are traditionally indie titles on PC through Steam. I think of recent hits such as Lethal Company and Content Warning. REPO is following in their footsteps with its brand of valuable-collecting shenanigans. It doesn’t matter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-players-can-play-repo-multiplayer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how many players you play with in REPO</a>, a good (but cursed) time is assured.</p>



<p>Its Steam player numbers have been extraordinary since launch, but can it also be enjoyed on consoles?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-repo-on-ps5">Is REPO on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More money needed. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>REPO is not currently available on PlayStation 5 or even PlayStation 4.</strong></p>



<p>Developer semiwork’s only previous project was Voidigo—a colorful roguelite. As such, the company is still very much in the process of building its brand. A <a href="https://repogame.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> PS5 port is presumably dependent on the horror game’s long-term success. The more people buy it, the more people play it on Steam, the chances of a PlayStation port increase.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-repo-on-xbox">Is REPO on Xbox?</h2>



<p><strong>Xbox also doesn’t have a REPO port lined up for the same reasons as other popular consoles.</strong></p>



<p>Yep, Microsoft owners face the same problem as PlayStation owners. REPO is very much an indie game, and Steam is a great proving ground for the title. Costs increase once you start factoring in more platforms and ports—let alone to mammoth brands such as PlayStation and Xbox.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-repo-on-nintendo-switch">Is REPO on Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch also misses out on a REPO console release.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve seen what I’ve had to say about REPO on PlayStation and Xbox already, the penny has dropped for Nintendo Switch owners too. The Switch is a very receptive platform for indie games, so a REPO release might not be unthinkable.</p>



<p>If the status of REPO’s platforms changes on PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch, we’ll update this guide and let you know.</p>



<hr>



<p>REPO is the epitome of an overnight sensation that continues to grow. The sky is the limit as it stands, and people are loving REPO as it stands. let us know what you think, and share any funny stories you’ve had with it.</p>



<p>Keep up with the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-repo-down-server-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO server status</a> changes as the player figures potentially meddle with the connection.</p>
