<p>Rockstar Games will acquire Video Games Deluxe and rename the studio to Rockstar Australia, it has been announced.</p>



<p>In the press release announcement (via <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250303172250/en/Rockstar-Games-to-Acquire-Video-Games-Deluxe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">businesswire</a>), it was said that Rockstar Games will acquire the studio, but did not disclose the sum.</p>



<div><p>The press release reads:</p><p>Rockstar Games<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;is proud to announce the acquisition of Video Games Deluxe, the Sydney-based development studio. The studio will be renamed Rockstar Australia. Video Games Deluxe has worked with Rockstar Games on some of its most memorable titles, including the 2017 re-releases of<em>&nbsp;<strong>L.A. Noire</strong></em><strong>,&nbsp;<em>L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files</em></strong>, and most recently, on upgrades to&nbsp;<strong><em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition</em></strong>&nbsp;for iOS and Android, Netflix, and modern consoles.</p></div>



<p>“After working together closely over many years, we are excited to have Video Games Deluxe join the team as Rockstar Australia,” said Rockstar Games Head of Publishing, Jennifer Kolbe.</p>



<p>Rockstar Games’ relationship with the Video Games Deluxe team began with founder Brendan McNamara’s former studio, Team Bondi, and the creation of the critically acclaimed and groundbreaking detective thriller,&nbsp;<strong><em>L.A. Noire</em></strong>.</p>



<p>“It’s been an honor to work closely with Rockstar Games this past decade,” said Video Games Deluxe founder Brendan McNamara. “We are thrilled to be a part of Rockstar Games and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-champions-release%E2%80%94platforms-everything-we-know.1123728/</guid>

<p>Whisper it, but the release of Pokémon&nbsp;Champions instantly gives a Pokémon&nbsp;Stadium feeling. The Pokémon&nbsp;Company surprised everyone with its announcement, but now it’s out in the wild, it’s time to prepare yourself for battle.</p>



<p>Older Pokémon&nbsp;fans will remember the glory of Pokémon&nbsp;Stadium 1 and 2. The larger-than-life titles focused on the series’ core combat and head-to-head encounters. Exhilarating battles brought to life in huge arenas with flashy visuals and sizzling sound effects. The last 25 years have seen a slew of Pokémon&nbsp;titles, but none similar to Stadium. </p>



<p>Say hello to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-champions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon&nbsp;Champions</a>—a seemingly spiritual successor to the Stadium years. It’s an entirely new AAA release, and its launch might surprise you for a couple of reasons.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-pokemon-champions-is-coming-out">Do we Know When Pokémon&nbsp;Champions is Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stadium vibes. Credit to The Pokémon Company.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon&nbsp;Champions doesn’t have a release date or an estimated window. All we know for sure is it’s “Now in Development,” and updates on its progress will arrive as and when they are ready.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Pokémon&nbsp;Presents</a> showcase is where we first learned of Pokémon&nbsp;Champions. A new Pokémon&nbsp;title was rumored to be shown off during the presentation. But it was expected to be another remake or perhaps a remaster. </p>



<p>Instead, a full trailer for Pokémon&nbsp;Champions was revealed—showing off its glitz, glamor, and gameplay. You can check out the debut announcement trailer right here.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-pokemon-champions-platforms">All Pokémon&nbsp;Champions Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon&nbsp;Champions is a multi-platform release for Nintendo Switch and mobile.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not just an exclusive Nintendo release and that’s it. Pokémon&nbsp;Champions is also coming to mobile platforms too. The official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik6IGiCzFzQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube trailer</a> announcement’s description confirms as much.</p>



<p>“Look forward to cross-platform battles alongside your favorite Pokémon on Nintendo Switch and mobile, with a variety of different modes available for your desired experience,” it says.</p>



<p>For now, we presume it’s the Nintendo Switch, but a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> release is likely on the cards as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-pokemon-champions">What is Pokémon&nbsp;Champions?</h2>



<p>Even though a lot of the content is quite cryptic, there’s a definite Pokémon&nbsp;Stadium feeling with big-time battles in large arenas again. It also looks like Pokémon&nbsp;can turn into Tera Types too. </p>



<p>It’s also confirmed Champions “Will feature familiar mechanics such as Pokémon types, Abilities, and moves, creating an environment conducive to rich and varied strategies for new and experienced Trainers alike.”</p>



<p>We’re sure we’ll learn much more about Pokémon Champions as time passes.</p>

<p>What are your initial impressions of Pokémon Champions? Does The Pokémon Company have another winner on its hands? Is it another Gym badge to pin up somewhere for the company? Can Champions capture the feeling of what made Pokémon Stadium so magical? Drop a comment below.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco announced that Dragon Ball Sparking Zero will receive 3 DLCs post-release.

The following two DLCs will include Daima content for Sparking Zero, and according to a Steam listing, the first part should be available to try out this month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortnite recently released its new anti-cheat policy, which revealed that players with lifetime bans will be offered a second chance in April 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-cheaters-will-receive-a-second-chance">Fortnite Cheaters Will Receive a Second Chance</h2>



<p>Fortnite has confirmed that players who have received a lifetime ban for cheating in the game and have been banned for more than a year can return to matchmaking in April 2025, when the new update rolls out. Players who have cheated in tournaments will not be able to participate in competitive events; however, they can also enter matchmaking in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in April, Fortnite’s lifetime ban policy for cheaters will change. First-time offenders will now receive a year’s ban, after which they will receive a second chance to return to the game. However, if they cheat again, a lifetime ban will be enforced. Players who sell cheats or break other rules, resulting in a lifetime ban, will not receive a second chance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s new <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-anti-cheat-update-february-27-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">anti-cheat policy</a> also introduces new PC requirements for tournaments. Players should have an Account Level of 350 or higher to participate in tournaments and enable TPM and Secure Boot while playing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many players wonder whether they will see the return of popular content creators who received lifetime bans for cheating. Jarvis, who was banned in 2019 for using cheat software while live-streaming, has also <a href="https://x.com/liljarviss/status/1895161943725613220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a> to Fortnite’s recent announcement about giving cheaters a second chance.</p>

Also, Epic Games recently banned a Fortnite cheater and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-bans-fortnite-cheater-forces-them-to-apologize-and-give-back-winnings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced them to apologise and return their winnings</a>.

<p>Netease recently spoke about their plans to grow Marvel Rivals as a franchise, and one avenue they are focusing on is “crossover events and promotions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/marvel-rivals-crossover-events-and-promotions-with-other-media-confirmed-by-netease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, Netease spoke about its growth strategies for Marvel Rivals during a Q&amp;A section of its Q4 2024 <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netease-inc-ntes-q4-2024-070339624.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a>. When asked about marketing expansions, the developers confirmed that Marvel Rivals will receive “crossover events and promotions with other media to expand the user base.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from crossovers in Marvel Rivals, the developers also spoke about the “wide acclaim” the game has received since the release of Season 1. Moreover, their investments in development and marketing have continued following a “long-term operational strategy”. Regarding esports, the team has a plan in the works and will announce it soon to “enhance the gaming ecosystem”.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has massive potential for crossovers with a name like Disney behind it. Players will also look forward to collaborations with the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as other games. A game like Fortnite already has its own Marvel Universe; imagine if Marvel Rivals were to join the fray, too. </p>
