<p>During an IRL livestream, popular streamers Valkyrae, Emiru, and Cinna were stalked and harassed by a young man who threatened to kill them. The stream ended abruptly, but thankfully all three women and their staff were unharmed after the disturbing incident.</p>

<p>During the multi-day Sis-a-Thon stream, hosts Valkyrae and Cinna were hanging around Santa Monica Pier yesterday with fellow streamer Emiru when the incident occured. The trio, along with members of the camera crew, walked past a young man crouching on the ground who asked for Emiru’s number. She declines and the group decides to move on, but the man says “I’m going to keep following her.”</p>



<p>After being followed for some time, despite asking him to stop, the group attempts to leave. The man then gets into an altercation with one of the friends of the group, and when the streamers call for security to intervene, he charges at them, threatening first to fight them before saying “I’ll kill you right now.” After distancing themselves from the man, amidst more calls for security, the stream ended.</p>

<p>Soon after the stream ended, both Cinna and Valkyrae took to Twitter to tell fans they were alright, but also to inform them that the Sis-A-Thon would be ending as a result. The next day, Valkyrae went back on Twitter to <a href="https://x.com/Valkyrae/status/1896613433245614442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">address</a> baseless accusations that the incident was staged, while also criticizing those that stirred up hate towards the women earlier during the stream:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Seeing accounts that have harassed us for a 10 second clip of downtime during a 24/7 marathon accusing us of “just begging for subs, women do nothing” to then farming engagement from this stalker situation while we IRL stream has been so sad to see. Seeing accounts accusing my friends and I for faking this and blaming us instead of questioning the man’s behavior has been embarrassing to see. I’ve learned it doesn’t matter how much I accomplish in this industry or how much I try to gain respect, some men will hate women and blame women no matter the situation.”</p>
