<p>It has been revealed that Call of Duty’s DMZ mode is returning in December, but there’s a huge catch. The once-popular extraction shooter platform first emerged in Modern Warfare II in 2022, but after a few months of updates, it eventually disappeared from the ecosystem, never to return – until now.</p>



<p>There’s a huge catch though.</p>







<h2 id="h-dmz-recon-coming-december-11th">DMZ: Recon Coming December 11th</h2>



<p>DMZ: Recon is a new extraction shooter experience coming to Call of Duty: Mobile in December. It’s a reflection of the DMZ title that was released alongside Modern Warfare II in 2022, albeit a ‘shrunk-down’ version.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It will land during COD Mobile’s Season 11 update, and like the original, it’s set to feature PvPvE gameplay. Unlike the original DMZ, it’s expected that there will be no punishment or negativity surrounding PvP, as that was a sticking point for fans of the first platform. This is reflected in there being no ‘team recruitment’ mechanics, which were in the first DMZ.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDutyMobile/comments/1oyh2hg/dmz_recon_is_official_heres_what_to_expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early impressions from COD Mobile leakers</a> suggested that DMZ: Recon will be entirely first-person and will feature an in-match buy store, just like the one found in the original DMZ mode. There will be boss characters, weapons can be levelled up in flight, and loot is based on a tier system that includes extremely rare collectibles.</p>



<p>Players can reportedly purchase vehicles on the fly, and as it’s a smaller experience, only eight teams of three will occupy each match.</p>



<p>It has also been suggested that two maps will emerge at launch on December 11th: Serpent Island and Building 21. It was also claimed from those attending preview events that players arrive in the game via a wingsuit, can use killstreaks, carry three weapons, and can extract using a helicopter system, just like the first game.</p>







<p>Are you happy to see DMZ coming back, even if it’s only in COD Mobile? Let your thoughts be known via the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Nearly two months after announcing the plans, Avalanche Studios has officially closed its office in Liverpool. This closure sees 31 people lose their jobs, adding to the ever-growing job loss count in the gaming industry.</p>



<p>In a post on its website, the company confirmed the closure and thanked the staff who were impacted.</p>







<p><strong>“The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project,” </strong><a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/updateliverpool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the statement reads</a>. <strong>“We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to Avalanche Studios Group.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Our focus remains on supporting the [staff] through this transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities.</strong>“</p>



<h2 id="h-layoffs-months-in-the-making">Layoffs Months In The Making</h2>



<p>Plans of the Liverpool closure was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avalanche-studios-closes-office-lays-off-staff-after-contraband-cancelation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced in September</a>. They came just weeks after it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-development-stopped-at-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development on Contraband</a> was ending. Avalanche said the decision came after an internal review of the company and its plans moving forward after the game’s cancelation. </p>







<p>“<strong>This review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations</strong>,” they said at the time, while saying it would impact all employees in Liverpool.</p>



<p>In addition to the Liverpool office, layoffs were planned for offices in Malmö and Stockholm. There hasn’t been an update on those locations, however. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Avalanche Studios for what the plans for the studio are moving forward. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dispatch Reaches Two Million Copies in Less Than A Month]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-two-million-copies-adhoc-studios/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-reaches-two-million-copies-in-less-than-a-month.1358584/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite releasing less than a month ago, AdHoc’s Dispatch has sold two million copies. The last episodes, 7 and 8, only came out last week and reached <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-million-copies-adhoc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a million copy milestone</a> within 10 days.</p>







<p>Released in late October, Dispatch follows Robert, a former superhero working a desk job and dispatching ‘reformed’ villains in Los Angeles. Composed of former TellTale Games members, AdHoc Studios brought the iconic Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-type dialogue choices and consequences. The game quickly became&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1981416301709934652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best-selling title</a>&nbsp;on Steam with only two episodes. Then, it reached a million copies only a week and a half after release. Now, with all the episodes out, the team shared an even bigger milestone.</p>



<h2 id="h-adhoc-studios-celebrates-two-million-copies-sold-for-dispatch-with-new-drawing">AdHoc Studios Celebrates Two Million Copies Sold for Dispatch With New Drawing</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We're also sad there are no new episodes this week, but thank you to the 2 million players that have joined us so far. Wouldn't be here without you.</p><p>Art by Derek Stratton. <a href="https://t.co/1Bu2MIMmh9">pic.twitter.com/1Bu2MIMmh9</a></p></div>— AdHoc Studio – Dispatch OUT NOW! (@theAdHocStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1991235043868410096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1991235043868410096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new post from AdHoc Studios</a> reveals that Dispatch has sold two million copies, a huge milestone for an indie title. To commemorate the occasion, Derek Stratton, the game’s art director, drew a new picture featuring everyone’s favorite character, Beef. The drawing is somber, as no new episodes have been released due to Episode 7 and 8 being the last ones. Still, the team seems pretty grateful for the many fans who joined in the journey.</p>



<p>Currently, Dispatch is available on PC and PlayStation 5. No ports to Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch 2 have been announced. Unfortunately, no Season Two has been revealed yet, though the team <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/11/11/a-new-update-on-dispatch-season-2-after-its-surprising-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">seems adamant</a> about bringing it back. Given how it started development years ago, it’ll likely be some time before we see the Z-Team again. Still, with how popular it has become (and earning a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Award nomination</a>), the future for the title is looking bright.</p>
