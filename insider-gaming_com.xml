<p>In Marvel Rivals, you wage war across a rich depth of Marvel licenses from Thor to Black Panther. Many of the universe’s respective characters and native lands are represented in the hero shooter, so let’s run you through every confirmed map and game mode so far.</p>



<p>I’ve played many online multiplayer shooters, and it’s incredible how opinions can vary depending on the title’s maps and game modes. These are core fundamentals of a shooter’s identity, meaning if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>‘ DNA is flawed in this regard, it could fail before it even gets started.</p>



<p>However, based on the Marvel Rivals alpha and beta tests, I’d suggest this is unlikely. So without further ado, here’s every map and game mode locked and loaded in for Marvel’s star-studded hero release.</p>

<p>We currently know of nine maps in Marvel Rivals, and these battle arenas are distributed amongst the same few locations. Check out every single map confirmed so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven</li>



<li>Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface</li>

</ul>



<p>More maps might accompany the official launch of the multiplayer title, so stay tuned for even more content. Also, with Marvel Rivals taking up the live-service trend, a fruitful conveyor belt of maps is only the beginning. </p>



<p>With so many Marvel licenses to use, I’d love to see the Avengers Tower or the Quantum Realm set the scene for an epic battle!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-marvel-rivals-map-rumors">All Marvel Rivals Map Rumors</h2>



<p>In addition to confirmed locales, many more Marvel Rivals maps are purportedly on the way—courtesy of a leak.</p>



<p>According to journalist <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ross Miller on X</a>, another f<strong>ive maps are already in development (or finished)</strong> and likely coming to Marvel Rivals in a future content update. They <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller/status/1788079410530185237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">outed</a>, “Hydra Erebus Base, The Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda, Klyntar, Empire of Eternal Night, and Krakoa” as major locations.</p>



<p>Each of the five areas is expected to have maps within too. Take this all with a grain of salt, but it makes for interesting reading.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-marvel-rivals-game-mode">Every Marvel Rivals Game Mode</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals is gearing up for launch with four game modes: <strong>Conquest</strong>, <strong>Convergence</strong>, <strong>Convoy</strong>, and <strong>Domination</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-conquest">Conquest</h3>



<p>Conquest is a variation of Call of Duty’s Kill Confirmed in which players need to bank points for a kill by collecting the fallen enemy’s coin. The key difference here is the value of a coin increases the longer time goes on.</p>



<h3 id="h-convergence">Convergence</h3>



<p>We’re using Overwatch as our template here as you need to capture a control point first to trigger a payload, which the attacking team needs to guide to the end of the linear route. Conversely, the defending team has to prevent the payload from reaching each checkpoint by pushing it back and repelling opposition forces.</p>



<h3 id="h-convoy">Convoy</h3>



<p>Convoy is an honorable imitation of Overwatch’s classic Payload and Convoy modes. There are no capture points here, it’s a straight-up escort or defense mission (depending on your given side) of a moving objective along a fixed path.</p>



<h3 id="h-domination">Domination</h3>



<p>For Marvel Rivals’ Domination game mode, it’s a basic race to capture a control point and hold it until one team reaches the threshold. If one team achieves 100% completion, but at least one enemy player is present, it goes to overtime to determine if the game continues.</p>
