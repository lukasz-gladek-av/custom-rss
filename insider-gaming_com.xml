<p>Bungie has revealed how Runners will work in Marathon, who they are, are what their class type does.</p>



<p>It’s been confirmed that their will be six individual ‘Runners’ on launch, with Bungie confirming four of them during the Marathon Gameplay showcase.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-runners-work">How Runners Work</h2>



<p>Marathon is a team-based extraction shooter, where the player will need to choose one of six (at launch) Runners to use. In the lore of the game, a Runner is a cybernetic mercenary who’s given up their human form for a biosynthetic shell. </p>



<p>The gist? Each of the Runners have their own unique abilities and attributes catering to different playstyles. The goal of the game is to scavenge the map for the best loot and extract.</p>



<p>Before you join a game, you’ll pick a Runner and build your loadout with the overall objective to get in, scavenge, and extract alive.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-are-the-runners-in-marathon">Who Are The Runners in Marathon?</h2>



<p>So far, Bungie has confirmed that there will be six different Runners coming to the game on launch, but they have only revealed four.</p>



<ul>
<li>Locus – Locus is the games “soldier” class who is suited towards players with a more aggressive playstyle.</li>



<li>Blackbird – Blackbird is the games reconnaissance Runner, who can find where players are and strategically plan your next move.</li>



<li>Glitch – Glitch is all about disrupting the enemy by pushing forward, compromising them (details to be determined) and getting out.</li>



<li>Void – Void is the games Stealth class, with active camo and the ability to throw down smokes.</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>It’s currently unclear on what the other two Runners in Marathon will be, but logic suggests that one will at least be some kind of healer, while the other could be some kind of Tank/Brute character.</p>

<p>Marathon is Bungie’s ambitious and energetic extraction shooter, poised to disrupt a relatively tired genre that has been dominated by a single game for far too long. The team at Bungie has worked tirelessly over several years to produce a remarkably unique title that might not look like a typical extraction shooter, but it definitely plays like one.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything we know about Marathon, including the game’s release date, gameplay loop, extraction shooter model, and when the closed alpha will take place.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-marathon">What is Marathon?</h2>



<p><strong>Marathon is a first-person shooter built around an extraction model</strong>. That means that players kit up, enter a map, and fight to survive against other players and AI enemies. They’ll complete tasks, loot items, and try to stay alive, as death means failure and the loss of everything they’ve acquired.</p>



<p>Extraction shooters are typically intense and very challenging, but Marathon will have a much more ‘arcade-style’ aesthetic and operating model. It’ll utilise fast-paced movement mechanics and powerful abilities to make it stand apart from the milsim extraction shooters we’re used to seeing.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-marathon-coming-out">When is Marathon Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Marathon’s release date was revealed <strong>as being September 23, 2025</strong>. The price of Marathon hasn’t been confirmed just yet, which means we don’t know if it’ll be a free game.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-marathon-alpha">When is the Marathon Alpha?</h2>



<p>The Bungie team revealed that the <strong>closed alpha for Marathon starts on April 23, 2025</strong>. It’ll start as an invite-only event, with passes being allocated to specific users. From there, priority codes will be issued, and those who access the alpha will be able to invite two friends.</p>



<p>If you want to access the alpha, it begins with jumping into the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/marathonthegame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marathon Discord server</a> and completing a survey.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marathon-coming-to-console">Is Marathon Coming to Console?</h2>



<p>Most extraction shooters are only released on PC platforms, but <strong>we already know that Marathon is coming to Xbox and PlayStation</strong>. This was known ahead of the grand reveal that took place on April 12.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-marathon-gameplay-look-like">What Does Marathon Gameplay Look Like?</h2>



<p>Marathon’s gameplay loop is typical for an extraction shooter. Players start their game up and load out as they see fit, equipping weapons, upgrades, shields, grenades, attachments, and more. They’ll pick a ‘Runner’, a cybernetic individual with unique perks and skills, and then they’ll pick a map.</p>



<p>From there, it’s a fight to survive, with players exploring the map they’ve chosen, trying to complete tasks and successfully win their fights to eventually get the chance to <strong>leave the map</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s a deep dive into Marathon’s gameplay:</p>

<p>The team at Bungie has sat down in front of a live crowd to carry out one of the most exciting reveals in recent years – <strong>Marathon gameplay</strong>. This game is a reboot of a title that dropped in the 1990s, but it’s coming back to the market in an entirely different format: an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Bungie has put a lot of stock into Marathon; that much is certain. The extended showcase that revealed Marathon gameplay was a big-budget affair in a full-fledged studio packed with Bungie employees and guests.</p>



<p>And it makes sense because Marathon looks fantastic.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-escape-will-make-me-god">Escape Will Make Me God</h2>



<p>The gameplay trailer for Marathon was stunning, showcasing how the core gameplay mechanics will work. This is a much more manageable extraction shooter that uses arcade elements. There are on-screen prompts, a helpful UI and HUD, and contextual pings sitting front and centre.</p>



<p>‘Death is not the end’ is the running theme in this game, and Bungie has designed Marathon to be a flawless team-based shooter.</p>



<p>It’s all about adapting to ever-evolving games that never go the same way twice. </p>



<p>You can see what I’m talking about in the extended gameplay trailer below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon | Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvJIQoWIQP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>There’s so much to soak up in the extended gameplay trailer. We get a look at some of the maps and Runners, which are the cybernetic characters that players will control in Marathon. We’re seeing invisibility upgrades, energy shields, scanners, and many other augments. There are traversal and movement mechanics that keep things fluid, but it all depends on your Runner.</p>



<p>The team stressed that the gameplay loop will feature ‘costs’. No one Runner is without a weakness. For example, if one character can overdrive and move faster, they’ll overheat, and it will impact them in another way.</p>

<p>Bungie has revealed that Marathon, an ambitious first-person extraction shooter, will be released on September 23, with a closed alpha coming soon. This information was revealed today during a live showcase hosted by the game’s developers.</p>



<p>In case you’ve been left out of the loop, Marathon is an ambitious extraction shooter that has serious sci-fi vibes. It’s colourful, innovative, and exciting, and it has been described as accessible and more social than your average extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Read on to find out more about the Marathon release date.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-escape-will-make-me-god">Escape Will Make Me God</h2>



<p>Marathon stands out immediately from the opening trailer that revealed the game’s release date. The palette pops on the screen, and everything from the class systems to the in-game abilities are exciting and punchy.</p>



<p>Here’s the full reveal trailer:</p>

<p>An extraction shooter isn’t necessarily what we expected from Bungie, the team best known for Halo and Destiny, but we’re here for it. It’s a reimagination of one of the toughest genres in gaming, with the team having created a never-before-seen vibe that still retains that core gameplay loop that you’d expect from an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Marathon is effectively a reboot of a game that surfaced in 1994 – but it wasn’t an extraction shooter, of course. This is a total pivot that ‘does justice’ to the original title and ‘pays homage’ to the game’s creator.</p>



<p>This is a team-based extraction shooter that features cybernetic characters tactical of ‘tactical and fast-paced combat’. It will be released with several maps that players can explore at will, battling ‘worldly threats’, AI enemies, and other players. It’s all about looting, completing quests, and getting out again without succumbing.</p>
