            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to play a tower defense game but from the perspective of the ones doing the attacking? So did developer Progress_Check and publisher Tate Multimedia. Introducing Monolith: Rogue TD, an upcoming tower defense title that has you playing the role of the villain.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming can exclusively reveal Monolith: Rogue TD, its features, and the first trailer that gives players a look at the game’s art style, creatures, and environment. </p>

<li><strong>Pick Upgrades</strong>&nbsp;– Forge your own deck of upgrades from randomized pools. Enhance your towers, your core, and your potential for devastation.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Will Add 10 Years Worth Of Content]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-add-10-years-worth-of-content/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-will-add-10-years-worth-of-content.1330249/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you thought the hype for ARC Raiders couldn’t get any bigger, then you should know how much Embark Studios values its new extraction shooter. A 10-year plan is already drawn up for ARC Raiders, so if you buy the game, expect a lot of content to be fired your way.</p>



<p>It’s been a while since an extraction shooter had this much hype and attention. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-early-access-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is taking the spotlight from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape From Tarkov</a>, and the game’s build-up has featured the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/has-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-been-extended-playtest-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Slam Beta</a> and is crescendoing into a big-time release. We’re not sure about you, but if you had any doubts about the future of ARC Raiders, the company has issued a <em>very </em>long-term vision.</p>



<h2 id="h-embark-studios-thinks-arc-raiders-is-a-10-year-game">Embark Studios Thinks ARC Raiders Is A 10-Year Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Embark Studios design lead Virgil Watkins—and his team—were asked about what the future holds for ARC Raiders in a sit-down interview. We’re not sure where the original source comes from, but the video credit goes to <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersNews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@ARCRaidersNews</a> for now.</p>



<p>Watkins had this to say about post-launch content:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I think internally, for a very long time, we referred to this [ARC Raiders] as a 10-year game. That is the ambition we are aiming for and that dictates the type and quantity of content we want to put into it.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The design lead doesn’t elaborate on the exact nature of any content or a timeframe, as it can “spiral into promises that can go unfulfilled if things change.”</p>



<p>While we know that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-price-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders isn’t free-to-play and has a price</a>, it should be somewhat comforting to know that the money you part with will supposedly be repaid 3,650 times over.</p>



<div><article><p><span>ARC Raiders’ design director, Virgil, on the game’s post-launch future.</span></p></article></div>



<p>It’s very bold to proclaim a game will have a 10-year lifecycle of plans and content in this day and age. If ARC Raiders sees a huge drop-off in players within a couple of years, and it doesn’t financially make sense to develop content for a non-existent audience, then those 10-year plans are suddenly under threat.</p>



<p>Should Watkins have said this? Have you been impressed by ARC Raiders enough to think it can sustain itself for at least 10 years? Share your thoughts and more in the comments section and through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new list of games leaving PlayStation Plus in November has been revealed, and Battlefield 5 is one of them. </p>



<p>Like all other subscription services, PlayStation Plus is known for introducing a new collection of games to the library each month, with titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-game-catalog-new-games-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn, Silent Hill 2, Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-october-2025-alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>, and more being added in October. However, some games are removed from the library whenever new games are added, and PS Plus will lose out on seven games in November. </p>



<h2 id="h-7-games-are-leaving-playstation-plus-in-november">7 Games Are Leaving PlayStation Plus in November</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/these-7plus-games-will-be-axed-from-ps-plus-extra-in-november-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PushSquare</a>, the PlayStation Store’s ‘Last chance to play’ section has been updated with seven new games that will be leaving PlayStation Plus in November. The highlights of this collection are the previously mentioned Battlefield 5 and Like a Dragon: Ishin. The exact removal date hasn’t been revealed, but these games are expected to be available until November 18. Check out the complete list of games leaving PS Plus in November 2025 below: </p>



<ul>
<li>Battlefield 5 (PS4)</li>



<li>Like a Dragon: Ishin (PS4/PS5)</li>



<li>Digimon Survive (PS4)</li>



<li>Football Manager 2024 Console (PS5)</li>



<li>Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes (PS4)</li>



<li>Alternate Jake Hunter: Daedalys The Awakening of Golden Jazz (PS4)</li>



<li>Synapse (PSVR2)</li>
</ul>



<p>It seems that the release of Battlefield 6 has led to the removal of other Battlefield games from PS Plus. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-1-and-3-other-games-are-leaving-playstation-plus-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 1 </a>was removed this month, and BF5 will be removed next month. Similarly, the addition of Yakuza: Like a Dragon will be followed by removing Like a Dragon: Ishin next month. </p>



<p>In other news, Sony has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-injunction-to-bar-tencent-from-using-any-resemblance-to-horizons-aloy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a preliminary injunction</a> to bar Tencent from using any resemblance to Horizon’s Aloy. Will you play any of the seven games before they leave PlayStation Plus in November?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Palworld developers have confirmed that a new Halloween update will arrive on October 23, 2025; however, details of this update are scarce. </p>



<p>Pocketpair has a lot of content planned for Palworld fans in the coming days. A collaboration with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworlds-next-crossover-is-with-ultrakill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultrakill</a> was announced last month, and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-coming-to-once-human-in-crossover-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Once Human</a> update is set to arrive on October 30. Ahead of that, players can celebrate with some spooky fun through Palworld’s Halloween update, which arrives this week. </p>



<h2 id="h-palworld-s-halloween-2025-update-looks-like-it-s-more-than-just-cosmetics">Palworld’s Halloween 2025 Update Looks Like It’s More Than Just Cosmetics</h2>



<p>A post on Palworld’s official <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1980439049853710677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account confirms the Halloween 2025 update. The description of the upcoming update mentions Zoe being spotted “in a rather unusual new outfit,” but that isn’t the only strange thing. It seems some mysterious figures are roaming the Palpagos Islands, dressed in Depresso costumes. More details about this update will be revealed soon. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It seems that Palworld is taking it up a notch from their Halloween update in 2024. Last year’s update provided players with free cosmetics for their pals, including Halloween Cattiva, Spectacled Katress, Pirate Pengullet, and Halloween Croajiro. It looks like the developers are upping their game in 2025, adding some spooky elements to the game’s world to match the festivals’ vibe. Moreover, this comes after the developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-1-0-release-window-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that “things are going to be a little quiet from us for the rest of the year”, as they work on the 1.0 update. </p>



<p>In other news, a former Capcom designer recently stated that Palworld “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-crossed-a-line-says-former-capcom-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossed a line</a>” and players shouldn’t buy the game.

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy director has mentioned the possibility of a DLC or another ‘full title’ after part 3.</p>



<p>There’s still some time left before Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s Part 3 is revealed; however, we do know that development has been progressing well, with the game already having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-has-a-lot-of-playable-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘a lot’ of playable content</a>. Interestingly, the developers are already thinking about their plans after the release of part 3, which could entail a new expansion or a fourth game. </p>



<h2 id="h-there-s-a-possibility-of-a-fourth-game-for-the-final-fantasy-7-remake-series">There’s a Possibility of a Fourth Game for the Final Fantasy 7 Remake Series</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WccfTech</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi was asked whether they had any DLC plans for Rebirth. Hamaguchi stated that there were ideas at some point, but they “revisited this topic” and realised that their priority should be what fans want the most. The dev figured that “what fans want the most is to bring the third installment as soon as possible.” Which meant that the next game took priority over DLC. </p>



<p>However, Hamaguchi revealed that the story doesn’t end there, as “there is the possibility of having a DLC for that third installment” after its launch. Moreover, with that being the conclusion to Final Fantasy 7 Remake Trilogy, “there’s probably going to be a much wider audience for Final Fantasy as a whole”, says the director. Which is why the developers are “actively considering” whether to introduce “another DLC or a full title”. </p>



<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 9 Remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-might-be-on-ice-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be ‘on ice’</a>, according to a new claim.
