<p>Union employees at Bethesda have gone on strike across multiple locations in the United States.</p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/bethesda-strike-zenimax-xbox-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inverse</a>, “hundreds” of employees have walked off the job in both Maryland and Texas. It’s claimed that the strike is due to the company not addressing remote work concerns as well as the recent outsourcing of quality assurance. The latter being something the union never agreed to.</p>



<p>The report claims that the union is “looking to limit the percentage of quality assurance testers the company outsources in comparison to the number of full-time workers present in its bargaining unit”.</p>



<p>The union, which is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-game-studios-union-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest video games union</a> in the United States, is also looking for a more flexible remote work policy after employees are being denied remote work requests.</p>



<p>“They have continually given us their first proposal again and again, and it’s become obvious that our different mobilization tactics have not worked,” Bethesda Quality Assurance Test Lead Rhyanna Eichner told Inverse regarding the company’s negotiations with the union.</p>

<p>“Striking isn’t fun or ideal, but there’s a satisfaction in having a concrete physical action we can do to fight for better work conditions,” Senior Quality Assurance Tester Juniper Dowell told the outlet. “Hopefully, we can convince them to stop dragging their feet and meet us at the table.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft and Bethesda for comment on the strike. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>Valve has released an update for Steam that officially ends support for Windows 7 and 8 operating systems. </p>



<p>The update, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4472730495692571025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released on November 5</a> that includes the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steams-game-recording-feature-is-now-out-of-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ability to record games</a> within Steam, forces those who wish to continue to use Steam to either upgrade to Windows 10 or 11. Or, if you don’t want Windows at all, you can move to MacOS or Linux.</p>







<p>“This version of the Steam client will no longer run on Windows 7 or Windows 8,” the update reads. “Users on these OS versions will not automatically update to this new version of the Steam Client.”</p>



<p>In it’s FAQ page on the support ending, Valve says moving on from the old operating systems has to do with the security of its users.</p>



<p>“This change is required as core features in Steam rely on an embedded version of Google Chrome, which no longer functions on older versions of Windows,” Valve said. “In addition, future versions of Steam will require Windows feature and security updates only present in Windows 10 and above.”</p>



<p>They continued: “Computers running these operating systems, when connected to the internet, are susceptible to new malware and other exploits which will not be patched. That malware can cause your PC, Steam and games to perform poorly or crash. That malware can also be used to steal the credentials for your Steam account or other services.”</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that Steam will also no longer work on MacOS 10.13 or 10.14.</p>



<p>Are you one of the holdouts still using Windows 7 or 8? Will this finally get you to upgrade? Let us know down below.</p>
