<p>Oh God, it’s happening…. perhaps.</p>



<p>Recently, Shiina posted a roundup of the latest Fortnite news in a short YouTube video. One rumor suggested that a nostalgic duo from a live-action TV show could be coming to the game as early as next week.</p>



<p>Shiina said that if that is true, it could be The Office, as they had heard the collaboration within the works. Their tone made it clear this was not a lock. Whether Jim Halpert and Pam Beesley or Dwight Schrute and Michael Scott, The Office has no shortage of iconic duos that could be added to the game.</p>

<p>Fortnite recently announced a collaboration with South Park, which includes map exchanges, new skins, and limited-time Quint (5-Player) playlists. Over time, Fortnite has also partnered with The Simpsons, Adventure Time, WWE, and more.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming will continue to monitor the story and report whether or not The Office is officially coming to Fortnite, but as we all know, you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. Michael Scott said that Wayne Gretzky said that.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Two Months Later, Only 10,000 Escape from Tarkov Players Have Finished the Game]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-player-count-finished-game/</link>
            <guid>1406497</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Two months ago, Escape from Tarkov hit 1.0 and was officially released as a <strong>full game</strong>. It was the most monumental milestone in the studio’s history, and the game’s director called it the most significant moment of his life. The release of Tarkov 1.0 introduced the game’s ultimate ending, achievable after completing an all-new campaign.</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, and just <strong>10,489 players </strong>have managed to complete the game. It’s not known exactly how many people <strong>play </strong>Escape from Tarkov, but on Steam alone, you typically have around 25,000 concurrent players at peak times – and that’s the minority platform <strong>by far</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-people-have-completed-escape-from-tarkov">How Many People Have Completed Escape from Tarkov?</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, confirmed that, at the time of writing, 10,489 players had <strong>escaped from Tarkov</strong>. When Escape from Tarkov hit 1.0 in November, this became the ultimate goal for fans worldwide, but also emerged as one of the toughest challenges ever presented in the extraction shooter space.</p>



<p>To make it to the game’s ending, an entire campaign with some hefty quests must be completed, and players then need to contend with a final ‘gauntlet’ through a new map, Terminal. This is the final mission and arguably the toughest thing Tarkov players have ever faced.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">10489 players escaped fromTarkov so far. Beasts! 🫡</p>— Nikita Buyanov (@nikgeneburn) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/2011537504126845148?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>If that wasn’t enough, players need to escape from boarding a boat, but depending on their squad size, <strong>not everyone </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-ending-zubr-seats-changes-battlestate-games/">is guaranteed a spot</a> on said vessel. That means that, for one or two players, it’s a trip back to the lobby and a second go at the final gauntlet.</p>



<p>It took <strong>two weeks </strong>for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/">first player in the world</a>, <strong>Tigz</strong>, to successfully escape from Tarkov. He did this while streaming live, and the broadcast was tuned into by several Battlestate Games employees, including Buyanov himself.</p>



<p>Many players have followed in his footsteps, but 10,489 users represent a serious minority group in the assumed <strong>millions </strong>of Escape from Tarkov owners. In August 2025, Nikita gave fans a glimpse at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-player-count-how-many/">how many people were playing</a> Escape from Tarkov <strong>PvP </strong>on a random Sunday evening, and the number was around 45,000.</p>



<p>That doesn’t include PvE, which should equal another 30,000 – 40,000 (if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/">Nikita’s PvE player count</a> claims are accurate). That means almost 100,000 concurrent players were enjoying Tarkov on a Sunday evening, and extrapolation means that just 10% of those players would have completed the game, two months after the opportunity became available.</p>



<p>We can safely say very few Tarkov players have managed to accomplish the ultimate goal.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Legacy of Kain Creator Reveals New Game ‘Deadhaus Sonata’ 30 Years Later]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/legacy-of-kain-creator-reveals-deadhaus-sonata/</link>
            <guid>1406482</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In 1996, Denis Dyack created Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, a game that would go on to spawn another four titles over the next seven years. The series license was secured by Crystal Dynamics in the late nineties, pulling control away from Dyack, who would then go on to direct and produce Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem, Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes, and Too Human.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, Denis Dyack will be fully unveiling his new game, dubbed a spiritual successor to Legacy of Kain arriving 30 years later. It’s called Deadhaus Sonata, and it’s an action RPG being pieced together by Apocalypse Studios. On social media, the team shared a short trailer, and the title is available to wishlist and <strong>examine closer </strong>on Steam.</p>







<h2 id="h-deadhaus-sonata-the-dead-do-not-sleep-forever">Deadhaus Sonata – ‘The Dead Do Not Sleep Forever’</h2>



<p>The Deadhaus Sonata team published a short trailer for their upcoming narrative-driven RPG on social media, showcasing some of the gameplay mechanics. The account was established way back in 2018, so the game has been in development for quite some time.</p>



<p>Fans of a vampiric tale will be enthused by Deadhaus Sonata’s blurb:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The creator of Legacy of Kain is back. Become the undead in a third-person narrative-driven action RPG where your choices shape your legend and the world around you. Feed to grow stronger, embrace powerful classes, and carve your path alone or in co-op through a dark realm filled with secrets.<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142050/Deadhaus_Sonata/#app_reviews_hash"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s no release date yet for Deadhaus Sonata, but the game is being more fully unveiled tomorrow. What we do know is that it’ll be coming first to early access, allowing players to ‘become the undead’ and assume control of a powerful vampire with supernatural abilities.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The marketing spiel for Deadhaus Sonata is ambitious and promises a lot:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Deadhaus Sonata is a new dark fantasy world shaped by psychological depth, interconnected lore, and player-driven consequence. Every choice leaves a mark on your character and the world around you, with sentient gear, persistent events, and outcomes shaped by time, place, and action.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the game can be wishlisted on Steam <strong>now</strong>, the title’s website stresses that it’ll be available on ‘all major platforms.’</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#949)—Clues and Answers for Thursday, January 15]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-15-949/</link>
            <guid>1406452</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>How’s 2026 going for you? I’m hoping you’ve at least kept up your NYT Connections streak – I know I have! If you’re looking for a quick way to solve today’s NYT Connections puzzle, look no further than this snapshot guide. I’ve got your NYT Connections hints and answers right here, ready to digest.</p>



<p>Read on to wrap today’s NYT Connections challenge and move on with your day!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-15">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 15)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #949:</p>



<ul>
<li>CEREAL</li>



<li>STATIC</li>



<li>MELTED</li>



<li>SNOW</li>



<li>LEVITATE</li>



<li>SALT</li>



<li>PATRON</li>



<li>SHOVEL</li>



<li>HOSE</li>



<li>STATIONARY</li>



<li>SPADE</li>



<li>JACKAL</li>



<li>FROZEN</li>



<li>RAKE</li>



<li>DANDRUFF</li>



<li>STILL</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These are all things you’d grab from a shed when working in the yard.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These all describe something that isn’t changing position or activity.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Each of these can appear as tiny, thin pieces that fall, sprinkle, or scatter.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word hides two common male first names back-to-back (sometimes overlapping slightly in sound or letters).</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 15:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-15-949">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 15 (#949)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– HOSE, RAKE, SHOVEL, SPADE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – FROZEN, STATIC, STATIONARY, STILL</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CEREAL, DANDRUFF, SALT, SNOW</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – JACKAL, LEVITATE, MELTED, PATRON</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
