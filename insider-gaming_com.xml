<p>Fortner servers are down ahead of the launch of Chapter 7, following the huge end-of-chapter event that marked an end to the previous chapter.</p>



<p>The Zero Point live event was stacked with collabs, including the likes of Godzilla, Hatsune Miku, and Homer Simpson, and servers immediately went offline after the conclusion of the event in preparation for Chapter 7’s launch.</p>



<p>Taking the Fortnite servers down immediately was an unexpected move by many, considering the usual start time of downtime for new content is at 2 AM ET, but Epic Games announced the downtime in advance of the event to give players a heads up.</p>

<p>Posting on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1994771674793996483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a> ahead of the event, Epic Games stated that downtime would commence immediately after the event’s conclusion, and in-game, a precise countdown was shared.</p>



<p>Fittingly for Chapter 7, downtime will last four seven hours, and there is a live countdown available in-game. That downtime is a similar length to what was witnessed prior to the launch of Chapter 6, though there could still be server issues when the season commences.</p>



<p>A host of players complained on social media of being disconnected during the live event, which had over 10 million active players watching the action, and server instability may be present when Chapter 7 first kicks off.</p>



<p>It will be late in the evening in the United States, however, and the middle of the night for Europe, which may reduce the flood of players heading into the game immediately when servers return.</p>



<p>During downtime, several prominent content creators will be publishing footage from an early access Chapter 7 launch event, similar to what was seen ahead of The Simpsons mini-season.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Linus Tech Tips Thinks the Steam Machine Price Will be Around $700]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-machine-price-analysis/</link>
            <guid>1368124</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new video posted to their YouTube channel, Linus Tech Tips has broken down the cost of the hardware that will be added to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-machine-everything-to-know-about-valves-new-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a> to get a sense of how much the console be priced. Spoiler alert… It’s likely to be much more than people thought online.</p>



<p>According to Linus Tech Tips, the parts at their historical low price will cost around $602, but that number has increased significantly in recent months by a whopping 50%, bringing the price to around $900.</p>



<p>As Linus Tech Tips rightfully pointed out, though, these prices are for name brands, and they think the cost can be reduced to around $813 at retail. However, Valve does have a direct-to-consumer model, meaning that it doesn’t need the traditional retailer margins of around 10%.</p>



<p>The question is then, how much profit does Valve want per console? Traditionally, console manufacturers have subsidised or even taken a loss on their consoles, while subscription models and software are their profit centres. </p>



<h2 id="h-steam-machine-will-cost-700">Steam Machine Will Cost $700?</h2>



<p>The conclusions led Linus Tech Tips to believe that the Steam Machine will cost approximately $699, if the hardware prices remain at the prices they do today. Linus Tech Tips then went on to say $800 at most if the hardware market continues to climb at the unprecedented rate it has been going. That could be a hard sell when the <a href="https://amzn.to/48iMmlb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5 is only $399</a> at the moment.</p>



<p>And remember… This is for a model with a 500GB SSD… Not 1TB / 2TB.</p>



<p>You can watch Linus Tech Tips’ full analysis and breakdown below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Personally, though, I think that the Steam Machine might be a little pricier. I would think that $799-849 would be the 512GB version, with a 2TB costing $999. But then and again, maybe I am just a little loopy when it comes to pricing. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[MOZA AB6 Flight Simulator Review—A New Level of Immersion]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ab6-flight-review/</link>
            <guid>1368100</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been around 4 weeks since I unboxed and started playing with the AB6 flight simulator bundle from MOZA, and it’s a true step up in terms of quality and immersion from what I’ve been using previously. For complete transparency, I am not a tried-and-tested flight simulator enthusiast with years of experience; in fact, I only got into flight simulators in the past 12 months thanks to my 9-year-old son, who is obsessed with planes. So naturally, as an adult who loves his toys… I couldn’t just let him have all the fun.</p>



<p>Nearly $1500 later, and we finally have a decent flight simulator setup, but when MOZA contacted me to try out their new AB6 flight, I jumped at the chance.</p>



<p>MOZA has been in both the flight and racing simulator scenes for several years, and their AB9 flight stick was very well received in the flight simulator community. With the AB6, they’ve opted for a more affordable offering at $399. For those not in the flight simulator community, it’s a price tag that might seem steep, but compared to other products on the market that offer similar features, it really is a good deal.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-fully-immersive-product">A Fully-Immersive Product</h2>



<p>One of the key highlights of the MOZA AB6 is a force-feedback flight base that delivers up to 6 Nm of peak torque—roughly half the output of the AB9. While on paper that is a huge difference, the competitive price and inclusion of the flight stick as a part of the bundle (which does not apply to the AB9), it is a good compromise. Remember that the AB6 is aimed at getting people into the hobby at a competitive price, rather than pricing them out.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What I will say is that the force feedback completely changed the immersion for both my son and me, and I don’t think either of us wants to go back to what we were using. In fact, I would recommend anything to get into the hobby with force feedback at the start, rather than wasting money further on down the line.</p>







<p>One of the things I was massively unaware of with the AB6 is that you can also change it into a shifter if you’re also into race simulation. So, if you’re like me and are sick of changing parts around, the MOZA AB6 makes it relatively easy to change a few settings and swap out the flightstick for a shifter and go from in the air to on the ground.</p>

<h2 id="h-ab6-overall-thoughts">AB6 Overall Thoughts</h2>



<p>Again, I am not a fully-fledged flight simulator enthusiast, but if you’re like me with a year or so in the cockpit, I couldn’t recommend the AB6 by MOZA enough. The production quality and immersion that the AB6 brings you is such a massive step up from the more common flight simulator products that most people start off with, that I do think it’s worth spending an additional $100 or so to get the full bang for your buck on what the hobby can offer.</p>



<p>You can check out MOZA’s AB6 and other products over on their <a href="https://amzn.to/4onOdK8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amazon page here</a>.</p>
