<p>If you’ve been anywhere on the internet in the last few months, the chances are you’ll have seen a guy dressed as Miles Morales pretending to be an NPC on stream. He’s one of the few still holding up the gimmick – or at least he was, until now.</p>



<p>The ‘NPC trend’ went wild on sites like TikTok a while back, and ‘NPC Miles Morales’ was by far the most prolific creator to do it. He’d go on stream for hours on end, performing Miles Morales’s (Spider-Man) voice lines and ‘animations’ in exchange for gifts and donations.</p>



<p>He’s announced that he’s giving it up after all these months and pursuing a traditional streaming career.</p>

<h2 id="h-with-great-power">With Great Power…</h2>



<p>NPC Miles Morales – whose real name is Malik Ambersley – has performed his role since midway through 2023, and over time, he has become increasingly popular and controversial. While streaming, he has been robbed, accosted by police, and gotten into fights, all the while performing a character that he rarely breaks from.</p>



<p>The bit has earned him a substantial amount of money, but to be honest, he has put in the work. What he does is physically demanding and requires a great deal of confidence – and his escapades eventually earned him an iconic spot in Kai Cenat’s recent Mafia 2 subathon.</p>



<p>Now that Ambersley has paired up with Cenat, he has become bigger than ever, and in a recent stream, he revealed that he’s hanging up the Miles Morales costume to pursue traditional activities, such as the ‘IRL streams’ that Kai Cenat is famous for.</p>



<p>He said he’d ‘rather be known for being himself’.</p>



<p>Have you ever caught NPC Miles Morales on stream? Let us know what you think about the character on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>IllFonic, the developers behind Friday the 13th: The Game and Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game, have announced that its the latest studio to hold layoffs in 2024.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/IllFonic/status/1864369606988632330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, CEO and co-founder Charles Brungardt said that the layoffs are an acceptance of the “harsh reality” within the games industry.</p>



<p>“Today we had to accept the harsh reality that the state of the industry has impacted us here at IllFonic,” he said. “It is with the heaviest of hearts that cuts to our teams had to be made today as we re-aligned to a refined strategy.”</p>







<p>In addition to developing its own games, Illfonic has provided support development for games like Crysis 3 and Star Citizen. Coincidentally enough, the latter’s developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloud-imperium-games-layoffs-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud Imperium Games recently held</a> its own layoffs.</p>



<p>There was no specific mention of how many people have been let go. According to <a href="https://leadiq.com/c/illfonic/5a1da50f2300005a0097c01e#:~:text=As%20of%20October%202024%2C%20IllFonic,including%20North%20AmericaEuropeAsia." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LeadIQ</a>, Illfonic employed 96 people as of October 2024.</p>



<p>To close his statement, Brungardt requested that those with openings reach out to him in order to help place those who have lost their jobs.</p>



<p>The gaming industry has seen&nbsp;<a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 14,600 confirmed jobs</a>&nbsp;lost across 170+ companies in 2024. Based on Insider Gaming sources, the real number — including unannounced layoffs — totals over 16,000.</p>
