<p>The Woojer Vest 3 is here and I was fortunate enough to take one for a spin around the block. Not entirely impressed with the concept of a ‘haptic feedback vest’, I was willing to give one a try and see if I could be converted by this luxurious technology.</p>



<p>It might be extremely expensive and rather cumbersome-looking at first blush, but the Woojer Vest 3 is a remarkable piece of technology that allows you to <strong>feel </strong>the games you play – and the media you consume – like never before. Is it a bit too fancy to win over the average gamer, though?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-high-price-heavy-vest">High Price, Heavy Vest</h2>



<p>You’d be surprised to learn that the Woojer Vest 3 will run you up a bill of almost $500 if you choose to invest. This next-generation haptic vest screams high-quality production value, but it’s an eye-watering sum to part ways with for ‘an experiment’, so I’m thankful to Woojer for providing me with a review sample.</p>



<p>From the moment I pulled apart the box, I knew that I was in for a treat. The Woojer Vest 3 screams ‘premium accessory’, from the packaging to the parts, and the materials used to construct the vest to the companion app. I’ll admit I had some teething issues getting the app paired with the vest, but they were my fault and Woojer was instrumental in getting me online as soon as possible.</p>



<p>Wearing the Woojer feels weird at first. It’s not a light thing, nor is it too slimline, and you’ll <strong>absolutely </strong>notice that you’ve got it on. The Woojer Vest 3 is almost built to be paired with a Meta Quest headset for the ultimate sense of gaming immersion, and that’s the feeling I got when I used it – but I also came away <strong>sweating</strong> after a moderate session.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most adjustable things I’ve ever worn, and as a bigger gamer, I was pleased to see the Woojer Vest 3 accommodated my frame. It’s marketed as ‘one size fits most’, so I shouldn’t have been surprised.</p>



<p>It didn’t take long to get to grips with it, and I was able to try it out across a range of functions, pairing it with audio sources for music, my Meta Quest 3 headset, and my gaming PC. On every occasion, I came away pleased with what the Woojer Vest 3 had shown me.</p>



<h2 id="h-but-what-does-the-woojer-vest-3-do">But What Does The Woojer Vest 3 Do?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>As it says on the tin, the Woojer Vest 3 is a haptic feedback device. That means it allows you to feel your game, music, or movie by providing tangible feedback across a range of ‘transducers’ when they detect an appropriate input.</p>



<p>It relies on an audio level and range, so the deeper and louder a sound, the more impact you’ll feel through the transducers located on your chest, back, and abdomen. Admittedly, I thought it would be super accurate, and that firing a rifle would allow me to feel a punch in my shoulder, but it’s not <strong>that </strong>specific.</p>



<p>I charged around on Black Ops 6 while wearing the Woojer Vest 3, though – and it was a blast. On Nuketown, the cacophony of explosions, gunfire, and other sound effects made for a unique sensation across my body. For a laugh, I cranked the feedback volume to the maximum level and the vest drilled me and left my skin buzzing.</p>



<p>It’s a versatile device that works with basically any input, but it can be a little fiddly when it comes to using cables. For instance, I had to run a cable from my PC into the vest, and then I plugged a wired headset into the vest’s control panel to accommodate an audio passthrough – but there are less cumbersome ways to make it work.</p>



<p>In terms of technical specs, the Woojer Vest 3 is equipped with six newly designed oscillators that offer ‘360-degree perceptual inference’. It can be tweaked with a handy app, and it supports Bluetooth and a range of wired inputs (USB-C, 3.5mm, etc). One charge can last up to eight hours, and it uses a unique charging solution to ramp that battery level up as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the Woojer Vest 3 is an innovative and intriguing device, but as it’s both drastically expensive and quite a chore to wear, I’ll be honest and say it doesn’t have much of a place in the market at the moment. It’s too niche a piece of technology for the average gamer to buy, and even enthusiasts might find it a bit gimmicky.</p>



<p>It felt great wearing it for a while and the reliability of the haptics blew my mind when I first tried it out, but taking it on and off for each session became tiresome, and in the summertime, I could see the Woojer Vest 3 being stuffed in a cupboard out of fear of overheating. </p>



<p>If you’ve got $500 burning a hole in your pocket and want to try something new, then maybe invest. Otherwise, keep a hold on your money.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-sales-better-ps4-pro/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-selling-better-than-ps4-pro-in-%E2%80%98the-same-period%E2%80%99-sony-says.1031913/</guid>

<p>Sony’s CFO, Hiroki Totoki, has gone on record suggesting that the PlayStation 5 Pro is selling just fine per the company’s expectations. In a recent statement, the CFO (also the firm’s COO) said that the PS5 Pro is ‘performing slightly stronger’ than the PS4 Pro did in the same period – in 2016.</p>



<p>He was frank in noting that Sony didn’t expect ‘large sales’ going into the manufacture of the console</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-under-the-impression">‘Under the Impression’</h2>



<p>In a recent statement grabbed <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Media-Entertainment/Sony-raises-revenue-forecast-on-strong-game-and-music-results" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Nikkei Asia</a>, Hiroki Totoki explained how things were looking for the PS5 Pro, which was released on November 7:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is a high-end product targeted at core customers, so we haven’t been eyeing a large sales plan to begin with.</p>



<p>I’m under the impression that the product is performing slightly stronger than the pre-orders of the PS4 Pro during the same period, so I don’t think it is adversely affecting the product’s sales plan.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Critics were quick to point out how strange it sounds that the CFO is merely ‘under the impression’ that the console is selling well, but let’s ignore that for now.</p>



<p>Ahead of the release of the PS5 Pro, a few issues surfaced that many believed would hamper sales of the console. Firstly, the price point – at $699.99, the PS5 Pro is one of the most expensive consoles released in <strong>a very long time</strong>, but that doesn’t appear to have been a problem. </p>



<p>Also, users were concerned that the console wouldn’t make ‘enough of a difference’ to warrant the upgrade. It’s technically impressive, but many will be reluctant to purchase something new just to tease a few extra frames or a little more clarity out of their console. </p>



<p>Regardless, financial projections at Sony are on the up, and if Totoki’s statement is anything to go by, so are sales of the PS5 Pro. How many of those sales have been claimed by scalpers, though? At least there’s now so much stock available in some markets that they’re being forced to sell them at a loss…</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is an ambitious remake of the legendary stealth action title released on PlayStation 2 in 2004. It has been in development at Konami for some time, and amidst ongoing content drops including screenshots and teaser trailers, it was revealed that it’ll be released in full in 2025.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, MGS’ series producer, Noriaki Okamura, revealed one of the driving reasons why Konami resolved to remake one of the most iconic games in the series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-was-basically-our-duty">‘It Was Basically Our Duty’</h2>



<p>In the most recent iteration of Play magazine (and circulated <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-delta-exists-because-konami-was-starting-to-get-worried-that-the-younger-generation-of-gamers-arent-familiar-with-the-metal-gear-series-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by GamesRadar</a>), Noriaki Okamura sat down to talk about all things Metal Gear Solid. He revealed one of the core reasons why Konami decided to remake Metal Gear Solid 3 more than 20 years after it was first released:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the things that really sparked us to do the remake in general is because we realised that a lot of the newer, younger generation of gamers aren’t familiar with the Metal Gear series anymore.</p>



<p>It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations. After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say—but again, who is Solid Snake?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the 2000s, Metal Gear Solid 3 became one of my most beloved games, and I looped the story time and again. It felt so ahead of its time, boasting an immersive, lengthy story, an open-ended operating system, and unique camouflage, healing, and survival mechanics.</p>



<p>All that will be present in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but everything has been improved upon immensely for this ambitious remake.</p>



<p>Okamura raises a good point, though. The first Metal Gear game was in 1987, and the <strong>last </strong>major release in the series was in 2015 with Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. That’s about the time that Konami and Hideo Kojima, the creator of the series, fell out of one another’s good graces.</p>



<p>The team at Konami tried to release a survival horror MGS game called MG Survive in 2018, but it was am monumental flop.</p>



<p>It has been <strong>ten years </strong>since the last Metal Gear Solid game, and there being so much that came before means it’s daunting to a newcomer who just wants to get involved and see what the fuss is all about. Where do you even begin with a franchise this expansive? There are almost 40 years of history wrapped up in Metal Gear Solid.</p>



<p>Let’s hope that the Snake Eater remake isn’t the end of it.</p>
