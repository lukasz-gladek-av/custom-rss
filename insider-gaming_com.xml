            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-plans-starfield-not-saying-anything/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda-has-%E2%80%98exciting-things-planned%E2%80%99-for-starfield-this-year-but-remains-silent.1127427/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-plans-starfield-not-saying-anything/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It seems like a lifetime since Starfield was released, but it wasn’t even two years ago that Bethesda Game Studios’ space-based RPG epic hit the market. For many, the game came and went without too much of an impact, and for others, it was the title of a lifetime, positively bursting at the seams with untold potential.</p>



<p>I’m probably in the former camp there.</p>



<p>Recently, the team posted on social media, expressing an appreciation for the patience of fans worldwide and stressing that there are exciting things in store for Starfield this year, but the squad is remaining tight-lipped for now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-next-starfield-dlc-anyone">Next Starfield DLC, Anyone?</h2>



<p>In September, a year after Starfield was released, Bethesda published Shattered Space, the first (and so far, only) major expansion for the game. It wasn’t an overwhelming thing and it left some players feeling short-changed, but at least it was an evolution on the game that has kind of run stagnant over the last eighteen months or so.</p>



<p>The game that took 20 years to emerge fully seemed to run out of steam very early on, which wasn’t good.</p>



<p>If we look at some representative examples of how the world is treating Starfield, we can see that things aren’t looking too positive. On Twitch, the game peaked at 552,021 viewers when it was released, but as I write this, just 40 people are watching Starfield gameplay.</p>



<p>By contrast, Fallout 4 has 648 viewers, which isn’t much better, but that game is <strong>a decade old</strong>.</p>



<p>On Steam, Starfield’s player count has dropped by 99% since its release. Talking of Fallout 4, the post-apocalyptic RPG’s player count on the PC platform more than tripled Starfield’s count at the time of writing.</p>







<p>That’s part and parcel of the lifecycle of a single-player game, though – so I won’t be too harsh on Starfield for not bucking the trend.</p>



<p>Bethesda planned to release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-wants-annual-starfield-expansions/">one major expansion</a> for Starfield every year, and given the track record for how early we heard about Shattered Space, we <strong>should </strong>have something on the board for the next expansion, but never mind. It has been almost six months since Shattered Space dropped, and we’re none the wiser.</p>



<p>But fear not! On <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1897709518013997493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the team at Bethesda Game Studios assured fans that all is well and that there’s something in the pipeline:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We know you’re eager for an update, and we truly appreciate your passion for Starfield. The team has been hard at work, and while we’re not ready to share specific details just yet, we have a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can’t wait to talk about when the time is right. </p>



<p>We’re always listening and taking your feedback to heart. Thanks for being part of this journey with us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Let’s bear in mind that the folks at Bethesda haven’t given us a solid update on The Elder Scrolls 6 in almost a decade, so there’s that.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Starfield? Let me know in the comments what you’re up to out there in the vast expanse of space.</p>

<p>Nacon held its Nacon Connect 2025 event on Thursday, and with it came the reveal of a new sequel to RoboCop: Rogue City called RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business.</p>



<p>Releasing this summer, RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business is a “stand-alone follow-up” to 2023’s game that will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>“The OmniTower is their fortress, violence is their language. Face off against elite mercenaries all the way to the top of the tower and uphold the law amidst chaos!,” the game’s description reads.</p>



<p>It continues: “When a group of highly trained mercenaries armed with cutting-edge weapons takes control of the building and turns it into their deadly fortress, RoboCop must take action and put a stop to their plans to undermine law and order.”</p>



<p>Nacon says that players will have new threats in the OmniTower with every floor being “riddled with deadly traps, and heavily armed elite troops.”</p>



<p>“Expect to face minigun-toting armoured squads, special forces equipped with jet packs or even katana-wielding foes who look more machine than man,” the publisher said.</p>



<p>Additional details including features, system specs, release date and more will be revealed in the coming weeks and months.</p>



<p>Check out the reveal trailer for the RoboCop: Rogue City sequel  yourself. And let us know what you think down below or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
