<p>Cygames has announced in a new statement that it will not implement GenAI in its products without prior notice and has apologised to the community. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Cygames announced that it will establish an AI studio, which is a subsidiary to develop and provide AI-based services and tools. The AI studio would participate in the research and development of its own models to offer services and tools for production sites. The studio has now backtracked on this, stating that GenAI will not be used to produce art for their products. </p>







<h2 id="h-cygames-releases-new-statement-on-ai-studio">Cygames Releases New Statement on AI Studio</h2>



<p>In a new statement on their official <a href="https://x.com/Cygames_PR/status/2011423096465682934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), Cygames has addressed the blowback they have received from the community since announcing their AI studio. The statement confirms that the “art produced from generative AI isn’t used in their products and will not be implemented “without prior notice.” The company added that it holds people who love games and the “dignity, passion, and heart of creators and artists” in the highest regard. </p>



<p>The company also stated that the art for all the current Cyfames and other products has been created by the “technical know-how and manual work” of their staff members. Cygames has apologized for the grief and anxiety it caused to the community and has pledged to “honor creators, as well as champion the free expression of people.”</p>







<p>In other news, NVIDIA’s CEO has stated that the constant negativity surrounding the AI industry is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-ceo-says-ai-doomer-narrative-is-hurtful/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extremely hurtful</a>”. Additionally, Nintendo has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/my-mario-marketing-did-not-use-ai-images-nintendo-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied claims</a> that generative AI was used in promotional images for its new “My Mario” toy line.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/imperialhal-controller-ban-algs-championship/</link>
            <guid>1405708</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Apex Legends Global Series 2026 Championship is set to take place tomorrow in Sapporo, Japan. Today, one of the game’s most prolific pro players, ImperialHal, revealed that his first-choice controller was <strong>banned </strong>and won’t be usable in the event. For a pro player, that’s one of the most critical changes to make at the last minute.</p>



<p>ImperialHal, who flies the Team Falcons banner, posted on social media that it has ‘got to be a joke, surely.’</p>







<h2 id="h-imperialhal-s-zd-ultimate-controller-is-banned">ImperialHal’s ZD Ultimate Controller is Banned</h2>



<p>The ALGS regulators have decided to <strong>ban </strong>ImperialHal’s chief controller, the ZD Ultimate, just one day before the ALGS Championship tournament takes place in Japan.</p>



<p>The ZD Ultimate is a lesser-known controller that boasts stacks of bonus features, including tri-connectivity, ultra-low latency, trigger switches, back paddles, extra buttons, and an RGB light strip. It currently costs $99.99 from the manufacturer.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, ImperialHal explained why it’s banned:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Because it has wireless capabilities that can be changed at any point via mobile and macro stuff that can’t be disabled.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also pointed out that during the Esports World Cup, ‘multiple players’ used controllers with similar functions, and they weren’t banned.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>My controller gets banned the day before 2 million Dollar tournament 😂😂😂</p><p>Gotta be a joke surely</p></div>— Falcons ImperialHal (@ImperialHal) <a href="https://twitter.com/ImperialHal/status/2011411052261699976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>ImperialHal has been competing in the Apex Legends space since 2019, making a name for himself while flying the TSM flag, but in 2024, he picked up a spot on Team Falcons’ developing roster. In 2023, he secured the top spot at the ALGS Championship, and a year later, hit a second-place finish at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>Last year produced a third-place finish at the ALGS Championship, so this is something of a redemption opportunity for the 26-year-old esports pro.</p>







<p>Do you think it’s right that the organizers banned ImperialHal’s controller so close to the start of the tournament? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>The Creator Codes scheme is a way for communities to give back to their favorite streamers while simultaneously supporting a new release. Hytale also has a Creator Codes program, and this guide lists various creators and their codes.</p>



<p>Certain individuals are recognized as a creator for a game. This associates that personality with said title, and fans of the game and creator can support both. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-pvp-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a> features the Creator Code, and you can scroll down for information on creators, codes, and how to redeem them.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot Games Congratulates Hytale Launch Six Months After Canceling It]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/riot-congratulates-hytale-six-months-after-canceling/</link>
            <guid>1405666</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In June 2025, Riot Games canceled Hytale and <strong>closed down </strong>Hypixel Studios, marking the end of the dreams of Minecraft fans worldwide. Hytale, the chief Hypixel project, had been in development for <strong>ten years</strong>, but it was cited as being ‘overly ambitious’ and failed to hit quality expectations, and was wiped from the slate by Riot Games.</p>



<p>Four months later, in November, Simon Collins-Laflamme, the founder of Hypixel, acquired the Hytale IP from Riot Games and brought back to the grind to make the game a reality.</p>



<p>Hytale entered early access <strong>yesterday</strong>, and Riot Games was quick to praise the game’s launch in a move that some have dubbed ‘ironic at best.’</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-skyrockets-despite-earlier-cancelation">Hytale Skyrockets Despite Earlier Cancelation</h2>



<p>Hytale was never supposed to see the light of day after it was <strong>canceled </strong>by Riot Games a little over six months ago. The game was deemed past the point of saving, and Riot shut the project down after suggesting it was unsustainable and too costly to push on with.</p>



<p>Yesterday, that all changed as Hytale hit the early access launch window many believed would never come.</p>



<p>Hytale skyrocketed up the charts, hitting a peak viewer count on Twitch of 440,000 users, numbers comparable to the launch of an AAA game. It’s not without its flaws, but it’s already being appreciated by those who spent years following the game’s development.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Riot Games, which decimated Hytale mere months ago, congratulated the early access launch:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Congrats on early access 👊</span></p></article></div>







<p>In response, the Hytale team commented: ‘Thank you for helping bring Hytale home.’</p>



<p>But fans were quick to criticize the situation:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘This is like thanking your captor for beating you up.’</li>



<li>‘Hytale exists in spite of Riot, not because of them.’</li>



<li>‘Genuinely, how did they help lmao’</li>
</ul>



<p>Perhaps Riot Games is kicking itself for canceling what is now being regarded as one of the biggest indie releases of the last few years.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re playing (and enjoying) Hytale.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Shoot A Plane monthly redeem codes to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash and much more.</p>



<p>Shoot A Plane is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-forge-codes/">Roblox</a> survival experience that assigns players to either hit flying targets or miss their chance at victory. The player must eliminate the planes to win, while the planes must escape your missile launcher to survive. The game also features multiple upgrades for your missile and launcher, however, to use them, you must purchase them with Cash.</p>



<p>The Roblox game is all about growing your missile to increase your Power, improving your targeting accuracy, getting Upgrades, and boosting your score. Generally, to become the best, you’ll not only need the finest missile launcher but also a way to progress without spending hours. That’s when you should redeem the active Shoot A Plane codes, as they can be redeemed for Cash, which is essential for upgrading your equipment and taking down bigger planes.</p>

<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-shoot-a-plane-codes">Where To Get More Shoot A Plane Codes</h2>



<p>Shoot A Plane codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Shoot A Plane Discord server, which has a dedicated channel where new codes are posted first, and the Crazy Launchers Roblox Group where developers announce updates and milestones for this popular missile-launching game.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around game milestones but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>



<p>This page is refreshed as soon as fresh codes go live, and any codes that have expired are taken out quickly so you always see only the ones that still work.</p>
