            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Co-op gaming isn’t, has never been, and will never die. Local co-op, especially, isn’t going anywhere, and many developers and publishers, thankfully, know what people want. LEGO is about as notable as any leader in the genre, and its new co-op adventure—LEGO Voyagers—seems to get everything right. Walk with me as I explain all in my Gamescom 2025 LEGO Voyagers preview.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-is-getting-the-skywalker-saga-treatment-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Star Wars</a>: The Video Game was a landmark moment in gaming: Super-popular licenses working hand-in-hand with one another. The ability to relive famous Star Wars moments with another player was the tip of the lightsaber. It spawned annual <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO</a> games (sometimes multiple releases a year) and gave friends, couples, and families the chance to enjoy cooperative play.</p>



<p>In LEGO Voyagers, you and a <em>human </em>friend need to learn every trick (and brick) in the book to overcome obstacles, move forward, and rescue a spaceship. I walked away from my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-2025-awards-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025</a> demo with a big compliment to the game—Hazelight Studios would likely be proud of this.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-stud-in-its-own-right">A Stud in Its Own Right</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/games/lego-voyagers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Voyagers</a> is a mandatory two-player game with a Friends Pass system, similar to Split Fiction, It Takes Two, and A Way Out. This means you only need to buy one copy of the game, and two players can join forces. There’s no AI or computer-controlled co-op cohort here.</p>



<p>I had the privilege of teaming up with Light Build Studios’ creative director, Karsten Lund, and got to hear his insight into the game as he led me every step of the way. The control scheme is simple enough, as one button lets you jump, and the action button attaches your character to most creations in the environment.</p>



<p>You’ll cling to planks to form a bridge, attach to fallen lights and structures to cross gaps, and even form a literal attachment with your partner as you become a giant poking device you’d only find in Olympic Pole Vault competitions to reach new heights. The handful of platforming sections I conquered won’t have you consulting help manuals or scouring YouTube for walkthroughs, but there’s just enough there to have you thinking. Voyagers could be a great learning tool for young ones.</p>



<p>Lund assured me that some of the game’s later challenges will ramp up the difficulty, though. Making this a co-op game for both young and old to enjoy—more than likely together. You also can’t help but admire how cute the game is. Our muted LEGO bricks are aesthetically endearing and are likely to be a merchandising masterstroke if the game sells—which I think it will.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-voyagers-steps-into-the-hazelight">LEGO Voyagers Steps Into The Hazelight</h2>



<p>I’m desperate to avoid the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hazelight-is-already-working-on-its-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios</a> comparison. The Josef Fares-founded company is seen as a modern-day pioneer of co-op-only gameplay. Creating intertwining adventures where two players must work together to prevail in the face of adversity and swat away negativity in search of the ultimate cathartic conclusion.</p>



<p>LEGO Voyagers gameplay has a similar vibe, and it’s hard to ignore. On the plus side, is this a bad thing? I don’t think so. I adore what Hazelight is doing, and the roughly 30-40 million copies sold across the studio’s first three games are symptomatic of a public that feels the same way.</p>



<p>I love to play co-op games with my fiancé. Always have done. LEGO Voyagers appeals to a wide-ranging demographic and is extremely accessible. From what I played, I don’t think LEGO Voyagers is going to break new ground, but it doesn’t need to, as it’s LEGO, it’s charming, pleasing on the eye, and a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Make your way to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to share your thoughts on co-op gaming. Do we need more efforts like we’re seeing from Hazelight and Annapurna/Light Brick Studio? Also, let me know what you thought of my LEGO Voyagers preview.</p>

<p>You can seemingly play Doom on any device with a screen. A modder named Aaron Christophel has managed to get the 1993 classic running on a portable Anker Prime charging station.</p>



<p>The charging station features a Synwit SWM34S SoC(system on a chip) with 8MB SDRam and 16MB of external flash memory. These specs allow Doom to be played on the built-in 200×480 LCD screen.</p>



<p>The controls are also pretty straight forward <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdOU8SqCqeY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for what Christophel</a> had to work with. You can move forward and backward by turning the dial; pushing the dial in and turning rotates you left and right; pushing the dial in without turning allows you to fire and open doors.</p>



<p>Christophel says that it was done without making any modifications to the internal hardware of the device. He was able to get it running using the debugging header connected to another device. </p>



<p>It may not be the most convenient way to play Doom, but the fact that you can is impressive in and of itself. Who knows, maybe this will also <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">become an Xbox</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-gets-new-trailer-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terrifying new trailer at Gamescom</a> has ignited additional excitement ahead of release, and gamers around the world don’t have too much longer to wait until enjoying the apocalyptic adventure can begin.</p>

<p>The release date is locked in and is rapidly approaching, so there shouldn’t be any delays, and it won’t be long until your survival adventure begins.</p>

<p>Rumors are circling regarding the next Nintendo Direct event. According to multiple reports, Nintendo is planning to hold its next direct showcase sometime in September.</p>



<p>According to SwitchForce, who has been accurate with Nintendo information in the past, the next direct appears to be planned for September 12.</p>



<p>“Nintendo tried to phone in an emergency about the missing Switch 2 games, but they accidentally dialed 912,” <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1959828809559249019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said</a>.</p>



<p>It’s not just SwitchForce claiming a direct is coming. While not confirming the date, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-planned-for-mid-september" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> did say that its own sources tell them that a mid-September Nintendo Direct is planned.</p>



<p>As far as what this upcoming direct would cover, that’s currently unknown. There has been speculation that it will focus on Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, especially with it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-receives-esrb-rating-ahead-of-launch/">recently receiving an ESRB rating</a>. The game is also scheduled to release sometime this year, and with only four months left in the year, signs point to it being time to give fans a deeper dive into the game.</p>

<p>Borderlands 4’s release date is screeching into sight and is set to be one of the biggest releases in 2025, and we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview of Borderlands 4</a> at Gamescom raised our excitement levels for the title, which comes a whopping six years after the previous entry in the series landed, and there’s plenty to take in, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-will-feature-30-billion-guns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30 billion guns featured</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to lock in for release, perhaps calling in sick from work for the day, we’ve got all the crucial release datte and start times information you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-borderlands-4-coming-out">When is Borderlands 4 Coming Out?</h2>

<p><strong>September 12 is the official release date for Borderlands 4 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with Nintendo Switch 2 players having to wait a while longer until October 3</strong>.</p>



<p>With the Borderlands 4 release date now locked in and on the horizon, there shouldn’t be any changes to the release date. Gearbox has already made the rather unusual move of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-move-forward-after-randy-pitchford-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bringing the Borderlands 4 release date</a> forward, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/randy-pitchford-addresses-gta-6-release-date-rumors-after-borderlands-4-is-moved-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEO Randy Pitchford then denying</a> the decision had anything to do with Grand Theft Auto 6. </p>



<p>The release date was brought forward by “confidence in the game and development trajectory,” giving fans a nice early bonus. As mentioned, however, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 players have a little while longer to wait</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-start-times">Borderlands 4 Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Borderlands 4’s official start times are yet to be announced, but listings on the PlayStation store suggest it will be available a midnight regionally.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UK PlayStation Store</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-au/games/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Australian PlayStation Store</a> both have midnight in their respective time zones, while the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US PlayStation Store</a> has a midnight release in Eastern Time stated—though it’s unclear whether this means those in other US time zones will gain access at the same moment.</p>



<p>A midnight regional release would also open the door for players to gain earlier access by switching their time zone, which is much easier to do on Xbox Series X|S than it is on PlayStation. However, we won’t know for sure if this is possible until the release times are confirmed.</p>



<p>For easier viewing, the table below shows the release times in popular time zones. Please remember that these are subject to change; we’ll be sure to keep them updated.</p>
