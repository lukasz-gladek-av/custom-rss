            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Screenshots of the canceled Xbox exclusive Contraband have surfaced online. With the new look, we see what the multiplayer game could’ve looked like had it come out. </p>



<p>The game, created by Just Cause’s Avalanche Studios, was revealed in 2021 with a neat trailer. We never saw gameplay, as it was just a teaser, but it seems the game was doing fine <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/job-listing-shows-contraband-is-still-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">behind the scenes</a>. However, infrequent updates and notable absences from presentations hinted that development may not have been going well. In August, it was confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-development-stopped-at-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">active development had stopped</a> to evaluate the game’s future. Furthermore, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avalanche-studios-closes-office-lays-off-staff-after-contraband-cancelation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many were laid off</a> due to the move, seemingly ending the game for good. Now, we have a clue as to what it would’ve looked like.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>A portfolio of one of Contraband’s UI artists was found online. In it, new screenshots of the canceled game’s UI and design are shown. Furthermore, we see the vision that Avalanche was going for with the design. <br></p>



<p>The pictures, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/pqZvhpr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available here</a>, show off a retro-like art style for the character models and typeface, reminiscent of the late 1900s. We also see how the game would’ve been done, with players joining sessions and teaming up in groups of four to tackle maps. One of the maps, Downtown, is seen in one of the photos and may show what it would’ve looked like in-game.<a href="https://imgur.com/a/pqZvhpr"></a></p>



<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/pqZvhpr"></a>It’s important to note that, even if true, take it with a grain of salt.&nbsp;As mentioned before, no gameplay has been released, so this may be the best we’ll have for a while. Still, it’s cool to see what could’ve been for the multiplayer game. It hasn’t been outright canceled, though it likely has given the lack of updates, so perhaps things could work out. If so, we could have one of Xbox’s most unique titles in a while.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-creator-pondsmith-keanu-reeves-2077-sequel/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-creator-on-keanu-reeves-in-2077-sequel-%E2%80%9Ccontact-me%E2%80%9D.1341775/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The creator of Cyberpunk wants Keanu Reeves back for Cyberpunk 2077’s upcoming sequel, despite how the story goes. Furthermore, he said he ‘has ways of bringing him back’.</p>



<p>Released in 1998, the Cyberpunk tabletop game, created by Mike Pondsmith, has been a staple of TTRPG fans for decades. In 2020, CD Projekt Red, known for The Witcher series, brought the edgy techno-dystopian world to gaming. While mixed at launch, subsequent updates, and a brilliant anime adaptation (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-confirmed-for-another-new-netflix-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a>) made the game a must-play. If you were around during the late 2010s, you know how huge the hype was, especially when Hollywood icon Keanu Reeves was announced as Johnny Silverhand. His portrayal of the rebel rockstar was a highlight for many, given how much time the player spends with him. Unfortunately, the endings don’t leave much room for the rocker to continue. However, it seems the creator may have a way to bring him back.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In a livestream from CD Projekt Red, Mike Pondsmith, the TTRPG creator, joined the crew to discuss Cyberpunk 2077. When talking about Keanu Reeves’ portrayal as Johnny Silverhand (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc?si=07ai4guwLhOQuEPL&amp;t=3619">at around the hour mark</a>), he said,</p>



<p>“<strong>Not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again</strong>,” Pondsmith states. “<strong>I have ways to do that, Keanu, contact me.</strong>“</p>



<p>Given the DLC was able to get Idris Elba and it’s worldwide success, it’s not suprising that the John Wick star would want to return. If Mike Pondsmith wants him back and can make it happen, then we may have it happen. All we know about Cyberpunk 2077’s sequel is that it’s in development, but no set release window. CD Projekt Red is currently working on The Witcher 4, but, for Cyberpunk fans, Cyberpunk Edgerunners 2 is in production, so it won’t be long before we return to Night City.</p>

<p>Use these Brainrot Tsunami monthly redeem codes for October 2025 to get free rewards in the game, including in-game currencies as well as potions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brainrot Tsunami is often described as a weird <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-raise-animals-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> simulator game where players must navigate tsunami waves and run through the map. Starting with a low speed, players are tasked with training to improve their pace, thereby making the process of dodging the tsunami waves that much easier. Another key mechanic in the game requires players to train with Brainrots. The game also allows players to spawn special tsunami waves, which can be used to troll the competition. As simple as the gameplay sounds, there is a decent amount of strategy involved, and with that in mind, any way to get ahead of the other players must be considered. That’s exactly where these codes will come into the picture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brainrot Tsunami recently had an update, but unfortunately for players, they didn’t release any new codes. However, fans of the game mustn’t lose hope, as the developers are still working on the game, which means that new codes are likely on the horizon. New codes are often released through the game’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ycveZcDGFV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a> or through the Roblox game page. However, to make staying up to date with the codes easier, we recommend that you keep this page bookmarked. We update this article as soon as any new codes drop, so check in every once in a while to maximise the number of rewards you can get.</p>
