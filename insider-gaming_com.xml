<p>New information claims that Bungie’s upcoming MOBA, Gummy Bears, is inspired by Smash Bros and is being developed by a new PlayStation Studio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/exclusive-details-bungie-moba-smash-bros-gummybears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, sources close to the project have revealed that Bungie’s Gummy Bears will introduce several elements from Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. franchise while being a “MOBA at its core.” Aspects such as a “percentage-based damaged system,” players being knocked off the map, and more will seemingly be incorporated into the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, Bungie’s Gummy Bears has been in development for three years and aims to target a younger audience by incorporating “vibrant and colourful visuals.” The title is called the “most fun” project from incubation, and multiple game modes are in the works. The title will also feature a class system with roles such as Support, Attack, and Defence. There will also be a social aspect to the game, where players can interact with each other between matches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last we heard about Bungie’s Gummy Bears MOBA was in 2023 when it was revealed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-new-game-to-use-unreal-engine-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PvP title was being developed in Unreal Engine 5</a>. Since then, the project has been handed over to a new PlayStation Studio, where 40 Bungie devs have joined the team to carry out the development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a former executive claimed that Bungie hired fans <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-hired-fans-as-they-would-work-for-less-former-exec-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as they would work for less money</a>. Also, the former Marathon Director has sued Bungie and Sony <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-marathon-director-sues-sony-and-bungie-denies-conduct-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over alleged inappropriate contact</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-is-reportedly-returning-to-warzone-in-season-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Verdansk is reportedly returning to Warzone during Season 3, which will be around mid-April 2025.</p>



<p>That’s according to TheGhostofHope, who has accurately leaked Call of Duty details in the past.</p>



<p>Taking to X (formerly Twitter), <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1878501659413754048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hope replied</a> to someone asking him to “leak Verdansk to wake them [Activision] up,” to which Hope replied, “S3,” referring to Season 3.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming first heard that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-map-verdansk-return-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk would return in December 2023</a>, which was said to be a move directly following the success of OG Fortnite, where Epic Games brought back the game’s original map with tremendous success. Originally slated for a December 2024 release, the map would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-verdansk-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed to Spring 2025</a>. </p>



<p>Activision confirmed the leaks in August 2024 during CODNEXT, where it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-warzone-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk would return in 2025</a>. Hope’s tweet suggests that we will not be getting it during Season 2, and instead in Season 3, meaning that we’re still a few months away from release. </p>



<p>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 1 lasted 70 days, suggesting that we’ll get the return of Verdansk around mid-April, unless the map is released during a mid-Season update, which would come around late May.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdansk-took-call-of-duty-to-new-heights">Verdansk Took Call of Duty to New Heights</h2>



<p>First released in 2020, Verdansk and Call of Duty Warzone took the Call of Duty franchise to new heights. The game, which was the first free-to-play Call of Duty ever was a tremendous success with Call of Duty players and saw the game reach its highest concrruent player numbers in history.Revenue also followed, making Activision billions of dollars in revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Following the successful release of OG Fortnite, which saw Fortnite’s player base revived, Activision are seemingly hoping that Verdansk will have similar results. </p>



<p>But as of the time of writing, Call of Duty has had serious issues with bugs and hackers, making the game unplayable to most. So here’s hoping that those issues will be squashed before the release of Verdansk.</p>
