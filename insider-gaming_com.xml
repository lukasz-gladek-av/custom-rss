<p>The competitive Rainbow Six Siege community has come to the support of a Team Secret player after the CEO of his team released him and criticized him for showing emotion after a loss. Numerous players and personalities are now calling out the CEO for their behavior.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-team-secret-ceo-s-actions-uncover-the-need-to-talk-about-mental-health">Team Secret CEO’s Actions Uncover the Need to Talk About Mental Health</h2>



<p>After being released by Team Secret following a group stage elimination at The Six Invitational, Australian player Jake “Virtue” Grannan posted on X that the move caught him by surprise. “Didn’t see this coming at all, after all the energy and work that I’ve been putting in,” he <a href="https://x.com/Virtue_R6/status/1889005812346941812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>. “One bad tournament has now lead me to be LFT [looking for team].”</p>



<p>However, a day later, Virtue and almost the entire Siege community were stunned by <a href="https://x.com/zypher84/status/1889338159739347427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a reply</a> to this post made by Secret CEO John Yao. Yao shared a screenshot of the team after they were eliminated, showing Virtue facing away from the group. The caption reads: “I am also very surprised.”</p>



<p>This reply, which appears to disparage Virtue, has drawn the ire of several members of the Siege community. Virtue confirmed that he was very emotional, that he was “almost crying,” and that he “couldn’t look at anyone” after a bad series. Some of the game’s biggest stars came to Virtue’s defense, including M80’s Leonardo “Kyno” Figueiredo and DarkZero’s Jason “Beaulo” Doty. The replies and quote reposts are littered with players, casters, coaches, and others criticizing Yao and defending Virtue.</p>



<p>While many are clearly upset about Yao’s comments, they have at least opened the door for a greater conversation about men’s mental health. It’s okay to cry, and it’s okay to cry in front of others.</p>



<p>Did the Team Secret CEO cross the line? Should mental health become a bigger talking point in esports? Let us know down below and on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 could be on its way to PlayStation 5 (PS5) sooner rather than later. According to a tease posted on social media by Windows Central’s Jez Corden, the Xbox console exclusive is likely one of the next first-party Xbox games to come to competing consoles.</p>



<p>In a reply to a user on Twitter who questioned “if” the game will come, Corden gave a more definitive tease of the possibility.</p>



<p>“Not if, “when!” and when is pretty soon from what I’ve been hearing,” <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1889342523807527095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. </p>

<p>The plan to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-more-xbox-games-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bring more Xbox games</a> to PlayStation—and even Nintendo Switch—is something that Microsoft has been actively discussing for some time now. As sales of Xbox hardware continue to drop, the company is looking at all avenues to increase its gaming revenue moving forward. The most recent Xbox exclusive to be announced for PS5 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>, which is set to launch this spring on the platform. Also coming in the spring is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. The latest rumors claim that Bethesda’s newest game is looking at an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-targeting-an-april-2025-release-for-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April release</a>.</p>



<p>Sony announced on Tuesday its first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-announces-state-of-play-for-february-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play</a> for the year will take place on February 12.

<p>GTA 6’s parent company has stated they are “not worried” about the game influencing violent behaviour in the real world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Violence in video games has been a controversial subject in the industry for years, with the GTA series often being the poster boy for such campaigns. The popular series will receive a brand new instalment this fall, with Rockstar finally releasing GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this year</a>. Many wonder if new allegations related to violence will pop up again, but Take-Two’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, doesn’t seem to be worried about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/02/10/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-take-two-interactive-chairman-and-ceo-strauss-zelnick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNBC</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/gta-6-publisher-claps-back-against-tv-media-inciting-disproven-violent-video-game-rhetoric/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Video Gamer</a>), Zelnick was asked whether he had concerns about GTA 6’s violence impacting the real world. He responded that he was “not worried.” Zelnick added, “To be clear: entertainment doesn’t create behaviour; entertainment reflects behaviour.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CEO explained that entertainment allows people to express and engage with feelings as it tells stories. “The notion [that] entertainment creates behaviour has been tested and disproved over and over again.” Therefore, he isn’t concerned about GTA 6 influencing people to commit violence against others in the real world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zelnick also discussed TV shows and movies with “very realistic-looking” violence, which doesn’t influence wrong behaviour; hence, he’s “not worried about photorealistic video games” inciting such behaviour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Take-Two’s CEO recently spoke about GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-gta-6-not-coming-to-pc-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping sell more consoles</a>. Also, the parent company’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-stock-hits-all-time-high-after-gta-6-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stocks rose to an all-time high</a> when they reconfirmed the fall 2025 release window. Do you think GTA 6 will influence violent behaviour in the real world?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
