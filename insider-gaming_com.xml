<p>The original Final Fantasy 7 has re-released on Steam, and it doesn’t seem to be faring well with players due to some issues, as reviews have dropped to ‘Mostly Negative.’</p>



<p>For those unaware, Square Enix announced last month that Final Fantasy 7 will be re-released on Steam, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/original-final-fantasy-7-is-re-releasing-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replacing the 2013 version</a>. Today, the new version has arrived with some brand-new features; however, these seem to be causing many gameplay issues, which are hampering the experience at launch. </p>







<h2 id="h-original-final-fantasy-7-re-release-on-steam-seemingly-riddled-with-issues">Original Final Fantasy 7 Re-Release on Steam Seemingly Riddled with Issues</h2>



<p>To understand the problem, players will first have to know the new features that have arrived with the original Final Fantasy 7’s re-release on Steam. Players have received a <strong>3x Speed</strong> mode, which allows them to battle, travel, and participate in select events at three times the speed. There’s also an option to turn off random battle encounters, a <strong>Battle Enhancement</strong> mode that allows players to recover HP/MP during battles, max out the Limit gauge, and an <strong>Autosave</strong> feature. </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/completely-broken-square-enix-rushes-out-final-fantasy-7-patch-for-the-og-jrpgs-new-steam-version-following-fan-reports-of-dizzying-battle-speed-and-other-technical-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, the majority of complaints seem to be with the game’s new speed-up feature, with players <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3837340/FINAL_FANTASY_VII/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">highlighting</a> issues like “combat speed is completely broken”, “the FPS limit has been increased from 15 to 30, doubling the speed of fights and actions but without adapting the animations so the actions desyncs with the audio,” and more. Some others have mentioned issues with overlays, textures, and screen tearing.  </p>



<p>However, some reviewers have pointed out that Square Enix was prompt in releasing a patch the same day to fix the combat speed issue. But will this be enough to get the review rating back up?</p>







<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on the Switch 2 is not a PS4 port. Additionally, the multiplatform release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-multiplatform-release-wont-compromise-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not compromise the graphics</a> in FF7 Remake Part 3.

<p>Xbox CEO Asha Sharma discusses the brand’s efforts to retain user engagement and grow its player base in an increasingly competitive landscape.</p>



<p>In 2026, there are so many entities fighting for engagement. Social media apps like YouTube and TikTok are competing with streamers like Netflix and Prime Video, as well as video game platforms like PlayStation and Xbox.</p>



<p>As Xbox looks to reshape its future following the retirement of Phil Spencer and the appointment of Asha Sharma as new CEO, the organization is recommitting to players rather than chasing emerging trends.</p>







<h2 id="h-asha-sharma-doesn-t-want-xbox-s-developers-to-lose-focus">Asha Sharma Doesn’t Want Xbox’s Developers to Lose Focus</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with Windows Central’s Jez Corden</a>, Sharma was asked about her plans to explore new avenues to help Xbox grow its audience. In response, she reaffirmed her commitment to loyal users, saying that if the time comes to invest in a different community, they will evaluate these things on an individual basis.</p>



<p>What I don’t want to do is have any creator at Xbox dilute their focus to chase an emerging community,” Sharma explained. “If we want to invest in a new community, we’ll look at how to do that. But it’s really important that people stay true to their core when they’re building.”</p>







<p>Elsewhere in the interview, she discussed her plans to drive Xbox’s rise through hardware and first-party offerings.

<p>Marathon is Bungie’s foray into the extraction shooter scene, with the Destiny veterans taking their slick first-person gunplay and applying it to the tried and tested formula. If you’re curious about the project and can’t wait until launch to try it, then Bungie has just the thing for you…</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> Server Slam Playtest. In the weekend leading up to the official launch, Bungie are hosting a free-to-play event for anyone to join and give Marathon a shot. It’s a great chance for Bungie to stress-test its servers, whilst the fanbase can decide whether they want to buy into the long-term future of the franchise. </p>







<p>If you’re eager to get involved, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/bungie/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a> have officially announced whether you can preload the Marathon Server Slam Playtest, and all of the details can be found down below.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Don’t miss it! Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Sadly, you will not be able to preload the Marathon Server Slam Playtest, so you’ll have to hit download the second it launches on February 26.</strong></p>



<p>This news was confirmed in the official Marathon Discord, and it’s disappointed a lot of the player base who wanted to dive right in the second it goes live. However, there was a silver lining, as in the same message, it was confirmed that you will be able to preload Marathon for the full release.</p>

</ul>



<p>So, for those dying to return to Tau Ceti after the Server Slam Playtest, fear not, as once Marathon goes live on March 5, you’ll have the option to have it downloaded and ready for launch. </p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-take-part-in-the-marathon-server-slam-playtest">How To Take Part In The Marathon Server Slam Playtest</h2>



<p><strong>To get involved in the Marathon Server Slam Playtest, all you need to do is download it for free once it releases on whichever platform you intend to play it on.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a>‘s reputation has gotten stronger as time has gone on. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a> has clearly listened to any feedback and criticisms, taken them on board, and the final result should be very promising: Could it rival ARC Raiders?</p>
