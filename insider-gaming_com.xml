<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 won every award imaginable when it came out, as did The Witcher 3 years before it. It makes sense that CD Projekt Red wants to create the most successful sequel possible, and acquiring one of BG3’s senior devs is a good way to do this.</p>



<p>Toss a coin to your Witcher if you want <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-dev-doesnt-know-how-to-top-the-witcher-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a> to have any hopes of living up to the reputation of the third game. Cyberpunk 2077 battled to become a huge success in the end, but it required a lot of hard work. The Witcher 4 will be equally as difficult, but it can get off to a better start than CP 2077. One way to do that is by bringing in a Larian Studios artist.</p>

<p>Felix Pedulla worked at Larian Studios for six years, starting as a cinematic artist before becoming a senior cinematic artist.</p>







<p>They helped Baldur’s Gate 3 to become one of the most celebrated and successful game releases of the last few years. That journey recently came to an end when Pedulla announced a new career move on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fedulla_newjob-careergrowth-gamingindustry-activity-7401304661347172352-uP_M?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACUuJ-8BNA69V1_ApZijzm0QdBNPNFJlEnA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>“After an incredible and frankly wild six-year ride with the amazing team at Larian Studios, a new chapter begins. I’m so grateful for every chaotic, creative, and unforgettable moment we shared. We made some serious magic together, and I’ll forever cherish the lessons and memories. A huge thank you to all my incredible colleagues and friends I made.</p><p>As one adventure ends, another begins! I am absolutely thrilled to announce that I’m joining the legendary team at CD Projekt Red as a Senior Cinematic Designer! The opportunity to contribute to one of the most ambitious studios in the industry is a dream come true. Time to trade in my Baldur’s Gate dice for some Polish steel and get to work crafting some epic cutscenes.”</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>It was nice to see so many of the replies being Larian Studios devs, sad to see the artist go. Interestingly, this news comes only a handful of weeks after it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-devs-acquire-kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-lead-gameplay-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s lead gameplay designer</a> also joined CD Projekt Red. The team is obviously keen to recruit and house the best developers in the world to create one of the most anticipated RPGs of all time.</p>

<p>A Fortnite artist has hit back at suggestions that some art in Chapter 7 Season 1 is AI-generated, proving their work on a piece of artwork.</p>



<p>Fortnite kicked off Chapter 7 in style with the Zero Point live event, marking the end of the last Chapter, attracting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-chapter-7-launch-featured-over-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million players</a>, but social media was soon awash with claims that AI created some artwork and assets used in Chapter 7 Season 1, despite a lack of proof.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-artist-proves-their-work-was-not-ai-generated">Fortnite Artist Proves Their Work Was Not AI-Generated</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Proof. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As posted by the likes of <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1995684089945620483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HypeX</a>, Fortnite artist Sean Dove revealed he was behind the Marty McFly Spray in the game that some have accused of being created by AI, showing his work on the image.</p>



<p>Dove explained the process of his work, particularly the background featuring clocks, where he “grabbed some clocks off image search, collaged them, and halftoned them.”</p>



<p>He admitted that “the numbers are bad” and that it was “entirely possible” he grabbed an AI clock when gathering images, but, nevertheless, the work was done by him.</p>



<p>Although this doesn’t quite end the AI debate surrounding Fortnite, as there are plenty of accusations revolving around other images found in the game, it does show evidence that one of the most prominent pieces of art, which is available as a Spray in the Battle Pass, is not AI-generated.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Epic Games regarding the accusations of AI artwork being used in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 and is waiting for a response.</p>

<p>The strange statue referenced by Geoff Keighley ahead of The Game Awards 2025 has been the talk of the town, and God of War director Cory Balrog has given a big update on GOW’s status in relation to the statue.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-mystery-statue-new-mexico-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fans have been trying to uncover the identity of a mysterious Game Awards Statue</a>. On November 29, The Game Awards show host and creator Geoff Keighley posted on X saying: “regal.inspiring.thickness.” The message was accompanied by a statue, which was later revealed to be close to the venue.</p>







<p>God of War has been one of the biggest suggestions heading into the show, and Cory Balrog has responded.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Not to be. Image via Santa Monica Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gaming content creator and streamer Luke Stephens had a surprise visitor pop up in their chat during a stream, none other than God of War director Cory Balrog.</p>







<p>Balrog has worked extensively on the GOW franchise since 2005 and worked their way up at Santa Monica Studio, becoming the main director for the 2018 reboot and Ragnarok. Stephens’ chat was talking about the Game Awards statue, and Balrog had a quick message to address one of the many suggested games:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“no, it’s not gow.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So there you have it, if you see the statue appear during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> livestream, you might be disappointed to learn that it’s not God of War related.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It doesn’t mean the series will be absent altogether. The long-rumored <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Metroidvania game</a> has been outed for a possible TGA 2025 appearance, and it would be fun to see.</p>



<p>No one seems to know, but what do you think the statue means for The Game Awards 2025? Any ideas which game it’s referring to or highlighting? Let IG know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

<p>Epic Games has significantly nerfed the XP gain across various modes in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, making the grind to complete the Battle Pass much longer.</p>



<p>Fortnite brought an end to Chapter 6 with the huge Zero Point live event, where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-chapter-7-launch-featured-over-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million players tuned in</a> to watch the defeat of the Dark Presence, and Chapter 7 Season 1 began soon after—but players have quickly noticed a major reduction in the XP awarded.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-xp-nerfed-for-chapter-7-season-1">Fortnite XP Nerfed For Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nerfed. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Posting on Twitter, FNBRUnderground shared details about the drop in XP gain in the new Chapter, which includes reduced rewards for completing Battle Royale Weekly Quests.</p>



<p>Weekly Quests now provide 134k XP, down from 170k XP in Chapter 6 Season 4, but the biggest drop of all comes in Save The World Endurance, with 188,300 XP available compared to 392,200 XP last season.</p>



<p>Playtime XP in LEGO Fortnite and Creative Maps has also been reduced, with LEGO Fortnite now providing 1,550 XP, down from 2,250, and Creative Maps dishing out 1,750 XP compared to 2,300 XP last season.</p>



<p>Epic Games has not detailed exactly why there has been such a major falloff in XP in Chapter 7 Season 1, but the main theory among players is that it has been reduced due to the longer length of the season, but that doesn’t quite add up.</p>



<p>As revealed by the current Battle Pass, Chapter 7 Season 1 in Fortnite is due to end on March 4, 2026, although this is a Wednesday and could therefore be adjusted slightly to align with Epic Games’ traditional release schedule.</p>



<p>That puts the length of the season at 95 days, which, although longer than Chapter 6 Season 4, the last full-length season in Fortnite, it isn’t too much different, given that the season lasted 85 days.</p>



<p>Fortnite does seem to be offering more quests to complete this season, though, and is encouraging players to jump into a variety of modes by locking some Battle Pass content behind tasks in the likes of Reload.</p>

<p>It’s not often that any game gets a new peak player count years after release, and it’s even rarer when it happens to a driving simulation title <strong>thirteen years </strong>after hitting the market. That’s what happened recently with Euro Truck Simulator 2, which skyrocketed on Steam to reach a new peak player count years after its release in October 2012.</p>



<p>On Steam, Euro Truck Simulator 2 soared to 72,678 concurrent players, all because of two new DLC packs that took players to the Nordics.</p>







<h2 id="h-euro-truck-simulator-2-reaches-new-heights">Euro Truck Simulator 2 Reaches New Heights</h2>



<p>Euro Truck Simulator 2 has always been one of the most popular driving sims, with some players going to extreme lengths to replicate a truck cab in their gaming room to immerse themselves in the hyper-realistic driving experience fully.</p>



<p>Days ago, SCS Software released two new pieces of DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2, Nordic Horizons and the Forest Machinery expansion. The former takes players to the gorgeous, rural vistas of Scandinavia, presenting them with mountainside roads, forest tracks, and scenic drives around lakes and fjords.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for the expansion:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>SCS Software has made leaps and bounds with Euro Truck Simulator 2 over the years, constantly adding new locations and ways to explore the game through a staggering array of expansions.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Steam</a>, users can invest in the Euro Truck Simulator 2 <strong>Ultimate Edition bundle </strong>to secure the base game and a whopping 34 expansions and pieces of DLC.

<p>Ninja has been streaming ARC Raiders since the game came out, participating in the recent ‘streamer war’ and exploring every facet of the all-new extraction adventure from Embark Studios. The game has proven to be a monumental success, attracting hundreds of thousands of viewers from across the streaming space.</p>



<p>The popular creator, with origins in games like Fortnite, revealed the one thing that he thinks would <strong>ruin </strong>ARC Raiders.</p>







<h2 id="h-don-t-make-arc-raiders-competitive">Don’t Make ARC Raiders Competitive</h2>



<p>During a recent stream, Ninja stressed that making ARC Raiders competitive and introducing tournaments would make the game unbearable, simply because people would start ‘min-maxing’ to sweat the game and become the best they could be at it.</p>



<p>Right now, it’s the most casual extraction title on the market, boasting accessible mechanics, a socially-focused gameplay loop, and forgiving combat elements.</p>



<p>Ninja’s concern is that if you add tournaments and the ability to earn money from playing ARC Raiders at a ‘pro level’, you’ll destroy those elements and just make the game too challenging for casual players.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nah, the second they try to make this game competitive, it would be so bad. I hope there are never tournaments for it.</p>



<p>I want them to keep it as casual as possible.</p>



<p>Also, there’s too much desync for this game to legitimately be competitive. They better never make this game competitive, ever.</p>



<p>Even like, joke tournaments. Like Escape from Tarkov has tournaments and stuff, I don’t know how they work, but like… The second you start throwing money in this game, people are going to start competing and it just encourages people to just min-max and become the best at this game, and…</p>



<p>It rapidly increases how quickly people get good at games when you start throwing tournaments in, it’s what happened to Fortnite.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full clip:</p>

<p>Players appreciate how approachable ARC Raiders is compared to other extraction titles, and while there’s definitely a skill gap, it feels like every weapon and approach is viable when it comes to combat. Introducing a strict meta and pushing for a competitive or ranked loop might push out the more casual players who are enjoying this game because of that fact.</p>



<p>That being said, Embark Studios also developed The Finals, a competitive arena shooter title with a more traditional ranked loop that includes high-stakes tournaments. It’s unlikely that any official tournaments would surface in ARC Raiders while the team is focused on making The Finals a competitive, esports-backed product.</p>

<p>It has been revealed that Hideo Kojima, the legendary game creator, has joined the cast of Zootopia 2 to provide a Japanese dub for Paul Moldebrandt, a mole who works in the Zootopia Police Department. His cameo appearance reportedly comes after he was directly approached by Jared Bush, the film’s director, to request his voiceover talents.</p>



<p>Zootopia 2 is set to hit screens in just a few days, launching on Friday, December 5.</p>







<h2 id="h-an-unexpected-cameo">An Unexpected Cameo</h2>



<p>In a statement <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/59427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recorded by Famitsu</a>, Hideo Kojima expressed his delight at being invited to voice a character in Zootopia 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I have plenty of experience with cameo appearances in live-action films and games, but this will be my first time dubbing an animated feature film. And it’s from Disney, to my surprise!</p>



<p>And since it came directly from director Jared Bush, I was incredibly honored and accepted without hesitation</p>



<p>My participation was limited to a small scene, but even at the recording stage, the level of detail was impressive. Thanks to the illustrations, the recording went smoothly. I’m usually on the directing side, so I learned a lot from actually acting. I was reminded of how much attention voice actors pay to basic things like turning pages in the script and adding noise.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As Kojima said, this isn’t his first time acting. He has appeared in a few small roles over the years, most notably in Cyberpunk 2077 and Control. He also assumed roles in Metal Gear Solid games and has made cameos in Death Stranding.</p>



<p>The report from Famitsu suggests that Kojima was a huge fan of the first Zootopia movie, released in 2016, and when he saw it, he was left wondering how they could ‘surpass’ it with a sequel.</p>
