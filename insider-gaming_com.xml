<p>A clone of the popular Nintendo title, Animal Crossing, has appeared on the PlayStation Store as ‘Anime Village Online’. </p>



<p>It is not uncommon for lookalikes, clones, or rip-offs of games to appear in different stores. We’ve seen this several times in the past with games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-lookalike-appears-on-nintendo-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-switch-clone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a> being cloned on the Nintendo Store, imitations of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> appearing on PlayStation Store, and more. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Getting Rid Of Skill-Based Matchmaking]]></title>

<p>Activision has seemingly heard the cries of players, and a major change for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 multiplayer is coming to the game at launch. In a post on the game’s website, the publisher announced that Black Ops 7 will have non-disbanding multiplayer lobbies at launch. </p>



<p>That means once you find a game lobby, you’ll remain in it until you either leave or it’s disbanded. </p>



<p><strong>“We’ve heard the community discussion and dialogue around lobby disbanding, and as we mentioned earlier during the Beta, we’re focused on keeping players together from match to match more often,”</strong> <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision said</a>. <strong>“Today, we’re excited to announce we’ll have persistent lobbies at launch for Black Ops 7. We’re committed to improving this experience for players, and will be sharing more details soon.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to persistent lobbies, Activision also announced that it <strong>“open matchmaking with minimal skill consideration will be the default for Black Ops 7 multiplayer.</strong> In other terms, that means skill-based matchmaking is being taken out of Black Ops 7</p>



<p><strong>“Simply put, imagine the matchmaking experience of Open Moshpit from the Beta, but as the standard in Black Ops 7 on day one,”</strong> they said. <strong>“Our team feels strongly about providing players with a more varied experience, and the Beta proved to be a great opportunity to test this approach. We’ll be sharing more details as we get closer to launch!”</strong></p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>
