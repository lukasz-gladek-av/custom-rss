<p>Microsoft’s earnings reports are closely watched by investors, analysts, and consumers alike. So it’s important to know when the next one is, what time it starts, and how you can listen to it live.</p>



<p>Quarterly updates provide insights into a company’s financial health, performance across key divisions, and growth outlooks for the months and years ahead. Microsoft is the second-largest company in the world in terms of market cap, but quarterly reviews can swiftly change the public and private perception of the company.</p>



<p>What is Microsoft’s focus? What are investors looking for? Are there any concerns or roadblocks? All that gets answered with each call.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-microsoft-earnings-report-date">When Is The Next Microsoft Earnings Report Date?</h2>



<p>Microsoft is currently scheduled to deliver its second quarter (Q2) earnings for fiscal year (FY) 2025 on Wednesday, January 29.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As to why the company is releasing its second quarter earnings in January, Microsoft’s fiscal year runs from July 1-June 30. The company’s second quarter runs from October 1 – December 31. The company’s quarters are structured as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Q1: July 1 – September 30</li>



<li>Q2: October 1 – December 31</li>



<li>Q3: January 1 – March 31</li>



<li>Q4: April 1 – June 30</li>
</ul>

<p>The next Microsoft earnings report is scheduled to start after trading closes for the day at 5:30PM ET/2:30PM PT on January 29, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-listen-to-microsoft-s-earnings-report">How To Listen To Microsoft’s Earnings Report?</h2>



<p>If you want to listen to Microsoft’s quarterly earnings report—or just look over the numbers—you can do so via Microsoft’s website. Simply do the following:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/default" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Investor Relations page</a> on Microsoft’s website</li>



<li>In the menu bar, select “Earnings &amp; Financials”</li>



<li>Then select “Press Release &amp; Webcast”</li>



<li>This will take you to the most recent earnings report page with the press release. On the right-hand side will be options to read the transcript (after the call), listen to the webcast, view the earnings slides, read financial statements, see product releases for the quarter, and more.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you just want to listen to the call without any other information, you’ll want to scroll down on the Investor Relations page to the Upcoming/Past Events section. If it’s not listed in the most recent calls, click “More Past Events”. From there, scroll to the call you’d like to listen to and click the “Webcast” link to listen to the call.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-for-xbox">What To Expect For Xbox</h2>



<p>When Microsoft releases its latest earnings, it will provide a number of updates on the state of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox business</a>. Details such as general gaming revenue, Xbox content and services revenue, Xbox hardware revenue, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cloud gaming</a>, Xbox Game Pass growth, Activision Blizzard King’s impact, and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-microsoft-earnings-report">The Last Microsoft Earnings Report</h2>



<p>When Microsoft announced its earnings for Q1 FY2025, it revealed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty launch in franchise history. Microsoft also said that the company set a record for the most Xbox Game Pass sign ups in a single day for the launch of the new game.</p>



<p>Regarding overall Xbox revenue, Microsoft said that it increased by 61% year-over-year with 53 points of net impact—53 of the 61%—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-activision-responds-report-regarding-financial-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming from Activision Blizzard King</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-quarterly-earnings-calls">What Are Quarterly Earnings Calls?</h2>



<p>Quarterly earnings calls are meetings held publicly traded companies to provide updates on their overall financial performance. Typically, these calls are open to shareholders, analysts, and media to call in and ask questions. The public, regardless if they’re a shareholder or not, is also able to listen to these calls live as they happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the calls themselves, companies will often release a full media deck and press release with important details included ahead of the call taking place. This allows investors, analysts, and media to prepare coverage or questions based on the information provided.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/techland-dying-light-next-era-10th-anniversary/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98the-next-era-of-dying-light%E2%80%99-revealed-as-techland-celebrates-10th-anniversary.1093026/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/techland-dying-light-next-era-10th-anniversary/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Techland has lined up an impressive 2025 roadmap for Dying Light 2, and it all begins with a celebration event honouring the 10th anniversary of the Dying Light franchise. In 2015, this open-world epic of a zombie apocalypse title made its way onto our screens and into our hearts, and today, it remains one of the best zombie games to ever be released.</p>



<p>From today, the anniversary celebration commences, with Techland pushing out four weeks of entertainment across both Dying Light and Dying Light 2: Stay Human, which was released in February 2022.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-hard-at-work">‘Hard at Work’</h2>



<p>In a recent press release, Techland explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At the same time we’re celebrating the 10th anniversary of Dying Light, we are already hard at work on the next era of the franchise.</p>



<p>Our recent major rebrand aims to establish the franchise as the ultimate zombie experience across all future projects.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This summer, the team will release Dying Light: The Beast, a standalone game that sees the return of Kyle Crane, the iconic protagonist from the first game. At Gamescom 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I caught up with Roger Craig Smith</a>, the legendary actor behind Kyle Crane, who returns to the Dying Light series after a ten-year break.</p>



<p>To kick off the celebrations, Dying Light 2: Stay Human will be discounted to the lowest price ever, per the Techland update. Those still playing Dying Light (2015) will get a free skin bundle and a special ‘hypermode’ event, too. After that, both Dying Light 2 and Dying Light will have special, in-game events unravel, including the return of fan-favourite modes like Low Gravity and Super Crane.</p>



<p>In the week starting February 19, Dying Light 2’s Tower Raid mode will be permanently released, and a special ‘Light up the Night’ stream will be held by Techland.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>But that’s not all!</p>



<p>Beyond that, the spring welcomes a major update in Dying Light 2: Stay Human, and in the summer, a fresh event will be delivered. In the fall comes the ‘Fall Update’ which goes hand-in-hand with a limited-time Halloween event, and finally, Winter Tales returns at the end of the year.</p>



<p>Throughout all that, Dying Light 2 players will receive:</p>



<ul>
<li>Co-op gameplay and matchmaking updates</li>



<li>New Tower Raid characters</li>



<li>New firearms and melee weapons</li>



<li>Community map support</li>



<li>Prologue improvements</li>



<li>Free outfits and gear</li>



<li>Technical and graphical improvements</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a busy year for the team at Techland, and the press release finished with a promising statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our plans to grow the franchise don’t stop at Dying Light: The Beast. We’ll continue the series with multiple unannounced projects and will also go beyond video games with new board games, exclusive merchandise, original webcomic series and more on the horizon. Our goal is to bring the world of Dying Light to even more people.</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-satchels-for-a-sheet-metal-door-in-rust/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-satchels-for-a-sheet-metal-door-in-rust/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>One of life’s little joys is learning<strong> how many satchels for a sheet metal door</strong> in Rust. It’s a memorable moment, your first-ever raid against your neighbor, and likely to stick with you. In the early game, you likely won’t craft a metric ton of explosive ammo, and C4 is still a few workbenches away, but a satchel is easily accessible and open to most skill levels. Here’s how many it takes to get through your neighbor’s front door!</p>







<figure></figure>



<p>Assuming your raid target upgraded to a sheet metal door, which most Rust players should do immediately after building a base of any size, it will take a few satchels to blow through. In total, you need four satchels for a sheet metal door in Rust. That’s not many, and crafting satchels is not overly expensive. But hey, that’s just door number one!</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Door Type</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Satchels</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Wooden Door</td><td data-align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sheet Metal Door</td><td data-align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Garage Door</td><td data-align="center">9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Armored Door</td><td data-align="center">12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>A sheet metal door has 250 health points and is more damage-resistant. A single satchel will deal approximately 61 HP damage to the door. As such, it requires a minimum of four satchels, with 6 HP leftover on the door after the fourth explosion, so you could waste a fifth satchel or use explosive ammo to blast the last few HP. Basically, hit it with anything else. Don’t waste a fifth satchel!</p>



<p>If you’re playing in a group, which Rust genuinely promotes, try to farm for C4. It’s a much better tool for raiding in Rust.</p>

<p>Into The Breach, a United Kingdom-based esports organization, is winding down its operations due to its CEO’s embezzling of funds, leaving the organization in an “unsustainable” position. According to one of the organization’s CS2 players, the CEO “scammed” players out of thousands.</p>



<hr>



<p>Per an <a href="https://x.com/ITBesports/status/1883909874561831187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official announcement</a> from the organization, an investigation into the company began after “recent events…highlighted significant mismanagement.” ITB discovered that “an individual entrusted with all financial and monetary decisions was embezzling funds.”</p>



<p>On X, ITB CS2 player Owen “smooya” Butterfield <a href="https://x.com/smooyacs/status/1883910676902769137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed</a> the finger at CEO Sam “STM” Macedonio, claiming he was the one laundering money and scamming $500,000 from his own players. In his own post on X, Macedonio <a href="https://x.com/SlayTheMinotaur/status/1883911595975233999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted fault</a>, owing the decisions he made to a “destructive, alcoholic narcissist” side of him “hellbent on self-immolation.” Macedonio noted there will be “several legal consequences” that he will accept and face.</p>



<p>In the replies of his post, Macedonio said that Into The Breach made around £5.5 million between 2023 and 2024. He said that he took around £600,000 in “director’s loans,” which he claims he blew on “benders and self-harm action.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In his post, Macedonio made mention of the breakout moment for Into The Breach, when the relatively unknown organization surprised the Counter-Strike world with a playoff run at the BLAST Paris Major in 2023. The success brought on by that run prompted the organization to return to Dota 2 and Rainbow Six, and also enter competitive Halo for the first time.</p>



<p>Both Into The Breach and Macedonio have said that any available funds will be given to players who have lost money. All players across the various ITB esports divisions will now become free agents.</p>



<p>What do you think about Into The Breach’s shocking demise? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo Games is finally delivering a PC port for the popular open-world action RPG Rise of the Ronin on March 11, 2025. This guide will take you through the minimum and recommended system requirements for Rise of the Ronin.</p>



<p>Rise of the Ronin was released for PS5 in 2024, where players got to experience this open-world action RPG for the first time. The game is set in Japan’s Edo period, where you shape your destiny by interacting with actual historical figures and learning their ideologies. The game’s highlight was its gameplay, with players instantly falling in love with the plethora of combat styles available for the title’s various weapons. Additionally, the world created by Team Ninja is nothing short of beautiful.</p>



<h2 id="h-rise-of-the-ronin-pc-system-requirements">Rise of the Ronin PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>To experience Rise of the Ronin on PC in all its beauty, the developers have provided a set of minimum and recommended system requirements. However, players will need 16 GB of RAM, 180 GB of SSD Storage Space and a broadband internet connection to run the game on either set of requirements. Additional notes state that “poor SSD performance may affect gameplay”, and multi-channel memory architecture is recommended. </p>



<p>Check out Rise of the Ronin PC’s minimum and recommended specifications per the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340990/Rise_of_the_Ronin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam listing</a>. </p>



<h3 id="h-minimum">Minimum</h3>



<p>The minimum requirements are not very demanding. Players only need an Intel Core i5-10400 or AMD Ryzen 5 1600 CPU and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 (VRAM 6GB) or AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (VRAM 8GB) GPU. This minimum set of requirements will allow Rise of the Ronin to run at 1080p/30FPS.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Specifications</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Minimum</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">Intel Core i5-10400 or better, AMD Ryzen 5 1600 or better</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 (VRAM 6GB) or better, AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (VRAM 8GB) or better</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB of RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">180 GB SSD</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Audio</td><td data-align="center">16-bit stereo with 48KHz playback</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">OS</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10/11 64bit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX Version</td><td data-align="center">DirectX 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Network</td><td data-align="center">Broadband Internet Connection </td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 id="h-recommended">Recommended </h3>



<p>Rise of the Ronin PC’s recommended system requirements allows players to experience the game at 1080p/60FPS under the standard graphics settings (upscaled). The recommended CPU and GPU specifications aren’t very high either, with the player needing an Intel Core i5-10600K/AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Super (VRAM 8GB)/AMD Radeon RX 6700XT (VRAM 12GB), respectively. The recommended requirements will allow players to experience Rise of the Ronin as the developers intended. </p>
