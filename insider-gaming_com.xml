            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella has taken up a spot of blogging to share his thoughts on advances in technology, specifically around AI.</p>







<p>In a new blogpost posted to his new website named ‘<a href="https://snscratchpad.com/posts/looking-ahead-2026/?v=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">snscratchpad</a>‘, Nadella remarks that 2026 will be a “pivotal year for AI,” noting, “Yes, another one [year]. But this moment feels different in a few notable ways.”</p>



<p>According to Nadella, “We have moved past the initial phase of discovery and are entering a phase of widespread diffusion. We are beginning to distinguish between “spectacle” and “substance”. We now have a clearer sense of where the tech is headed, but also the harder and more important question of how to shape its impact on the world.”</p>



<p>“We are still in the opening miles of a marathon. Much remains unpredictable. Amidst this “model overhang,” where capability is outpacing our current ability to use it to have real world impact, this is some of what we still need to get right,” he continued.</p>



<p>In point one, Nadella states that “We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our “theory of the mind” that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other.”</p>



<p>He later continues to say that “we need to make deliberate choices on how we diffuse this technology in the world as a solution to the challenges of people and planet. For AI to have societal permission it must have real world eval impact. The choices we make about where we apply our scarce energy, compute, and talent resources will matter. This is the socio-technical issue we need to build consensus around.”</p>



<p>While true, it isn’t at all surprising to see Nadella fully in support of AI, after all, Microsoft has seen tens of thousands of layoffs in the past 36 months as the company continues to invest in AI.</p>







<p>Even now, it’s almost impossible to use any of Microsoft’s ecosystem without having some form of AI use, with Microsoft Copilot being at the forefront of the company’s drive.</p>



<p>It’s certainly looking like 2026 will be another year focused on AI, but with new issues coming to the forefront, including an unprecedented rise in RAM prices and other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-prices-to-5000-in-2026/">hardware including GPUs</a>, it poses the question to what extent will AI be pushed and the price that we’ll, quiter literally, have to pay.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The next year is shaping up to be a big one for gaming, with 2026 including a wealth of major releases from huge publishers across the world, but there are also plenty of exciting Indie releases on the horizon.</p>



<p>From sequels to popular titles to entirely new creations, Insider Gaming has selected eight of the biggest Indie games to watch out for in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-2026-indie-releases">Biggest 2026 Indie Releases</h2>



<h3 id="h-hytale">Hytale</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Finally. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Where else is there to start? After being scrapped by Riot Games, Hytale is back in the hands of it’s original creators at Hypixel Studios and an early access release is set for January 13. After a long, long wait, this could be one of the biggest releases of the year.</p>



<p>Hytale began life as a Minecraft server, and the inspiration from the Mojang title is clear to see, but the big differences are the embracement of modding, with all in-game assets being made available to the community to create with, opening the door to an infinite number of ideas.</p>



<p>The early access release merely marks the next stage in the Hytale journey, and players have been warned it’s far from the finished product, but, either way, Hytale will be huge in 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-demon-tides">Demon Tides</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Washout. Image via Fabraz</figcaption></figure>



<p>A platformer set in the open seas, Demon Tides will see players explore the waters of the world to uncover dark secrets, with “dozens of locales” and gear to upgrade, and the game is set to be released on February 19.</p>



<p>The demo, initially released in February 2025, earned rave reviews, and even received an update dropping additional content, and the full adventure is now right around the corner.</p>



<h3 id="h-beastro">Beastro</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Cooking up a storm. Image via Timberline Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>No release date has been set for Beastro, but a demo is now available on Steam, with the title seeing players take control of Panko, tasked with creating culinary masterpieces to serve to a variety of characters, and the dishes you create will build a deck for their adventures.</p>



<p>The food-based fantasy adventure’s unique mix of cooking and deck building, with a variety of ingredients to unlock and secrets to discover, will certainly cause a stir, and it’s a title you should definitely keep your eyes peeled for in 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-aniimo">Aniimo</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Journey awaits. Image via Pawprint Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>Two years after Palworld set the gaming world alight, a new open-world, creature-catching game is on the horizon with Aniimo, which, like the Pocketpair title, will be open to a wide audience due to its inclusion on Xbox Game Pass from release date. </p>



<p>Full details of the release are yet to be shared, though they could come in Xbox’s Partner Showcase in January, but the countdown is well and truly on, with reveals showcasing an array of Aniimo’s to collect, vast social interactions, and an exciting world to explore.</p>



<h3 id="h-slay-the-spire-2">Slay the Spire 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sequel. Image via Mega Crit</figcaption></figure>



<p>Set for launch in March 2026, Slay the Spire 2 is the sequel to the original title, once again inciting players with a roguelike deckbuilder filled with challenges and variety.</p>



<p>The original Slay the Spire, released in 2019, is still extremely popular to this day and is ranked overwhelmingly positive on Steam with close to 70,000 reviews, showing that there is already an extremely strong playerbase, and more players are set to be drawn in.</p>



<h3 id="h-coromon-rogue-planet">Coromon: Rogue Planet</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Going rogue. Image via TRAGsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another creature-catching game releasing in 2026 is Coromon: Rogue Planet, a sequel to the original Coromon, which focuses on a roguelike approach—which could set it apart from other games in the genre.</p>



<p>While there’s plenty that will be familiar to players, like choosing your starter Coromon and battling wild monsters, the roguelike approach gives a different spin to the game, and could lure in a heap of players as a result.</p>



<h3 id="h-big-walk">Big Walk</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Follow the leader. Image via House House</figcaption></figure>



<p>The creators of Untitled Goose Game are back in 2026 with the release of Big Walk, a cooperative online walker-talker where players can “hang out and get lost with close friends in a big world.”</p>



<p>Filled with challenges, puzzles and discoveries, there’s a heap of adventures on the horizon, and the scope to just hang out with your friends, or boot your companions into the ocean, the choice is up to you.</p>



<h3 id="h-neverway">Neverway</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Haunted. Image via Coldblood Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Neverway is described as a mixture of a horror, life sim, and action RPG, where players take charge of Fiona, who starts over on a farm. If this sounds like your cup of tea, and you’re a big fan of Stardew Valley, Neverway’s release in 2026 is something that can’t be missed.</p>



<p>With farming, combat, dating, and plenty to collect, Neverway could be one of the biggest titles in 2026, and the fact it was co-created by the pixel artist of Celeste adds another feather into Neverway’s cap.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 Jailbreak Rumors Have Caused A Star Wars Game to Increase 1000% in Price]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-game-hike-in-price/</link>
            <guid>1395940</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new PlayStation 5 rumour suggesting that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-rom-keys-leak-jailbreaking-concerns-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console can be jailbroken</a> has caused one Star Wars game to increase in price by over 1000%.</p>







<p>That’s because, according to the rumours, the jailbreak method can only be done with a physical version of one particular game.</p>



<p>The game in question is Star Wars Racer Revenge, which, before the rumours, was selling for around $50. Now, listings on eBay are as high as $500, meaning that the price has increased tenfold.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/gezine_dev/status/2006548152913215847?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gezine</a> on X, one of the reasons for the sudden price increase is that the game only has around 10,000 copies in the market, which is a relatively low number in the grand scheme of things. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Wars Racer Revenge [Full Game | No Commentary] PS4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7TXXOtvIG8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As of yet, Star Wars Racer Revenge is the only game that works and according to the rumours, it works because the exploit targets the PlayStation 5’s disc authentication used for backwards compatibility.</p>



<p>Sony is yet to respond to the rumours, but if true, the jailbreaks could pose security concerns for the brand. As for what it currently means for jailbroken PlsyStation 5’s is also unclear, but it’s a step in the direction to soon having jailbroken consoles flooding the market.</p>







<div><p>So, with the price increases, it might be worth checking your library of physical games to see if you have a copy lying around. You might just be sitting on a fortune!</p><p>What do you think of the news that the PlayStation 5 may be jailbroken?

            <title><![CDATA[Should Escape from Tarkov PvE Be Free or Deleted Entirely, Nikita Asks]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-pve-free-or-deleted-nikita/</link>
            <guid>1395877</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new and somewhat bizarre post on social media, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov has asked his followers what should be done with Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform. The contentious mode has been a point of debate since surfacing in June 2024, and Nikita hosted a poll with three options, two of which were ‘make it free’ or ‘delete it’.</p>



<p>The poll surfaced on social media after Nikita responded to a post from a critic who ‘refunded Escape from Tarkov’ after discovering that the PvE mode <strong>was not free</strong> and is instead a paid-for bolt-on.</p>







<h2 id="h-and-our-survey-says">And Our Survey Says…</h2>



<p>The feedback on Nikita’s tongue-in-cheek poll is clear, and the bulk of Escape from Tarkov users either want PvE to be <strong>free </strong>or <strong>deleted entirely</strong>. At the time of publishing, 53.1% of voters (out of 17,000 votes) want PvE to be entirely free. That was supposed to be the case years ago when the concept first surfaced, but Battlestate Games went a different way with things.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The second-most popular option was ‘delete PvE’, which garnered 29.4% of the votes, assumedly from diehard PvP fans who believe that the PvE offering has long diluted what it means to be an Escape from Tarkov fan.</p>



<p>Nikita has been in the weeds with it recently and stressed in a new interview just a few days ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nikita-ten-years-of-tarkov-miracle/">Escape from Tarkov is his life</a>, and he couldn’t imagine existing without the game. In our most recent episode <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nikita-interview-tarkov-console-frustrating/">of Access Granted</a>, we sat down with Nikita, and he walked us through what it means to be an Escape from Tarkov developer.</p>



<p>Spoiler: It’s a mindset thing, and if you don’t have it, you’re not a Tarkov dev.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform isn’t going anywhere. Nikita said minutes after posting the poll that it’s all a big joke to poke fun at people complaining about PvE in the first place.</p>



<p>If anything, Tarkov’s PvE offering is getting stronger through 2026. There are some updates planned that will even introduce a PvE mode to Escape from Tarkov: Arena, so if you want to play <strong>that game </strong>but don’t want the stress of real players, you’ll be catered to soon.</p>







<p>Do you play Escape from Tarkov’s PvE mode, and if so, what do you think of it? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
