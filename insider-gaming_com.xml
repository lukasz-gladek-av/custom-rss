<p>ARC Raiders players have started spotting UFOs in the sky after the latest Shrouded Sky update. </p>



<p>The latest Shrouded Sky update for ARC Raiders went live yesterday, introducing a new map condition, ARC enemies, buffs &amp; nerfs, and much more. However, some items were not mentioned in the latest patch notes, and fans of extraterrestrial entities would love the new addition. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-players-spot-ufos-flying-in-the-sky">ARC Raiders Players Spot UFOs Flying in the Sky</h2>



<p>A new post on the r/ArcRaiders <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdgkdw/what_in_tarnation_is_that/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> discusses the appearance of UFOs in the game. The post shows a video of a player maneuvering through a building while the Hurricane map condition is on. There’s suddenly a loud noise of something flying in the sky, and when they look up, there are two clusters of blue lights that are floating past him, with what looks like a massive ship that is hidden by the cloud cover. </p>



<p>There is ongoing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rea7g9/new_giant_ufo_arc_boss_but_more_zoomed_and_slowmo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">speculation</a> that Embark Studios might be hinting at a new giant enemy for ARC Raiders, possibly a boss, through the appearance of UFOs. Some players have attempted to reach the highest points on the map to get a better view of this flying object, but they haven’t had any success. Meanwhile, others continue to speculate about what all this could mean.</p>



<p>In other news, Embark Studios has made a major change to ARC Raiders Feats, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-embark-studios-pvp-feats-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removing PvP-focused feats</a> and pushing closer to a PvE vibe.

<p>A new report reveals that Amazon has released Maverick Games from its publishing agreement. </p>



<p>Amazon has two big games in development with Crystal Dynamics: the Tomb Raider <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remake</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-catalyst-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next installment</a> of the mainline series. Along with that, they were also in a partnership with Maverick Games to publish their open-world driving game, but those plans have now changed. </p>







<h2 id="h-amazon-will-publish-upcoming-tomb-raider-games-and-focus-on-luna">Amazon Will Publish Upcoming Tomb Raider Games and Focus on Luna</h2>



<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/amazon-abandons-its-open-world-driving" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Business</a>, an Amazon Game Studios spokesperson revealed that the company has decided to “release Maverick Games from their publishing agreement.” The company will focus on projects that take advantage of “Amazon’s unique strengths and scale,” which includes the recent re-launch of Luna and the Tomb Raider franchise partnership with Crystal Dynamics. </p>



<p>The spokesperson mentioned that Amazon Game Studios has great respect for the narrative-driven driving experience that Maverick Games is developing. They believe that this decision will enable the developer to find a publishing partner whose strategic priorities are more closely aligned with bringing their game to market.</p>



<p>The co-founder of Maverick Games, Mike Brown, and CEO Harinder Sangha have stated that the development of their debut title is progressing “as strongly as planned” and that they are already “in active dialogue with partners who share our long-term ambition for the IP and look forward to sharing more later this year.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nacon Faces Closure After Filing For Emergency Insolvency]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nacon-faces-closure-after-filing-for-insolvency/</link>
            <guid>1445659</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nacon, a major French publisher and holdings company, has this morning revealed a dire situation. In a new press release, the company has revealed it has filed for insolvency after its parent company, Bigben, entered a period of financial difficulty.</p>



<p>In the release, it was stressed that Nacon will need to undergo a ‘rapid implementation of a financial restructuring’ to survive and has requested a judicial reorganisation review to facilitate this. Nacon’s ‘available assets’ are now substantial enough to meet its due liabilities, and it will now assess critical pathways out of this situation.</p>







<h2 id="h-nacon-could-shut-down-if-the-worst-happens">Nacon Could Shut Down If The Worst Happens</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nacon-CP-25.02.2026-English-Diffusion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the new press release</a>, published this morning at 8 AM CET, Nacon’s representatives wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To date, the Company reports that its available assets do not allow it to meet its due liabilities. In this ucontext, the Company will, as of today, file for insolvency (“déclaration de cessation des paiements”) with the Court and request the opening of judicial reorganisation proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”). </p>



<p>The aim of this procedure is to assess all possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of the Company’s activity under the best possible conditions, protect employees, and preserve jobs, while renegotiating with its creditors in a calm and constructive framework</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The company’s shares have ceased trading on the Paris market, and a court hearing has organised for early March to review the next steps for the firm.</p>



<p>Nacon was founded in 1981, dabbling in publishing, software, and peripherals over the years. It famously had a stint of distributing Sega’s Dreamcast consoles at the turn of the millennium. The company was originally known as Bigben Interactive, but it restructured in 2019, consolidating resources under the new ‘Nacon’ banner to bring together a dedicated gaming brand.</p>



<p>Bigben Group became the majority shareholder in Nacon, assuming control of more than 76% of shares.</p>



<p>This insolvency threatens a whopping 11 studios, including Spiders, Daedalic, Big Ant, Cyanide, and Kylotonn, all of which sit under the Nacon banner.</p>



<p>Cyanide is best known for the recent release of Styx: Blades of Greed. Big Ant is a studio focused almost exclusively on sports titles, Kylotonn most recently released Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, Spiders is the developer behind GreedFall, and Daedalic infamously developed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lotr-gollum-daedalic/" id="9681">The Lord of the Rings: Gollum</a> most recently.</p>



<p>The company is yet to deliver on the publishing and release of multiple games:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gear.Club Unlimited 3</li>



<li>GreedFall 2: The Dying World</li>



<li>Cthulu: The Cosmic Abyss</li>



<li>Endurance Motorsport</li>



<li>Edge of Memories</li>



<li>Dragonkin: The Banished</li>



<li>Hunting Simulator 3</li>
</ul>



<p>Nacon’s employees were notified of this news yesterday, February 24, and Nacon has promised to ‘keep the market informed as the situation and the proceedings develop.’</p>

<p>Pokémon Go offers a slew of content in the build-up to Go Tour Kalos, including some exclusive Timed Research that players must claim through code redemption.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" id="52102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a> Tour: Kalos takes place this weekend, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-tour-kalos-time-dates/" id="177591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 28 to March 1</a>, and comes off the back of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-day-presents-2026-date-time-length/" id="178159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Day on Friday</a>, where a slew of exciting news from the franchise is set to be shared.</p>



<p>If you want to make sure you don’t miss out on the Timed Research Codes in Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos, Insider Gaming has the crucial details you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-pokemon-go-tour-kalos-timed-research-codes">All Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos Timed Research Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Debuts. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are several Timed Research Codes available to claim around Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour: Kalos, with Unown the featured Pokémon</strong> <strong>in each.</strong></p>



<p>Various Unown forms are the focus of the Timed Research during the Kalos Tour, including X &amp; Y, the games where Kalos first featured, and Z &amp; A, referencing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a-2/" id="3627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, where players returned to Lumiose City.</p>



<p>Timed Research codes, as the name suggests, are only available to complete and earn rewards for a limited time. The tasks are easy to complete, however, and you should be able to tick through them quickly while you focus your attention on all the other offerings during Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos. </p>



<p>All the Timed Research codes for Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos are shown in the table below, alongside the Pokémon they feature.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Code</th><th data-align="center">Featured Pokémon</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>6K343X373BDQM</strong></td><td data-align="center">Unown Y</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>2PKXPAT2RJXKL</strong></td><td data-align="center">Unown Z &amp; A</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-timed-research-codes-in-pokemon-go">How to Redeem Timed Research Codes in Pokémon Go</h2>



<p><strong>All Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Timed Research Codes must be redeemed on the Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go webstore, and cannot be redeemed directly within the app.</strong></p>



<p>While this isn’t ideal if you’re out and about, the redemption process is quick and easy, with rewards available in the app immediately once redeemed.</p>



<p>The precise steps to redeeming the Timed Research Codes in Pokémon Go are shown below.</p>



<ol>
<li>Head to the Pokémon Go webstore.</li>



<li>Sign in to your account.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Code Redemption’ option at the top of the page.</li>



<li>Enter the code and click ‘Apply.’</li>



<li>When successfully redeemed, a notification will appear from Pokémon Go on your device.</li>



<li>Open Pokémon Go and complete the tasks!</li>
</ol>
