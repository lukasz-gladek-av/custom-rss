<p>No Man’s Sky has passed into the realm of ‘Very Positive’ on Steam after eight years on the market. The space-faring epic is one of the biggest rags-to-riches stories in gaming, and after eight years of solid updates and continuous content drops, it has managed to bump itself up a notch on the popular PC platform.</p>



<p>At launch, No Man’s Sky was crushed by negative reviews and paltry feedback that left players dismayed. The game had been a long time coming, and when it was released, it was in a shambolic state that put people off almost instantly.</p>

<h2 id="h-skyrocketing">Skyrocketing</h2>



<p>When Hello Games released No Man’s Sky, something of a panic took place. The developer became reclusive and impossible to reach, and the negative reviews continued piling up. The earliest updates failed to patch most of the game’s major problems, and the ambitious title became a laughing stock.</p>



<p>Over time, things stabilised, and the content was flowing regularly enough to keep a solid base of users entertained. By today, Hello Games has released a string of major updates that have left fans gobsmacked. With each new update, memes surface about Hello Games being <strong>too </strong>generous, with fans stressing that they’d happily pay for these sizeable expansions.</p>



<p>On Steam, No Man’s Sky just passed into ‘Very Positive’ where its all-time review count is concerned. It took this long to turn the numbers around, but today, the game is looking at a slew of reviews that are 82.1% positive, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/275850/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to SteamDB</a>.</p>



<p>When the game came out, only 30 – 40% of the reviews were positive.</p>



<p>That’s a turnaround tale for the history books.</p>
