<p>The date and time for Pokémon Presents 2026 have been revealed: it will air on February 27, 2026. </p>



<p>Pokémon Presents 2026 is an event fans of the franchise have been eagerly waiting for, as it will make all announcements about future games and other media properties they are working on. What’s more, the event falls on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-day-2026-pokemon-presents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon&nbsp;Day</a> 2026, and this year is the 30th anniversary of the franchise. </p>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-presents-2026-airs-on-february-27">Pokémon Presents 2026 Airs on February 27</h2>



<p>Announced through the official Pokémon <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/2024756120313807015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), Pokémon Presents 2026 will be hosted on February 27 at 6:00 AM PST.

<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-pokemon-presents-2026">What to Expect from Pokémon Presents 2026</h2>



<p>No official details about what Pokémon Presents 2026 will include have been revealed, so this is just speculation and based on previous rumours. Firstly, there has been a lot of talk about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-wind-waves-gen-10-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gen 10 game</a>, and hopefully, it will finally be revealed at this event. Moreover, we could get announcements for a new game, another live-action movie (maybe Detective Pikachu 2), or something in the anime industry. In the end, players will have to wait for an official announcement for sure. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/incursion-red-river-update-story-arc/</link>
            <guid>1441387</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Incursion Red River is fast becoming a must-have extraction shooter. We’ve been talking about Incursion since it shone at Steam Next Fest in February 2024, and later that year, a massive update hit the game in development, blowing it wide open.</p>



<p>Now, the team at Games of Tomorrow has unveiled the incoming 1.3 update, which features a massive story segment bolstered by voice acting provided by none other than the BAFTA-award-winning Jane Perry. It’s coming globally on February 25th, and if you’re at all interested in this game, you’ll want to see what it includes.</p>







<h2 id="h-incursion-red-river-continues-to-grow">Incursion Red River Continues to Grow</h2>



<p>In 2023, Incursion Red River was known as PROJECT QUARANTINE, but a major rebrand overhauled the game’s identity and pushed it into the realms that we know now. In April 2024, the game launched in early access, and it has been under ongoing development ever since.</p>



<p>This new update, 1.3, is perhaps the most ambitious the team at Games of Tomorrow has produced thus far.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Games of Tomorrow revealed the 1.3 update has pushed them ‘to the absolute limit’, allowing them to ‘go beyond the boundaries originally set for the project.’</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’ve pushed ourselves to the absolute limit with this one…</p><p>With Update 1.3, we tried to go beyond the boundaries we originally set for the project and deliver something truly substantial.</p><p>With a full story chapter featuring 23 missions, voice by <a href="https://twitter.com/TheJanePerry?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TheJanePerry</a>, and… <a href="https://t.co/36tLqEJMfY">pic.twitter.com/36tLqEJMfY</a></p></div>— Incursion Red River (@IncursionRR) <a href="https://twitter.com/IncursionRR/status/2024140999560147145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The 1.3 update includes a full story segment comprised of 23 missions, with voice work from Jane Perry, a legendary actor. It also introduces Solarint to the universe, hired as an AI programmer after his success on SP-Tarkov’s SAIN AI mod. The team wrote in a recent blog post:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>AI behavior has been completely rebuilt. It will feel fundamentally different to the enemies you will encounter in 1.2.</p>



<p>We are aiming for grounded and realistic behavior. Bots won’t be doing jumpshots or anything that a person in their situation wouldn’t plausibly do.</p>



<p>This first version is designed to be a solid framework to build off in future updates. That means it is not feature complete and some behavior is placeholder until the systems can be made to support it as intended. Even so, we think it will be a very compelling upgrade compared to 1.2.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This means that AI enemies have had their pathing, movement, tactical positioning, difficulty, and focus upgraded.</p>



<p>Incursion Red River is one of those extraction shooters that deserves way more attention than it gets. All-time, it peaked at 2,478 concurrent users on Steam, which isn’t at all indicative of the game’s quality. When we played the game during pre-release in 2024, we were pleasantly surprised at how well it handled.</p>



<p>It’s worthstressing that it’s a PvE shooter with cooperative elements, which isn’t typical for the extraction genre, and that’s perhaps why it hasn’t hit lofty heights <strong>yet</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[FURIA Has Stripped Entire Rainbow Six Siege Roster (Except for HerdsZ)]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/furia-rainbow-six-roster-dropped/</link>
            <guid>1441384</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FURIA has unveiled a major restructuring effort that has resulted in the removal of <strong>almost </strong>the entire Rainbow Six Siege roster. The only player to survive the culling is Gustavo ‘Herdz’ Herdina, the sole member to retain his spot with the organization.</p>



<p>The roster that was just dismissed was the former w7m team that claimed the top spot at the Six Invitational 2024, securing a $1 million prize after having dominated at the BLAST Atlanta Major and BLAST Copenhagen Major the year before.</p>







<h2 id="h-furia-s-rainbow-six-presence-drops">FURIA’s Rainbow Six Presence Drops</h2>



<p>FURIA is now sitting without a roster after falling out of this year’s Six Invitational in sixth place. The organization made it into the playoffs in Paris, but back-to-back losses against Team Falcons and Fluxo W7M were enough to eliminate the Brazilian roster from the running.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it was FaZe Clan, a <strong>different </strong>Brazilian unit, that went on to win the Six Invitational. It was a historic victory, as it cemented FaZe Clan as the first back-to-back Six Invitational winner <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>All eyes are now on the team that will be built around HerdsZ, the last player left on FURIA after the cleanout. That’s not all, though, as fans of Rainbow Six esports will be eager to see if the dismissed roster remains a squad and moves on to a new home together, just as they did from w7m into FURIA.</p>



<p>There’s now something of an off-season before the big events start popping up again. Our next BLAST R6 Major will land in May in Salt Lake City, which gives teams plenty of time to get their ducks in a row.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ve got any idea what will happen next with FURIA.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you’ve made it to the end of another tough week. Your reward for making it this far is another string of NYT Connections hints and answers. It’s not much, but it’s all I have! If you scroll down, you’ll get the NYT Connections solutions you need to solve today’s puzzle as quickly as possible.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[WWE Files New ‘WWE Eras Collide’ Gaming Trademark]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-files-new-wwe-eras-collide-gaming-trademark/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE has filed three new video game trademarks.</p>



<p>On February 18, WWE filed to trademark the terms “WWE Domination,” “WWE Generations,” and “WWE Eras Collide.” All three trademarks have the same description, noting that they’re used for video games.</p>



<p>“Trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of video and computer game software; video games software for use with wireless devices; downloadable video games software for use via a global computer network and wireless devices; interactive video game programs and computer game cartridges; interactive multimedia computer games on all platforms comprised of computer hardware and computer game software; electronic games software that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device,” the official trademark description reads.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-games-in-the-past-have-focused-on-the-clash-of-eras">WWE Games in the Past Have Focused on the Clash of Eras</h2>



<p>In 2011, WWE released WWE All Stars. Published by THQ, the game focused on pairing the stars of yesteryear against the then-modern stars of WWE. The game was an arcade-style break from the usual simulation releases the sports entertainment juggernaut puts out annually.</p>



<p>No game has since been directly focused on the collision of different eras in WWE history. However, every year, several generations are represented in the WWE 2K video game series. </p>







<p>It is not certain whether these trademarks will lead to a new video game release, and if that game will be released on mobile or console devices. Still, it’s been several years since WWE has tried something new in the gaming realm, and any sign of a fresh idea could be fun for that fan base.</p>
