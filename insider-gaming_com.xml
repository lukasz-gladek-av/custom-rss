<p>Aim is everything in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a>, as you’ll need to stay accurate to get the fastest TTK possible. While using the meta <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-krig-c-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-dragons-breath-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attachments</a> helps a lot, having the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-black-ops-6-controller-settings-aiming-combat-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best and most comfortable aim settings</a> can be extremely beneficial, especially on controller.</p>



<p>This is mainly due to Aim Assist, and while it’s been nerfed in BO6, it remains a fundamental advantage that controller players will want to make the most of. That said, here are the best Aim Assist settings in Black Ops 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-aim-assist-settings-in-bo6">Best Aim Assist Settings in BO6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Sensitivity Multiplier: </strong>Preference</li>



<li><strong>Look Inversion (On Foot): </strong>Standard</li>



<li>Aiming Advanced Settings
<ul>
<li><strong>Look Inversion (all):</strong> Standard</li>



<li><strong>ADS Sensitivity Transition Timing:</strong> Gradual</li>



<li><strong>3rd Person ADS Correction Type: </strong>Assist</li>



<li><strong>Aim Response Curve Type:</strong> Standard</li>



<li><strong>Custom Sensitivity Per Zoom:</strong> Off</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Target Aim Assist: </strong>On</li>



<li><strong>Motion Sensor Behavior:</strong> Off</li>
</ul>



<p>The most important setting here is Target Aim Assist as if you turn this off, you won’t receive any help when your crosshairs are near an enemy. It’s important to note that Aim Assist has been nerfed in BO6, as the devs reduced its strength when in close-quarters combat. Also, there are no longer multiple Aim Assist options, with the devs deciding to simplify the aiming system for controller.</p>



<p>Other controller settings like Sensitivity and Deadzone Inputs will further help your accuracy and therefore increase the effectiveness of Aim Assist, so it’s important to have these settings dialed in too. We recommend playing around with different Sensitivity settings and choosing one that feels comfortable, and as for Deadzone, reduce the right stick value to as low as 3, but if your stick is drifting, increase this value until the drift stops.</p>

<h2 id="h-where-to-find-aim-assist-setting-in-bo6">Where to find Aim Assist setting in BO6</h2>



<ol>
<li>Boot up Call of Duty.</li>



<li>Go to Black Ops 6.</li>



<li>Head to Settings.</li>



<li>Scroll to the Controller tab and then Aiming.</li>



<li>You’ll find Aim Assist under the second section.</li>
</ol>



<p>Aim Assist is a controversial topic for competitive online FPS games, as the war between mouse and keyboard vs controller continues. </p>

<p>As per the latest reports, Pokemon TCG Pocket has raked in over $120.8 million between October 30 and November 17, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to data from <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AppMagic</a> (shared via <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-surges-past-100-million-in-17-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PocketGamer</a>), Pokemon TCG Pocket reached over $100 million in earnings on November 15 and exceeded $120 million by November 17.

<p>In its first week, Pokemon TCG Pocket earned $35.8 million. In the second week, earnings increased to $48.5 million, and in the third week, they reached $37.2 million with a few days still remaining.</p>



<p>When it comes to regional spending, fans from Japan are the most significant contributors, accounting for 42% of the global expenditure, with a total of $50.6 million spent. The United States follows, making up 28% of global spending with $33.6 million.</p>



<p>The Pokémon TCG Pocket has made an impressive debut, surpassing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-crossed-30-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30 million downloads in just the first 9 days</a> and generating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-already-earned-over-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over $12 million in revenue within the first 4 days</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cdl-2025-competitive-settings-revealed-%E2%80%93-maps-modes-and-restrictions.1039155/</guid>

<p>The Call of Duty League has published the full spread of competitive settings ahead of the 2025 season. On social media, the unveiling caused some issues with fans worldwide, especially concerning the mapset that has been lined up for the CDL 2025 season. It’s not amazing, and many fans are clinging to the hope that a resurgence of old maps will make their way into the pool.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cdl-2025-season-settings-unveiled">CDL 2025 Season Settings Unveiled</h2>



<p>The map list for the 2025 season of the Call of Duty League isn’t amazing, and many are wondering why Control is still a thing.</p>



<p>Here’s the spread:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hardpoint: </strong>Protocol, Red Card, Rewind, Skyline, Vault</li>



<li><strong>Search and Destroy: </strong>Protocol, Red Card, Rewind, Skyline, Vault</li>



<li><strong>Control: </strong>Protocol, Vault</li>
</ul>



<p>Having just two maps for Control is a bit of a nightmare, and it’s yet another year that fans are clamouring and asking for a different mode to fill the competitive slot. For the longest time, people have asked for something like CTF or Blitz to make a return to the Call of Duty esports scene, to no avail.</p>



<p>The settings put forward by the Call of Duty League <a href="https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/competitive-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a recent guide</a> are mostly typical and nothing has changed from last season, but it’s in the restricted items that things start getting interesting. During the pre-season window, we’ve seen plenty of GAs get lobbied around, but the official rules from Activision are something else.</p>



<p>As usual, the need to keep things as balanced as possible is front and centre, and with that in mind, almost every perk and streak is eliminated. Only the RC-XD and Hellstorm missiles remain in the scorestreak selection.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the CDL 2025 season? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
