<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is Ubisoft’s second-biggest launch to date, just behind Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.</p>



<p>That’s according to Insider Gaming sources, who have provided data for the last three mainline Assassin’s Creed titles. The information was <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1904177799419634137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted public on my ow</a><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1904177799419634137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">n</a><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1904177799419634137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> X</a> (formerly Twitter) account a few hours ago. </p>



<p>According to our sources, who have obtained the information via Ubisoft’s own tracking tools (and have provided such data on past titles), it shows that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is behind that of Valhalla, but ahead of Odyssey.</p>



<p>Last week, Ubisoft announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-surpasses-odyssey-and-origins-launch-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">past two million players just two days after launch</a> and one million players one day after launch.</p>



<p>According to the data, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla achieved 2.55 million players on its first day, whereas Odyssey achieved just shy of 1M (roughly 430,00 during early access).</p>



<p>At the time of writing (March 24), Shadows is tracking to hit three million players in the coming days. According to its trajectory, Shadows could hit roughly six million players within its first month, but its worth pointing out that the game has released in Q1, compared to other successful Assassin’s Creed games that release in the holiday season.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla did 8M in its first month, whereas Odyssey did 3.4 million. </p>



<p>At the time of writing, Odyssey currently has the most unique players of any Assassin’s Creed title sitting at over 40 million.</p>



<p>As always pointed out online, these are <strong>player numbers and not sales</strong>, but we should here more on the games performance from Ubisoft themselves in the coming months. </p>
