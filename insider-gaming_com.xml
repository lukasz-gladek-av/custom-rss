<p>No Man’s Sky has received a new Halloween update called Breach, and it is free for existing players. </p>



<p>The Voyagers update has been big for No Man’s Sky, not only introducing a lot of new things to the game, but also helping the game experience&nbsp;a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-enjoys-resurgence-after-anniversary-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge resurgence</a> on Steam. The latest Breach update will build towards features introduced in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voyagers</a>, including ship assembly, space-walking, skydiving, and community spirit. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-no-man-s-sky-s-breach-update">What’s New in No Man’s Sky’s Breach Update</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As mentioned above, the Breach Expedition is a Halloween update for No Man’s Sky, making players traverse a desolate and abandoned universe as they explore wrecks of ill-fated corvette ships, which can be scavenged for ship modules that can be added to your ship-building arsenal. These wrecks feature all types of corvette pieces, including rare&nbsp;vertical parts&nbsp;which unlock a whole new range of&nbsp;build configurations.</p>



<p>The Breach update also introduces exclusive expedition rewards, and a set of Atlas-themed modules is among them. As players go on their scavenging spree, they will learn about the fate of the “jewel in the crown of these wreckages”, Fireship Arcadia. On this expedition, players will journey through the “ominous and exotic&nbsp;purple-star solar systems”, first seen in the Worlds Part II update. The expedition is available from today and will last for approximately 3 weeks. </p>

<h3 id="h-space-wreckage">Space Wreckage </h3>



<p>In the far reaches of deep space,&nbsp;wrecked corvettes&nbsp;can now be encountered and salvaged. Step out into&nbsp;zero-gravity&nbsp;to explore these hollow hulks, and&nbsp;equip your Multi-Tool laser&nbsp;to dismantle their valuable modules – then repurpose this scrap to&nbsp;build your dream ship&nbsp;at a Corvette Workshop.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-corvette-modules">New Corvette Modules</h3>



<p>A significant number of new corvette modules are now salvageable from deep-space corvette wrecks and planetary scrapheaps. These include new&nbsp;landing gear,&nbsp;shields,&nbsp;weapons,&nbsp;connectors, and a number of&nbsp;highly-requested wedge-shaped modules&nbsp;that enable a huge variety of creative and complicated corvette builds.</p>



<h3 id="h-quality-of-life">Quality of Life </h3>



<p>In addition to the bundle of fixes, improvements, and new features in today’s update, the No Man’s Sky team have been hard at work on improving Voyagers since its launch in August. Notably,&nbsp;snapping&nbsp;is greatly improved,&nbsp;collision&nbsp;is more robust, and the Corvette Workshop now offers the option to&nbsp;apply a colour palette to an entire corvette. There has never been a better time to build a corvette!</p>



<h3 id="h-breach-expedition-rewards">Breach Expedition Rewards </h3>



<p><strong>Event Horizon, Eternal Serpents, and Siren of the Stars Posters</strong></p>



<p>These decorative posters commemorating the Breach expedition depict a deep-space&nbsp;gravitational anomaly, the&nbsp;tileable eternal serpent of time, and a&nbsp;betentacled siren, poised to begin its mucal embrace…</p>



<p><strong>Aeron Cowling &amp; Diffuser</strong></p>



<p>The geometry of these corvette modules is ancient and unmistakable, shaped by the crimson heartbeat of the universe itself.</p>



<p>The extruded&nbsp;Aeron Cowling&nbsp;and&nbsp;Aeron Diffuser&nbsp;hull plates add a bold, angular appearance to your corvette’s silhouette.</p>



<p><strong>Wings of Aeron</strong></p>



<p>This Atlas-themed&nbsp;wing module&nbsp;stabilises the corvette during atmospheric flight.</p>



<p><strong>Aeron Powershield</strong></p>



<p>The Aeron Powershield is linked to the corvette’s&nbsp;shielding system, providing a significant performance boost to the ship’s defence array.</p>



<p><strong>Aeron Winglet, Aeron Pillar &amp; Aeron Pyramid</strong></p>



<p>These&nbsp;decorative Atlas-themed modules&nbsp;can be affixed to the corvette exterior, furthering the ship’s devotion to the crimson entity.</p>



<p><strong>Aeron Starship Trail</strong></p>



<p>This engine modification injects the Starship&nbsp;exhaust trail&nbsp;with an&nbsp;arterial streak of crimson.</p>



<p><strong>Aeron Drive &amp; Aeron Blade</strong></p>



<p>Design a hefty, heavyweight&nbsp;Atlas corvette&nbsp;with the bulky&nbsp;Aeron Drive, or favour a more lightweight, sleek aesthetic with the streamlined&nbsp;Aeron Blade&nbsp;wing.</p>

<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion, the 2D Beat ‘Em Up from Dotemu and Tribute Games, finally has a release date. </p>



<p>On Wednesday, it was announced that Marvel Cosmic Invasion will launch on <strong>Monday, December 1.</strong> The release date was confirmed at the end of the latest trailer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-demo-data-mine-heroes-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introducing the game’s final two</a> playable characters: Phoenix and Iron Man.</p>



<p>Available for PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2, Marvel Cosmic Invasion is based on the Annihilation storyline from the mid-2000s. In the game, Annihilus has launched an attack across the galaxy, where it’s up to you to fight your way through enemies to stop the Annihilation Wave.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion, while looking like a standard side-scrolling 2D fighting game, introduces new mechanics to the genre, like its “Cosmic Swap” system. This system allows players to quickly swap out with another character as they play. </p>



<p>From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Preview</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>…it’s not all about just swapping in and out because you want to use a certain character. Instead, there’s a strategy to who you decide to choose and how you use them.</p>



<p>In my playthrough I chose Spider-Man and Venom as my two characters. Immediately, you can find synergy between them. I would throw enemies into the air with Venom only to quickly switch to Spider-Man for a swinging kick. I’d then hit my opponent in the air with Spider-Man, switch to Venom and chomp away across the screen. The variety of combinations you can pull off, even if they don’t necessarily flow or make sense, adds a level of depth to the combat that’s rarely seen in a beat ’em up.</p>

<p>With less than a week until its launch, the Battlefield 6 Season 1 trailer has been released, previewing what’s to come for players. </p>



<p>The trailer, which you can watch below, gives players a first look at the new Blackwell Fields map along with the Strikepoint game mode.</p>



<p><strong>“Season 1 rolls out in three phases with new hardware, gadgets, maps, and monthly drops for Portal,”</strong> EA said. <strong>“Blackwell Fields spans besieged facilities and homesteads under a burning horizon, supporting all combat sizes with land and air. Eastwood turns a quiet villa and golf retreat into a frontline, with land vehicles and helicopters in play.”</strong></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 Season 1 starts with the aforementioned new map and mode, along with three new weapons, a new attachment, and a new vehicle. The new weapons coming to the game are the SOR-300SC rifle, GGH-22 pistol, and the Mini Scout sniper rifle.</p>
