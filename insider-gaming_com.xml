<p>Nintendo’s Metroid Prime 4: Beyond has not only emerged from the shadows in recent times, but it’s ready to step into the spotlight altogether with a full-scale Metroid Prime 4: Beyond release.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-gameplay-new-unlisted-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> didn’t just go off the grid after it was announced in 2017; it disappeared into obscurity. It wasn’t to be seen or heard from again until Samus and co finally got a proper update in June 2024. Aptly, everyone is primed for Metroid’s launch in 2025, and Insider Gaming has its release date, start time info, and more.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Feel the power. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches exclusively on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on December 4.</strong></p>







<p>18 years after Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, the world gets to go Beyond. There will be reasons galore as to why it’s taken so long to make, but no one should think about this for now. Instead, start checking you have space on your Nintendo Switch consoles, make sure you’ve got the day booked off work, and everyone can find out why Metroid Prime 4: Beyond took so long to get here.</p>



<p>Side note: You can buy and play Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on either the Nintendo Switch or its Switch 2 upgrade. The more the merrier, especially in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/top-holiday-video-games-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Holiday</a> season!</p>

<figure><figcaption>It’s sure to make a big landing. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Almost all Nintendo first-party games go live at 7 AM PT on release day, meaning Metroid should be available at 7 AM PT on December 4, with other regions to follow.</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo has said this about its first-party titles in the past. There’s no reason why it wouldn’t be the same, so here are the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond release dates and times in key regions, based on existing information.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">7:00 AM—December 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM—December 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">10:00 AM—December 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Grenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3:00 PM—December 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT)</td><td data-align="center">4:00 AM—December 5</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Where Winds Meet has reached a huge milestone: 9 million players in 2 weeks since launch. </p>



<p>The free-to-play RPG from Everstone Studios and NetEase Games was expected to do well at launch after Where Winds Meet managed to surpass 10 million pre-registrations, hitting the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-hits-10m-pre-registrations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final community goal</a> ahead of the title’s launch. Now, the devs have revealed that the game only took 14 days to reach a new milestone. </p>



<h2 id="h-where-winds-meet-shows-no-signs-of-stopping">Where Winds Meet Shows No Signs of Stopping</h2>



<p>The new title from Everstone Studio and NetEase Games was released on November 14, 2025, and has been going strong ever since. It reached an all-time peak of 251,008 on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3564740/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> a week ago and has been averaging over 150,000 concurrent players at the time of writing. Where Winds Meet reached 9 million players across two platforms: PlayStation 5 and PC. The mobile release hasn’t happened yet, and pre-registrations are open at the moment. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Where Winds Meet is a Wuxia open-world action-adventure RPG set in ancient China in the tenth century. Players get to embody the role of a young swordmaster who is on a quest to&nbsp;uncover forgotten truths and solve the mysteries of their own identity. </p>



<p>The game features Wuxia—style traversal: scale rooftops, glide through the air, or use fast travel to navigate between regions swiftly. There are also options for combat, including melee, ranged, and stealth playstyles, with weapons such as swords, spears, dual blades, rope darts, bows, fans, and umbrellas. The game features over 20 unique regions with diverse characters, authentic activities, ancient cities, forgotten tombs, and much more. </p>

            <guid>1369576</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale has released its PC performance and system requirements for the game, which is scheduled to go into early access on January 13, 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-hytale-system-requirements">Hytale System Requirements</h2>







<div><p>Hytale requires both a 64-bit processor and operating system.</p><p>● <strong>Minimum:</strong> Targeting 30+ FPS at 1080p on Low preset.<br>● <strong>Recommended:</strong> Targeting 60+ FPS at 1080p on High preset.<br><strong>● Creator/Streamer:</strong> Stable framerate with high-quality video capture and streaming at<br>1440p.</p><p>These categories reflect actual in-house testing across low-end integrated GPUs, mid-range<br>laptops, and high-end recording setups.</p></div>



<h3 id="h-minimum-requirements-1080p-30-fps">Minimum Requirements (1080p @ 30 FPS)</h3>



<div><p>●<strong> OS:</strong> 64-bit Windows 10 (version 1809), Windows 11</p><p>● <strong>CPU: </strong>Intel Core i5-7500 (or equivalent), AMD Ryzen 3 1200 (or equivalent)</p><p>● <strong>RAM:</strong><br>○ Singleplayer, with dedicated graphics: 8 GB<br>○ Singleplayer, with integrated graphics: 12 GB<br>○ Multiplayer-only: 8 GB</p><p>● <strong>GPU:</strong><br><strong> Integrated:</strong> <br>■ Intel UHD Graphics 620<br>■ AMD Radeon Vega 3○ <br><strong>Dedicated:</strong><br>■ NVIDIA GTX 900 Series<br>■ AMD Radeon 400 Series<br>■ Intel Arc A-Series<br><strong>Deprecation notice: Support for Vulkan 1.3 will be required in the future.<br></strong><br><strong>● Storage: </strong>SATA SSD with 20 GB of free space</p><p><strong>● Network:</strong> 2 Mbit/s connection for multiplayer (UDP/QUIC compatible).</p><p><em>Based on benchmarks where Intel HD Graphics 630 achieved ~30–34 FPS at 1080p. We definitely recommend setting the “view distance” to 192 blocks. Ensure that no other programs are running to guarantee performance.</em></p></div>



<h3 id="h-recommended-requirements-1080p-60-fps">Recommended Requirements (1080p @ 60 FPS)</h3>







<div><p>● <strong>OS: </strong>64-bit Windows 10 (version 1809), Windows 11</p><p>● <strong>CPU: </strong>Intel Core i5-10400 (or equivalent), AMD Ryzen 5 3600 (or equivalent)</p><p>● <strong>RAM: </strong>16 GB</p><p>● <strong>GPU:</strong><br><strong>Integrated:</strong><br>■ Intel Iris Xe Graphics<br>■ AMD Radeon 660M<br><strong>Dedicated:</strong><br>■ NVIDIA GTX 900 Series<br>■ AMD Radeon 400 Series<br>■ Intel Arc A-Series<br><strong>Deprecation notice: Support for Vulkan 1.3 will be required in the future.</strong><br><strong><br>● Storage:</strong> SSD with 20 GB of free space</p><p><strong>● Network</strong>: 8 Mbit/s connection for multiplayer (UDP/QUIC compatible)</p></div>



<h3 id="h-storage-requirements">Storage Requirements</h3>



<div><p>Hytale procedurally generates a world that can, in practice, grow without a fixed limit. Based on extensive playtime in exploration mode, we found these numbers to be representative of a normal playthrough. Keep in mind: the more you explore, customize, and build with a wide variety of blocks, the more memory and storage the game will require.</p><p>● Installation size: 8 GB<br>● Saved game size (in Exploration mode):<br>○ ~661 MB for 5000×5000 blocks<br>○ ~27 KB per 32×32 chunk</p></div>



<h3 id="h-recording-streamer-requirements-1440p-60-fps">Recording / Streamer Requirements (1440p @ 60 FPS)</h3>



<div><p>For players who want to record, stream, or produce Hytale content with stable framerates during high-bitrate capture. The goal here is not raw FPS but consistent frametime under heavy load (large battles, complex builds, high view distance, simultaneous server simulation if in singleplayer).</p><p><strong>Suggested Setup</strong><br><strong><br></strong>● <strong>OS: </strong>64-bit Windows 10 (version 1809), Windows 11</p><p>● <strong>CPU: </strong>Intel Core i7-10700K (or equivalent), AMD Ryzen 9 3800X (or equivalent)</p><p>● <strong>RAM: </strong>32 GB</p><p>●<strong> GPU:</strong><br>○ NVIDIA RTX 30 Series<br>○ AMD Radeon RX 7000 Series<br>○ Intel Arc A-series</p><p><em>Note: These recommendations are made as newer graphics cards provide much better video quality for a given bitrate, especially for livestreaming scenarios. If supported, we also strongly recommend the use of AV1 / HEVC for video recording.</em><br><em><br></em>● <strong>Storage:</strong><br>○ NVMe SSD with at least 10% (or 50 GB) of free space available.<br><em>Note: For best performance, we recommend using a separate drive for video recording.</em><br><em><br></em>One internal benchmark (AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D, NVIDIA RTX 5080, 2×32 GB DDR5-6000) sustained around 400 FPS at 3840×1440 resolution with view distance set to 768 blocks in singleplayer while recording the game in AV1. This tier is optional but helpful for creators who want stable 60+ FPS at high resolutions during recording sessions.</p></div>

<p>Fortnite devs revealed in a new post that the Chapter 7 launch featured 10.5 million players and over 3 million tuned in across livestream platforms. </p>



<p>Chapter 7 Season 1 for Fortnite is already live, introducing players to a brand new island where the battle bus has been destroyed, and players have been tasked to collect the missing parts. Before Chapter 7 launched, Fortnite held a Zero Hour event that brought swarms of players to the title. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-7-launch-had-over-3-million-players-tuned-in">Fortnite Chapter 7 Launch Had Over 3 Million Players Tuned In</h2>



<p>The announcement of the new player stats comes from Fortnite’s post on <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1994855116869116102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). The post states, “Absolute Cinema: 10.5M of you joined us in-game for Zero Hour, and 3M+ tuned in across livestream platforms!” Fortnite’s Chapter 6 Zero Hour event, bringing millions of players, wasn’t a surprise as it featured a jam-packed event filled with collaborations. We also saw the likes of Playboi Carti, Hatsune Miku, and more. The end also featured an Avengers: Endgame type of event, where so many past collabs of Fortnite returned.</p>



<p>For those wondering about the new chapter, Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 introduced a brand new map called Golden Coast. You have to reach this map by using Storm Surf, as the Battle Bus is out of commission. The update also introduced new gameplay features, including the addition of self-revive, drivable reboot vans, turning into bosses, and more. </p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite is reportedly looking to add a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-getting-gulag-mechanic-similar-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone-style Gulag mechanic</a>. Fortnite featured Quentin Tarantino’s ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-to-feature-quentin-tarantinos-dream-kill-bill-chapter-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dream’ Kill Bill chapter</a> last month.

<p>GTA 6 has the eyes of the world on it, from players to developers and publishers. It’s the biggest video game ever, and there’s no doubt about this. It’s been two years since Rockstar Games dropped a sacred piece of history on our laps with the GTA 6 reveal trailer, and no one’s been the same since.</p>



<p>The first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> trailer debuted nearly two years to the day on December 5. Rockstar actually announced the trailer’s launch several days in advance, and it meant that everyone was locked in. We’re coming up to the trailer’s second anniversary, and it’s a moment of reflection on a long journey.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-6-trailer-1-turns-2-in-december">GTA 6 Trailer 1 Turns 2 In December</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Our time will all come. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s every chance Rockstar Games was going to drop GTA 6’s first trailer without warning. However, a leak beforehand forced Rockstar’s hand, and the company revealed the first trailer’s date in advance.</p>







<p>Vice City has never looked better than it did in Trailer 1. We also got our first glimpse into the mysterious new characters of Lucia and Jason. Eventually, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-2-is-live-featuring-jason-and-lucia/">GTA Trailer 2</a> <em>was </em>shadow-dropped, but it’s been two years since the record-breaking first trailer, and it’s incredible how little has been shown from the full game since—such as any discernible, official gameplay footage (not the leaks). </p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-1-allegedly-becomes-number-one-youtube-trailer-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 allegedly became the number one YouTube trailer of all time</a>.</p>



<p>We continue to wait for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-3-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Trailer 3</a>, and it’s amazing how ravenous the community becomes when so much as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-video-in-development-grand-theft-auto-rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">short in-development video of GTA 6</a> appears online!</p>



<p>The latest GTA 6 delay means it’ll be close to three years since Trailer 1 was announced. If you fancy a quick reminder of what’s coming, or feel a mini-wave of nostalgia close to Christmas, check out Grand Theft Auto 6’s reveal trailer here.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 developers have made a very cryptic post that teases a new update for December 2025, which also falls during the game’s fifth anniversary. </p>



<p>Recently, CD Projekt Red provided us with some information on how they are laying the foundation for Cyberpunk 2, with plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-adds-50-new-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase the dev team</a> for the game by a tremendous amount by 2027. However, right now we are looking at the original title, Cyberpunk 2077, which seems to be getting more content 5 years after release. </p>



<h2 id="h-could-cyberpunk-2077-get-update-2-4-in-december-2025">Could Cyberpunk 2077 Get Update 2.4 in December 2025?</h2>



<p>No concrete details were revealed about Cyberpunk 2077’s new update in their latest post on <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1995500633277755416" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter); however, they did mention some dates in cryptic messages for players to look out for. The new post includes the words “SECURE COMMS CHANNEL ESTABLISHED. STANDBY FOR INCOMING PRIORITY TRANSMISSION…” The post also includes an image of a calendar that lists Cyberpunk 2077 for December 10, Solomon Reed for December 12, and Songbird for December 29. </p>

<p>There are no other details in the post, and all players can do right now is wait for these dates to find out for sure what the Cyberpunk 2077 devs are cooking up. The game’s fifth anniversary arrives on December 10, 2025, so there’s a chance we’ll learn more on or before that date. Many players have been anticipating the announcement of update 2.4 for Cyberpunk 2077, which might introduce new features and content, and there’s a chance this is it. </p>
