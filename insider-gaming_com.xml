<p>The PlayStation 5 has long since replaced the PlayStation 4 as the de facto Sony gaming console. However, if Marvel Rivals is on PS4, it would incorporate a ton of extra players who are yet to upgrade to the latest generation of hardware.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals is a technical…marvel. It looks stunning and its cel-shaded graphics pop on modern-day consoles and the latest PC rigs. Not only this, but a 6v6 match featuring a constant stream of projectiles, moving parts, and superhero taunts requires a lot of manpower. If you want to play Marvel Rivals on the PS4 though, it opens up a new line of questioning.</p>



<p>NetEase surely wants as many people playing the hero shooter as possible, but technical limitations are a constant barrier for many AAA games nowadays. Let’s see what the developer decided for Marvel Rivals and its PS4 fate—we already know its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marvel-rivals-on-ps5-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5</a> compatibility.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-on-ps4">Is Marvel Rivals on PS4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re Doomed, all Doomed. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals is not available to play on PS4. Developer NetEase has restricted the free-to-play shooter’s platform releases to the PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a sad, harrowing reality of gaming in 2024. The PlayStation 4 (and its Pro upgrade) were once considered the pinnacle of console gaming. Now, they are becoming relics companies hardly take time to consider. Marvel Rivals isn’t alone in this neglect—so think twice before harboring a grudge!</p>



<p>I’m no expert, but I think it has a lot to do with developers unwilling to devolve their vision for a title. For example, a PS5 has a lot more power than the PS4, and therefore the main development is done with the PS5 in mind. A PS4 is very limited compared to its younger brother, and sacrifices need to be made.</p>



<p>As we’ve seen with Switch ports trying to imitate titles released on superior hardware, a dumbed-down version of a game isn’t necessarily worthwhile—or reflective of its quality. Therefore, many new releases are kept for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It doesn’t necessarily a PS4 port is dead as stranger things have happened.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/news/20241205/40185_1198415.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals release FAQ</a> mentions “Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, Epic Store, and our official website (Loading Bay)” as the available platforms—not specifying which versions of those platforms. So if you’re a PS4 user desperate to yeet Captain America’s shield like a boomerang, all isn’t completely lost. We’ll update this guide in case anything changes. </p>

<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’s 5.0 update introduces an Obelisk Operation, a new enemy and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-space-marine-2-obelisk-update-details">Space Marine 2 Obelisk Update Details&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Space Marine 2’s Obelisk Operation takes players to Demerium. Here, their goal is to disrupt the flow of energy protecting an Aurora device. To do that, you must rotate a replica of the obelisk. However, the console control of the device is placed deep into the heart of a “tomb plunged into darkness”. The operation is set to occur “parallel to the final events of the campaign.”</p>



<p>Space Marine 2’s Obelisk Update also introduces a new Majoris enemy called Tzaangor Enlightened. This disk-flying, melee/ranged-hybrid enemy will be found in all Operations featuring the Thousand Suns and should be considered a formidable opponent when in great numbers. The way to bring them down is to catch them after a parry or during a long animation; the developers have advised using a Target Lock when facing this enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, the update also brings new Season Pass content with the Dark Angels Chapter Pack. Season Pass owners can grab Dark Angels Successor Chapters cosmetics, including Dark Angels Champion skin (Bulwark) and weapon skins for Auto Bolt Rifle, Plasma Pistol, Power Sword and Bulwark’s Storm Shield.&nbsp;</p>
