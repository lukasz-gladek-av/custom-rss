<p>Insider Gaming is proud to announce its debut virtual showcase.</p>



<p>Airing on <strong>May 28th at 3pm ET/12pm PT/8pm UK across Insider Gaming’s YouTube and social media platforms</strong>, the Insider Gaming Showcase comes to you with the goal of helping games get funded or find publisher backing.</p>



<p>But why? Well, to put it simply, the gaming industry is going through unprecedented times, and one of the hardest challenges that developers currently face is funding, and it’s only getting more difficult. That’s why we want to use our outlet and its exposure to help games get seen – <strong>completely free of charge</strong> to developers.</p>



<p>The showcase will feature nonstop, back-to-back game trailers, with no fluff in between to distract viewers from the awesome games currently in development. We’ll also feature a “concept” section in the showcase, featuring amazing concept art and ideas of games that haven’t yet reached a stage of development where footage can be shown.</p>



<p>Following the showcase, we will have separate deep-dive video interviews with the developers, in addition to written coverage on our website and in the app, so viewers can learn more about the games and the developers behind them.</p>



<p>In addition, Insider Gaming will also act as a PR agency to a loose degree. We will be working with other outlets and content creators before, during, and after the showcase to facilitate potential interviews to help get the games seen by as many different audiences as possible, again, free of charge.</p>



<p>To take things one step further, Insider Gaming will also compile all the games from the showcase into a dossier containing the contact information for each featured game, which we will send to our extensive list of investors, VC’s, and publishers after the show. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has high ambitions for the showcase, aiming to add at least 1 million cumulative new wishlists for the games we feature.</p>



<p>Moving past May 28th, we also want the showcase to be a recurring event, with a second showcase tentatively planned for December, with two shows a year moving forward.</p>



<p>Of course, we’re not ignorant of the fact that putting on a showcase costs time and money, and that’s why, behind the scenes, we’ve already partnered with a few companies to sponsor the show and are actively looking for a few more to help support this great initiative in times when developers need the exposure.</p>



<p>You can contact Tom Henderson at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#99edf6f4d9f0f7eaf0fdfcebb4fef8f4f0f7feb7faf6f4" id="mailto:tom@insider-gaming.com">tom(a)insider-gaming.com</a> if you would like to sponsor the show. Developers can now submit their games by <strong>emailing Insider Gaming’s Executive Editor Mike Straw at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8ce1e5efe4ede9e0cce5e2ffe5e8e9fea1ebede1e5e2eba2efe3e1">michael(a)insider-gaming.com</a></strong> or <a href="https://forms.gle/3AVqXsLDohEA173K6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filling out our submission form</a>: </p>



<p><strong>Submissions are open until March 20.</strong></p>



<p>Outlets and content creators can contact either email address above to get involved as partners or for potential co-streaming opportunities.@</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden 4: The Two Masters DLC will release next week, in March 2026. </p>



<p>Team Ninja’s latest mainline entry to the Ninja Gaiden franchise was released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-world-record-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in October 2025</a> and has been faring quite well since release. Now, the developers have finally provided an update on how they plan to expand the experience with a brand-new DLC for the game. </p>







<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-dlc-will-add-new-story-missions-weapons-and-more">Ninja Gaiden 4 DLC Will Add New Story Missions, Weapons, and More</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>A new post by Team Ninja on <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/2026688643667214432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) confirms the release date of the new The Two Masters DLC for Ninja Gaiden 4, and it arrives on March 4, 2026. The new DLC will add three new chapters, weapons, enemies, and the Abyssal Road challenge mode. Learn more about the new additions below. </p>



<p>The story expansion for Ninja Gaiden 4 will see Yakumo and Ryu’s battle against fiends continue, as the two characters battle against even deadlier enemies, challenging bosses, and new trials. The new weapons will also help expand Yakumo and Ryu’s combat styles. Yakumo will receive the “Solitaire” scythe, which is great for crowd control, and Ryu’s will get “Jakotsumon” serpent gauntlets, which are useful for fast, close-quarters combat.</p>



<p>Abyssal Road in the Ninja Gaiden 4: The Two Masters DLC is an endurance-style mode where players face 100 unique combat encounters. These encounters include enemies from both the base game and the DLC, and introduce the new Special Blood Essence and Frenzied enemy mechanics, which dynamically alter battle conditions.</p>



<p>The DLC will also arrive with “a wide range of quality-of-life improvements, balance adjustments, and bug fixes, including combat responsiveness improvements, new weapon set customization options, and fixes across multiple chapters to ensure a smoother experience throughout the campaign.” Players with Deluxe Edition or Deluxe upgrade will get the DLC for free, and others can buy it for $14.99 on March 4. </p>
