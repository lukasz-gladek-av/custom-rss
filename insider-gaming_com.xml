<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl was released on PlayStation 5 on November 20, 2025, a full year after it dropped on Xbox and PC platforms. It arrives on PlayStation 5 along with all the upgrades and enhancements that have been applied over the last twelve months, which means players flying the blue banner are getting a ‘better product’ than when the game first launched in 2024.</p>



<p>I’ve been toying with STALKER 2 since it dropped on PlayStation 5, getting to grips all over again with one of my top games of 2024. In my first STALKER 2 review, I said, ‘I cannot dredge up a single reason why you shouldn’t invest in STALKER 2,’ but is that still true after a year of evolution and the game launching on a new platform?</p>



<p>To find out, read on and explore my full STALKER 2 PS5 review.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-stalker-2-worth-it-on-ps5">Is STALKER 2 Worth It On PS5?</h2>



<p>STALKER 2 had a fair few issues when it was released in 2024. It needed some serious upkeep, and in the weeks that followed the launch, GSC Game World applied many fixes and patches to address the game’s biggest concerns. It stabilized, and hundreds of thousands of people poured into the game over the next year or so.</p>



<p>Today, STALKER 2 isn’t too much of a different beast, but enough has been done for it to finally feel much more polished. The game’s unique elements, like the ‘A-Life’ AI engine that was promised ahead of launch, still aren’t where they should be, but it’s a sight better than it was when it dropped on Xbox and PC in November 2024.</p>



<p>If you’re unfamiliar, STALKER 2 throws players into a harrowing, harsh post-apocalyptic environment called The Zone. It’s worth stressing that the rest of the world is mostly fine, it’s just The Zone that’s post-apocalyptic. This irradiated, mutant-infested space surrounds Chornobyl, the ill-fated nuclear power plant found in Ukraine.</p>



<p>In STALKER 2, players must contend with the threats of The Zone, both human-based and mutated, to uncover shocking revelations, align with or dispute against factions, and resolve the protagonist’s story and reason for being there in the first place.</p>



<p>It’s a pretty challenging game, and at times, it has been compared to the likes of Escape from Tarkov and Fallout, which is mostly accurate. Imagine if Fallout were set in Russia and you’re basically there.</p>



<p>STALKER 2 represents hours of gaming wrapped up in an attractive package. There’s a solid story there that takes players across a massive, mixed map, presenting them with plenty of weapons, outfits, and equipment items to get to grips with.</p>



<p>It’s <strong>worth </strong>the investment to secure a copy on PlayStation 5, but let’s go a little deeper.</p>



<h2 id="h-stalker-2-is-better-than-ever">STALKER 2 is Better Than Ever</h2>



<figure><figcaption>‘Gorgeous’ isn’t the word</figcaption></figure>







<p>I’ve already sunk many hours into STALKER 2 on PlayStation 5, and I can attest to it being better than ever. My first review in 2024 was glowing, but the PS5 release takes things to the next level. It’s a marvel of a thing to come back to a game an entire year later and be presented with almost a different version, and the comparisons are pretty easily made.</p>



<p>The overall optimization of STALKER 2 has been improved; it runs better and smoothly, and there are fewer bugs throughout. New quests, UI elements, customization options, and details have been added over the last year, and some nice-to-have features like an ‘immersive mode’ are now present.</p>



<p>Even on the PS5 Slim, not even a PS5 Pro, the game looks phenomenal. The vistas in this game are something special to behold, and the weather effects, physics, and sound engine are all on point. This game has one of the best dynamic weather engines I’ve ever seen in a game, and it lacks much of a backing soundtrack, so the ambience immerses you to the max when you’re walking around The Zone.</p>



<p>The game’s difficulty balancing can be a little skewed at times, but it’s plenty forgiving if you play on a lower difficulty.</p>



<p>My favorite thing in STALKER 2 has to be the combat. Whether you’re fighting the game’s more fearsome mutants or the many human enemies that roam The Zone, you’re in for a treat. Combat is versatile and pretty dynamic, and everything from stealth to all-out guns blazing feels viable.</p>



<p>Talking about roaming The Zone, you’ll also have a great time digging through all the nooks and crannies of this game. It’s packed with secrets, collectables, side missions, and ad-hoc objectives that pop up as you probe the wider map. The world-building is phenomenal, and the atmosphere created in some environments is to die for… Literally.</p>



<p>We should also be getting some kind of expansion in the future, too, so if you get it, you’ll have more to look forward to down the line. GSC Game World is not finished with STALKER 2 by any means.</p>







<h2 id="h-verdict-4-great">Verdict: 4 – Great</h2>



<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl represents many hours of entertaining (if a little morbid at times) gameplay for anyone fond of the post-apocalyptic settings found in the likes of Fallout and Metro. It’s a stunning game that might present some issues at times, but GSC Game World has worked hard to optimise it over the last year or so.</p>



<p>It remains one of my favorite games in the genre, and I’d take a third playthrough in a shot, especially if GSC ever implements a more major update or some kind of expansion.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[BACKBONE ONE Review—Small But Mighty for Mobile Gamers]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/backbone-one-review-mobile-gaming/</link>
            <guid>1371655</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I’ve never been a huge mobile gamer, but I can fully appreciate that it makes up a <strong>massive </strong>portion of our industry. In recent years, mobile games have become increasingly intelligent, and AAA titles are finding their way onto mobile devices both natively and via cloud streaming services.</p>



<p>It stands to reason that, if you want to enjoy mobile gaming as much as possible, you’ll want a solid controller with which to do so. That’s where the BACKBONE ONE comes in, an innovative, handy, and powerful little device that holds your phone and provides a solid base on which to build a strong mobile gaming experience.</p>



<p>I’ve been trialling the BACKBONE ONE for a couple of weeks and have been nothing but impressed. Here’s my full BACKBONE ONE review.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-the-backbone-one-worth-99-99">Is The BACKBONE ONE Worth $99.99?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing this BACKBONE ONE review, the device was selling for $99.99. I’d picked up the ultra-limited Death Stranding 2 edition, which came in a fabulous themed box and boasted a unique shell that’s to die for, but the standard is much more accessible and easier to find online.</p>



<p>As I write this, the <a href="https://backbone.com/pages/death-stranding-2-le">Death Stranding 2 edition</a> is fully sold out, but BACKBONE has teased that another wave might arrive soon. If you’re a fan, you’ll want to secure one of these, as it’s a gorgeous item to have in your collection, even if you don’t actively play mobile games.</p>



<figure><figcaption>My BACKBONE ONE Death Stranding 2 Edition is a beautiful thing.</figcaption></figure>







<p>Now, to the BACKBONE ONE review.</p>



<p>The BACKBONE ONE is a relatively simple thing that works right out of the box with almost no setup required. You simply pull it apart, insert your mobile device, and snap it closed again. It has a USB-C connection (or a Lightning connection) built into the device, which means it works with almost all modern devices.</p>



<p>If you’re in the market and looking to make known your allegiances, you’ll be happy to know you can purchase the BACKBONE ONE in both an Xbox or PlayStation-based theme.</p>



<p>It basically takes your phone and turns it into a cheap, portable gaming device, which, when paired with something like Game Pass, becomes a formidable thing. It’s small but mighty, and while the inputs and the overall form factor are pretty tiny compared to something like an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-powerhouse-portable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, it’s perfect for gaming on the go.</p>



<p>In recent years, BACKBONE has evolved this device, and now, there’s a handy app, more responsive inputs, magnetic adapters that ensure a better fit for a wider range of devices, and more tactile buttons. There’s even a nice 3.5mm headset jack on the side if you want to game on a train or while sitting in an Uber.</p>



<p>It really is that simple.</p>



<p>I’d say it’s worth $99.99, without a doubt. If you want to game while travelling and don’t want to splash out almost $1,000 on a top-tier handled gaming device, this is where you’ll want to get involved. It weighs almost nothing, shrinks down into the tiniest space in your backpack (or even a pocket), and it looks nice.</p>



<p>It’s also durable, which I’ve tested by aggressively pulling it open and shut again and dropping it a few times. There’s very little in the way of working parts inside the BACKBONE ONE, so you don’t have to worry about it being devastated by a slip of the hand. Just try to make sure your phone isn’t in it when you do drop it, because that’s not guaranteed to be protected.</p>



<p>If there’s one thing I can complain about, it’s that my ‘armoured’ phone protector couldn’t fit properly in the BACKBONE ONE as the charging port was a bit obscured, but that’s a ‘me’ problem.</p>



<p>I’d recommend the BACKBONE ONE if you want to game on the go on the cheap; it’s that simple.</p>







<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what your favorite mobile game is and if you’d buy the BACKBONE ONE.</p>

<p>No Man’s Sky creator has recently responded to Once Human, allegedly using their assets in a premium loot box, stating, “jokes on them.” </p>



<p>Hello Games No Man’s Sky was released all the way back in 2016, but has still been going strong almost a decade later. The developers recently released a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-breach-update-patch-notes-improved-ship-building-space-wrecks-salvaging-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brand-new update</a> for the title, introducing improved shipbuilding, space wrecks, salvaging, and more. Once Human, on the other hand, is a more recent title, releasing in 2024. However, Once Human was recently accused of ripping off assets from No Man’s Sky, and the founder has responded. </p>







<h2 id="h-no-man-s-sky-founder-says-jokes-on-them-in-response-to-once-human-allegedly-ripping-off-assets">No Man’s Sky Founder Says ‘Jokes on Them’ in Response to Once Human Allegedly Ripping Off Assets</h2>

The user has revealed that Once Human’s cosmetic item, Sky King, looks very similar to No Man’s Sky’s Teleport Module. The item from Once Human can only be obtained as the highest-tier reward from a premium lootbox, whereas in No Man’s Sky, you can acquire the item just by progressing through the game. </p>

<p>The post caught the attention of Hello Games founder Sean Murray, who responded on <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1995953990958547164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). Murray stated, “jokes on them – we forgot to LOD those rivets,” with an image of the asset in question. For those wondering, LOD stands for Level of Detail, a process in game development that optimises performance by displaying simpler versions of 3D models when they are far from the camera. </p>

<p>Microsoft has announced that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has set the record as the best third-party title to release on Xbox Game Pass in 2025, adding a further accolade to Sandfall Interactive’s debut title.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is widely regarded to be one of the best games to release this year, with the expectation that it will sweep up numerous victories in The Game Awards next week, and the Game Pass record shows just how impressive the release of the title was.</p>

<p>In a post on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>, Microsoft’s announcement of Clair Obscur’s impressive accolade detailed how it was based on the data of the number of unique players who played the title in the first 30 days of launch.</p>



<p>Sandfall’s creative director, Guillaume Broche, said the success was “so far beyond what any of us could have imagined,” detailing how nerve-wracking it was to release a title, but the “support of everyone has really made everything feel like a dream.”</p>



<p>Broche also thanked Xbox and Game Pass for their support, noting that the game’s addition to the service allows people to “try our game when they might not have before,” particularly as the turn-based RPG genre can be off-putting for newcomers.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur is up for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-vote-game-awards-2025-all-categories-nominees-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several major honors at The Game Awards</a>, having been nominated for Game of the Year, Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, Best Art Direction, Best Score/Music, Best Audio Design, Best Independent Game, Besty Debut Indie Game, and Best Role-Playing Game, while Charlie Cox, Jennifer English, and Ben Starr make up half of the contenders for Best Performance.</p>
