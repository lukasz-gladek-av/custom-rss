<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-last-caretaker/" id="3556">The Last Caretaker</a> is currently unfolding in early access and impressing gamers worldwide. It’s an ambitious, emotional game that presents players with the utmost freedom, sending them into a world devastated by rising oceans and tasking them with preserving the remnants of humanity, hundreds of years after they’ve left the planet.</p>



<p>Channel37, the game’s developer, has just unveiled the bulk of The Final Frontier, the game’s second major update since it was released in December 2025 in early access. It’s fairly accurate to say this update is <strong>huge</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-ways-to-sail-new-places-to-sail-to">New Ways to Sail, New Places to Sail To</h2>



<p>The Final Frontier has just been released, marking the arrival of the second major expansion to The Last Caretaker. Despite the name, it’s just the beginning for this open-world sandbox, which we recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/reviews/the-last-caretaker-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awarded a 9/10 in our full review</a>.</p>



<p>The update starts with new ways to explore the game. Players are tasked with finding a new location, ‘Rocky Islands’, which leads to them unlocking the CS-17 Courier Skimmer, a <strong>Jet Ski</strong>-type craft. This is contained within a whole new biome that itself contains more quests to uncover.</p>



<p>Additionally, Channel37 has added ‘The Maze’, a tricky facility that’s not hard to find, but is hard to escape from once you’re lost within. That, too, contains more quest lines to discover.</p>



<p>The order of the day with The Final Frontier is deeper customization, and with that in mind, players can tweak their all-important vessel with 37 paint styles, all of which are free to find around the world. Additionally, new tools, such as the ‘deep ocean floor sonar’, have been added.</p>



<p>Channel37 has introduced a stack of quality-of-life improvements and adjustments with The Final Frontier, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Better building visualization and snapping</li>



<li>New dismantling visuals per material</li>



<li>Animation and usability improvements</li>



<li>Improved underwater visibility</li>



<li>More data logs to find</li>



<li>New achievements</li>



<li>Performance and stability upgrades across physics, rendering, buoyancy, cables, and UI</li>
</ul>



<p>The Final Frontier is totally free to download and explore, and it represents the second in a very long line of updates planned for The Last Caretaker.</p>

            <guid>1432141</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A leaker has made a cryptic tease for some of the most popular titles in all of gaming, Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green. </p>



<p>Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green are still among the most highly regarded games in the Pokémon series and have served as an entry point into gaming for many users. Recently, there have been numerous Pokémon leaks, including a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-super-bowl-commercial-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Bowl advertisement</a><span>&nbsp;and a significant amount of information about&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-wind-waves-gen-10-leaks/" target="_blank">the Gen 10 title leaked&nbsp;</a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-wind-waves-gen-10-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year</a>. Hopefully, something about these two games comes true as well. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-does-return-of-pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-mean">What Does Return of Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green Mean? </h2>



<p>The leak about the ‘return’ of Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green comes through <a href="https://x.com/Riddler_Khu/status/2021518874785841331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) user Riddler_Khu. Their post states, “They will return soon~” and features images of the box art for both Fire Red and Leaf Green. No other details were revealed about what this “return” might mean, and this leaker is notorious for teasing without providing much context. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are several possibilities of what this could mean, but readers should note that this is just speculation. The first option is to add them to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass, as the only other Pokémon title from that generation is Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team.</p>



<p>The second option could be Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green HD/4K Remasters, adding greater fidelity to the visuals, a better framerate, and other upgrades for current-gen consoles. The last option is a full-blown Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green remake, which could mean retaining the original story and world, while adding elements from new titles, just as 3D gameplay, 4K visuals, and more. </p>



<p>In the end, players will have to wait for official confirmation from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company to know whether a ‘return’ is even happening, and, if so, what it means. Until then, take the information with a grain of salt. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/justin-roiland-high-on-life-2-controversy/</link>
            <guid>1432120</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At the center of Rick and Morty’s early years and High on Life was Justin Roiland. He co-created the sci-show TV show and founded Squanch Games, the studio behind High on Life 2 and its predecessor. But controversy has courted Justin Roiland in recent years, making his High on Life 2 status a questionable one, to say the least.</p>



<p>Rick and Morty at its pomp was untouchable. It shifted merchandise like nobody’s business, TV numbers were great, and those first three to four seasons were gold. It made Justin Roiland a star, and he boosted his profile by founding Squanch Games and creating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life/" id="106984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life</a>.</p>



<p>In 2026, the dynamic is very different, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" id="170939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2</a> makes some changes.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-justin-roiland-be-in-high-on-life-2">Will Justin Roiland Be In High on Life 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No squanching. Credit to Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s confirmed that Justin Roiland has had no involvement whatsoever in High on Life 2, whether it’s the game’s development or conception.</strong></p>



<p>Quite simply, Justin Roiland resigned from Squanch Games in 2023. He’s gone off the grid since, and it means he hasn’t been associated with the company in the meantime, ensuring the voice actor hasn’t played a part in High on Life 2.</p>

</ul>



<p>Long-time fans will know he voiced Kenny in the first game, but the Gatlian was later replaced in post-launch HOL content.</p>

<h2 id="h-why-isn-t-justin-roiland-in-high-on-life-2-controversy-explained">Why Isn’t Justin Roiland In High on Life 2? Controversy, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Reports of domestic abuse, harassment, and other accusations against Justin Roiland were made public in 2023, and the voice actor and creator was subsequently dismissed or parted ways with most (if not all) companies he was associated with at the time.</strong></p>



<p>Roiland was actually arrested as early as 2020. Once everything became public knowledge in 2023, many women came forward with claims against Roiland, and it wasn’t long before he was dismissed from Adult Swim and Rick and Morty—where he voiced the titular Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith for several years.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/high-on-life-2-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is High on Life 2 on Xbox Game Pass?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Eventually, he resigned from Squanch Games, and despite criminal charges being dropped against Roiland in 2023, new claims of assault surfaced later in the year.</p>



<p>Justin Roiland has been out of the spotlight since, and it remains to be seen if he’ll make a comeback to any of his former companies or projects. For now, he’s not associated with Rick and Morty, High on Life 2, or anything else.</p>

<p>A new Silent Hill Transmission is arriving later this week, focusing on Silent Hill: Townfall.</p>



<p>Silent Hill fans have been hoping for a new announcement for a very long time, especially after the movie adaptation, Return to Silent Hill, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/return-to-silent-hill-bombs-hard-in-early-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t score so well with reviewers</a> or the audience. Now, the developers have planned a full showcase that will provide all the latest details on their upcoming title. </p>







<h2 id="h-silent-hill-transmission-to-focus-on-townfall">Silent Hill Transmission to Focus on Townfall</h2>



<p>A new post by the official Silent Hill account on <a href="https://x.com/SilentHill/status/2021388925982416947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) confirms the upcoming Transmission event for this week. The upcoming showcase is scheduled for February 12 at 4:00 PM PT. The event will feature the developers sharing “the latest news on SILENT HILL: Townfall”. The streaming links for the event haven’t been posted at the time of writing. </p>



<p>Silent Hill Townfall is a title we have heard very little about, aside from the title. We know that it will be a horror title and a spin-off of the Silent Hill series. The game will be developed by No Code and published by Konami and Annapurna. What’s more, the Silent Hill showcase comes right after PlayStation’s State of Play event. </p>



<p>The developers had released a very cryptic trailer back in 2022, with a confusing voiceover and shots of a tape recorder and waves. Since then, this is the first time the developers will reveal more details about the game. </p>







<p>In other news, Silent Hill 2 Remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrived for Xbox Series X/S consoles</a> late last year. Additionally, the release date for Townfall was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-townfall-release-date-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked last year</a>.

<p>Squanch Games do be squanching around with High On Life 2, the new 2026 sequel. Another round of Gatlians and gross jokes is guaranteed in High on Life 2, and it’s time to check if there’s early access to get the laughs in now. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" id="170939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2</a> looks to be more of the same outrageous content as the original, and if you do love the original, that’s hardly a bad thing. You’ll be skateboarding and doing <em>even more</em> talking, and it’s looking to capitalize on the large following amassed with the first game’s release.</p>



<p>If you’re keen on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/squanch-games/" id="2701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squanch Games</a>‘ High on Life 2, let’s check if it has early access or a demo.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-high-on-life-2-through-early-access">Can You Play High On Life 2 Through Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Booooo. Credit to Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no early access option for High on Life 2, which means you need to wait until launch to play it.</strong></p>



<p>You can only buy the standard edition of High on Life. There is no Deluxe Edition or Mega-Ludicrious Cromulon Edition designed to throw in a few digital or physical trinkets in exchange for mass sums of Schleem (one for the less-casual Rick and Morty fan there), although there is a now sold-out Collector’s Edition.</p>



<p>It’s quite a nice change of pace, and something more developers and publishers could do with.</p>

</ul>



<p>There’s now one universal High on Life 2 version to buy. Unfortunately, it doesn’t provide early access.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-high-on-life-2-have-a-demo">Does High On Life 2 Have A Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>You can’t even play High on Life 2 early via a free-to-play demo from any applicable storefront.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>If you’re asking Squanch Games to ‘show me what you got,’ the developer has a solid and firm answer: No.</p>



<p>No early access, no demo; it’s a traditional launch-day affair where you need to be patient to play it on PlayStation 5 and other platforms.</p>



<p>Did you ever get around to playing the original High on Life? Through gameplay trailers and other reveals, what is the biggest change you’re looking forward to in High on Life 2?

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" id="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Contexto</a> a go if you haven’t already! </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s guessing time. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>
