<p>In a recent video published by Fortune, Xbox President Sarah Bond spoke about the next-generation Xbox console, which has long been a point of debate and contention amongst gamers. Some believe Xbox is <strong>getting out of hardware</strong>, while die-hard fans are fully preparing to stump up the cash for whatever comes next.</p>



<p>Sarah Bond insists that the next Xbox will offer a ‘powerful experience’ that will be portable and accessible across multiple platforms, going with players ‘everywhere they go’.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-next-xbox-has-big-promises-in-store">The Next Xbox Has Big Promises in Store</h2>



<p>The team at Xbox recently confirmed a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-partner-preview-confirmed-for-this-week/">Partner Preview event</a>, scheduled to drop later this week. This is where upcoming games will be showcased, particularly those that have a tie-in with Xbox in some way. To that end, we know that the likes of Tencent, IO Interactive, and THQ Nordic will show up at the event.</p>



<p>Beyond the games, Xbox is still looking to whatever hardware comes next. It might be a good couple of years before it surfaces, but the next-generation Xbox is shaping up to be something special, if the likes of Sarah Bond are to be believed.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Fortune, Bond explained what’s happening with the future of hardware at the Microsoft-backed gaming firm:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hardware is absolutely core to everything that we do at Xbox, because we know that our most valuable players, the people who love Xbox, <strong>love </strong>the hardware experience. That’s why we’re working on our next-generation hardware.</p>



<p>It’s going to be a powerful experience, and one that also enables people to take their library with them, and that’s what’s really important here as well, is that we know while people want to play their library absolutely on the console, they also want to play it on PC or stream it on the Cloud.</p>



<p>And so, the Xbox experience starts with the console but then gives something to people that they can experience across all screens if they choose to, bringing their library, their community, their identity, and the store with them everywhere they go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It sounded pretty scripted, but that’s part and parcel of being the most prolific spokesperson in the company (perhaps on par with Phil Spencer, of course). The way Bond kept repeating ‘Xbox Experience’ has me thinking that the next console already has a name picked out… (shifty eyes emoji).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gabe-newell-just-bought-a-new-500-million-yacht-with-a-basketball-court-and-%E2%80%9915-gaming-stations%E2%80%99.1355854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gabe Newell, the co-founder of Valve and a multi-billionaire gaming legend, has secured a brand-new yacht, custom-built to his desires and fitted with a whopping fifteen ‘gaming stations.’ What’s the betting that at least one of them features a Steam Machine?</p>



<p>The ‘high-performance vessel’ will reportedly support ‘everything from world-class hospitality to scientific research’, as the yacht is equipped with a <strong>science lab and dive center</strong>, amongst other things. The 360-foot, hybrid beast chalked up a production cost of between $375 and $530 million, proving that Gaben is eating <strong>well</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-valve-on-the-open-seas">Valve on the Open Seas</h2>



<p>Gabe Newell, the eclectic founder of Valve, is said to be worth more than $10 billion. He spends most of his time <strong>living </strong>aboard yachts, and his recent addition to his collection, the ‘Leviathan’, is simply another arrow in the quiver of ocean-faring palaces.</p>



<p>It’s the 50th largest yacht in the world, custom-built to match everything that Newell desired, and in a statement, the Valve head honcho gushed over the creation of the thing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Working with the team at Oceanco is incredibly enjoyable and a lot of fun; everybody is professional, creative and dynamic. We knew we were asking for unusual things, and Oceanco embraced it with open arms. Not only have we designed a very unusual yacht that leans into Oceanco’s strengths of innovation and design, but the team has also been willing to collaborate with us on evolving the process.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It could also have been one hell of a tax swindle, given that Gabe Newell <strong>owns Oceanco</strong>, the shipyard that built the Leviathan, but that’s just a silly thing to say.</p>



<p>The Leviathan features a submarine garage, more than a dozen premium gaming PCs, racing sim rigs, a basketball court, a hospital, and more bedrooms, kitchens, and relaxation areas than you can shake a stick at. It has been dubbed the most comfortable yacht ever designed, and it certainly seems like it <a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/oceanco-delivers-leviathan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per the yacht’s brochure</a>.</p>



<p>And in true gamer form, it’s surrounded by a ring of RGB lights.</p>



<p>This one-of-a-kind vessel will serve several purposes and won’t necessarily be Gaben’s new home, but it’s nice to know he has his pick of the lot when it comes to hyper-expensive boats.</p>







<p>Recently, Valve revealed a slew of new gaming devices, including a new Steam Deck, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-reveals-steam-machine/">a Steam Machine</a>, and the Frame, a new virtual reality headset.</p>
