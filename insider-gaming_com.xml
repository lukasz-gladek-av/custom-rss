<p>Verdansk returning to Warzone is a massive success story, but there is always the fear that the map will be removed or replaced in the rotation. Raven Software alleviated those concerns. </p>



<p>Caldera replaced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-prison-safe-locations-in-warzone-verdansk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> as the primary <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/corsair-warzone-range-single-keycap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a> map in December 2021 after a remarkable run that almost lasted two years. Since then, battle royale maps have typically been replaced after two years. For example, Caldera and Urzikstan survived two years before being shut down. </p>



<p>Al Mazrah was a rare exception and only made it one year. Verdansk is an interesting case, as the map launched in April, which is deep into the Black Ops 6 life cycle.<span> So, since&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-black-ops-7-details-have-been-leaked-by-a-playtester/" target="_blank">Black Ops 7</a>&nbsp;is coming soon, fans don’t know what that me</span>ans for Verdansk’s future. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-verdansk-be-replaced-in-warzone">When Will Verdansk be Replaced in Warzone?</h2>

<p><strong>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Raven Software’s Warzone game director, Pete Actipis, confirmed that Verdansk will remain in Warzone throughout 2025. </strong></p>



<p>“We brought Verdansk back for a reason. It wasn’t just to bring it back for a season and kind of say goodbye to it again,” Actipis said. “A lot of effort went into it. So for the time being, Verdansk is sticking around, and this is just the beginning of the Verdansk 2025 journey, and then we’ll see how things go from there.”</p>



<p>This will be reassuring news to fans who have enjoyed Verdansk so far, and the success is undeniable. Verdansk’s return sparked a staggering&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/with-verdansk-return-call-of-dutys-player-count-jumps-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200% increase</a>&nbsp;in player count.&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-player-count-off-charts-as-verdansk-exceeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision</a>&nbsp;reportedly took notice and is pleased with the positive results from the update, and Raven Software expressed similar optimism. </p>

<p>The devs plan to continue supporting Verdansk this year, and fans will not have to wait much longer for the next major update.

<p>Star Wars Zero Company will receive an official “world exclusive first look” on April 19 through a panel with Bit Reactor, Respawn, and LucasFilm Games.</p>



<p>Star Wars Zero Company is an upcoming single-player turn-based tactics game that was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-bit-reactor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>earlier last month. The official reveal will be live-streamed from a ‘Galaxy Stage’ on April 19 as part of the Star Wars Celebration event. Respawn will produce the title, while Bit Reactor will lead the game’s development. Star Wars Zero Company will be <a href="https://x.com/EAStarWars/status/1911816230908121249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released on</a> PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-star-wars-zero-company-about">What is Star Wars Zero Company About?</h2>



<p>Not much has been officially revealed about the game besides its title and genre; however, some details have surfaced early through leaks. According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/images-from-respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-have-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report</a> from March, early images of the game showed gameplay reminiscent of popular tactical turn-based games like XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM 2. We also saw a Mandalorian character fighting against a Storm Trooper, with the bottom screen showing the actions a player can take in this situation.</p>



<p>However, the screenshots were from an earlier game build and are subject to change or removal with the final build. The only way to know what Star Wars Zero Company is about is by tuning in for the official reveal on April 19, where we might get to see some gameplay and hopefully a release date, too.</p>



<p>In other news, Star Wars: Hunters will shut down<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-hunters-is-shutting-down-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in October 2025</a>. The Star Wars Eclipse developer was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-eclipse-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unaffected by NetEase’s restructuring</a>.

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is continuing to be a successful launch for Ubisoft amid all of the company uncertainty. According to the latest information from Circana, the game is one of the best-selling games in the United States (US) so far this year.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lmrugvasic24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a> on Monday, Circana’s Mat Piscatella revealed that Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been the best-selling video game in the US in each of its first three weeks on the market in terms of dollar sales. </p>



<p>It was added that it’s the second-best-selling game year-to-date trailing on Monster Hunter: Wilds. Monster Hunter: Wilds released just about three weeks—February 28—before Assassin’s Creed Shadows did on March 20.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-exclusive-ubisoft-s-plan-for-the-ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-detailed-in-internal-memo">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-plan-for-the-ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXCLUSIVE – Ubisoft’s “Plan” For The Ubisoft/Tencent Subsidiary Detailed In Internal Memo</a></h6>



<p>Though specific numbers haven’t been revealed by Circana, Ubisoft has said publicly that more than 3 million players have played the game as of its first week. That number, however, is likely to include those who received a copy from Ubisoft or are subscribers to Ubisoft+. It’s unsure, as of publishing, what the official units sold count is for the game as it reaches a month on the market. </p>



<p>That information is likely to come at or around the time Ubisoft holds its next earnings call on May 14.</p>



<p>What do you think of Assassin’s Creed Shadows being at the top of the sales charts in the US since its release? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>
