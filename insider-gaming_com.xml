<p>Peak developer has announced that a new biome, called ‘Roots’, will be arriving on November 5, 2025. </p>



<p>Landfall and Aggro Crab’s co-op physics-based climbing title, Peak, has been a major success since its release. The title had already approached the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-sold-nearly-2-million-copies-last-week-during-steam-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million sales mark</a> a few months ago, thanks to a boost in sales from Steam. Now, the developers are introducing a new biome to provide additional content for players. </p>

<p>Announced through a new update on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3527290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, the next Peak biome has been named Roots, and it evokes a truly foresty vibe. In the trailer, we see two characters hiding atop a tree trunk, with one character sliding in while holding a vine. As the duo seems to be planning their next move, one of the characters is abducted by a spider, and the teaser ends at that moment, revealing the November 5 release date. Check out the teaser for Peak’s Roots biome below: </p>

<p>The last biome added was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peaks-first-major-update-adds-a-new-biome-items-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mesa</a>, which featured sandy terrain and massive mountains. This time, it seems like players will be scaling massive tree trunks rather than mountains and hills. Similar to Mesa, Roots might take over on its arrivals and then be rotated randomly with Mesa and Alpine; however, developers have not confirmed these plans. Moreover, players can also expect new items to keep them safe, new resources to make climbing each other, and new obstacles to make their lives more difficult. </p>



<p>In other news, Peak developers announced a brand-new co-op arcade racing game this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-devs-announce-a-new-co-op-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crashout Crew</a>, and its demo is now available.
