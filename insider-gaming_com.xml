<p>The Cities: Skylines franchise is getting a new developer. Publisher Paradox announced on Monday that it was moving long-time developer Colossal Order off of the franchise in what is said to be a “mutual decision.</p>



<p>In a joint statement on the Paradox forums, Colossal Order is moving on to build new projects and explore “new creative opportunities.”</p>







<p><strong>“For over fifteen years, the Cities Series and our partnership with Paradox have been a defining part of our journey at Colossal Order,”</strong> <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen said</a>. <strong>“When we set out to create Cities in Motion, we never imagined it would grow to become a cherished franchise with a passionate, loyal community of millions of players around the world. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“We’re confident that the franchise will continue to thrive under Paradox’s leadership. As we move forward, we’re excited to channel our experience, creativity, and passion into new projects that align with our long-term vision.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-meet-cities-skylines-new-developer">Meet Cities: Skylines New Developer</h2>



<p>Taking over the franchise will be another Finnish studio, Iceflake Studios. One of Paradox’s internal management studios, Iceflake will take over <strong>“all existing and future development for Cities: Skylines II, including free updates for the current version, continuous work on the Editor and console editions, as well as future expansions and content packs. This means that Cities players will be able to look forward to new updates and content drops for many years.”</strong></p>



<p>Colossal Order will continue on the game for a short time in order to implement in-progress updates like various bug fixes, the Bike Patch, Old Town buildings, and a Beta version of asset support for the game’s editor. After that, Iceflake will take over all development at the start of 2026.</p>







<p><strong>“Taking the reins on a genre-leading franchise like Cities is an immense honor and a great responsibility,”</strong> Iceflake studio manager Lasse Liljedahl said. <strong>“There’s a huge, loyal community out there and I want to say to every member of that community that we will humbly carry this legacy with respect, together with all of you.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Iceflake has the capacity and capability to get started. We have a decade worth of experience from making city building and management games. We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can’t wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game.”</strong></p>



<p>When making the announcement, there was no update on the console version of Cities: Skylines 2. The version has been delayed multiple times, and there’s been no update on when players can expect it. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to ask what this change means for the console version.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Dueling Grounds monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Coins, Gems and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dueling Grounds is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-skateboard-simulator-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> fighting game where players take part in one-on-one duels to find out who the ultimate fighter is. Players can utilise weapons such as swords and daggers, while also executing typical fighting game actions like blocks, parries, and punches. It’s essential for players to get a solid grasp of the controls, as simply button-jamming will only get them so far. Chaining combos is crucial, as it’s the best way to do the maximum amount of damage most efficiently.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Like most fighting games, Dueling Grounds also boasts an ability bar, which can be filled up by landing strikes and successfully blocking or parrying the opponent’s moves. Once filled, players can launch an ultimate attack that deals massive damage, increasing their chances for victory. Although simply progressing through the game will give players the resources they need to stay competitive, using redeem codes to gain an advantage is a common practice in most Roblox games.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-active-dueling-grounds-codes-nbsp">Active Dueling Grounds Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-dueling-grounds-codes-nbsp">Expired Dueling Grounds Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Dueling Grounds, as the game released quite recently. Considering just how much popularity it has gained over the last few weeks, the developers are likely working on new codes to be released. Once new codes release, older ones tend to expire, and when that happens, the expired codes will be moved to this section. In the meantime, we urge players to make use of the active codes at the earliest, as they could expire at any moment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-dueling-grounds-codes">How To Redeem Dueling Grounds Codes</h2>

<p>Redeeming codes in Roblox Dueling Grounds is a fairly straightforward process, as it’s just a matter of navigating through the game’s menu and inputting one of the active codes listed above into the corresponding text box. For players who are new to the Roblox environment, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Dueling Grounds.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Click on the green star icon on the left hand side of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down till you see the codes text box.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click on the redeem button to claim your reward.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-dueling-grounds-codes">How To Get More Dueling Grounds Codes</h2>



<p>New Dueling Grounds codes are likely going to be released through the game’s official Discord server or through the developers’ social accounts. However, tracking both of these for new codes regularly can be a hassle, and that’s where this page can come in handy. We update this page as soon as any new codes drop , so we recommend that you keep this page bookmarked for future reference.&nbsp;</p>
