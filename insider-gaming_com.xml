<p>Battlestate Games has revealed that, amid ongoing issues with the redemption and dropping of Twitch rewards in the Escape from Tarkov 1.0 launch, the campaign has been greatly extended. After reviewing ‘all possible options’ with Twitch, Battlestate has agreed to extend the campaign, running it from November 29 to December 20.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games confirmed that <strong>no changes have been made </strong>to the rewards unlockable via the campaign, but Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio, stated that his unique voice line pack has received a boosted drop rate.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-nikita-in-escape-from-tarkov">How to Get Nikita in Escape from Tarkov</h2>



<p>Most of the viewers chasing the Tarkov Twitch drops are doing so because they want to unlock Nikita’s voice in the game. As one of the most exclusive rewards, users have a chance of securing Nikita’s voiceover for their character, regardless of whether they’re playing as a BEAR or a USEC PMC.</p>



<p>In a new post on social media, Nikita responded to the concerns about the rarity of this drop, stating that things have been addressed:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">btw increased chances of drops with my voicelines 👆</p>— Nikita Buyanov (@nikgeneburn) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1993341219242754260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<blockquote></blockquote>



<p>The new Tarkov Twitch drops campaign will run from November 29 at 11 AM GMT to December 20 at 11 AM GMT. It was stressed in an <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated article</a> that the rewards are to remain the same, as is the process to earn them:</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One to five paid subscriptions (regular or gift) are required to receive the reward. If a gift subscription is purchased, the reward is granted to the person who paid for the subscription. Renewing an existing subscription also counts.</li>



<li>The subscription must be to any streamer who is broadcasting in the Escape from Tarkov category at the time relevant to the campaign.</li>



<li>Rewards will be available only in PVP MODE.</li>



<li>The reward is issued only once per Twitch and game account, respectively.</li>



<li>Free subscriptions, including Amazon Prime, Bits, and similar, do not count within the framework of the campaign.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon is in the midst of a huge popularity spike that will only get bigger next year with the 30th anniversary of the franchise, and finding the right holiday gifts for an avid Pokémon fan in 2025 can be tricky, given the sheer amount of options available.</p>



<p>Anyone outside of the Pokémon loop may find it difficult to tell a Charizard and a Pikachu apart, which is merely the tip of the iceberg, as the Pokémon franchise has gotten weird at times during almost three decades of history. Fear not, though, as Insider Gaming is here to help with a selection of the best holiday gifts 2025 for any Pokémon fan, young or old.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-pokemon-holiday-gifts-for-2025">Best Pokémon Holiday Gifts for 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-tcg-mega-evolutions-elite-trainer-box">Pokémon TCG Mega Evolutions Elite Trainer Box</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Pokémon TCG is now in the Mega Evolution era, and this Elite Trainer Box covers the first set in that run. Each ETB contains an exclusive promo, nine booster packs, card sleeves, and other TCG accessories. There are two designs available, featuring Gardevoir and Riolu, with separate promos in each.</p>

<h3 id="h-pokemon-tcg-mega-charizard-x-ex-ultra-premium-collection">Pokémon TCG: Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those looking for an extra boost for any Pokémon TCG collector, the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection is one of the most sought-after products released in recent years.

<hr>







<figure></figure>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most recent game to release in the franchise, mixing things up with new battle mechanics and an expansive open-world environment across Lumiose City. Available on both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, it’s the perfect time to buy with the Mega Dimension DLC releasing on December 10.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-eevee-evolutions-powera-enhanced-wireless-controller-for-nintendo-switch-switch-2">Eevee Evolutions PowerA Enhanced Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch/Switch 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Joy Cons on both the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 are not the most comfortable to use for extended gaming sessions, so the PowerA Enhanced Wireless Controller is a good option—especially as this design is stacked with Eevee and its various evolutions, though there are also other designs available.</p>



<p>With up to 30 hours of charge, two mappable Advanced Gaming Buttons, and superior ergonomics for comfortable gaming, the PowerA Enhanced Wireless Controller is a solid bet.</p>

Alternatively, there’s a Treetop Battle Playset, which is slightly more expensive.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-mega-pokemon-building-toys-set-kanto-region-pokedex">MEGA Pokémon Building Toys Set, Kanto Region Pokédex</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Pokémon’s partnership with MEGA is coming to an end, with LEGO products arriving next year, so time is running out to get some of the best MEGA products available, including the Kanto Region Pokédex. The 322-piece build includes a light button, five interchangeable cards featuring popular Pokémon, and a display stand for those who want to showcase the build, rather than play with it.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-paldea-first-partner-plush-3-pack">Pokémon Paldea First Partner Plush 3 Pack</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>One of the hardest decisions in any Pokémon adventure is which partner to choose, but that tough choice is wiped away by the Paldea First Partner Plush 3 Pack, featuring 8-inch plushes of Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The perfect size for taking on any journey, or cuddling while tucked up in bed, the bundle offers great value for money.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[COD SBMM Creator Debunks Black Ops 7 Conspiracy Theories]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sbmm-cod-creator-debunk-conspiracies/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cod-sbmm-creator-debunks-black-ops-7-conspiracy-theories.1364176/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty’s Skill-Based Matchmaking model (SBMM) has long been the source of <strong>much debate </strong>and contention in the wider industry. It’s believed that these days, Activision’s studios want to punish you for being good at your game while trying to shoehorn players into matches with those closest to their current performance metrics, which makes things ‘sweatier’ for almost everyone on a streak.</p>



<p>It’s why people feel that a single good game in Call of Duty leads to you being ‘punished’ by SBMM. In a recent video, Charlie Olson, one of the original creators of the Call of Duty SBMM algorithms as we know them, took a dive into these very topics and debunked some of the SBMM-related conspiracy theories circulating Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-sbmm-is-all-over-the-place">Black Ops 7 SBMM is All Over The Place</h2>



<p>In a new video shared by Charlie Olson of Invokation, the ‘Dark Art of SBMM’ was explored. Olson is credited with creating the current (or close to) <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM model for Call of Duty</a> during a ten-year stint at Raven Software. He left a few years back to focus on his own company, but has remained in the realms of SBMM, MMR, and multiplayer gaming.</p>



<p>In the 40-minute video, Olson runs through the technical know-how behind MMR and SBMM, explaining why the systems are viewed both positively and negatively by the wider gaming community, even <strong>beyond </strong>Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Here’s the full walkthrough:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Dark Art of SBMM" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NpCmr8a9uuE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Towards the end of his run-through of all things matchmaking, Charlie Olson addressed some of the ‘conspiracy theories’ that have surfaced in Call of Duty since Black Ops 7 was released midway through November.</p>



<p>On October 9, Treyarch posted on social media that ‘open matchmaking’ was confirmed to be coming to Black Ops 7, prompting many to fear that the game would be a casual crapfest. This is what Olson addressed first:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Some players are leaving because they thought this tweet meant SBMM had been completely removed from the game, and then they felt betrayed by the inclusion of one standard matchmaking playlist, and then blamed it for stealing ‘fodder’ from the open playlist.</p>



<p>What’s really going on here is there aren’t enough casual players at launch to make open matchmaking the pubstomp that was expected or promise. If open lobbies are sweaty, it’s because it’s mostly sweats playing.</p>



<p>Open matchmaking really does have minimal skill consideration and you can be sure that standard matchmaking isn’t pulling too many players yet, because most casual players just want the one or two modes they’re most comfortable with.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for noobs to stomp, my advice would be to try the open TDM playlist, that’s probably the best place to look.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then jumped into the outright conspiracy theories surrounding SBMM in Black Ops 7. This core conspiracy theory suggests that Activision’s studios <strong>LIED </strong>about removing SBMM in open matchmaking.</p>



<p>Olson suggested that the evidence people are using to back up this theory is to be expected:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This usually comes with three pieces of ‘evidence’. One, open lobbies are sweaty. Two, wait times are longer than in the beta. Three, connections are worse than in the beta.</p>



<p>But those are <strong>just trade-offs from bringing back persistent lobbies</strong> for launch, assuming they don’t want low-pop playlists to starve.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Olson wrapped with predictions, suggesting that Black Ops 7 will ‘get sweatier’ and that the player count will mirror XDefiant’s performance before the game bombed out.</p>

<p>GTA 5 can be nominated for the GOTY category in the Steam Awards 2025, thanks to the Enhanced Edition releasing this year. </p>



<p>Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto 5 has been one of the most relevant titles in gaming for over a decade. The first iteration of the title was released for the PS3 and Xbox 360, with newer versions released with each successive generation of consoles and PCs. Now, the latest version of the game is up for the Game of the Year award on Steam. </p>







<h2 id="h-you-can-nominate-gta-5-for-goty-for-steam-awards-2025">You Can Nominate GTA 5 for GOTY for Steam Awards 2025</h2>



<p>The nomination window for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamawards/nominations/2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Steam Awards</a> is now open and will be live until December 1, 2025, 10:00 AM Pacific. During this time, players will be able to nominate games across 11 categories, including Game of the Year, VR Game of the Year, Labor of Love, Best Game on Steam Deck, Better With Friends, Outstanding Visual Style, Most Innovative Gameplay Award, Best Game You Suck At,  Best Soundtrack Award, Outstanding Story-Rich Game, and Sit Back and Relax. Winners will be announced on January 3, 2026, at 10:00 AM Pacific. </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/557864/article/apparently-grand-theft-auto-v-is-eligible-for-steams-goty-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, players have the option to nominate GTA 5 for GOTY in the first category. For those who don’t know, Steam Awards work differently from other award shows. Instead of a panel of judges deciding the nominations, Steam Awards selects nominees solely through player votes. Which means, theoretically, if players vote to nominate GTA 5 for GOTY and it receives the most votes again once the nomination period is over, it can win GOTY. The only reason it is eligible for this award is that GTA 5 Enhanced Edition was released on Steam on March 4, 2025.  </p>
