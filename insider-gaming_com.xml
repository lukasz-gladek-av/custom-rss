<p>Asha Sharma responds to concerns over her Xbox gamertag profile and recent social media posts.</p>



<p>Following Phil Spencer’s retirement announcement on Friday, February 20, Asha Sharma was named EVP and CEO of Microsoft Gaming. In an attempt to familiarize herself with the Xbox player base, Sharma <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-xbox-ceo-responds-to-fans-desire-for-console-exclusives/" id="178442">replied to players on Twitter</a>, letting them know that she hears their concerns and wants to recommit to core Xbox players and re-strengthen the brand.</p>



<p>In one of these tweets, she shared her gamertag.<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-ceo-profile-one-month-old-suspicious/" id="178467"> Internet sleuths quickly searched the profile </a>and felt it was artificially boosted to enhance her appearance as a relatable gamer.</p>



<h2 id="h-asha-sharma-didn-t-expect-her-profile-to-become-a-big-deal">Asha Sharma Didn’t Expect Her Profile to Become a Big Deal</h2>



<p>Responding to IGN’s Ryan McCaffrey on Twitter, Sharma claimed that she didn’t expect the gamertag to garner so much attention. </p>



<p>She also responded to concerns that AI, the department at Microsoft she previously worked in, is being used to write her posts, saying she agrees with those who claim that faking her affinity for gaming would be a bad thing.</p>



<p>She says her account had racked up more than 10,000 Gamerscore and played such a wide variety of games because it was a shared account at home. That has since been fixed.</p>



<p>“I also didn’t expect my gamertag to blowup and the reality is more boring. I created it recently to learn and understand this world. I’ve played with my family, and it’s a shared home account across devices (which you can see in the range of games /achievements). Fixed that this weekend and everyone is only playing on their own GTs,” she said before reaffirming that her goal is to return to the roots of Xbox and make the brand stronger for the future.</p>

<p>One of the games that Asha Sharma’s profile had 100% completed was Firewatch. Sharma has claimed that the game deeply resonated with her, and she wants to make emotionally impactful content like that at Xbox.
