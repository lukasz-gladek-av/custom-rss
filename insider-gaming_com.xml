<p>Like all other competitive games, Overwatch 2 has a popular ranked mode that gamers can play and climb up the skill ladder. With multiple different ranks to hit, getting to the top is no easy feat. Here is a list of all the Overwatch 2 ranks and how you can hit them.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-overwatch-2-ranks">All Overwatch 2 Ranks</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the ranks in Overwatch 2:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze </strong>(V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Master</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Grandmaster</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Champion</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Top 500</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The game follows a pretty standard ranking system, featuring five levels in almost all of them, with five being where you start and one being the final level before ranking up. The game uses Matchmaking Rating (MMR), which many other games use too to calculate ranks. </p>



<p>However, the final rank, Top 500, is quite impressive to hit. Not many games have a final rank that specifies what number you are in the world in the game. This gives players a global leaderboard to strive to get their name on, making the game just that much more competitive.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-in-overwatch-2-guide-to-top-500">How to Rank Up in Overwatch 2 | Guide to Top 500</h2>



<p>To rank up in Overwatch 2 you simply must play ranked matches. As you progress through the game’s ranked system, you will find games tend to get much more difficult, as ranked uses skill-based matchmaking when putting you in matches.</p>



<p>Getting your name on the Top 500 list is not something that can just be done overnight. Many competitive Overwatch players spend countless hours grinding ranked and never even hit the Top 500.</p>



<p>Still, by winning matches, players can move up in the ranks. </p>



<p>When you first start playing ranked mode in Overwatch 2, the game will have you unranked for a series of games before calculating what badge you should receive. </p>



<p>While your first rank will not be Grandmaster or Champion, some players may start at as high as Gold.</p>

<p>MultiVersus is making major changes to how players can unlock fighters in the game. </p>



<p>Developer Player First Games <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-fighter-road" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has announced</a> the new “Fighter Road”. Starting November 12, this is the new way for players to unlock fighters in a more straightforward way than in the past.</p>



<p>“At its core,&nbsp;Fighter Road&nbsp;is a streamlined way to earn characters through an easy-to-follow progression track that players can tackle at their own pace,” the studio said. “This is a great way for&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>&nbsp;players to get their hands on the game’s robust and diverse cast of characters.”</p>



<h6 id="h-related-warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/">Warner Bros. Games Focusing on Batman, Mortal Kombat, And Hogwarts Legacy Moving Forward</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-how-multiversus-fighter-road-works">How MultiVersus Fighter Road Works</h2>



<p>Fighter road has players earning progress towards unlocking one new fighter at a time. The progress is earned through Fighter Road XP that gets awarded via matches, events, and the battle pass. </p>



<p>Of course, if you don’t want to work to unlock a specific fighter in MultiVersus, you can always just buy them outright with Fighter currency or Gleamium. However, Fighter currency will no longer be available starting with Season 4 on November 12, so what you spend comes from what you’ve earned to that point.</p>



<p>As far as tracking the progress towards fighter unlocks, Player First Games says that characters will be broken down into tiers based on “a number of factors”.</p>



<p>“The first tier, for example, consists of Shaggy, Banana Guard, Wonder Woman, and Batman,” the said. “While characters are unlocked in a specific order in Fighter Road, some tiers allow for players to choose which character they want to work toward unlocking next. </p>



<p>“Characters that are already owned by the player, will be omitted from the Road and, if the player wants to unlock any characters within a tier using their existing character tokens, they can still do so. As players progress on the Fighter Road, their progress will be displayed on a post-match screen that highlights their progress on the reward track.”</p>



<p>Should you complete the Fighter Road and unlock all of the fighters, any additional earned Fighter Road XP will be converted to Battle Pass XP at a 40% rate.</p>
