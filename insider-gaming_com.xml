<p>Here’s the official description for the Darkhold battle pass:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Darkhold contains two powerful spells that have aroused interest in opposing forces: The Vampiric Verses can create creatures of the night, while the Montesi Formula can eliminate them. When Eternal Night descended upon New York, the Darkhold’s pages were scattered across Manhattan. Now, the race is on to prevent its dark power from falling into the wrong hands. Join us in the battle in Marvel Rivals and help recover the lost pages!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-cs2-skin-wear-rating-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A CS2 skin wear rating is a crucial component in determining the value of the skin itself. Counter-Strike’s massive skin economy is made up of hundreds of thousands of skins. The wear rating of a skin can determine whether a skin is worth tens, hundreds, or even thousands of dollars.</p>



<p>Let’s take a deep dive into what CS2 skin wear rating is, what determines it, and how it affects a skin’s price.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-cs2-skin-wear-rating">What is CS2 Skin Wear Rating?</h2>



<p>A wear rating is <strong>a numerical value, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, that determines the amount of wear on a specific CS2 skin</strong>. The higher the wear rating, the more used and rugged it appears. The lower the wear rating, the more new and clean it appears. Wear rating is also commonly referred to as float value.</p>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>A Factory New Asiimov AK-47 skin.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>A Battle-Scarred Asiimov AK-47 skin.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>The wear rating directly determines what a skin’s exterior classification is:</p>



<ul>
<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.00 to 0.07 are considered Factory New</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.07 to 0.15 are considered Minimal Wear</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.15 to 0.38 are considered Field-Tested</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.38 to 0.45 are considered Well Worn</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.45 to 1.00 are considered Battle-Scarred</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>For virtually all skins, items that are Factory New buy and sell for much higher than any of the other exteriors. Then it’s usually a sharp drop to Minimal Wear prices, and then another sharp drop to the higher wear exterior prices. Skins that are closer to the 0.00 rating will sell for much more, even more than other Factory New skins. If you’re looking at Factory New skin listings on the marketplace, the cheapest ones are the ones closest to the 0.07 threshold.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-determines-cs2-skin-wear-rating">What Determines CS2 Skin Wear Rating?</h2>



<p><strong>A CS2 skin’s wear rating is determined when it is opened from a case</strong>. Skins are not guaranteed to be Factory New or Minimal Wear when opened from a case. It’s also a common misconception that CS2 skins degrade over time with use. Wear rating does not increase over time with use.</p>



<p>Many skins can only be opened within a specific exterior classification. Doppler knives, among <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-expensive-counter-strike-skins-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most expensive CS2 skins</a>, can only be opened as Factory New or as Minimal Wear, for example.</p>
