<p>During the latest The Crew Showcase, it was announced that The Crew 2 has received a new update today, October 16, introducing a Hybrid Mode (offline mode).</p>



<p>The Crew 2’s offline mode was announced back in September 2024, and earlier this year, Ubisoft Ivory Tower <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-will-begin-testing-the-crew-2-offline-mode-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that testing for it would begin on April 30. Within just a few months, the new Hybrid Mode will be delivered and was shadow-dropped in an update today. </p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-crew/motorfest/news-updates/44AueZeJRbz9H2BxrCJueZ/what-you-cant-miss-from-the-crew-showcase-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the developers of The Crew 2 announced that their brand-new offline mode is available today. The latest update will allow players to switch between the original online experience and the latest Hybrid mode. The Crew 2 was built on online multiplayer, so some features will not be available, including multiplayer modes, global rankings, and livery sharing, which require an internet connection. </p>



<p>The developers will provide a full breakdown of the differences between the original online mode and The Crew 2’s new offline Hybrid mode in a dedicated article. This article will also include details on how players will access and manage their offline save files in the latest update. The developers also stated that “This update represents a major milestone in our commitment to ensuring long-term access to The Crew 2 for all players.” </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Will Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Be Free To Play?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s going to be a huge moment when we get to drop into Battlefield 6’s battle royale mode. The spiritual successor to Firestorm and Hazard Zone will be a historic occasion, and we’re checking to see if it’s free-to-play, plus anything else cost-related, or what you need to hop in.</p>



<p>Battle royale is an interesting one in 2025. The genre’s peak days feel behind us more than they are ahead, but millions of players are still dropping into huge maps slowly being engulfed by electricity, storms, and gas. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> launched with a decent campaign and a brilliant multiplayer mode, but we’ve always known a battle royale extra was lurking in the background.</p>



<p>It’s fascinating to see how destruction is factored into the fray. Before we get there, however, let’s see if you’ve got to pay to take the ride.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play">Is Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Free To Play?</h2>

<p><strong>According to Insider Gaming sources, yes, the Battle Royale game mode will be completely free-to-play under the Battlefield 6 umbrella.</strong></p>



<p>We exclusively reported on Feb. 27, 2024, that EA was working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale mode</a> for the (then) upcoming Battlefield 6. Pretty much everything in that story came to fruition. But the story also added:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Ripple Effect, the studio that is working on a ‘new experience’ for the Battlefield franchise is working on a new Battle Royale title that’s currently aimed to be <strong>free-to-play</strong> and follow a similar strategy to the highly successful Call of Duty: Warzone that will see the free-to-play experience tie-in with its premium release.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Officially, all we know in this moment is that BF 6’s battle royale is happening. EA hasn’t confirmed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-pois-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>, nor officially confirmed our report that it will be free. Stay tuned for further updates, but we’ll be shocked if you have to pay an extra penny for BF 6’s battle royale—perhaps with one slight caveat.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-battlefield-6-battle-royale-be-a-standalone-game-like-warzone">Will Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Be A Standalone Game Like Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>There has been no news or leaks to say if Battlefield 6’s battle royale game is included in the overall BF 6 package, or if it’ll be a free-to-play download like Call of Duty: Warzone.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s that caveat we mentioned. We haven’t heard anything regarding EA’s final decision on the battle royale being completely free, or only free to paying Battlefield 6 customers.</p>



<p>Warzone is a Call of Duty game, but it’s a separate (free) download. We’ll have to see if the new battle royale component follows its path.</p>



<p>If we can and do learn more about the battle royale mode, you’ll hear it from us. We haven’t steered you far wrong when it comes to BF 6 news and leaks, so we’ll keep our eyes open on more battle royale news. Are you looking forward to seeing how different a BF 6 BR looks in 2025?
