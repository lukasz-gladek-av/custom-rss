<p>A CS2 skin wear rating is a crucial component in determining the value of the skin itself. Counter-Strike’s massive skin economy is made up of hundreds of thousands of skins. The wear rating of a skin can determine whether a skin is worth tens, hundreds, or even thousands of dollars.</p>



<p>Let’s take a deep dive into what CS2 skin wear rating is, what determines it, and how it affects a skin’s price.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-cs2-skin-wear-rating">What is CS2 Skin Wear Rating?</h2>



<p>A wear rating is <strong>a numerical value, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, that determines the amount of wear on a specific CS2 skin</strong>. The higher the wear rating, the more used and rugged it appears. The lower the wear rating, the more new and clean it appears. Wear rating is also commonly referred to as float value.</p>

<p>The wear rating directly determines what a skin’s exterior classification is:</p>



<ul>
<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.00 to 0.07 are considered Factory New</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.07 to 0.15 are considered Minimal Wear</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.15 to 0.38 are considered Field-Tested</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.38 to 0.45 are considered Well Worn</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.45 to 1.00 are considered Battle-Scarred</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>For virtually all skins, items that are Factory New buy and sell for much higher than any of the other exteriors. Then it’s usually a sharp drop to Minimal Wear prices, and then another sharp drop to the higher wear exterior prices. Skins that are closer to the 0.00 rating will sell for much more, even more than other Factory New skins. If you’re looking at Factory New skin listings on the marketplace, the cheapest ones are the ones closest to the 0.07 threshold.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-determines-cs2-skin-wear-rating">What Determines CS2 Skin Wear Rating?</h2>



<p><strong>A CS2 skin’s wear rating is determined when it is opened from a case</strong>. Skins are not guaranteed to be Factory New or Minimal Wear when opened from a case. It’s also a common misconception that CS2 skins degrade over time with use. Wear rating does not increase over time with use.</p>



<p>Many skins can only be opened within a specific exterior classification. Doppler knives, among <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-expensive-counter-strike-skins-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most expensive CS2 skins</a>, can only be opened as Factory New or as Minimal Wear, for example.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has announced that it has appointed a group of “leading advisors” to assist with exploring company options moving forward. The news comes as part of a special strategic update provided by the company on Thursday.</p>



<p>“Following the strategic and execution reviews initiated by the Executive Committee a few months ago, Ubisoft is taking decisive steps to reshape the Group in order to deliver best-in-class player experiences, enhance operational efficiency and maximize value creation,” the company said via press release shortly before the call took place.</p>



<p>During the call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that this group of advisors will “review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders.” He didn’t give details as to who these advisors are, but did say that things will be overseen by the independent members of the Board of Directors.</p>



<p>Guillemot says that he’s confident that this decision will “position Ubisoft for a stronger future” in the years to come, and that he’s confident there are “several potential paths” forward for the company.</p>







<p>As far as more information into what these paths are, Guillemot wouldn’t divulge. He was asked multiple times for more clarification, but said that he couldn’t say more and wouldn’t comment on “specific rumors” that were circulating. He reiterated, however, different options were being explored.</p>



<p>“We are limited in what we can say today,” he said while stating that the process has already been started with the advisors.</p>



<p>One of those potential paths is rumored to be a buyout by Chinese company Tencent. Guillemot was asked specifically about that possibility as well as the company being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-chinese-military-blacklist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added to a “Chinese Military Blacklist”</a> by the United States government. Guillemot, once again, declined to comment on either front.</p>



<p>The update regarding the state of the company comes as Ubisoft announced another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay for Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>. Guilletmot said that the delay was part of the company’s “renewed focus on gameplay quality and engaging Day-1 experiences”.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for Ubisoft as a company in 2025? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.&nbsp;</p>
