<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations may have only just launched on October 25 (today as of writing), but it’s already hit a sales milestone. Sega has announced that the game has sold 1 million copies.</p>



<p>The sales numbers come from copies sold worldwide on all available platforms.</p>







<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations is a remake of 2011’s Sonic Generations. Where it differs, however, is that it includes new content in the form of Shadow Generation.</p>



<p>“Sonic X Shadow Generations&nbsp;is a title that combines two games:&nbsp;Sonic Generations, where players can enjoy speed-running various stages with Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic, enhanced with new elements, and&nbsp;Shadow Generations, a completely new game featuring the dark hero Shadow&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a>&nbsp;through dynamic environments,” Sega’s overview of the game reads.</p>



<p>“The story begins as a mysterious creature called the “Time Eater” creates distortions in time and space, setting off separate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s for Sonic and Shadow. Players can look forward to a high-speed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>-adventure with distinct gameplay experiences and narratives.”</p>



<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations is available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
