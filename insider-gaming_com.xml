<p>At CES 2025, NVIDIA unveiled an AI innovation in PUBG – the ‘PUBG Ally’. This AI companion system will grant players a buddy to run around the map with, performing tasks and helping them out on a strategic level, being driven entirely by NVIDIA’s AI technology.</p>



<p>It was claimed that PUBG Ally characters will be capable of human-like behaviour, including sharp decision-making and advanced levels of audio and visual perception. The technology is set to appear in Naraka: Bladepoint and inZOI, but the most-talked-about introduction is in PUBG, the popular battle royale game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-the-first-time">Not The First Time</h2>



<p>In August 2024, I sat down with Arena Breakout: Infinite’s development team to learn about FACUL, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-facul/">revolutionary AI companion system</a> that would align players with AI support in place of real-world gamers. The system was yet to be finessed into the game, but the potential of the system seemed white-hot when it was presented at Gamescom.</p>



<p>It was a throwback of sorts to the decades-old command system found in games like SOCOM.</p>



<p>The PUBG Ally model promises to work the same way as MoreFun Studio’s FACUL engine. In PUBG, a proposed ‘co-playable character’ will support players by finding loot, driving vehicles, and providing cover fire. It’ll use ‘small language models’ to accomplish most of this, empowering the ‘CPC’ to act as a human would in every scenario imaginable.</p>



<p>If you avoid playing PUBG because you’re afraid of running solo in a battle royale game, look no further than the PUBG Ally model.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t confirmed <strong>when </strong>the system would be added to PUBG. It was stressed during the CES 2025 presentation that viewers were watching a tech demo and not a live representation of the model.</p>

<p>Hi-Rez Studios has officially confirmed that Smite 2 will transition from a paid alpha to a free-to-play open beta next week, on Tuesday, January 14. It was back in September 2024 that paying customers gained access to the Smite 2 alpha, but starting next Tuesday, you’ll be able to download and play Smite 2 without spending a penny.</p>



<p>The free-to-play transition will come hand-in-hand with a sizeable content update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-smite-2-free-to-play-update-incoming">Smite 2 Free-to-Play Update Incoming</h2>



<p>The first Smite title debuted in 2014, and it wasn’t until last year that Smite 2 surfaced in an alpha state. Now, the second title is preparing to be offered to a wider audience, with developer Hi-Rez Studios pushing it out with a free-to-play operating model.</p>



<p>When January 14 rolls around, Smite 2 will become free-to-play, but it’ll also receive a substantial update including new God characters, mechanics, and modes.</p>



<p>Smite 2 is already pretty diverse, featuring a stacked roster of playable characters – 45 in total. That number is set to be increased by more than 10% with this update, as five new Gods will come through into the game, four of which are throwbacks to the original game – Ullr, Mulan, Geb, and Agni.</p>



<p>The fifth God will be Aladdin, a character who is paired with a genie that can trap opponents at will. That sounds familiar!</p>



<p>Additionally, Hi-Rez Studios will be introducing a new 3-v-3 mode called Joust. This mode accommodates the arrival of an all-new map, made up of just one lane, such is the mode. The team has also pieced together a 1-v-1 mode called Duel, which will allow players to battle on a much more intimate playing field.</p>



<p>All this is being added to Smite 2 ‘s free-to-play update alongside a slew of quality-of-life changes, such as ‘Role Guides’, and balances.</p>



<p>Will you be downloading Smite 2 when it goes free-to-play? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
