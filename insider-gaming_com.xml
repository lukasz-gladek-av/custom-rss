<p>The CEO of Embark Studios has revealed that they don’t wish to promote PvP systems, as they don’t want to foster that type of gameplay. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders is undoubtedly one of the standout titles of 2025, and it shows no signs of slowing anytime soon, having recently hit a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new milestone of 12 million units sold</a>. At the same time, it seems the developers aren’t looking to go all-in on PvP to keep the fire burning, since the game wasn’t designed with that as a focus.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-devs-don-t-want-to-foster-pvp-type-gameplay">ARC Raiders Devs Don’t Want to Foster PvP-Type Gameplay</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameBeat’s</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dean Takahashi</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/arc-raiders/250358/news/the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players-arc-raiders-dev-explains-why-it-wont-add-additional-pvp-m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund revealed why they aren’t looking to promote PvP systems. The CEO first mentioned discussions about adding Nemesis systems; however, they don’t know where the team is at right now and are also happy that the game doesn’t have a leaderboard and “it’s not competitive.”</p>



<p>Söderlund adds that the dev team “doesn’t want to necessarily foster that type of gameplay” as “the game isn’t about shooting other players”. Of course, the game allows you to be aggressive and fight other players, “but the ethos of the game has never been to go in and shoot players.” The PvP element was added to craft tension. </p>



<p>The Embark CEO then spoke about the game being designed to be played “without other players for a long time,” and noted that this worked quite well in some instances. However, as soon as other players were added, the dev team had to resort to subtle ways of signalling, rather than telling you how many players are on the server, how many have died, etc. </p>



<p>Hence, ARC Raiders is all about players using audio and visual cues when engaging in PvP situations. Players need to hear other players shooting and see raider flares go up to see where the action is. Not providing all the information at once creates tension, forcing players to decide whether exploring the area where the action is a risk worth taking. </p>



<p>However, the CEO also said that private servers in ARC Raiders are “absolutely something we could consider,” and that could be an excellent addition for players looking for more PvP action. </p>

<p>StarRupture has officially launched into early access, with the Creepy Jar title putting players on a hostile planet tasked with survival, and controller support is a feature players have raised questions about.</p>



<p>Early access to StarRupture launched on January 7, giving players the first opportunity to dive into the game, but there’s still a lot to come in development before the full release.</p>



<p>If you want to know all the details on the status of controller support in StarRupture, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-starrupture-have-controller-support">Does StarRupture Have Controller Support?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not yet. Image via Creepy Jar</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, StarRupture does not include controller support following the launch of early access on January 6, with only mouse and keyboard support.</strong></p>



<p>While it is possible to map out controller inputs using Steam, the process can be complicated if you don’t know what you’re doing, and there’s a chance that you will miss some crucial inputs, particularly for features that might not be immediately clear at launch.</p>



<p>Steam does provide the option to download controller input profiles created by other players, so it’s worth keeping an eye on the Reddit and Discord pages for any creations.</p>



<p>The door is not closed to controller support entirely, however, as StarRupture launched in an early access stage and development of the title continues.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-starrupture-add-controller-support">Will StarRupture Add Controller Support?</h2>



<p><strong>StarRupture will add official controller support in the future, but there is no timeframe of when it will be added.</strong></p>



<p>The early access roadmap overview shared by the developers specifies plans for controller support, along with plans for additional accessibility support, including improved keybinds, subtitle options, and adjustable text size.</p>



<p>Controller support’s inclusion in the early access roadmap indicates there are plans to add it before the full release, an approach that varies froma a previous release by Creepy Jar, Green Hell.</p>



<p>Initially launched in early access in August 2018, the 1.0 release of Green Hell followed in September 2019, with controller support then added in December of the same year.</p>



<p>No timeline has been stated yet for the duration of early access and the full launch, but, although planned, controller support may still be a way off.</p>

<p>Major collabs continue to come thick and fast in Fortnite, with continuous leaks indicating what players can expect, and South Park is currently the talk of the community.</p>



<p>Fortnite has regularly partnered with some of the biggest franchises from the world of gaming, movies, TV, and music, with a regular flurry of new collab items in the Item Shop, along with larger crossovers featuring in-game content.</p>



<p>South Park has been a rumored addition in Fortnite for a while, and Insider Gaming has all the collab details you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-south-park-coming-to-fortnite">Is South Park Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Incoming. Image via South Park Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Epic Games officially revealed the South Park collab on January 6, following a slew of leaks indicating that the infamous TV series would be landing in the game.</strong></p>



<p>Rumours of South Park’s addition in Fortnite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-collab-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first appeared in October 2025</a>, with additional leaks and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-leak-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details then emerging in December</a> of the same year. A month later, the South Park collab has been officially confirmed by Epic Games.</p>



<p>Additional details have not been revealed at the time of writing, but HypeX stated in December that it won’t just be the addition of skins and cosmetic items into the Item Shop. Instead, it’s claimed that the collab will feature in-game content including rifts, a boss, a Mythic weapon, Medallions, and an unknown consumable.</p>



<p>It’s also unclear whether the collab items will be available in the main Battle Royale mode, or whether they will be a part of gameplay in other mode, like Blitz or Reload.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-south-park-coming-to-fortnite">When is South Park Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>Epic Games’ reveal of the South Park collab confirmed the drop will take place on Friday, January 9, coinciding with the first major update of the year.</strong></p>



<p>The January 9th update marks the end of Winterfest, and, with there still being almost two months of Chapter 6, Season 1 remaining, new content drops are expected, and there are some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-og-driftboard-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bug fixes with specific quests to iron out</a>, too.</p>



<p>Details of exactly what is coming in the South Park collab will likely start to emerge in leaks when the servers go down for maintenance, with Epic Games then revealing everything officially in a blog or social media post.</p>
