<p>After hearing Take-Two CEO’s recent comments on supporting “legacy titles”, GTA Online may have a chance at survival even after GTA 6 arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two’s CEO, was recently asked why players should keep investing in GTA Online in 2025 when an improved and enhanced version could arrive with GTA 6. Zelnick didn’t mention GTA Online or an online version of GTA 6 specifically; however, his answer provides some hope to the massive community.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Zelnick stated that his statements are theoretic, as he can’t mention a particular project (GTA 6 Online) “when an announcement hasn’t been made.” However, he added that Take-Two is known for its support properties if the community is still involved with the games.</p><p>&nbsp;As an example, he explained that 2K released NBA 2K Online in China in 2012, and soon after, a new version called NBA 2K Online 2 was released in China in 2017. However, even after the latest version arrived, the company didn’t sunset the first online game, and they are both still available in the market. The CEO concluded, stating, “We’ve shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>GTA Online is one of the most popular multiplayer games, bringing in over 150,000 players daily on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/271590/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam alone</a>. The online version of GTA 5 has been available for more than 10 years now, and players have gathered a considerable amount of wealth and assets in the game by investing a lot of time and sometimes a lot of real-world money. Take-Two and Rockstar have earned a lot through GTA Online, and with a community so big, there might be a chance that the game survives even after GTA 6 arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the GTA 6 publisher is ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-publisher-is-not-worried-about-the-game-influencing-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not worried</a>’ about the game influencing violence in the real world. Also, Take-Two’s CEO recently spoke about GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-gta-6-not-coming-to-pc-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not coming to PC at launch</a>. Do you want GTA Online to survive even after GTA 6 releases?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lies-of-p-overture-release-period%E2%80%94how-to-play-prequel-dlc.1109433/</guid>

<p>We return to Krat to battle more creatures and find out where everything began. The Lies of P Overture release is an extensive prequel with the DLC aiming to trace the outbreak’s origins back to its beginning.</p>



<p>Lies of P was one of 2023’s most surprising debuts. I hold my hand up and say I thought it looked like nothing but a Bloodborne clone—and a pale imitation at best. I have since gorged on humble pie and was utterly moved once I finally rolled the credits after a million and one deaths. </p>



<p>Lies of P is an unbelievable addition to the Soulslike genre, and the announcement of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-overture-prequel-announced-its-not-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lies of P Overture</a> prequel was music to my ears.</p>



<h2 id="h-lies-of-p-overture-prequel-release-period">Lies of P Overture Prequel Release Period</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New possibilities await. Credit to Neowiz Games and Round8 Studio.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Lies of P Overture is set to release during Summer 2025, but we don’t have an exact date to go with this timeframe.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Sony State of Play Event</a> is where we first caught a glimpse of Lies of P Overture. Again, it was surprising due to Lies of P’s ending. I won’t spoil anything, but it felt like the developers would likely be working on a fully fledged sequel.</p>



<p>Neowiz Games and Round8 Studio were actually working on prequel DLC! In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/lies-of-p-overture-launches-summer-2025-on-ps5-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Lies of P’s director discussed Overture and its goals.</p>



<p>“Do you remember the moment when you, as Geppetto’s most ambitious masterwork, woke up in the middle of the great Puppet Frenzy, a massacre that devastated the entire city around you? Now, you will venture back in time to experience the harrowing journey that birthed that fateful moment. Through Lies of P: Overture, we aimed to fully refine, forge and complete the story as we originally envisioned it,” said Jiwon Choi.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-lies-of-p-to-play-overture-prequel">Do You Need Lies of P to Play Overture Prequel?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, you need a copy of Lies of P to play the Overture prequel DLC.</strong></p>



<p>Many DLCs allow you to play the content without needing the base game. That’s 100% not the case here, and you need a working physical or digital copy of Lies of P.</p>



<p>What isn’t confirmed though is if this is post-game DLC, it can be started midway, or available from the second you boot Lies of P up for the first time. With Overture being a prequel, I’d lean toward the DLC being readily available, even if you’ve never played the base game of Lies of P before.</p>



<p>We’ll update this hub once we learn the accurate release date, as well as what’s needed to play Overture.</p>



<hr>



<p>Did the Lies of P Overture DLC announcement catch you off guard too? Did you play or finish Lies of P? What have you made of the early Overture gameplay footage so far? Let us know.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Willl There Be a Days Gone 2? Sequel Status Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/willl-there-be-a-days-gone-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/willl-there-be-a-days-gone-2-sequel-status-explained.1109409/</guid>

<p>Days Gone 2 is a sequel many gaming fans have wanted for a long time. Its sales suggested the debut title was a success, but 6 years later, we’re still twiddling our thumbs, waiting to get our Freaker on for Days Gone 2.</p>



<p>I’m glad I get to write about Days Gone as I think it’s one of the most underrated games of all time. I played it when it first came out, and I’ll never understand the lukewarm critical reception it got. Freakers and hoards are utterly terrifying, the story is consistently engaging throughout, and it’s a rock-solid survival title from start to finish.</p>



<p>Rumors circulated in late 2024 that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-circulate-that-days-gone-is-getting-ps5-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone PS5 Remaster</a> was in the works. This finally happened at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s February 2025 State of Play</a>. Now, the Days Gone 2 discourse is hotter than ever.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-a-days-gone-2-sequel-happening">Is a Days Gone 2 Sequel Happening?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Could it be? Credit to Bend Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As it stands, a Days Gone 2 sequel is not in development, nor is it on the cards—and there’s a good chance it will never happen.</strong></p>



<p>It breaks my heart writing this, and I hope I get to backtrack on everything I’m writing one day. But we believe developer Bend Studio has moved on and was working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-layoffs-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-service title before it was canceled by Sony</a>. This means outside of Days Gone’s Broken Road DLC—and now the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-remastered-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone Remastered</a> release—this may be all the <a href="https://www.bendstudio.com/game/days-gone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Days Gone</a> content we get.</p>



<p>Oh, and we also mustn’t forget its connection to Astro Bot—something <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/">Days Gone’s dir</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/">ctor</a> wasn’t keen on.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-hasn-t-days-gone-had-a-sequel">Why Hasn’t Days Gone Had a Sequel?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s been widely reported Sony was not the biggest fan of Days Gone when it first came out, despite the game selling very well.</strong></p>



<p>Days Gone took a long time to develop and probably cost a decent amount of money to make and market. But <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2023/12/20/playstation-game-sales-bloodborne-days-gone-7-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game World Observer reported</a> in 2023 Days Gone had sold close to <strong>7.5 million copies</strong>—bettering Bloodborne and 2016’s Ratchet &amp; Clank—and by now, it’s probably closer to 8 million—with the Remaster sure to give it a boost.</p>



<p>Despite this, Jeff Ross—a senior member of the Days Gone team—had this to say on there being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-sequel-sony-never-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no sequel</a>: “A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence <strong>it will never happen</strong>. <strong>Sony higher ups like Hermen were never fans</strong>, so you won’t hear about it at the PlayStation State of Play today or ever.”</p>



<p>I think the only way we’re going to see a sequel is if there’s interest. The Days Gone remaster needs to sell well, and people need to show they want another game. Plus, if Bend Studio’s rumored live-service title has been stopped, it means they’re free. Maybe they have some time to develop a certain Zombie-game sequel?</p>



<hr>



<p>In short, if <em>you </em>want a Days Gone 2 sequel, support it by buying it. Post about it on social media, make videos, and everything in between. What are your memories of Days Gone? Is it scandalous we’ve never had a Days Gone 2?</p>
