<p>Everyone who has played ARC Raiders knows that Scrappy the Rooster exists. He’s a quirky little bird that struts around your Raider Den, collecting all kinds of resources while you’re off topside fighting the ARC – and other Raiders. But nobody really knows how he got there and what his purpose in life is, besides gathering scrap items.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has just set the story straight on where Scrappy came from and why he exists in ARC Raiders.</p>







<h2 id="h-scrappy-has-an-origin-story">Scrappy Has an Origin Story</h2>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/the-story-of-scrappy-the-rooster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders website</a>, Johan, a 3D artist working on the game, revealed the origin story behind Scrappy, everyone’s favorite and lovable rooster character:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was living with my parents at the time – they happened to keep chickens. Mid-zoom meeting, the birds somehow snuck into the house and strutted around behind me, instantly stealing the show and derailing the meeting entirely. Among those birds was Hȧkan, the rooster that would go on to become Scrappy.</p>



<p><strong>Hȧkan was unlike the other roosters.</strong>&nbsp;Friendly, cuddly, and blind in one eye, he had a habit of stepping in his food and tripping over himself. I adored him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One day, I decided to photoscan Håkan and sneak him into the game as a silly little easter egg. In early builds, you could sometimes spot a rough version of Hȧkan sprinting around the cantina.</p>



<p><strong>But then, Hȧkan</strong>&nbsp;<strong>got his chance to shine.&nbsp;</strong>The team needed an in-game asset that would be used as a “resource producer,” something that would provide you with materials after each raid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cycled through many ideas: robots, cats… robot-cats! But the art team didn’t have time to build them and the meeting stalled, until someone raised their hand and said, in a moment of brilliance, “don’t we have a rooster?”</p>



<p><strong>That spark of inspiration turned into a phenomenon.&nbsp;</strong>Scrappy went from hidden easter egg, to “temporary mesh we’ll definitely replace later”, to a beloved and irreplaceable part of the ARC Raiders universe. So next time you see Scrappy, tell him I say hello!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a quaint story, but it perfectly explains why Scrappy exists in a world so devoid of animal life. Most of the humour has been sucked clean out of the world on account of it being a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but knowing that Scrappy is waiting for you when you return to Speranza is always a nice touch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gentlemates CDL Roster Revealed Ahead of 2026 Season]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gentlemates-cdl-roster-revealed-2026-season/</link>
            <guid>1365898</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re just weeks out from the start of the Call of Duty League 2026 season, and teams are starting to be unveiled. The organizations across the board are lifting the lid on jerseys, rosters, and operating models, as the Call of Duty esports world prepares for what could be one of the most ambitious seasons in CDL history.</p>



<p>Next season, the Call of Duty League comes back to the United Kingdom for the first time in <strong>many years</strong>, teams have been shaken up more than <strong>ever</strong>, and the Call of Duty League Championship is headed back to <strong>Las Vegas</strong>.</p>



<p>Gentlemates is the latest team to uncover its four-man roster heading into the new season.</p>



<h2 id="h-your-gentlemates-have-been-confirmed">Your Gentlemates Have Been Confirmed</h2>



<p>Gentlemates, which assumed control of the Los Angeles Guerrillas spot last season, has confirmed the four-man starting lineup ahead of the commencement of the 2026 CDL season:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dylan ‘Envoy’ Hannon</li>



<li>Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe</li>



<li>Daunte ‘Sib’ Gray</li>



<li>Travis ‘Neptune’ McCloud</li>
</ul>



<p>It was a mixed season last year for these players, but perhaps none more so than Neptune, a superstar player who broke back into the CDL under the Vancouver Surge banner, going on to land in second place at multiple Major tournaments <strong>and </strong>at COD Champs. It was <strong>almost </strong>Neptune’s greatest season ever.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Ghosty and Envoy migrate from LA Thieves, their spots overtaken by a restructuring that has finally pulled aBeZy out from under the FaZe banner.</p>



<p>LAT won Major 3 and Major 4 and went on to top the chart by the end of the season, but a hugely lacklustre performance in Kitchener at COD Champs saw the team drop out in seventh place after being defeated by Boston Breach <strong>and </strong>Vancouver Surge. There’s likely very little love lost between Envoy, Ghosty, and Neptune.</p>



<p>Sib comes over from Cloud9 NY, a rehash of the old New York Subliners roster that was also taken over last season. It was a horrible year for C9NY, with the team failing to secure a spot of traction the whole season through, falling extremely short and not even making it to Champs.</p>



<p>Ironically, C9NY <strong>still </strong>finished above LAG M8 in the season standings.</p>



<p>It’s going to be a busy year in the Call of Duty League. Let me know what roster you’re most interested in on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Invented a Whole New Genre and Nobody Noticed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-invented-a-whole-new-genre-and-nobody-noticed/</link>
            <guid>1365880</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders continues to stun audiences worldwide, retaining a player base equalling hundreds of thousands of users a month after launch. It has proven to be one of the most energetic, electrifying games of the year, storming up the charts and taking over social and streaming platforms with ease.</p>



<p>What many don’t seem to have noticed is that ARC Raiders didn’t just disrupt an existing genre; it <strong>created a new one</strong>. This stellar title from Embark Studios has been dubbed an extraction shooter by <strong>all comers</strong>, but it’s not… It’s something else entirely.</p>











<p>ARC Raiders is <strong>not </strong>an extraction shooter, but an extraction <strong>adventure</strong>. This naming convention hasn’t been used before, and every other game in the space that walks a close line to ARC Raiders typically refers to itself as a simple ‘extraction shooter’.</p>



<p>With ARC Raiders, Embark Studios has gone <strong>beyond </strong>the fundamental term and created a category that better describes the nature of this game. It’s a broader, bolder, and more sizeable extraction title than we’ve ever seen, packed with lore and an intriguing backstory that’s being explored over the next few years, all being well.</p>



<p>This is what I mean by the naming conventions, taking what other developers and publishers in the space refer to their game as on storefronts and in marketing materials:</p>



<ul>
<li>Escape from Tarkov – ‘Extraction FPS’</li>



<li>Arena Breakout: Infinite – ‘Extraction Shooter’</li>



<li>Incursion: Red River – ‘First-Person Extraction Shooter’</li>



<li>Zero Sievert – ‘Extraction Shooter’</li>



<li>Gray Zone Warfare – ‘Extraction Shooter’</li>



<li>PUBG: Black Budget – ‘Extraction Shooter’</li>
</ul>



<p>And then <a href="https://arcraiders.com/#purchase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there’s ARC Raiders</a>… <strong>Extraction Adventure</strong>.</p>



<p>The game’s blurb relays this sentiment perfectly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ARC Raiders blends the tension from extraction shooters with atmospheric settings from the adventure genre. Lurking threats—from deadly machines to other Raiders—create a constant ebb and flow of intensity, where every moment is charged with the thrill of high stakes. Extract valuable loot and explore the unfolding mysteries of a vibrant, lethal world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been dubbed an ‘immersive world’ that unfolds over multiple biomes, taking players from arid environments to cold, surgical facilities carved deep into mountainsides. The social elements of ARC Raiders make it more unpredictable than anything to emerge in the space in years, and it’s that uncertain edge that makes each raid ‘absolute cinema’.</p>



<p>With some RPG elements woven into the game’s skill paths, a far-reaching story that’s being drip-fed to players over time, and the ability to lead an experience over several iterations of characters, each with different opportunities, ARC Raiders really is in a league of its own.</p>







<p>Do you think it’s right that Embark Studios has dubbed ARC Raiders an ‘extraction adventure’, or would you call it something else? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Splash Damage, the studio behind games like Gears Tactics and Star Wars: Hunters, is facing layoffs that could impact the entire company.</p>



<p>These new layoffs are happening just two months after Splash Damage was sold by former parent company Tencent to an unknown group of private equity investors. </p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/splash-damage_an-update-from-splash-damage-activity-7399486098588196864-pz0I/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> on Wednesday, it was announced that the company was <strong>“entering a studio-wide consultation process affecting all roles.”</strong> This consultation, they say, was a <strong>“difficult step” </strong>for the company, but it’s one that they believe is <strong>“necessary so Splash Damage can remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market.”</strong></p>



<p>This is the second time this year that Splash Damage has faced layoffs. After the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/transformers-reactivate-cancelled-splash-damage-to-lay-off-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelation of Transformers: Reactivate</a>, the studio said that it needed to scale down in order to <strong>“refocus our efforts on other projects.”</strong></p>



<p>Those efforts included Star Wars: Hunters, a game that released on mobile in June 2024. In January 2025, the game released in Early Access on Windows, but was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-hunters-is-shutting-down-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled just two months</a> later with the game shutting down fully on October 1, 2025.</p>







<p>The company’s statement on Wednesday ended with a promise to “explore every option” in order to retain as many employees as possible, while giving support to those who will be let go.</p>



<p><strong>“We know this kind of change is emotionally tough, and we will do what we can to guide our people through this process with honesty and care,”</strong> they said.</p>



<p>Formed in 2001, Splash Damage has worked on a mix of its own games while also co-developing other titles. Games on its resume include Gears of War 4 and 5, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, and Doom 3. Currently, the studio is working on an open-world survival game called “Project Astrid”. That game was announced back in 2023, but no updates have come since. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to ask if the sale had anything to do with the layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>
