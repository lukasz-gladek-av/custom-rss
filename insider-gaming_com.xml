<p>Larain has revealed that they will refrain from using GenAI tools for concept art or dialogue text generation for Divinity following recent community blowback.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Larian Studios was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-larian-employees-fire-back-at-bosss-ai-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under fire</a> from the community recently after the CEO stated that “everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it” regarding AI. The CEO later confirmed that the dev team will hold an AMA to clear up confusion about AI usage and address other aspects of the game, and that day has finally arrived. </p>







<h2 id="h-divinity-will-not-feature-any-genai-art-or-text-generation">Divinity Will Not Feature Any GenAI Art or Text Generation</h2>



<p>Revealed through Larian’s Divinity AMA on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games</a>, Larian CEO Swen Vincke has confirmed that “there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity.” Vincke then addressed the discussion around “AI tools as part of concept art exploration”, explaining that it didn’t mean the concept art was generated through AI; however, to avoid any confusion in the community, they have decided to “refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development.” </p>



<p>At the same time, the development team has been constantly working on speeding up the development process and feels that GenAI can help with this process. GenAI can help in refining ideas faster, “leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.” </p>



<p>However, the CEO has confirmed that Larian “will not generate ‘creative assets’ that end up in a game without being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data.” If GenAI ends up being used to create in-game assets, it will be trained on the data Larian owns. The Writing Director for Divinity confirmed that the same stance applies for the writing as well, and they “don’t have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity.” </p>







<p>In other news, Larian has confirmed that players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-says-players-dont-need-to-play-older-divinity-games-for-the-new-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t need to play older games</a> before the upcoming Divinity title. Additionally, the game will follow the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-plans-to-follow-the-same-early-access-format-as-other-larian-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same early access format</a> as the previous titles.

            <title><![CDATA[There’s A 4th Game Coming During The Xbox Developer Direct]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On Thursday, Microsoft confirmed three games would be appearing at the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct later this month. When the three games were announced, many fans were left wondering if that would be it for the event. Well, according to a new report, there’s at least one more game.</p>



<p>First mentioned by Shinobi on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot36-oops-all-obsidian.1310962/page-215#post-149812867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reset Era forums</a>, Xbox is planning to show a “secret fourth game” during the Developer Direct. Shortly there after, another outlet corroborated those claims.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-this-fourth-game-at-xbox-developer-direct">What Is This Fourth Game At Xbox Developer Direct?</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-xbox-developer-direct-will-feature-a-secret-unannounced-fourth-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, the fourth game not only exists, but it’s reportedly a <strong>“promising indie title from a third-party publisher”. </strong></p>



<p>No other details on what this game could be was mentioned by either Shinobi or VGC. </p>



<p>Despite the reliability of both sources, it’s important to note that plans can change and that everything should be taken with a grain of salt until either the show airs, or it can be confirmed by Insider Gaming.</p>







<p>As far as what is guaranteed to be there, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-games-confirmed-for-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox confirmed</a> that Forza Horizon 6, Fable, and Game Freak’s Beast of Reincarnation will be shown. Forza Horizon 6 will get its first gameplay reveal, Beast of Reincarnation will see details of the game’s protagonist Emma’s plan manipulation abilities, and Fable will get its first extended look. </p>



<p>Last year’s show featured games like Doom: The Dark Ages, Ninja Gaiden 4, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 3. There was even a surprise Ninja Gaiden 2 Black shadow drop announced.</p>
