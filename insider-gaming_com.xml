<p>StarRupture has officially launched into early access, with the Creepy Jar title putting players on a hostile planet tasked with survival, and controller support is a feature players have raised questions about.</p>



<p>Early access to StarRupture launched on January 7, giving players the first opportunity to dive into the game, but there’s still a lot to come in development before the full release.</p>



<p>If you want to know all the details on the status of controller support in StarRupture, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-starrupture-have-controller-support">Does StarRupture Have Controller Support?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not yet. Image via Creepy Jar</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, StarRupture does not include controller support following the launch of early access on January 6, with only mouse and keyboard support.</strong></p>



<p>While it is possible to map out controller inputs using Steam, the process can be complicated if you don’t know what you’re doing, and there’s a chance that you will miss some crucial inputs, particularly for features that might not be immediately clear at launch.</p>



<p>Steam does provide the option to download controller input profiles created by other players, so it’s worth keeping an eye on the Reddit and Discord pages for any creations.</p>



<p>The door is not closed to controller support entirely, however, as StarRupture launched in an early access stage and development of the title continues.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-starrupture-add-controller-support">Will StarRupture Add Controller Support?</h2>



<p><strong>StarRupture could add official controller support in the future, but there is no guarantee it will be added, and doesn’t seem to be a priority during development.</strong></p>



<p>The early access roadmap overview shared by the developers does not specify plans for controller support, although there are plans for additional accessibility support, including improved keybinds, subtitle options, and adjustable text size.</p>



<p>Controller support’s omission from the early access roadmap could indicate there are no plans to add it until post-launch of the full release, an approach that was seen in a previous release by Creepy Jar, Green Hell.</p>



<p>Initially launched in early access in August 2018, the 1.0 release of Green Hell followed in September 2019, with controller support then added in December of the same year.</p>



<p>No timeline has been stated yet for the duration of early access and the full launch, but it’s clear the addition of controller support could be a way off.</p>

<p>Major collabs continue to come thick and fast in Fortnite, with continuous leaks indicating what players can expect, and South Park is currently the talk of the community.</p>



<p>Fortnite has regularly partnered with some of the biggest franchises from the world of gaming, movies, TV, and music, with a regular flurry of new collab items in the Item Shop, along with larger crossovers featuring in-game content.</p>



<p>South Park has been a rumored addition in Fortnite for a while, and Insider Gaming has all the collab details you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-south-park-coming-to-fortnite">Is South Park Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Incoming. Image via South Park Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Epic Games officially revealed the South Park collab on January 6, following a slew of leaks indicating that the infamous TV series would be landing in the game.</strong></p>



<p>Rumours of South Park’s addition in Fortnite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-collab-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first appeared in October 2025</a>, with additional leaks and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-leak-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details then emerging in December</a> of the same year. A month later, the South Park collab has been officially confirmed by Epic Games.</p>



<p>Additional details have not been revealed at the time of writing, but HypeX stated in December that it won’t just be the addition of skins and cosmetic items into the Item Shop. Instead, it’s claimed that the collab will feature in-game content including rifts, a boss, a Mythic weapon, Medallions, and an unknown consumable.</p>



<p>It’s also unclear whether the collab items will be available in the main Battle Royale mode, or whether they will be a part of gameplay in other mode, like Blitz or Reload.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-south-park-coming-to-fortnite">When is South Park Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>Epic Games’ reveal of the South Park collab confirmed the drop will take place on Friday, January 9, coinciding with the first major update of the year.</strong></p>



<p>The January 9th update marks the end of Winterfest, and, with there still being almost two months of Chapter 6, Season 1 remaining, new content drops are expected, and there are some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-og-driftboard-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bug fixes with specific quests to iron out</a>, too.</p>



<p>Details of exactly what is coming in the South Park collab will likely start to emerge in leaks when the servers go down for maintenance, with Epic Games then revealing everything officially in a blog or social media post.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-inspired-ending-stranger-things/</link>
            <guid>1399084</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Stranger Things recently wrapped after almost a decade of being on the air. On New Year’s Day, the final episode, with a whopping two-hour runtime, aired on Netflix and broke the hearts of millions of fans worldwide. Whether you loved it or hated it, the ultimate episode wrapped up almost every core story put forward by the writers over the last ten years.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the Duffer brothers, the creators of Stranger Things, revealed what Dungeons &amp; Dragons-themed game inspired the <strong>ending battle </strong>against the Mind Flayer and Vecna in Stranger Things.</p>







<h2 id="h-that-s-how-you-take-down-these-monsters">‘That’s How You Take Down These Monsters’</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Variety</a>, Ross and Matt Duffer, the creators and directive minds behind Stranger Things, offered up all kinds of information about the show, how it wrapped, and what it took to get to this point.</p>



<p>Midway through the interview, the talk turned to the final battle between Vecna, the physical manifestation of the Mind Flayer, and the good guys from Hawkins. It was a phenomenal sequence that showed how these unlikely heroes were able to get the upper hand on a behemoth of an opponent like the Mind Flayer.</p>



<p>Matt Duffer explained what inspired the final battle:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We were thinking about D&amp;D, and I was playing&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate 3&nbsp;at the time, and&nbsp;we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat it was for the entire party to work together. Everyone had fully realized — either through self-acceptance or they’ve resolved all their various issues — moving into that final battle, they’re absolutely primed. </p>



<p>They’re the ultimate team, and it’s the party working all together to defeat this thing. And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that’s where I go back to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and something like&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate. Because that’s how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable. Lots of video game references were applied to that final battle.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 and Stranger Things are inherently linked to the same Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe. The core exception is that Baldur’s Gate 3 remains more aligned with the source material, while Stranger Things is more <strong>inspired by </strong>it and uses references in an alternate way.</p>



<p>For instance, the young heroes in Stranger Things name the series’ Big Bad the ‘Mind Flayer’, flanked by ‘Vecna’, but that’s not their true identity; it’s just what the D&amp;D-loving kids refer to them as based on their attributes and make-up.</p>

<p>Detroit: Become Human is one of the best story-driven adventure titles ever made. It was pieced together by Quantic Dream and released way back in 2018, emerging on Steam as a port in 2020. The game tells the story of a race of androids breaking free from their programming and conditioning to rise against their human creators and oppressors.</p>



<p>In the last two weeks, Detroit: Become Human has established itself as a best-selling game on Steam, becoming the second-most bought title on the platform behind ARC Raiders and shifting almost (an estimated) <strong>one million copies</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-is-detroit-become-human-surging-on-steam">Why is Detroit: Become Human Surging on Steam?</h2>



<p>A recent report from Alinea Analytics revealed that Steam generated substantial revenue in December 2025. The Valve-backed storefront generated a whopping $1.6 billion, a year-over-year increase of more than 22%. The growth was elevated by games like ARC Raiders being released and selling extremely well in a short period.</p>



<p>One unexpected title to storm up the charts was 2018’s Detroit: Become Human, which Alinea estimates sold approximately 993,000 copies from December 21 to January 5. That’s almost <strong>one million sales</strong> for a game that was released nearly eight years ago.</p>



<p>Per the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-steam-games-that-sold-the-most" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report from Alinea</a>, the staggering growth was spurred by the game having a deep discount – the steepest discount the title has ever seen on the platform. It crashed down from $40 to just $4, representing a fair amount of bang for the average gamer’s buck.</p>



<p>Detroit: Become Human was only topped by ARC Raiders, which sold around 1.2 million copies on Steam in the same timeframe.</p>



<p>The likes of PEAK, Battlefield 6, and R.E.P.O. also claimed spots in the best-seller charts on Steam.</p>



<p>Detroit: Become Human is a phenomenal and emotional game that is totally open-ended. It mirrors titles like Beyond: Two Souls, Heavy Rain, and Until Dawn, giving players full control over every action their characters make, allowing them to influence the direction of a story that has multiple endings and branching concepts.</p>



<p>The sales figures also pushed Detroit: Become Human to an all-time high peak player count of 25,615 users on January 4.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation Promotes Strange Resident Evil Rip-off Named ‘Ebola Village’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-promote-resident-evil-rip-off-ebola-village/</link>
            <guid>1399069</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new trailer uploaded to the official PlayStation YouTube channel, gamers get a first-hand glimpse at ‘Ebola Village’, an upcoming first-person horror shooter coming January 23rd to PlayStation 5 and <strong>PlayStation 4</strong>. The title is the first bizarre note, and it only gets worse from there.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to point out the gen-AI cover for the video, the stark similarities to Resident Evil (right down to the game’s title font), and the low-quality make-up of the gameplay, which looks years out of date.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Ebola Village came out on PC several months ago. What’s even more perplexing is that this is the latest in a line of similar titles, none of which have ever managed to gain any traction.</p>











<p>The comments under the recent trailer upload for Ebola Village are immensely negative and accurately representative of the <strong>confusion </strong>PlayStation fans have about this game.</p>



<p>One wrote, ‘We got Resident Evil at home,’ playing on a classic meme, while another declared, ‘Official PlayStation account advertising a genuine ripoff shovelware game might be a new low.’</p>



<p>Here’s the full trailer, in case you want to see the content for yourself:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ebola Village - Release Date Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRM0AdPcs3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The trailer showcases a few sequences that closely mirror content seen across the Resident Evil franchise in the last two decades or so. For instance, the player character being chased by a deranged villager wielding a chainsaw, which is instantly reminiscent of 2004’s Resident Evil 4.</p>



<p>Everything from the animations to the visuals screams ‘low budget’, and while that’s not normally a problem (we love indie games here), the subject matter of Ebola Village is much more than just ‘inspired’ by games like Resident Evil. In the comments under the video, gamers were quick to parody the title:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘What’s next, COVID City?’</li>



<li>‘Tuberculosis Town next’</li>



<li>‘From the makers of Coronaland and SARSville comes a terrifying new chapter’</li>
</ul>



<p>Ebola Village will be released digitally on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on January 23, and perhaps it’ll be worth playing to see how it shapes up after all. On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306030/EBOLA_VILLAGE/?curator_clanid=33714941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, the game somehow managed to scrape a ‘Very Positive’ rating from 319 reviews, at the time of writing.</p>
