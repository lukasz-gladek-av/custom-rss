<p>Fortnite might have another Dragon Ball collaboration in the works, and this time, it’s with the latest Daima series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As revealed by <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1904609271561805956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Loolo_WRLD</a> on X (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fortnite-reportedly-getting-dragon-ball-daima-skins-collaboration-crossover-item-shop-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>), “an ID related to a new Dragon Ball wave” has been spotted in the Fortnite files, and it seems it could hint at new Daima skins. Reliable leaker Spheshal_Nick has added more information, stating that he has also recently heard about this collaboration. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Daima is the latest addition to the popular anime franchise, and players would love to see characters from the series come to Fortnite Island. Daima features some of the most hyped characters of the series, such as Vegeta Super Saiyan 3 and Goku Super Saiyan 4. It also has new fan-favourite characters like Glorio, the Tamagamis, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite has already collaborated with Dragon Ball in the past, with skins for Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Beerus, Goku Black, Piccolo, Cell, Bulma, Trunks, Android 17, Android 18 and Frieza present in the game. These characters also come with their own set of accessories and emotes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the cosmetics, Fortnite also had notable additions to gameplay for the Dragon Ball collaborations, including the Kamehameha and Nimbus Cloud (Kintoun) items in Battle Royale. They had also introduced a Dragon Ball Adventure Island where players could explore iconic locations from the series. It will be interesting to see if Fortnite receives additional themed gameplay for the alleged Daima collab.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nintendo has confirmed its next Nintendo Direct event will take place on Thursday, March 27 at 10am ET/7am PT. The announcement comes just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-direct-expected-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">days after rumors</a> began of an event happening this week.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://x.com/nintendoamerica/status/1904896350853960065?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media post</a> announcing the event, this Nintendo Direct will feature “around 30 minutes of upcoming games for Nintendo Switch”. What it wont include, however, is anything regarding the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>The company is, instead, choosing to keep all of that under wraps until the new console’s Direct on April 2. </p>



<p>As far as what games to expect, there are questions regarding the state of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. According to a new claim, the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-wont-be-at-nintendo-switch-2-direct-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t be present</a> at the Nintendo Switch 2 event. That has lead many to wonder if it will be shown at this current-generation Direct or kept off until a later date.</p>



<p>Recently, Insider Gaming learned of Nintendo’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans for game launches</a> around the Nintendo Switch 2. According to sources, the company is set to release its launch window games in three waves.</p>



<p>Thursday’s Nintendo Direct will air on the company’s YouTube channels and in the video player below.</p>

<p>The First Berserker Khazan follows the typical conventions of many contemporary Soulslikes. It has a plethora of intimidating bosses and looks to jump you at every opportunity. But let’s see if Khazan has one of the most basic controls—a jump button. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is happy for you to die over and over. This is why I would consider the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-the-first-berserker-khazan-have-difficulty-settings-easy-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulty settings</a> if you haven’t already. It’s also happy to thrust you into multi-mob ambushes and test your patience. But it also has elements of traversal and exploration. </p>



<p>You’ll come across various paths and routes in The First Berserker Khazan. So much so it’ll leave you wondering if Khazan has a jump button, and we have the answer.</p>

<figure><figcaption>We tried it, so you don’t have to. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The First Berserker Khazan does not have a dedicated jump button, meaning all combat and platforming is conducted on the ground or through interactive prompts.</strong></p>



<p>If we use FromSoftware as an example, jumping has rarely been a feature of Souls games. The developer built the genre and opted to ignore a jump function for years. It’s only recently, with the likes of Sekiro and Elden Ring, that we’ve seen jumping become prevalent.</p>



<p><a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan</a>‘s first few hours do a great job of setting the scene. They introduce you to basic attacks, then eventually new weapons, and even the Javelin. But along the way, you see various items on ledges, and gaps that look like they are crossable.</p>



<p>You’d think a man of Khazan’s now-powerful and almost demonic stature should be able to perform a simple jump. Alas, the weary warrior cannot. He can bring down giant yeti bosses and wield Greatswords that it would take 3 or 4 men to lift, but he is incapable of leaving the ground.</p>
