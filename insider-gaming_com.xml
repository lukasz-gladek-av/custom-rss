<p>Sony and PlayStation have unveiled a new leasing program for users in Japan and the United Kingdom. The new program, called Flex, allows users to rent a PlayStation 5 or one of several other PlayStation products, for 12, 24, or 36 months at a time.</p>



<h2 id="h-players-can-rent-or-lease-the-ps5-in-japan-or-the-uk">Players Can Rent or Lease the PS5 in Japan or the UK</h2>



<p>In the UK, users can <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/leasing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lease one of several PS5 models</a>, the PlayStation Portal, PS VR2, or even a DualSense Edge Wireless Controller through Raylo, a tech leasing company. As with any other lease, you can lock in a lower monthly rate the longer your lease term is. 36 month leases offer the lowest monthly cost, and there’s a monthly rolling lease that can be canceled at any time that’s much more expensive. For example, the PS5 Pro costs £35.59/month under a rolling monthly lease, but a 36 month lease lets player pay just  £18.95/month. Currently, a PS5 Pro is retailed at £699.99 in the United Kingdom.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is not a rent-to-own plan, but the Flex FAQ section does note that players “may have the option to purchase the device at the end of [a] lease, subject to Raylo’s discretion and pricing at that time.” While the service leases controllers as well, each PS5 comes with at least one controller included, as well a “fair” wear-and-tear policy that covers minor scratches or dents.</p>



<p>In Japan, video game retailer GEO launched its own PS5 rental service at the end of February. Players in Japan have the option of renting a PS5 for an eight-day or 15-day window for just a few dollars. However, according to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japans-new-ps5-rental-is-massively-popular-with-service-fully-booked-across-all-regions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automaton</a>, the service is already completely booked until mid-April.</p>



<p>Would you consider leasing a PS5 instead of buying one? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Ahead of the game’s release on March 20, Ubisoft has released 20 minutes of new Assassin’s Creed Shadows gameplay.</p>



<p>The new gameplay shows both Naoe and Yasuka “infiltrating Nijo Palace, the castle complex (also known as a tenshu) in Kyoto, a major city in the larger region of Yamashiro.”</p>



<p>“Castles in Assassin’s Creed Shadows are strongholds, filled with hostile guards, valuable resources, and one precious loot chest,”  Ubisoft’s Youssef Garcia-Maguid wrote on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/assassins-creed-shadows-20-minutes-of-new-castle-gameplay-launches-march-20/?sf276574441=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog.</a> “Conquering a tenshu means eliminating any Samurai Daisho on the premises, which unlocks the loot chest, giving you powerful gear. You can see the contents of these chests when you hover over the castle icon in the map.”</p>



<h6 id="h-related-exclusive-ubisoft-is-confident-on-releasing-assassin-s-creed-shadows-on-march-20-2025">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXCLUSIVE – Ubisoft is Confident on Releasing Assassin’s Creed Shadows on March 20, 2025</a></h6>



<p>Garcia-Maguid added that Castles are “just one of the many activities” in the game that players can complete in order to increase their Knowledge Rank. Increasing your Knowledge Rank will let players learn higher-level abilities.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ creative producer, Jonathan Dumont, has revealed new details about the Claws of Awaji DLC, stating it will feature a ‘spookier’ and ‘different’ vibe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ahead of the release, Dumont shared information about the game’s post-launch content during an interview with <a href="https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-development-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>. The creative producer stated that Assassin’s Creed Shadows Claws of Awaji DLC will act as a “continuation” of the adventure and story of their two protagonists. The DLC will feature a “different vibe, a bit spookier,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dumont also stated that Assassin’s Creed Shadows features “a definite ending”, and the Claws of Awaji DLC’s events occur after the “core story of the main game”. This means players will have much to explore after completing the base game, as the DLC will introduce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-expansion-claws-of-awaji/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10+ hours of additional gameplay</a>. Check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer</a> for Claws of Awaji here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same interview, Dumont also discussed the bonus pre-order quest for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Thrown to the Dogs. The creative producer described it as “a simple yet heartfelt side quest,” similar to the side content we saw in AC Odyssey. The quest begins with a beaten-up stray dog at a grave, who takes the protagonists to his former house to uncover some “family secrets,” stated Dumont.&nbsp;</p>
