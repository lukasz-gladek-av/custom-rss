<p>Embark Studios has uncovered what’s coming next with Shrouded Sky, the update hitting ARC Raiders next week. Alongside a teaser trailer that revealed the new map condition as ‘Hurricane’, we received a graphic that contained a <strong>stark revelation</strong> that has fans excited.</p>



<p>After months of asking for them, it looks like Embark Studios is finally adding beards to the customization menu in ARC Raiders. The post-apocalyptic Speranza residents who have all gone rather baby-faced up until now might finally be able to wear a little face fur after Shrouded Sky drops.</p>







<h2 id="h-beards-are-coming-to-arc-raiders">Beards Are Coming to ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>If you’ve been holding out hope that Embark Studios would add beards to ARC Raiders, it looks like you’re finally in luck. In the new teaser trailer for Shrouded Sky, we’re treated to a graphic that shows a raider very clearly sporting a relatively large beard.</p>



<p>That’s important for one major reason, and it’s that up until now, every shot of in-game characters has had them wearing clothing sets that can be equipped <strong>in-game</strong>. It also has them exclusively showing off hairstyles, tattoos, and face decorations that you can buy or unlock in ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>This is the first time we’ve seen a raider with a full beard.</p>



<p>Therefore, we’re led to believe, very patently, that beards are coming to ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>It could be in anticipation of the new Shrouded Sky update, which drops on February 24th. It brings <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-hurricane-new-map-condition/">the ‘Hurricane’ map condition</a>, which will batter players with vicious winds, flying debris, and harsh rain. Perhaps wearing a beard is some extra layer of protection against the detritus flying around, slamming you in the face.</p>



<p>That’s probably not the reason.</p>



<p>Beards were always on the cards, in reality. This is a slow-feed, live-service title with plenty of meat, and Embark Studios plans to support it for years to come. We were always going to get beards; it’s just a matter of when.</p>



<p>Now, all that matters is for us to find out how deep the facial hair runs. Will we get moustaches and goatees, too? It’s anyone’s guess.</p>
