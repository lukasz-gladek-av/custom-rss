<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy director has mentioned the possibility of a DLC or another ‘full title’ after part 3.</p>



<p>There’s still some time left before Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s Part 3 is revealed; however, we do know that development has been progressing well, with the game already having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-has-a-lot-of-playable-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘a lot’ of playable content</a>. Interestingly, the developers are already thinking about their plans after the release of part 3, which could entail a new expansion or a fourth game. </p>

<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WccfTech</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi was asked whether they had any DLC plans for Rebirth. Hamaguchi stated that there were ideas at some point, but they “revisited this topic” and realised that their priority should be what fans want the most. The dev figured that “what fans want the most is to bring the third installment as soon as possible.” Which meant that the next game took priority over DLC. </p>



<p>However, Hamaguchi revealed that the story doesn’t end there, as “there is the possibility of having a DLC for that third installment” after its launch. Moreover, with that being the conclusion to Final Fantasy 7 Remake Trilogy, “there’s probably going to be a much wider audience for Final Fantasy as a whole”, says the director. Which is why the developers are “actively considering” whether to introduce “another DLC or a full title”. </p>

<p>Electronic Arts has announced that The Sims Mobile will be shut down after more than seven years of operations and updates. The all-mobile product will be closed down from Janaury 20, 2026, and as it’s an online title, it’ll no longer be accessible to any users.</p>



<p>The team revealed a stack of limited-time events coming in the next few weeks to usher in the closure of the game, but today, October 21, The Sims Mobile will be delisted from app stores.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-sims-mobile-is-the-latest-ea-game-to-go">The Sims Mobile is the Latest EA Game to Go</h2>



<p>Electronic Arts has busied itself closing down servers and shutting down games across a range of genres in the last couple of years. The Sims Mobile is the latest title to be hit by that action.</p>



<p>In March 2018, The Sims Mobile was released by Electronic Arts, and by September, it had pulled in almost 50 million users and racked up more than $20 million in revenue.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent blog post</a>, the team at Electronic Arts confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>(On October 20) the final update for The Sims Mobile will be available to download from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. From this date forward, players will no longer be able to purchase packs or spend real money within TSM. Any existing SimCash, Simoleons, or Tickets can still be used until January 20, 2026.</p>



<p>In the final update, releasing on October 20th, 2025, everyone will receive unlimited energy to help them make the most of this time. This should make it easier to complete projects and enjoy the last few months of play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s now a list of special events that will unravel leading up to when the game is taken offline:</p>
