<p>In a recent interview, Dan Houser, one of the founders of Rockstar Games, revealed why the United States has always been the setting for Grand Theft Auto, save for a brief outing to London in 1999. It’s a similar reason why Fallout, a famed post-apocalyptic franchise, won’t ever leave the United States.</p>



<p>In Houser’s words, there’s too much ‘Americana’ in the DNA of Grand Theft Auto for it to work in any other country. The stint in London in 1999 with a top-down classic on the PS1 was an experiment more than anything, and Houser dubbed it ‘cute and fun’.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-and-fallout-forever-in-america">GTA and Fallout, Forever in America</h2>



<p>During the Summer Game Fest showcase, we sat down with Bethesda Game Studios to learn about a recent update and the future of the franchise. One of the questions we had was regarding the ongoing setting of the United States being the base formula for the post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<p>I was told that Fallout ‘probably won’t’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/never-say-never-bethesda-fallout-leave-united-states/">ever leave the United States</a>, and that’s because it <strong>needs </strong>everything that happened in the USA in the franchise’s universe to succeed. It’s deeply rooted in Americana and the post-war, atom-mad landscape that kind of existed in real life.</p>



<p>Similarly, Dan Houser recently explained on the Lex Fridman podcast that <strong>Grand Theft Auto </strong>can’t leave the United States:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We made a little thing in London 26 years ago, GTA London, for the top-down one for the PS1. That was pretty cute and fun.</p>



<p>There was so much Americana inherent in the IP, it would be really hard to make it work in London or anywhere else. You needed guns, you needed these larger-than-life characters.</p>



<p>The game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider’s perspective. That was so much about what the series was that it wouldn’t really have worked in the same way elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/dan-houser-says-rockstar-games-only-attempted-gta-london-once-in-26-years-because-the-series-is-so-much-about-america-that-it-wouldnt-really-have-worked-in-the-same-way-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> for the quote)</em></p>



<p>Historically, Grand Theft Auto has taken players from fictional renditions of Miami to Los Angeles, and from New York to a minuscule foray into North Dakota. There are few places outside of the United States that could serve as a strong enough canvas for the art that Rockstar Games needs to create what it does best.</p>



<p>That’s the same with Fallout, of course. In 2024, Todd Howard backed up the sentiment that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-leave-united-states/">Fallout can’t exist outside the United States</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My view is, part of the Fallout schtick is on the American naivete and part of that. And so, for us right now, it’s okay to acknowledge some of those other areas, but our plans are to predominately keep it in the US. It’s okay to leave mystery or questions, ‘What’s happening in Europe, what’s happening here’. The worst thing you can do to mysterious lands is to remove the mystery.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders is proving to be such a success that it’s becoming a victim of its own victory. Hours ago, the all-new extraction shooter from Embark Studios suffered from network stability and server issues under the weight of an immense number of players, with a new all-time high player count being secured.</p>



<p>In one moment, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">354,836 concurrent players</a> <strong>on Steam alone </strong>were enjoying the new extraction adventure from Embark, the creators of The Finals. This puts the game’s success (on Steam at least) on par with the likes of GTA 5, Starfield, Monster Hunter: World, and Borderlands 4.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-is-taking-the-world-by-storm">ARC Raiders is Taking the World by Storm</h2>



<p>As ARC Raiders hit new lofty heights on Sunday evening, the game started showing cracks that impacted users worldwide. Embark was forced to arrange a server queue system and seemed to switch off crossplay while recovery actions took place.</p>



<p>For a while, players were forced to contend with those queues, party issues, network instability in-game, and even some crashes.</p>



<p>It wasn’t a long-lived issue, but it was indicative of the sheer success and scope of ARC Raiders, widely considered one of the best extraction shooters around and an immense contender to the monopoly held by the likes of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders recently received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-2025-roadmap/">a sizeable roadmap</a>, detailing the next few months of content for the sensational game. That’s in addition to Embark Studios’ promise to support ARC Raiders <strong>for the next decade</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s proving to be a hit with players, of course. On Steam, ARC Raiders has managed to secure more than 37,000 reviews, 90% of which are purely positive. It’s a transformational extraction shooter that’s seriously disrupting the genre right now.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/to-the-moon-expo-recover-uk-games-expo/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/to-the-moon-expo-promises-to-recover-failing-uk-games-expo-scene.1341868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When you open up the website for the upcoming To The Moon expo, you’re greeted with a message that reads, ‘a gaming expo with more games than merch stalls.’ If you’ve read our recent report on the state of EGX and the wider expo scene in the United Kingdom, you’ll appreciate why that’s a hugely exciting prospect.</p>



<p>To The Moon is a brand-new gaming and tech expo coming to the UK with its inaugural event <strong>next week</strong>, and it’s trying to pick up and reposition the pieces of an ecosystem that’s falling apart as we speak.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-to-the-moon-expo">What is To The Moon Expo?</h2>



<p>To The Moon is ‘a gaming expo for gamers, by gamers’, and everyone is heading to the event hoping that the company behind the expo can deliver on that promise. Here’s the blurb from the site for the expo:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This isn’t just another gaming expo: This is a call to players, creators, and fans who know the industry can be more. We are here to craft an experience for YOU! From high-energy esports tournaments and meeting your favourite voice actors, to discovering new games and learning how you can break into the gaming industry – we have something here for every kind of gamer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Held at the NEC in Birmingham, To The Moon walks in the footsteps of the Insomnia Gaming Festival, once the shining gem of the UK’s gaming expo scene and now a shrivelling shadow of its former self. The team behind To The Moon has promised a visitor capacity of 15,000 gamers and more than 150 exhibitors, alongside a ‘full-blown esports arena’.</p>



<p>It’s a much smaller affair than Insomnia Gaming Festival was, up until going bust a couple of years ago (and weirdly resurfacing in recent months), but everybody has to start somewhere.</p>



<p>To The Moon will feature an indie zone packed with playable games, a creator zone, an industry hub for networking, guest appearances, and several talks and workshops.</p>



<p>On the list for guests, speakers, and meet and greets are some pretty prestigious folks. From Glen Schofield, founder of Sledgehammer Games and Striking Distance Studios, to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/">Tom McKay</a> and Luke Dale of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II fame, there are plenty of opportunities to rub shoulders.</p>



<p>VOID Interactive is bringing an immersive Ready or Not SWAT experience to the venue, and a VR arena will be set up for fans to participate in competitions.</p>



<p>There’s a retro gaming arcade, board games, (some) merch stalls, and even an invitational League of Legends tournament, all being held under the roof of one of the most popular event venues in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>To The Moon could be one of the best up-and-coming gaming events in the business, and the gamers in the United Kingdom desperately need something like this to succeed, given the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/egx-death-uk-gaming-expo/">recent collapse of EGX</a>, Insomnia, <strong>and </strong>WASD.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.tothemoonexpo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tickets for To The Moon</a> can be bought online now for the showcase that’s set to run from November 12 – 13.</p>



<p>Do you think To The Moon sounds like your kind of event? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-3-876/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-876-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-monday-november-3.1341862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a whole new week, and a fresh start to the penultimate month of the year, but do you know what the most important thing is for you to do today? That’s right, it’s <strong>solve another NYT Connections puzzle</strong>. Fortunately, I’m here to help you get off to an easy start, providing the best NYT Connections hints and solutions to get you there quickly.</p>



<p>Read on to get today’s NYT Connections hints without any delay.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-3">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 3)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #876:</p>



<ul>
<li>SEA MONKEY</li>



<li>JIGSAW PUZZLE</li>



<li>BALLOON ANIMAL</li>



<li>CLOWN NOSE</li>



<li>WHOOPEE CUSHION</li>



<li>MARASCHINO CHERRY</li>



<li>FUNKY CHICKEN</li>



<li>LEGO SET</li>



<li>FIRE ENGINE</li>



<li>JUMBO SHRIMP</li>



<li>PICK-UP STICKS</li>



<li>BOUNCY CASTLE</li>



<li>WATER WINGS</li>



<li>LITE-BRITE</li>



<li>STOP SIGN</li>



<li>DARK HORSE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of objects that scream “stop,” “sweet,” or “silly” — all dressed in crimson.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These puffed-up pals are party staples, poolside protectors, and prankster favorites.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>If you’ve ever stepped on one barefoot or spent hours assembling, you know the pain and joy.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These quirky phrases pair unexpected adjectives with creatures — some real, some imaginary.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 3.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-3-876">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 3 (#876)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CLOWN NOSE, FIRE ENGINE, MARASCHINO CHERRY, STOP SIGN</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BALLOON ANIMAL, BOUNCY CASTLE, WATER WINGS, WHOOPEE CUSHION</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – JIGSAW PUZZLE, LEGO SET, LITE-BRITE, PICK-UP STICKS</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – DARK HORSE, FUNKY CHICKEN, JUMBO SHRIMP, SEA MONKEY</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Contraband Screenshots Emerge After Game’s Cancelation]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-screenshots-canceled-xbox-avalanche/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/contraband-screenshots-emerge-after-game%E2%80%99s-cancelation.1341799/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Screenshots of the canceled Xbox exclusive Contraband have surfaced online. With the new look, we see what the multiplayer game could’ve looked like had it come out. </p>



<p>The game, created by Just Cause’s Avalanche Studios, was revealed in 2021 with a neat trailer. We never saw gameplay, as it was just a teaser, but it seems the game was doing fine <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/job-listing-shows-contraband-is-still-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">behind the scenes</a>. However, infrequent updates and notable absences from presentations hinted that development may not have been going well. In August, it was confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-development-stopped-at-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">active development had stopped</a> to evaluate the game’s future. Furthermore, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avalanche-studios-closes-office-lays-off-staff-after-contraband-cancelation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many were laid off</a> due to the move, seemingly ending the game for good. Now, we have a clue as to what it would’ve looked like.</p>



<h2 id="h-contraband-would-ve-had-four-player-multiplayer-and-stylized-graphics-screenshots-reveal">Contraband Would’ve Had Four-Player Multiplayer and Stylized Graphics, Screenshots Reveal</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Contraband - Official Reveal Trailer 4K | E3 2021" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5qlGpqHggw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>A portfolio of one of Contraband’s UI artists was found online. In it, new screenshots of the canceled game’s UI and design are shown. Furthermore, we see the vision that Avalanche was going for with the design. <br></p>



<p>The pictures, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/pqZvhpr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available here</a>, show off a retro-like art style for the character models and typeface, reminiscent of the late 1900s. We also see how the game would’ve been done, with players joining sessions and teaming up in groups of four to tackle maps. One of the maps, Downtown, is seen in one of the photos and may show what it would’ve looked like in-game.<a href="https://imgur.com/a/pqZvhpr"></a></p>



<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/pqZvhpr"></a>It’s important to note that, even if true, take it with a grain of salt.&nbsp;As mentioned before, no gameplay has been released, so this may be the best we’ll have for a while. Still, it’s cool to see what could’ve been for the multiplayer game. It hasn’t been outright canceled, though it likely has given the lack of updates, so perhaps things could work out. If so, we could have one of Xbox’s most unique titles in a while.</p>

<p>The creator of Cyberpunk wants Keanu Reeves back for Cyberpunk 2077’s upcoming sequel, despite how the story goes. Furthermore, he said he ‘has ways of bringing him back’.</p>



<p>Released in 1998, the Cyberpunk tabletop game, created by Mike Pondsmith, has been a staple of TTRPG fans for decades. In 2020, CD Projekt Red, known for The Witcher series, brought the edgy techno-dystopian world to gaming. While mixed at launch, subsequent updates, and a brilliant anime adaptation (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-confirmed-for-another-new-netflix-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a>) made the game a must-play. If you were around during the late 2010s, you know how huge the hype was, especially when Hollywood icon Keanu Reeves was announced as Johnny Silverhand. His portrayal of the rebel rockstar was a highlight for many, given how much time the player spends with him. Unfortunately, the endings don’t leave much room for the rocker to continue. However, it seems the creator may have a way to bring him back.</p>

<p>In a livestream from CD Projekt Red, Mike Pondsmith, the TTRPG creator, joined the crew to discuss Cyberpunk 2077. When talking about Keanu Reeves’ portrayal as Johnny Silverhand (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc?si=07ai4guwLhOQuEPL&amp;t=3619">at around the hour mark</a>), he said,</p>



<p>“<strong>Not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again</strong>,” Pondsmith states. “<strong>I have ways to do that, Keanu, contact me.</strong>“</p>



<p>Given the DLC was able to get Idris Elba and it’s worldwide success, it’s not suprising that the John Wick star would want to return. If Mike Pondsmith wants him back and can make it happen, then we may have it happen. All we know about Cyberpunk 2077’s sequel is that it’s in development, but no set release window. CD Projekt Red is currently working on The Witcher 4, but, for Cyberpunk fans, Cyberpunk Edgerunners 2 is in production, so it won’t be long before we return to Night City.</p>



<p>Do you want Johnny Silverhand to return for Cyberpunk 2077’s sequel? How do you think he’ll come back? Did you enjoy Cyberpunk 2077? Phantom Liberty?

<p>Use these Brainrot Tsunami monthly redeem codes for October 2025 to get free rewards in the game, including in-game currencies as well as potions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brainrot Tsunami is often described as a weird <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-raise-animals-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> simulator game where players must navigate tsunami waves and run through the map. Starting with a low speed, players are tasked with training to improve their pace, thereby making the process of dodging the tsunami waves that much easier. Another key mechanic in the game requires players to train with Brainrots. The game also allows players to spawn special tsunami waves, which can be used to troll the competition. As simple as the gameplay sounds, there is a decent amount of strategy involved, and with that in mind, any way to get ahead of the other players must be considered. That’s exactly where these codes will come into the picture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brainrot Tsunami recently had an update, but unfortunately for players, they didn’t release any new codes. However, fans of the game mustn’t lose hope, as the developers are still working on the game, which means that new codes are likely on the horizon. New codes are often released through the game’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ycveZcDGFV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a> or through the Roblox game page. However, to make staying up to date with the codes easier, we recommend that you keep this page bookmarked. We update this article as soon as any new codes drop, so check in every once in a while to maximise the number of rewards you can get.</p>
