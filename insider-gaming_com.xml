<p>Battlefield 6’s destruction technology has received praise from all players, and it seems that dropping previous-gen consoles, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, was key in reaching that standard. </p>



<p>The developers of Battlefield 6 have elaborated on the destruction tech used in the game several times ahead of release. The title utilizes tactical destruction, which brings “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-devs-elaborate-on-tactical-destruction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unparalleled levels of freedom</a>” to the game, and was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-took-huge-inspiration-from-bad-company-2s-destruction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inspired</a> by <span>the&nbsp;intimate destruction</span> experience in Bad Company 2. Now, the developers have explained what it takes to achieve this level of destruction in BF6. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-magic-trick-behind-battlefield-6-s-destruction-is-dropping-previous-gen-consoles">The ‘Magic Trick’ Behind Battlefield 6’s Destruction is Dropping Previous-Gen Consoles</h2>



<p><span>During a new interview with Battlefield 6’s technical director, Christian Buhl,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-dev-says-its-destruction-tech-is-so-delicious-for-one-simple-reason-the-only-magic-trick-is-that-were-not-on-the-ps4-or-xbox-one-any-more/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a>&nbsp;asked what the secret sauce was behind the game’s destruction system.</span> Buhl revealed that “Maybe the only magic trick is that we’re not on the PS4 or Xbox One anymore.” This enabled developers to work with increased memory and CPU speed, which in turn improved overall performance. As the developers weren’t trying to optimize the “game to run on a PS4, for example.”</p>



<p>However, there was still a lot of work done towards Battlefield 6’s destruction after dropping previous-gen consoles. Buhl spoke about “testing destruction” and the different areas that need to be optimised. The technical director also talked about the Frostbite engine, which was built for Battlefield, and destruction, and “those pieces are core parts of the engine.” The developer concluded, stating,”&nbsp;I don’t think there was any magic bullet. It was just a lot of testing, a lot of iteration, a lot of work.”</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-and-multiplayer-has-the-same-destruction-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale and multiplayer</a> have the same destruction system. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-players-dont-give-a-damn-about-new-portal-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only 12% of BF6 players</a> give a damn about the new Portal mode.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-preload-guide-file-size-revealed/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The file sizes for Pokémon Legends: Z-A have dropped ahead of next week’s release, and, as is customary with titles on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles, you won’t have to clear out too much space.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the first Pokémon title to launch on Switch 2, though it’s also available on the original Switch console and launches on both platforms on October 16.</p>



<p>While Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-1-vs-switch-2-performance-which-version-should-you-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn’t include any additional features or content</a> that have been advertised ahead of launch, the file size is almost double on the newer console.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Small sizes. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Preloads for Pokémon Legends: Z-A are now available on both platforms, as of October 8, which confirms the file size on both generations of Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>On the original console, you’ll need 4.0 GB of space for the game, while those on Switch 2 require 7.7 GB of space, which even those of us who struggle with maths can spot is almost double the size.</p>



<p>The small size of the game on the original Switch may raise eyebrows when compared to previous titles, with Scarlet &amp; Violet clocking in at around 6.8 GB, Legends: Arceus being 6.1 GB, while Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl were 6.9 GB. Those pale in comparison to Sword and Shield, though, which was 12.4 GB.</p>



<p>Legends: Z-A on the original Switch is, therefore, the smallest file size of a mainline Pokémon game since Sun &amp; Moon on the Nintendo 3DS.</p>



<p>The smaller size can be explained by the setting of Legends: Z-A taking place solely in Lumiose City, rather than an entire region, but the new battle mechanics could have pushed the file size up in comparison.</p>



<p>Either way, it’s good news on both platforms for any player who doesn’t want to uninstall other games to make room for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, as you should have more than enough space.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is PowerWash Simulator 2 Splitscreen? Local Multiplayer Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-powerwash-simulator-2-splitscreen-local-multiplayer-explained/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-powerwash-simulator-2-splitscreen-local-multiplayer-explained.1320430/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The original PowerWash Simulator game was highly enjoyed by many, but will PowerWash Simulator 2 add splitscreen functionality?</p>



<p>There are many reasons to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-explained-exact-start-times-and-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look forward to the sequel</a> if you loved the first game, but it’s always nice to see how games like this improve over what came before.</p>



<p>Here is your answer to whether PowerWash Simulator 2 has splitscreen or not, and a general look at how multiplayer works.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-powerwash-simulator-2-have-splitscreen">Does PowerWash Simulator 2 Have Splitscreen?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A friend could help you get this clean faster. Image by Futurlab</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, PowerWash Simulator 2 has splitscreen functionality. You and one other person can play the game from the same screen as you work together to clean up various levels.</strong></p>



<p>This is actually a pretty big development, considering that the original <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/games/powerwash-simulator-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerWash Simulator game</a> did not have any local multiplayer, only online.</p>



<p>Often these days, video games are going out of their way to remove local multiplayer opportunities. In some cases, this comes down to the performance taking a noticeable dip when the game tries to run two instances at the same time. Hopefully, the splitscreen in PowerWash Simulator 2 isn’t anything that will cause massive frame drops or other issues.</p>



<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 adding dedicated local multiplayer support may actually be one of the reasons that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game isn’t on older hardware</a>. There’s a possibility that the development team was so focused on making sure the splitscreen experience was as smooth as possible that they wanted to make sure only the current generation consoles could run it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-people-can-play-powerwash-simulator-2">How Many People Can Play PowerWash Simulator 2?</h2>



<p><strong>While two people can play PowerWash Simulator 2 in splitscreen, the career mode has been expanded to four players at a time, with free play holding up to six players at once.</strong></p>



<p>These are some pretty notable increases over the original game. The first game only allowed two people to play the career mode together, and in that, only the host was able to save their progress and got a much better reward payout than the joined friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, this time around, all players who join career mode will share all of the progress updates as the host, which allows them to bring their upgrades and unlocked levels into their own save.</p>



<p>Futurlab has definitely taken a big interest in making sure that multiplayer in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-revealed-with-new-announcement-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerWash Simulator 2</a> has been improved over the original game. Changes like these are much more friendly to players who want to enjoy the game with others and make it so no one is being left behind just for the “crime” of helping their friend.</p>



<hr>



<p>How many people are you going to play PowerWash Simulator 2 with? Do you plan on doing the career mode with a dedicated splitscreen partner? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
