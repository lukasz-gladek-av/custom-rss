<p>A new leak on social media for Fortnite hints at a huge collaboration with South Park. The event, if true, would have several big elements like a Rift Anomaly and multiple mech skins.</p>



<p>Chapter 7 of Fortnite has been off to a great start for fans. Not only did players get&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Kill Bill collaboration</a>, but skins for Back to the Future and a new map. With the live-service title collabing with basically every IP out there, there’s one vulgar one that would feel right at home: South Park. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-collab-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rumors of a collab</a> have been here and there, but one reliable Twitter user dropped a huge leak as to what South Park will be like in Fortnite.</p>











<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>SOUTH PARK x FORTNITE IS A BIG COLLAB</p><p>• MULTIPLE SKINS AS MECHS<br>• Rift Anomaly: "Everyone Kills Kenny"  <br>• At least 1 Boss on the map<br>• Stick of Truth Mythic<br>• Respawn Token/Medallion<br>• Unknown Consumable<br>&amp; more.. <a href="https://t.co/veNGth1U9k">pic.twitter.com/veNGth1U9k</a></p></div>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1995938479830929447?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The leak in question comes from <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1995938479830929447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>, a well-known leaker in the Fortnite community. They’ve gotten many details from past seasons correct and are generally accurate. This time, the leak pertains to South Park, as it is seemingly making its way into Fortnite. While no date was given as to when, information regarding the collab has dropped.</p>



<p>As it seems, the Fortnite x South Park collab will feature skins for the mechs and a few collectibles. However, the biggest ones are that a Boss will spawn on the map relating to the adult-animated series. Furthermore, a Rift Anomaly, aptly titled “Everyone Kills Kenny,” will be part of it, though no details on how it will play out were stated.</p>



<p>Given the recent popularity of South Park, it’s no surprise to see it collaborate with Fortnite. It wouldn’t be South Park’s first foray into gaming, as the show has garnered two RPGs and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/south-park-snow-day-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other tie-in games</a>. In fact, South Park: The Stick of Truth was a hit with critics and fans, being a near-ideal translation from its TV counterpart. While Fortnite’s version may be toned down for the player base, it’s sure to hit the same marks it did in 1997.</p>







<p>What do you think of the South Park x Fortnite leak? Excited to see more? Which characters do you want to see in the game? Want South Park to get The Simpsons treatment in Chapter 6?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tencent and Sony have agreed to a later hearing date for the Horizon clone lawsuit if Light of Motiram pauses its promotion and public testing. </p>



<p>Sony has been fighting Tencent in court for allegedly ripping off elements from PlayStation’s Horizon series for their upcoming title, Light of Motiram. Tencent has filed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-claps-back-at-sony-playstations-horizon-clone-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion to dismiss</a> this case, whereas Sony has filed for an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-injunction-to-bar-tencent-from-using-any-resemblance-to-horizons-aloy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">injunction</a>. Both entities have now agreed on delaying these hearings, however, with some conditions. </p>











<p>According to a new order filed yesterday by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, there are some new developments in Sony and Tencent’s Horizon clone lawsuit. It seems that both entities have &nbsp;“engaged in discussions in order to resolve the current dispute.” These discussions have led to Sony Interactive Entertainment and Tencent Entities agreeing to extend the briefing schedule and to a later requested hearing date; however, these come with some conditions. </p>



<p>Sony and Tencent have agreed on four conditions to extend the hearing: </p>



<ul>
<li>Firstly, the extension “will not be used to argue that SIE delayed in seeking a preliminary injunction.” </li>



<li>Secondly, there can be “no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram during the pendency of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction.” </li>



<li>Thirdly, the release date of Light of Motiram cannot be “moved up to before Q4 2027.”</li>



<li>Lastly, Tencent Entities “will not seek expedited discovery in connection with the Motion for Preliminary Injunction.”</li>
</ul>







<p>Due to the new extension, Tencent’s deadline to file its response to Sony’s preliminary injunction is now December 17, 2025, instead of December 3. Sony must file its Reply in Support by January 2, 2026. Both entities will also request that Judge Jacqueline Corley hear the injunction and the motion to dismiss simultaneously on January 29, 2026, rather than on January 15. </p>



<p>In other news, Tencent’s last response to the lawsuit was “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-responds-to-sony-horizon-clone-lawsuit-fame-does-not-create-a-trademark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fame does not create a trademark</a>.” What are your thoughts on Tencent pausing Light of Motiram’s promotion?
