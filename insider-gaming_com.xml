<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 20, 2026, Quordle is the #1488 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-quordle-daily-game">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 20.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>

<li>Place</li>



<li>Animal</li>



<li>Work</li>



<li>Nature</li>



<li>Game</li>



<li>Concept</li>



<li>Idea</li>



<li>Food</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-contexto-hints-for-today-february-20-2026">Contexto Hints For Today, February 20, 2026</h2>

<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-pokemon-presents-2026">What to Expect from Pokémon Presents 2026</h2>



<p>No official details about what Pokémon Presents 2026 will include have been revealed, so this is just speculation and based on previous rumours.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/incursion-red-river-update-story-arc/</link>
            <guid>1441387</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Incursion Red River is fast becoming a must-have extraction shooter. We’ve been talking about Incursion since it shone at Steam Next Fest in February 2024, and later that year, a massive update hit the game in development, blowing it wide open.</p>



<p>Now, the team at Games of Tomorrow has unveiled the incoming 1.3 update, which features a massive story segment bolstered by voice acting provided by none other than the BAFTA-award-winning Jane Perry. It’s coming globally on February 25th, and if you’re at all interested in this game, you’ll want to see what it includes.</p>







<h2 id="h-incursion-red-river-continues-to-grow">Incursion Red River Continues to Grow</h2>



<p>In 2023, Incursion Red River was known as PROJECT QUARANTINE, but a major rebrand overhauled the game’s identity and pushed it into the realms that we know now. In April 2024, the game launched in early access, and it has been under ongoing development ever since.</p>



<p>This new update, 1.3, is perhaps the most ambitious the team at Games of Tomorrow has produced thus far.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Games of Tomorrow revealed the 1.3 update has pushed them ‘to the absolute limit’, allowing them to ‘go beyond the boundaries originally set for the project.’</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’ve pushed ourselves to the absolute limit with this one…</p><p>With Update 1.3, we tried to go beyond the boundaries we originally set for the project and deliver something truly substantial.</p><p>With a full story chapter featuring 23 missions, voice by <a href="https://twitter.com/TheJanePerry?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TheJanePerry</a>, and… <a href="https://t.co/36tLqEJMfY">pic.twitter.com/36tLqEJMfY</a></p></div>— Incursion Red River (@IncursionRR) <a href="https://twitter.com/IncursionRR/status/2024140999560147145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The 1.3 update includes a full story segment comprised of 23 missions, with voice work from Jane Perry, a legendary actor. It also introduces Solarint to the universe, hired as an AI programmer after his success on SP-Tarkov’s SAIN AI mod. The team wrote in a recent blog post:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>AI behavior has been completely rebuilt. It will feel fundamentally different to the enemies you will encounter in 1.2.</p>



<p>We are aiming for grounded and realistic behavior. Bots won’t be doing jumpshots or anything that a person in their situation wouldn’t plausibly do.</p>



<p>This first version is designed to be a solid framework to build off in future updates. That means it is not feature complete and some behavior is placeholder until the systems can be made to support it as intended. Even so, we think it will be a very compelling upgrade compared to 1.2.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This means that AI enemies have had their pathing, movement, tactical positioning, difficulty, and focus upgraded.</p>



<p>Incursion Red River is one of those extraction shooters that deserves way more attention than it gets. All-time, it peaked at 2,478 concurrent users on Steam, which isn’t at all indicative of the game’s quality. When we played the game during pre-release in 2024, we were pleasantly surprised at how well it handled.</p>



<p>It’s worthstressing that it’s a PvE shooter with cooperative elements, which isn’t typical for the extraction genre, and that’s perhaps why it hasn’t hit lofty heights <strong>yet</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[FURIA Has Stripped Entire Rainbow Six Siege Roster (Except for HerdsZ)]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/furia-rainbow-six-roster-dropped/</link>
            <guid>1441384</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FURIA has unveiled a major restructuring effort that has resulted in the removal of <strong>almost </strong>the entire Rainbow Six Siege roster. The only player to survive the culling is Gustavo ‘Herdz’ Herdina, the sole member to retain his spot with the organization.</p>



<p>The roster that was just dismissed was the former w7m team that claimed the top spot at the Six Invitational 2024, securing a $1 million prize after having dominated at the BLAST Atlanta Major and BLAST Copenhagen Major the year before.</p>







<h2 id="h-furia-s-rainbow-six-presence-drops">FURIA’s Rainbow Six Presence Drops</h2>



<p>FURIA is now sitting without a roster after falling out of this year’s Six Invitational in sixth place. The organization made it into the playoffs in Paris, but back-to-back losses against Team Falcons and Fluxo W7M were enough to eliminate the Brazilian roster from the running.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it was FaZe Clan, a <strong>different </strong>Brazilian unit, that went on to win the Six Invitational. It was a historic victory, as it cemented FaZe Clan as the first back-to-back Six Invitational winner <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>All eyes are now on the team that will be built around HerdsZ, the last player left on FURIA after the cleanout. That’s not all, though, as fans of Rainbow Six esports will be eager to see if the dismissed roster remains a squad and moves on to a new home together, just as they did from w7m into FURIA.</p>



<p>There’s now something of an off-season before the big events start popping up again. Our next BLAST R6 Major will land in May in Salt Lake City, which gives teams plenty of time to get their ducks in a row.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ve got any idea what will happen next with FURIA.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you’ve made it to the end of another tough week. Your reward for making it this far is another string of NYT Connections hints and answers. It’s not much, but it’s all I have! If you scroll down, you’ll get the NYT Connections solutions you need to solve today’s puzzle as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Enjoy your weekend! But don’t forget to stop back tomorrow for another guide!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-20">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 20)</h2>
