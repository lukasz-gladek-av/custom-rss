            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Employees at Electronic Arts (EA) and members of the Communication Workers of America (CWA) have released a statement regarding the pending acquisition and privatization of the company. In the joint statement, union members working at EA state that they weren’t properly represented during sale negotiations and that there is a worry of company layoffs when it happens. </p>



<p>The group says this $55 billion deal will <strong>“further concentrate power and wealth into the hands of a few gatekeepers while doing nothing to address the concerns of players and workers.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“EA is not a struggling company,”</strong> the statement says. <strong>“With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest video game developers and publishers in the world. EA’s success has been entirely driven by tens of thousands of EA workers whose creativity, skill, and innovation made EA worth buying in the first place.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardized as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The group says that if any layoffs take place or if studios close, it’s because of a choice to do so and not something done out of necessity. They say that it would be a move done solely to <strong>“pad investors’ pockets—not to strengthen the company.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the statement, the <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">union has launched a petition</a> for the United States Federal Trade Commission to look more into this deal. They are “calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, and preserves creative freedom.”</p>



<p>The announcement of a deal to sell EA to a group that includes the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came in late September</a>. To fund the sale, EA will be taking on $20 billion in debt, which many worry will lead to the aforementioned layoffs.</p>



<p><strong>“Every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency, and power,”</strong> they say. <strong>“Decisions that shape our jobs, our art, and our futures are made behind closed doors by executives who have never written a line of code, built worlds, or supported live services.”</strong></p>



<p>The statement closes by saying that the <strong>“value of video games is in their workers” </strong>and that they are <strong>“standing together and refusing to let corporate greed decide the future of our industry.”</strong></p>



<p>How do you think the pending sale of EA plays out? Leave your thoughts down in the comments below, and&nbsp;join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>Team Ninja has just announced that their first leader, Tomonobu Itagaki, has unfortunately passed away. </p>



<p>All eyes are on Team Ninja right now, as their highly anticipated installment to the Ninja Gaiden franchise arrives on October 21, 2025. We have already seen a lot of the game through several trailers and teasers, and it seems that it’s going to be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-trailer-shows-off-disgusting-levels-of-difficulty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficult one</a>. However, less than a week before release, one of the most integral people behind the franchise’s revival has passed away. </p>



<h2 id="h-team-ninja-s-first-leader-passed-away-a-few-days-before-ninja-gaiden-4-s-release">Team Ninja’s First Leader Passed Away a Few Days Before Ninja Gaiden 4’s Release</h2>



<p>Tomonobu Itagaki’s passing was announced through Team Ninja’s <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1978756897231798606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The post stated: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are deeply saddened by the passing of Team NINJA’s first leader, Tomonobu Itagaki. </p>



<p>We will carry on the philosophy and creativity that Itagaki-san began and continue to create games that many gamers will enjoy. </p>



<p>Our deepest condolences for his loss. </p>



<p>From everyone at Team NINJA</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For those unaware, Tomonobu Itagaki is a renowned Japanese video game designer who started his journey at Tecmo in 1992. Itagaki’s claim to success came with 1996’s Dead or Alive. In 2001, Itagaki was named Team Ninja’s first leader, where he revived the 1988 arcade franchise Ninja Gaiden and released it for Xbox in 2004. The title received widespread critical acclaim and an international online tournament. </p>



<p>Following that, the Team Ninja leader helped release Ninja Gaiden Black, Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword, and Ninja Gaiden II. He then left Tecmo in 2008 due to a fallout and founded Vallhalla Game Studios, where he helped develop Devil’s Third with some former Team Ninja members. Then, in 2021, Itagaki created another studio, called Itagaki Games. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-battlefield-6-assault-rifle-loadout/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-meta-battlefield-6-assault-rifle-loadout%E2%80%94all-attachments-how-to-unlock-equipment.1326430/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>While Battlefield 6 has a fun and varied arsenal, nothing beats the best assault rifle, and our top meta loadout ensures the weapon has you locked in and will get you more kills than if you used any other AR.</p>



<p>An assault rifle is a staple of online FPS shooters. Sniper Rifles aren’t always applicable, Shotguns also depend on the size of the map, LMGs are powerful but as mobile as a tank, and SMGs also fall into that ‘circumstantial’ territory. An assault rifle is an all-around beast, and even the bad ones are good.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has a reliable foundation of assault rifles to kickstart the game, so let’s see which AR is considered to be the meta selection, and we’ll take a deep dive into its best loadout and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-best-assault-rifle-in-battlefield-6">What Is The Best Assault Rifle In Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Test it out if you’re unsure. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The consensus is that the M433 is the best meta assault rifle in Battlefield 6, which is no surprise as it’s an extremely effective weapon at most ranges.</strong></p>



<p>Whether you used it in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>‘s campaign or online, the M433 is a monstrous weapon. Everything about it works: Firepower, fire rate, recoil control, its default ammo clip size, mobility, and handling. It’s literally the perfect assault rifle, and it only gets better once you start applying the best attachments to it.</p>







<p>Our best M433 assault rifle class focuses on reducing recoil and making it more efficient and effective during combat. It’s not the most attachments you can have for the gun—so feel free to tinker and add more—but this is a simple and relatively easy to put together loadout.</p>



<p>Here’s our best M433 assault rifle meta loadout.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-m433-assault-rifle-in-battlefield-6">How To Unlock M433 Assault Rifle In Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>From the get-go. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You’ll be pleased to know that the M433 assault rifle is unlocked by default at the beginning of your Battlefield 6 online multiplayer journey!</strong></p>



<p>It wouldn’t be convenient if all weapons were locked when you start playing Battlefield 6 online, would it? Some guns need to be available, and the M433 is one of them. This means you can equip it right away and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-farm-xp-level-up-fast-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start leveling it up fast and earning XP</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-assault-rifle-class-setup-in-battlefield-6">Best Assault Rifle Class Setup In Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>Alongside your M433 assault rifle, you also need the right equipment and abilities. From Frontliner to the M87A1 Shotgun, we’ve picked out the gear you need to complement the M433 perfectly.</p>



<p>Check out each slot and what to put in it:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Field Specs:</strong> Frontliner</li>



<li><strong>Sidearm:</strong> P18 (Pistol)</li>



<li><strong>Gadget 1:</strong> M87A1 (Shotgun)</li>



<li><strong>Gadget 2:</strong> Deploy Beacon</li>



<li><strong>Throwable:</strong> Fragmentation Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Melee:</strong> Sledgehammer</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Frontliner </strong>is preferable from Field Specs (once you unlock it) as it speeds up health recovery, reduces fall damage, and gives a brief buff to spawning teammates. It’s just a generally great set of abilities that aim to keep you alive for longer and make you stronger.</p>



<p>The <strong>P18 </strong>is the best and most consistent Pistol in Battlefield 6, so that’s an easy one. We’ve opted for the M87A1 shotgun as the first gadget, as that’s the best shotgun in the game. It’s unstoppable, and the perfect option for close-range combat. Whereas the <strong>Deploy Beacon</strong> gets you—and your squad—back into the fray faster.</p>



<p>The <strong>Fragmentation Grenade</strong> is a standard Frag Grenade that’s great for puncturing holes in the walls and enemies, and speaking of both of those things, the <strong>Sledgehammer </strong>is a beastly, bludgeoning no-brainer.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ego-ai-create-human-like-ai-characters-with-personalities/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98human-like%E2%80%99-ai-characters-with-memories-and-personalities-created-by-ego-ai.1326370/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Today, a San Francisco-based AI company has announced the launch of character.world, an AI engine that allows for the creation of ‘human-like’ characters with memories, personalities, and the ability to form relationships with users.</p>



<p>This technology is built on the Character Context Protocol (CCP), an open-source product from EGO AI, which allows for the seamless integration of powerful and authentic AI-powered NPCs across various games, apps, and platforms, including Discord and Twitch.</p>



<p>The announcement went hand-in-hand with the unveiling of almost $7 million in seed funding to further bolster these AI-driven creations entering the market.</p>



<h2 id="h-living-persistent-characters-who-can-make-games-richer">‘Living, Persistent Characters Who Can Make Games Richer’</h2>



<p>In a press release, the CEO of EGO, Vishnu Hari, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Games and digital worlds have always struggled with flat, scripted non-player characters (NPCs) that feel mechanical and forgettable. EGO AI is tackling that head-on with characters who act, react and remember like real players.</p>



<p>Our mission is to move beyond chat windows and give people living, persistent characters who can make games richer, worlds more alive and interactions more meaningful.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a short video presenting the abilities of EGO AI, the company showcased how a user can talk directly to an AI NPC powered by the CCP technology, getting an instant response that’s contextualized and makes sense. The AI NPC remembered the conversation and referred to it later, even recalling a topic when talking to the user <strong>outside </strong>the initial game.</p>



<p>Here’s the video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="What is ego?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0dDGktWqUMI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>These are very early days for EGO AI, but investors are excited about the potential. In a statement, Adam Draper of Boost VC, one of the investors in EGO AI, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What excites me about Ego is their approach to one of gaming’s biggest challenges: creating characters that truly feel alive.</p>



<p>Their foundation model is a breakthrough in AI character behavior. We’re entering a new era where AI characters will carry personality, memory, and emotion—indistinguishable from human players—and Ego is positioned to lead it. And Vish is the most resilient founder in the space.</p>

<p>In an extensive whitepaper, EGO AI explained everything that goes into the technology driving these AI characters and laid out the benefits, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>More authentic gameplay</li>



<li>Automatic population of game worlds</li>



<li>Automated play and balance testing</li>
</ul>



<p>Each AI character will have a personality, needs, emotions, and memory features that enable them to feel as human as possible, and EGO AI has promised that this is the ground floor for this technology.</p>



<p>It obviously has some concerning elements circulating around it, the most critical of which is the inherent threat to human actors who would otherwise play these roles. This will likely fire up a debate when EGO AI becomes more public.</p>



<p>Are you eager to see more technology like this surface, or would you rather stick to traditional methods of portraying NPCs? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
