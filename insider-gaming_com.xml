            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is mere months away from hitting the market (we hope), and fans are still busy theorizing over how much the game will cost. The price is yet to be set, and many feel that it could be the first standard game to hit the market with a $100 price tag.</p>



<p>The nature of that price tag has been widely debated by many, including the folks here at Insider Gaming. It’s believed that if any game can carry that price tag, it’s Grand Theft Auto 6. That’s a sentiment that was shared by a Grand Theft Auto actor during a recent interview with The Escapist.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-grand-theft-auto-6-cost-100">Should Grand Theft Auto 6 Cost $100?</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/jay-klaitz-exclusive-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Escapist</a>, Jay Klaitz, the actor behind the notorious Lester Crest in Grand Theft Auto 5, sat down to talk about all things GTA. He touched on his experiences acting the character and performing alongside the trio of leads in the game that debuted a whopping 12 years ago.</p>



<p>Talk naturally turned to Grand Theft Auto 6 and Klaitz’s expectations of the game, including the long-rumored price point.</p>



<p>He’s in the camp suggesting that, owing to the investment poured into creating a Grand Theft Auto game, it’s more than worth a $100 label.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yeah dude. I mean, GTA V was so heavy on the mocap. I assume that GTA VI will be the same way, and these games take so long to make. Years and years and years. It’s not like they’ve just been hanging out, chilling and then just started doing the work last year. They finished GTA V and then started on GTA VI more or less immediately thereafter.</p>



<p>This shit takes forever and as we saw with GTA V the game will come out and there will be other versions, there will be downloadable content, it will be online. You’re almost buying multiple games when you buy the one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would also like to see it made more accessible to more fans so I get that side of the argument too to make it affordable for folks. That’s cool too. Maybe there’s like a way to split the difference, but I share the sentiment that this game warrants that price tag. Yeah, I get that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Klaitz was talking about the post-launch window of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is set to drop in May 2026. He addressed hopes that Rockstar Games would ‘bring back old Lester’ in some kind of expansion that revisits the character.</p>



<p>It would work, given how we see heist footage in the newest GTA 6 trailers, and that fits nicely into Lester Crest’s wheelhouse.</p>



<p>Do you think Klaitz is right and that Grand Theft Auto 6 should cost $100? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s November! That came around <strong>very fast</strong> this year, didn’t it? Halloween is now over and done with, and we can start looking to the festive season, and after that… 2026! Today, though, we’re looking a little smaller on the scale of time and considering today’s NYT Connections hints and answers.</p>



<p>I’ve got the best solutions you need to wrap up today’s NYT Connections puzzle and get on with your day. Read on to get all the hints you need to smash today’s challenge.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-1">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 1)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #874:</p>



<ul>
<li>RAVEN</li>



<li>PINKY</li>



<li>CHIP</li>



<li>JET</li>



<li>INKY</li>



<li>ROCKY</li>



<li>FILE</li>



<li>CLYDE</li>



<li>HARDY</li>



<li>SUE</li>



<li>TELLER</li>



<li>CHARGE</li>



<li>INDICT</li>



<li>ITCHY</li>



<li>PITCH</li>



<li>CHER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These are all legal actions that initiate or escalate a case.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each of these words is commonly used to describe a deep, rich black color — poetic and evocative.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>A fun twist — these are the “second” names in iconic duos.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>All animated rodents who take top billing in their respective pairs.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 1.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-1-874">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 1 (#874)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CHARGE, FILE, INDICT, SUE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – INKY, JET, PITCH, RAVEN</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CHER, CLYDE, HARDY, TELLER</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CHIP, ITCHY, PINKY, ROCKY</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘GTA 6 Workers’ Fired To Prevent Union Forming, It’s Alleged]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-workers-fired-prevent-union/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98gta-6-workers%E2%80%99-fired-to-prevent-union-forming-it%E2%80%99s-alleged.1340902/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new report, it has been claimed that ‘dozens of’ Rockstar Games employees have been fired for misconduct in a wave that might have been a twisted form of union busting. </p>



<p>The report originally published by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier claims that between 30 and 40 Rockstar Games employees in the UK and Canada were terminated, and they were allegedly <strong>all </strong>part of a ‘private trade union chat’ on Discord.</p>



<h2 id="h-blatant-and-ruthless-layoffs-at-rockstar-games">‘Blatant and Ruthless’ Layoffs at Rockstar Games</h2>



<p>Rockstar Games is preparing to launch Grand Theft Auto 6 in just a few months, all being well. The studio has been piecing together the open-world crime epic for years, and fans are eagerly awaiting the delivery of what will arguably be the largest game launch in history.</p>



<p>But the most recent bit of news involving Rockstar Games isn’t all that positive.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTkzOTg3MSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyNTQ0NjcxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNTBISEpHUFFRNkMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.9NYooKXrBMU_quRYMOSw6uACDogcIuS-E27t4GD8f2g&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> recently reported that Rockstar Games laid off 30 to 40 employees, labelling their dismissal terms as ‘misconduct’. However, a spokesperson of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) claimed that it’s an attempt at preventing unionization amongst the team members:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry. This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Take-Two refuted the claims, suggesting that all the firings took place because of ‘gross misconduct,’ but all the employees were dismissed at the same time, per reports, and all of them were found to be in a private chat on Discord related to unionization.</p>



<p>Rockstar Games has mostly avoided the waves of layoffs that have hit the industry over the last couple of years. Take-Two, the company’s parent firm, hasn’t fared as well. In April 2024, the gaming titan laid off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-take-two-layoffs/">around 5% of all employees</a> in a bid to streamline the business.</p>



<p>Do you think these alleged dismissals sound unlawful? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a></p>

<p>After a stellar launch, ARC Raiders has revealed its 2025 roadmap. Over November and December, new content like Arcs, quests, and a new map will come out for the multiplayer title.</p>



<p>Having only launched on October 30th, Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders has quickly become one of Steam’s hottest titles. The extraction shooter saw big success during its beta tests and, now that it’s out, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s hit over 264,000 players</a>. In a thank you note from the team, it revealed what fans can expect from the rest of 2025 and in the coming weeks.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Posted on <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official blog</a>, the ARC Raiders team detailed some of the new content being added to the game via a roadmap. For November (North Line), the fifth map, Stella Montis, will drop, as well as new Arcs, weapons, and quests. Large-scale community events are also being planned for both November and December. Finally, in December (Cold Snap), snowfall will be added to the game alongside a new Raider Deck, quests, and the Expedition Departure Window.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ARC Raiders team also shared a heartfelt thank-you note to those who played the game. The statement, <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in the blog</a>, can be found below:</p>



<p><strong>“We are so thankful to have you on this journey with us, and we will continue to refine and grow the game with your feedback in mind,” </strong>the ARC Raiders team states. <strong>“Keep your eyes on the horizon. This is only the beginning of what is in store for ARC Raiders.”</strong></p>



<p>With a launch like it had, ARC Raiders has the potential to be the next best multiplayer FPS. It will be interesting to see how it develops over time and what’s in store for players next. Either way, there’s a lot to look forward to for the game, and definitely worth checking out.</p>
