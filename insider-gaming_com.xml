<p>Black Ops 7 has landed, with Zombies once again returning to the Call of Duty franchise, and there is another way to play this time around with the addition of Cursed Mode—and we’ve got an explanation of exactly what it is.</p>



<p>Zombies in Black Ops 7 has plenty to uncover, with an in-depth narrative to follow that continues on from the events of Black Ops 6 and a wealth of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-zombie-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive Camos to unlock</a>.</p>



<p>Cursed Mode in Black Ops 7 Zombies provides the biggest challenge of all, however, and we’ve got a breakdown of what you can expect from the mode.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-cursed-mode-in-black-ops-7-zombies">What is Cursed Mode in Black Ops 7 Zombies?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A new challenge. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Cursed Mode in Black Ops 7 Zombies is a hardcore version of the mode, providing a challenge for those familiar with the Zombies mechanics and turning back a more original style.</strong></p>



<p>Players are limited from the off, starting with just a Pistol, and can unlock Easter Eggs and Quests to unlock ‘Relics’—which have a similar style to Skulls in the Halo franchise. Once unlocked, they can be applied to the start of any Cursed run and provide extra challenge.</p>



<p>Each Relic provides debuffs to increase the challenge, and there are three difficulty tiers of Cursed mode that increase with the amount of Relics activated. However, there are also small buffs available at each difficult level, such as Golden Armor purchasable off the wall in Tier 1.</p>



<p>The core differences for cursed mode are detailed below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Players start the match with Pistol only.</li>



<li>Loadout weapons are unavailable.</li>



<li>Minimap is disabled.</li>



<li>Black Ops 3-style point system.</li>



<li>Modified ammo costs.</li>



<li>Maximum four active Perks.</li>



<li>No Ammo Caches.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-cursed-mode-in-black-ops-7-zombies">How to Unlock Cursed Mode in Black Ops 7 Zombies</h2>



<p><strong>Cursed Mode only becomes available in Black Ops 7 when the Ashes of the Damned main quest has been completed for the first time.</strong></p>



<p>This can be done by finding the steps and working your way through the Ashes of the Damned main quest yourself, or by waiting for the Directed Mode to release—which is expected to arrive in Season 1.</p>



<p>Once unlocked, Cursed Mode is permanently available for players to select as one of the four Zombies options alongside Standard Mode, Directed Mode, and Survival.</p>
