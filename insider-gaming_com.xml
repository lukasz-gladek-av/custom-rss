<p>Battlestate Games has released a new gift code for Escape from Tarkov players, and it offers a hint regarding the game’s imminent graduation into a fully released game. For almost a decade, Escape from Tarkov has been a beta product, but in the coming months, it’ll transform, and the latest Escape from Tarkov reward code is teasing exactly that.</p>



<p>The latest Tarkov code offers a stack of free items, but more importantly, it tells us that the game’s full release is <strong>coming soon</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-latest-tarkov-code-gives-free-kit">Latest Tarkov Code Gives Free Kit</h2>



<p>If you want to redeem the latest Escape from Tarkov code, you’ll need to head to <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/promo/activate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>, sign in, and click on ‘Activate Promo Code’. Then, type in this code: RELEASECOMINGSOON.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that you can only redeem these free Tarkov items on a PvP account and <strong>not </strong>on a PvE account. If you’re only tied to the latter, you won’t even be able to claim the code, period.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here’s everything you get when you redeem the new Escape from Tarkov gift code:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tactical Sport Headset</li>



<li>Fleece Beanie</li>



<li>TGlasses</li>



<li>AFAK</li>



<li>Esmarch x 2</li>



<li>Ultimag x 3</li>



<li>Zarya Flashbang</li>



<li>SJ6</li>



<li>7.62 PP x 60</li>



<li>7.62 PS x 120</li>



<li>RGD-5 x 2</li>



<li>Propital</li>



<li>Morphine</li>



<li>CALOK-B</li>



<li>CMS</li>



<li>Vaseline</li>



<li>A18 Skanda Armoured Rig</li>



<li>AKMN (fully kitted)</li>
</ul>



<p>The AKMN assault rifle you get with the new Tarkov code is a beaut, boasting the red hex components that are guaranteed to make it stand out.</p>



<p>You’ll notice that when you head to Escape from Tarkov to collect the rewards, you’ll be met with a message from System that simply reads ‘Soon.’</p>



<p>It’s indicative <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">of Tarkov’s 1.0 release</a>, which might drop before the year is out (but more likely it’ll come in 2026).</p>



<p>Let me know if you’re excited about Escape from Tarkov’s imminent full release on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of 2025’s biggest and most important titles is a remake—Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. It’s a full remake of MGS3, and the review embargo will tell us if it’s lived up to the original game’s legend, or if it’s fallen flat on its face in Tselinoyarsk mud.</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid is an all-time franchise. Its stories still stand the test of time, and there are gameplay ideas that had they not been done previously would be unthinkable in 2025—although looking at the back of the game case would be slightly problematic in the digital era. I don’t think there’s a finer example of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-boss-fights-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MGS than Snake Eater</a>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater remake</a> is a fitting first reimagining. Even though Hideo Kojima isn’t at the helm of the project, we still expect this to be a hit. So let’s check out its review embargo details.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Fans will hang onto the word of reviews. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Several sources have quoted August 22 as the game’s review embargo date, with a release time of 12:01 AM PT.</strong></p>



<p>Many outlets and critics already seem to have gotten their hands on Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. You can see from Destin Legarie’s <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> page that this is the case.</p>



<p>Destin is quoted as saying: “I’ve played Metal Gear Solid Delta on PS5 and PC. Embargoed for Friday, August 22nd, 2025 as 12:01am PT. Coverage beyond me fanboying will be live at embargo.”</p>

<p><strong>Expectations for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater are sky-high, and I expect the reviews to follow suit with a Metacritic score in the region of 90-95.</strong></p>



<p>A telltale sign that Konami is confident about Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is that review copies are already out weeks in advance. The other sign is the review embargo date being a week before launch. Companies only do this if they’re confident about their product.</p>



<p>I would suggest Konami is more than happy with the state of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. This is great news when you consider 2004’s original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater has a <strong>91/100 rating</strong> on Metacritic. As long as the remake builds upon existing greatness and adds some modern-day quality of life changes, it’s hard to see the score dropping below 91.</p>



<p>Using my reasoning, I don’t think a <strong>92 or 93</strong> score is out of the question.</p>



<hr>



<p>The wait for the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review embargo will be more excruciating than Naked Snake using CQC to battle a crab. Let me know what score you think the Snake Eater remake is going to score. Be sure to check out the Insider Gaming forum for more MGS discussions.</p>
