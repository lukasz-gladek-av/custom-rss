<p>New extraction shooter ARC Raiders is looking to ‘Embark’ on a long journey. Whether it has the legs remains to be seen, but we’ve extracted some new information about the shooter and the potential ARC Raiders roadmap of future content.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is one of the big, new multiplayer dogs in 2025. With Call of Duty unable to crack the DMZ nut, Escape From Tarkov has largely had the genre to itself. Say hello to Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders!</p>



<p>The extraction shooter has had multiple betas—including the late-on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/has-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-been-extended-playtest-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Slam playtest</a>—and it’s time to look forward instead of back.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-have-a-roadmap">Does ARC Raiders Have A Roadmap?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We expect to travel and go everywhere. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, ARC Raiders doesn’t officially have a roadmap yet, as Embark Studios is unwilling to commit to additional content plans for the time being.</strong></p>



<p>However, it doesn’t mean the developer isn’t thinking about the future, and this is evident with he shocking reveal that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-add-10-years-worth-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders devs are already planning 10 years worth of content</a>.</p>



<p>Embark Studios design lead Virgil Watkins said: “I think internally, for a very long time, we referred to this [ARC Raiders] as a 10-year game. That is the ambition we are aiming for and that dictates the type and quantity of content we want to put into it.”</p>



<p>We often see multiplayer games and single-player games with season passes announce future content before the current chunk of gameplay is out! <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Raiders</a> isn’t going down this path anytime soon, as these plans can “Spiral into promises that can go unfulfilled if things change.”</p>



<h2 id="h-what-new-content-is-coming-to-arc-raiders">What New Content Is Coming To ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>Virgil Watkins has stated that ARC Raiders is likely to add fresh maps, more quests, and additional common-sense content throughout the game’s lifespan.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the design lead’s words in full: “Of course, adding things over time like new maps, extending questlines, and introducing new enemies and new weapons, and things like that. We’ll have some stuff lined up post-launch and for a little bit after, but then it will be based on what we see out of the launch and thereafter.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It sounds like the typical content you’d come to expect from a post-game launch for an extraction shooter. We respect the fact that the team doesn’t want to put a timeframe on the new content and see how the launch plays out first.</p>



<p>Based on your time in any of the game’s playtests, what do you think ARC Raiders is lacking? It’s time to let us know via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> and the comments section below.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/scarface-world-is-yours-coming-to-steam-and-epic/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/legendary-gta-competitor-%E2%80%98scarface%E2%80%99-coming-to-steam-and-epic-with-hd-graphics-mode.1331128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent hours, eagle-eyed gamers have scoured repositories on Steam and Epic Games on PC to find out everything they can about a reappearance of 2006’s <strong>Scarface: The World is Yours</strong>. The open-world title emerged as a competitor to Grand Theft Auto on the PlayStation 2, but due to complex licensing issues, it was never revisited.</p>



<p>It now <span>appears to be being brought back to life by a new publisher,&nbsp;<strong>and&nbsp;</strong>it is being given a new face with an HD graphics mode added</span> as a DLC. In case you’re unfamiliar, The World is Yours puts players in the shoes of Tony Montana from the 1983 Scarface movie, presenting an alternate universe in which he survives an assassination attempt and must rebuild his drug empire.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-scarface-the-world-is-yours-coming-back">Is Scarface: The World is Yours Coming Back?</h2>



<p>Scarface: The World is Yours has always been one of those games that fans have desperately sought a remaster of. It was released in 2006 and offered a large open-world map of Miami, customization options, the ability to rebuild and decorate Tony Montana’s iconic mansion, and the gameplay loop facilitated the construction of an <strong>empire</strong>.</p>



<p>It was buggy as hell in many ways, and the PC port that was released way back when was a shambles, but on PlayStation 2, the game was a certified banger that still sits firmly in my mind twenty years later. It was originally pieced together by Radical Entertainment, the same studio that made The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run and the Prototype games.</p>



<p>Scarface: The World is Yours was a heavily licensed game that featured Al Pacino’s likeness as Tony Montana, dialogue, direct-to-game story elements, a top soundtrack, and branding. This long presented a licensing concern when the discussion came about remastering or re-releasing the game.</p>



<p>Now, Hong Kong-based publisher EC Digital Entertainment appears to be floating the game on digital platforms <strong>for the first time</strong>. The unheard-of publisher seems to be backing a re-release of Scarface: The World is Yours on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/scarface-the-world-is-yours-7c3e6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Store</a> and on Valve’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113570/Scarface_The_World_Is_Yours_2006/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> storefront, but no release date has been given.</p>



<p>It has been suggested by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ocxf5r/scarface_the_world_is_yours_store_page_shows_up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">some users on social media</a> that the Epic Games store, especially, has been ‘released early’ in what looks like some twisted backend glitch.</p>



<p>Scarface: The World is Yours is a game that all Grand Theft Auto fans should check out. It might have twenty years on it by now, but it’s a phenomenal title that was overshadowed by the earlier launch of GTA: San Andreas in late 2004 and the later launch of GTA: IV in 2008.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re hoping for a resurgence of Scarface: The World is Yours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Persona 3 Reload is bringing back the original’s singer with a new update celebrating the Nintendo Switch 2 release.</p>



<p>Released in 2024, Persona 3 Reload served as the series’ first remake, bringing the 2006 original back to life for newer generations. With the changes, the original vocalist, Yumi Kawamura, did not return. Instead, the music was sung by Azumi Takahashi, as well as returning contributor Lotus Juice. Upon its release, it received tons of praise for its reinvention of the game and dedication to the original. An expansion, titled Project Aigis, came out later that year and acted as an epilogue to the game’s narrative. A port of Persona 3 Reload is launching on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/persona-3-reload-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on October 23rd and, as celebration, a nostalgic voice is making her return.</p>



<h2 id="h-yumi-kawamura-s-original-persona-3-songs-returning-for-persona-3-reload-in-upcoming-update">Yumi Kawamura’s Original Persona 3 Songs Returning for Persona 3 Reload in Upcoming Update</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>An iconic voice returns to Persona 3 Reload… 🎤🎶</p><p>Listen to eight dungeon and battle BGM tracks by the original Persona 3 vocalist – Yumi Kawamura – when the game launches on Nintendo Switch 2! </p><p>Patch will be available on all platforms. <a href="https://t.co/cZKpuVTWyP">pic.twitter.com/cZKpuVTWyP</a></p></div>— Official ATLUS West (@Atlus_West) <a href="https://twitter.com/Atlus_West/status/1980787484729430169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1980787484729430169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a>, Atlus West revealed that songs from the original Persona 3 and FES will be coming to Reload on October 23rd, when the Nintendo Switch 2 version is released. To celebrate the occasion, vocalist Yumi Kawamura, who performed the songs for the 2006 JRPG, spoke about the addition. In a statement below, she says</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It’s been a while!” Kawamura states. “I’m truly overjoyed and grateful to be reunited with everyone again. Persona 3 is a treasure to me as well—I can’t help but feel excited. Old friends, will you fight alongside me once more? New friends, how about letting my songs aid you in battle? Let’s celebrate together. Thank you for your continued support!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The songs being added to Persona 3 Reload from Persona 3 and FES are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>“Burn My Dread -Last Battle-“</li>



<li>“Mass Destruction”</li>



<li>“Deep Mentality”</li>



<li>“When The Moon’s&nbsp;Reaching Out Stars”</li>



<li>“Want to Be Close”</li>



<li>“Memories of You”</li>



<li>“Mass Destruction -P3fes Version-“</li>



<li>“Brand New Days”</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s important to note that the songs will only be available during exploration in Tartarus and in battles. The songs, as mentioned before, will come to Persona 3 Reload on October 23rd via a new patch. Luckily, all consoles, like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will get to listen to Yumi’s iconic tracks then, too. While Azumi’s versions of Persona 3’s songs were great, Yumi’s rasp and range can’t be beat. As a fan of the series, it’s good to see her renditions return and add some nostalgia to the amazing turn-based gameplay.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see Yumi’s versions come to Persona 3 Reload? Who do you prefer, Yumi or Azumi? Did you play the remake? What did you think of it?

<p>Luigi’s Mansion is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 via Nintendo Switch Online just in time for Halloween.</p>



<p>As a benefit of Nintendo Switch Online, many nostalgic games from Nintendo’s past are available to play. From NES classics like Donkey Kong to Game Boy hits like Tetris, there’s a lot to enjoy for fans. With the newly released Nintendo Switch 2, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2-upgrade-pack-details-revealed-for-nintendo-switch-online-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Expansion Pack</a> including GameCube, Nintendo 64, and Game Boy Advance titles was released. As the catalog grows, with recent additions including Forsaken 64 and Chibi-Robo, a spooky hit from the 2000s is coming just in time for Halloween.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-online-adding-luigi-s-mansion-releasing-october-30th">Nintendo Switch Online Adding Luigi’s Mansion, Releasing October 30th</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/GvN4hHpfVqQ?si=YMZmjm1kbZz5gIyG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new video</a> from Nintendo, the company announced that Luigi’s Mansion is headed to Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack. Furthermore, you won’t have to wait long to play it, as it releases on October 30th, 2025, the day before Halloween. The iconic 2001 title, released on the Nintendo GameCube, has since gone on to have a 3DS re-release and two other mainline entries.&nbsp;Luigi’s Mansion follows Mario’s brother, Luigi, as he navigates a ghost-infested mansion in search of his brother and friends. With a handy Poltergust 3000 and the kooky Prof. E. Gadd, you’ll take down the many ghosts and specters you’ll encounter.</p>



<p>The most recent title from the Luigi’s Mansion series was a re-release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-luigis-mansion-2-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a> for the Nintendo Switch in 2024. As for the last mainline entry, that was Luigi’s Mansion 3 in 2019, also for the Nintendo Switch. Its success as a Mario spinoff has made it a household name and one many hope makes a return with a new game. Perhaps the addition to Nintendo Switch Online could be a sign it’s in the works or if interest is there? In any case, Luigi’s Mansion’s addition is a scare we all can enjoy.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Splinter Cell Remake Loses Another Director]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-remake-no-director-job-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splinter-cell-remake-loses-another-director.1331020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new job listing from Ubisoft, the Splinter Cell remake has lost its director again.</p>



<p>Based on the Tom Clancy brand, Splinter Cell brings the stealth espionage action to gaming. With six mainline titles and a dozen novelizations, the series was a hit in the 2000s/2010s. Unfortunately, we last played as Sam Fisher back in 2013 with the cool yet controversial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-adds-steam-achievements-for-splinter-cell-blacklist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blacklist</a>. Having been over a decade since the last entry, a remake of the franchise’s first title was in order and announced in 2021. Sadly, all the news surrounding the project since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hasn’t been the best</a>, with no updates and the original director leaving. Now, it seems whoever came after them has quit the remake, according to a new Ubisoft job listing.</p>



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-hiring-new-director-for-splinter-cell-remake">Ubisoft Hiring New Director for Splinter Cell Remake</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/splinter-cell-remake-lost-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a>, a job listing, which has since been taken down, was available on Ubisoft’s website. The position, Game Director, was for the Ubisoft Toronto office and would be for the Splinter Cell remake. The description for the job states that the person would be part of the Splinter Cell development team, leading workers and coming up with new features. </p>



<p>In 2022, the original director, David Grivel, left the project and Ubisoft after more than a decade at the company. Given we haven’t seen any gameplay or updates like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a>, things look a bit unsteady. Just recently, the series did get a small revival with Netflix’s Splinter Cell: Deathwatch, an animated series from John Wick creator Derek Kolstad. The show <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-season-two-renewed-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was renewed</a> for a second season shortly after premiering, so it seems the hype for a new entry is very much present. Hopefully, things will work out and we’ll finally put on those night-vision goggles again.</p>



<p>What do you make of the news of the director’s departure? Did you watch Splinter Cell: Deathwatch? What did you think? Do you want to see a new Splinter Cell game in the future?
