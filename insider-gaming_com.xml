<p>Marvel Rivals Season 4 leaks have arrived, revealing the new season’s heroes, battle pass, skins, team-ups, a new game mode, and more. </p>



<p>As we draw closer to Marvel Rivals season 4, more leaks and rumors have started circulating. A recent claim stated Marvel Rivals could finally be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-debut-could-finally-be-happening-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making its debut on PS4</a>. New leaks regarding Marvel Rivals Season 4 have surfaced online, revealing details about the upcoming content expected in the next season.  </p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-4-leaked-heroes">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Leaked Heroes</h2>



<p>The leaked information about Marvel Rivals Season 4 originated from a Russian Discord channel, via XOXLEAK on <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1962964070581338220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) and Dylbobz on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92EIFCUXkrI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. Their new post states that the season name is called Heart of the Dragon, the launch hero will be Angela, and the second hero is Daredevil. Angela has some kind of temporary flying mechanic and has a melee-based skillset with a “bow or perhaps a spear”. Daredevil has an Asian-styled design and opposes Angela, “embodying the Dragon and the Tiger.”</p>

<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-4-battle-pass-and-skin-leaks">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Battle Pass and Skin Leaks</h2>



<p>Coming to Marvel Rivals Season 4 Battle Pass, it is reportedly called “Fruits of Immortality”. It will feature skins like Moon Knight Mecha Knight from Marvel’s What If…? series, a new Phoenix skin which is “presumably Dark Phoenix”, and a Phoenix Force Loki skin which is Red and has feathers. There is seemingly a new Ultron Wasteland skin to look forward to as well. </p>



<h2 id="h-new-game-mode-and-team-ups">New Game Mode and Team Ups </h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 4 is reportedly arriving with a new quick-play game mode that allows players to select the same heroes multiple times. Regarding Team-Ups, Human Torch, Black Panther, and Psylocke are the first ones; Venom and Captain America are the second ones. </p>



<p>Regardless, the information doesn’t come from the usual source; therefore, readers should take it with a massive grain of salt. All will be confirmed when the new season trailer arrives this week. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re brave enough to tackle the terrors of Bloober Team’s new Cronos: The New Dawn IP, I can tell you first-hand that the trophy list isn’t easy. This guide has every known achievement, as well as all the hidden and secret trophies you normally have to venture into the game to find out.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> isn’t for the faint-hearted. It’s a survival-horror game with an emphasis on psychological torment, as well as physical endangerment—thanks to the game’s litany of disfigured, slimy menaces. I had an endless sense of unease playing the game, but it was worth it. I also happened to scoop up a ton of trophies and achievements on the way.</p>



<p>If you want to see the Cronos: The New Dawn trophy list for yourself, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-cronos-the-new-dawn-achievements-amp-trophies">All Cronos: The New Dawn Achievements &amp; Trophies</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Even the Traveler has doubts. Credit to Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is the default trophy list you’ll see when you first start up <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/cronos/cronos-the-new-dawn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>. These are the trophies and achievements Bloober Team wants you to see. The tasks the developer wants you to know about before you begin.</p>

<ul>

<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is a story-driven single-player game. This means many of its trophies and achievements are purposely hidden. I’ve done you the service of concealing them from the main list. This is your final warning: If you don’t want to know anything about Cronos story spoilers or possible content you’ll encounter, turn away now!</p>



<p><strong>*SPOILER WARNING*</strong></p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-and-trophies-are-in-cronos-the-new-dawn">How Many Achievements And Trophies Are In Cronos: The New Dawn?</h2>



<p><strong>There is a grand total of 48 PlayStation Trophies and 47 Xbox Achievements for you to pursue in Cronos: The New Dawn.</strong></p>



<p>Granted, a lot of Cronos is <em>you </em>being hunted and chased down. If you’re hankering for the game’s full set of extra accomplishments, though, you need to keep the entire list in mind. You can’t get every trophy and achievement on your first playthrough, as it’s impossible. </p>



<p>Getting the Platinum Trophy requires at least one more run—there is no Platinum Trophy for Xbox users, be warned.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s hopefully the start of something special for Bloober Team and Cronos: The New Dawn. It’s an incredible new IP with all the makings of a new series. I enjoyed it, but let me know how you get on with it through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cronos-the-new-dawn-review%E2%80%94a-new-harbinger-of-horror-has-merged.1287492/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bloober Team is hot off the heels of its 2024 success. Cronos: The New Dawn is a brand-new IP from the makers of the Silent Hill 2 Remake, and it has everything you could want from a survival-horror game: A nervous atmosphere, a constant feeling of trepidation and jeopardy, grotesque monsters, and an inventory so limited you’re wondering if you can stuff a few more ammo clips into your suit.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> feels <em>safe</em>—and I hate using that word with new games, as it feels like an insult. It feels like a pejorative, but in many cases (this one especially) it’s a compliment. Bloober Team throws out the odd new idea here and there, but the game feels like a well-rounded survival horror title with an interesting story.</p>



<p>The game’s central enemy mechanic revolves around the concept of merging, and it feels like Cronos has dipped its hand into the best pots, aptly creating an amalgamation of tried and tested horror tropes to produce a polished and impactful debut.</p>



<h2 id="h-cronos-the-new-dawn-review">Cronos: The New Dawn Review</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Did you pay for your fare? I don’t think so. Credit to Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p>You are a nameless Traveler: A mysterious figure sent to retrieve items, uncover time rifts to gain a deeper understanding of the planet’s implosion, and explore its fallen remnants in search of The Traveler who came before you. The ‘Change’ brought the world to its knees and executed it in cold-hearted fashion. All that remains is a series of monsters—each more unpleasant than the last—who merge with defeated enemies and become stronger—which is a real problem for you!</p>



<p>I found the first hour of <a href="https://cronosnewdawn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> to be a bit slow and unengaging, to be honest. You think of Silent Hill 2’s foggy and genuinely haunting opening moments, whereas Dead Space hits you with loud, blaring danger sirens as a Necromorph tries to pierce you in a tense elevator chase sequence. Any lingering doubts quickly evaporated into intrigue as the story and gameplay improved progressively. It crescendoed by the end of my 14 hours in Cronos’ hellscape, and I was truly left wanting more when the credits rolled.</p>



<p>The story feels a bit ambiguous and ambitious for its scope at times, but the final payoff is satisfying. It probably requires a second playthrough to fully grasp the intricacies of the narrative’s details, which are revealed through cutscenes and typical world-building notes and tapes scattered throughout the game’s various vile and decrepit biomes.</p>



<h2 id="h-don-t-fix-what-isn-t-broken">Don’t Fix What Isn’t broken</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nope. Just nope. Credit to Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’ve played any survival-horror game before, Cronos swiftly becomes second-nature. You need to be accurate, and learning the game’s charge-up mechanic is crucial to make shots stronger and optimize ammo management. The upgrade system is a slow-burner (don’t expect to upgrade even half your gear by the time your first playthrough is done), and the pacing ducks and dives between combat-heavy encounters and exploration.</p>



<p>The game genuinely improves as it unfolds, allowing you to acquire more weapons and tools. I would’ve liked more variety in the weaponry, but your flame Tool and explosive bombs you get somewhat compensate. Cronos’ level designs range from snowy exteriors to dank, dilapidated residential buildings with monsters scuttling around every surface. You risk eternal dizziness as you need to have your head on a swivel, lest you get pounced on by an unsuspecting enemy.</p>



<p>My favorite portion of Cronos was a hospital section midway through the game—no prizes for where the inspiration came from here. Puzzles aren’t really at the forefront of Cronos’ design, but this area requires multiple keys, and special items are necessary for doors and hidden areas. The tension was palpable throughout, too. My anxiety and nervousness were through the roof as I ventured into unknown corridors and rooms, and there wasn’t enough absorption in the world to mop up my terror sweats.</p>



<p>Cronos has jump scares aplenty, and its addictive 80s synth music offsets any built-up paranoia you’re likely to experience. As much as you won’t want to, searching the vicinity is a must. Despite being advertised as a hard game, I comfortably finished Cronos with under 10 deaths—but I am well-versed in the genre. Seek out Energy, look for Cores, and your cat-like curiosity will be rewarded—there are literally cat collectibles. </p>



<p>If you’re worried there’s not enough of a challenge, a Hard Mode is unlocked at the end, along with a New Game+ setting.</p>



<h2 id="h-room-for-one-more-please">Room For One More, Please?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An explosive journey. Credit to Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ll flat-out say Cronos’ inventory system is frustrating beyond belief. It’s probably the most oppressive balancing act since Resident Evil 0. If you don’t focus your Core upgrades on increasing your inventory slots ASAP, you’re going to suffer. Each ammo slot doesn’t hold much, and you can never truly have a consistent balance of ammunition, weapons, and health.</p>



<p>If you find a health item out in the open, you can’t use it; it <em>has</em> to be in your inventory. The only way to drop items is to permanently discard them. You’re telling me we can have magical inventory boxes that can transfer your gear from one safe area to the next, but I can’t use a first aid pickup right in front of me?</p>



<p>You often have compulsory story items taking up slots, and I ended up not really using the game’s central burning mechanic because each flame canister—you guessed it—takes up an inventory slot. I felt punished for minimizing ammo and resource waste. Now, I think the game’s Hard Mode will be better-suited for me, and inexperienced horror fans are probably going to chew through supplies faster than a hungry mouse does a block of cheese, but veterans might get the ick from the system’s obtrusiveness.</p>



<h2 id="h-cronos-the-new-dawn-verdict">Cronos: The New Dawn Verdict</h2>



<p>The critic in me will say Cronos: The New Dawn isn’t transcendent. Again, this is ok. What Cronos does, it does very well, and taking the recency bias of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-silent-hill-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> out of the equation, I can’t recall a new survival-horror game I’ve enjoyed this much and found this immersive in a while.</p>



<p>Once it gets going, Cronos batters you with a buffet of scares, stress, and superb combat. I can’t overlook the stingy inventory management headaches that will last a lifetime, but there’s no denying that Cronos: The New Dawn wants you to think and strategize. I’ll wrap up this review by saying Cronos: the New Dawn is an excellent new survival-horror title. If you have an interest in the genre, this is a must-play, and old-school horror fans will love this: Such is our calling.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Sonic Series Producer has stated that Mario Kart World did not influence Sonic Racing CrossWorlds in any way. </p>



<p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds launches this month on September 25, 2025. Ahead of the release, players will be able to try the game through an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-getting-free-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open network test</a> scheduled for mid-September. Ahead of that, the developers have revealed how Mario Kart World had no impact on their upcoming title’s development plans.</p>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-world-did-not-influence-sonic-racing-crossworlds-development-plans">Mario Kart World Did Not Influence Sonic Racing CrossWorlds Development Plans</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://traxion.gg/sonic-series-producer-was-surprised-by-mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Traxion</a> (via <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/09/02/sonic-team-boss-mario-kart-world-wont-have-any-influence-on-sonic-racing-crossworlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MyNintendoNews</a>), Sonic Series Producer Takashi Iizuka spoke about Mario Kart World’s impact on Sonic Racing CrossWorlds. Izuka first stated that, like everyone, they are also unaware of the “road map of Mario Kart titles” and were “surprised” when it was released. At the same time, the developers were expecting one to be released soon, as Nintendo “typically” releases a new karting title with new hardware.</p>



<p>However, Iizuka added, “Whether or not Mario Kart was going to be released, our goal was to develop the best kind of Sonic racing title. That hasn’t changed – Mario Kart World won’t have any influence.” Izuka also spoke about the differences between the two games, which include cross-play, a customizable gadget system, characters from other IPs, Travel Rings, and more. </p>



<p>He stated that these features add “depth to the racing and are something other kart racers aren’t doing.” Izuka concluded, saying, “Even though Mario Kart World was announced, it didn’t influence our development plans.”</p>



<p>In other news, Sonic Racing CrossWorlds’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-full-character-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete character list</a> has been revealed, including launch, season pass, and bonus characters.
