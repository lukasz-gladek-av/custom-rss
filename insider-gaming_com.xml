<p>Ahead of the game’s release on March 20, Ubisoft has released 20 minutes of new Assassin’s Creed Shadows gameplay.</p>



<p>The new gameplay shows both Naoe and Yasuka “infiltrating Nijo Palace, the castle complex (also known as a tenshu) in Kyoto, a major city in the larger region of Yamashiro.”</p>



<p>“Castles in Assassin’s Creed Shadows are strongholds, filled with hostile guards, valuable resources, and one precious loot chest,”  Ubisoft’s Youssef Garcia-Maguid wrote on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/assassins-creed-shadows-20-minutes-of-new-castle-gameplay-launches-march-20/?sf276574441=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog.</a> “Conquering a tenshu means eliminating any Samurai Daisho on the premises, which unlocks the loot chest, giving you powerful gear. You can see the contents of these chests when you hover over the castle icon in the map.”</p>

<p>Garcia-Maguid added that Castles are “just one of the many activities” in the game that players can complete in order to increase their Knowledge Rank. Increasing your Knowledge Rank will let players learn higher-level abilities.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ creative producer, Jonathan Dumont, has revealed new details about the Claws of Awaji DLC, stating it will feature a ‘spookier’ and ‘different’ vibe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ahead of the release, Dumont shared information about the game’s post-launch content during an interview with <a href="https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-development-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>. The creative producer stated that Assassin’s Creed Shadows Claws of Awaji DLC will act as a “continuation” of the adventure and story of their two protagonists. The DLC will feature a “different vibe, a bit spookier,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dumont also stated that Assassin’s Creed Shadows features “a definite ending”, and the Claws of Awaji DLC’s events occur after the “core story of the main game”. This means players will have much to explore after completing the base game, as the DLC will introduce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-expansion-claws-of-awaji/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10+ hours of additional gameplay</a>. Check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer</a> for Claws of Awaji here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same interview, Dumont also discussed the bonus pre-order quest for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Thrown to the Dogs. The creative producer described it as “a simple yet heartfelt side quest,” similar to the side content we saw in AC Odyssey. The quest begins with a beaten-up stray dog at a grave, who takes the protagonists to his former house to uncover some “family secrets,” stated Dumont.&nbsp;</p>
