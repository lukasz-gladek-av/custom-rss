<p>With the second season of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> set to launch, the game’s communications team has shared a list of updates players can look forward to.</p>



<p>While new maps and challenges are already known to be coming to Battlefield 6<a href="https://x.com/battlefieldcomm/status/2021313449754755403?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">, major updates are also on the way,</a> bringing quality-of-life improvements, faster progression, and more.</p>



<p>One such change includes faster Battle Pass progression. The team notes that this season will be more rewarding and that Battle Pass Tokens earned from Career XP have been recalculated, allowing players to progress faster through regular gameplay and weekly challenges.</p>



<p>Additionally, in-game movement has been improved. The team behind Battlefield 6 now says it feels more predictable and readable during fast-paced action changes, including acceleration curves, smoother vaulting, and smoother ladder transitions. The team has also made fixes that reduce visual inconsistencies and unexpected behavior.</p>







<h2 id="h-updates-coming-to-redsec">Updates Coming to REDSEC</h2>



<p>REDSEC is Battlefield 6’s Battle Royale mode. This community update notes that there will be more rewarding progression in the mode, as Career and weapon XP earn rates have been increased. Hopefully, baseball helps progression feel more balanced between the regular gameplay experience and Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Also, they are increasing overall armor availability in REDSEC. Plus, they’re introducing a cooldown on Vehicle Keycards as a mission reward after players acquire one. This is intended to help balance tank access in Battle Royale mode.</p>

<p>The patch notes for Overwatch’s Season 1 are here. Updates include general quality-of-life fixes, updates, and more.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch </a>recently announced that, with the launch of its next season, it would revert to the name “Overwatch” after several years as “Overwatch 2.” Along with these changes comes a story-focused mentality and a new Rise of Talon story arc.</p>



<p>The February 9 patch notes detail a new conquest event and some updates fans can look forward to.</p>



<p>The conquest event will be a 5-week-long event. Players will choose their faction each week and can represent either Overwatch or Talon. After making their selection, there will be weekly faction challenges with their own rewards. Once the entire pass is unlocked, players can choose to switch factions and earn all of the faction-specific rewards on that side as well.</p>



<p>Learn more about the faction warfare and new Heroes added to the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-to-be-renamed-overwatch-with-next-update/" id="174168">here</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-game-mode-update-clash-leaving-quick-play">Game Mode Update: Clash Leaving Quick Play</h2>



<p>In a game mode update, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/blizzard-entertainment/" id="87642">Blizzard </a>announced that Clash has been removed from Quick Play. This also means removing Hanaoka and Throne of Anubis from the map selection. It is stated that the mode will remain in Stadium, and it may return to Quick Play in the future.</p>



<p>“We have some amazing new maps lined up for the next year, and our reworks will continue…and get bigger. Redesigns that completely change how certain areas of our maps play are coming soon.”</p>







<h2>More Information on the General Updates to Overwatch</h2>



<p>New updates also feature a revamped UI that focuses on your friends and favorite Heroes. Loot box updates include a selection of Cosmetics from Seasons 15 through 20. Also, players can now adjust the Field of View on Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro consoles.</p>



<p>Much more is included in the official notes. Read the full patch notes <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/" id="96159">RGG</a>‘s Masayoshi Yokoyama has stated that Sega’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/yakuza-kiwami/" id="154859">Yakuza Kiwami</a> series will conclude with the third installment, setting the stage for a new series.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/yakuza-kiwami-3/" id="2971">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> is set to release on February 12. It is the latest in the line of Kiwami remakes for the Yakuza series. Unfortunately for those looking for more of this style of game, Masayoshi Yokoyama revealed during a recent livestream that the forthcoming game will be the series’ final installment, making way for new games with a different title. The spin-off will not be comparable to the Like A Dragon series either.</p>



<p>“I don’t think it will continue as the ‘Kiwami’ series anymore. I think a different series will begin, and not something like ‘Like A Dragon 9, ‘ but rather a new series on a different line, with a different meaning. This might be something you’ll understand once you play Yakuza Kiwami 3.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-yakuza-kawami-3-also-comes-bundled-with-dark-ties">Yakuza Kawami 3 Also Comes Bundled With Dark Ties</h2>



<p>In addition to the remake of 2009’s Yakuza 3, this new game also comes with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties/" id="173294">Dark Ties DLC</a>. In this expansion, you will play as the antagonist of Yakuza 3, Yoshitaka Mine. This is a prequel story following Mine as he joins the Yakuza Tojo Clan. </p>



<p>This version is comparable to Sonic x Shadow Generations in that it gives players a choice of which mode to launch first.</p>
