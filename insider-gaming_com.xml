<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Eidos Montreal worked with Kojima Productions on the developer’s new game ‘OD’ for around a year before some of its developers were asked to move to Japan.</p>







<p>According to sources who added further context to our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/legacy-of-kain-reboot-eidos-montreal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">past report on the current layoff situation</a> at Eidos Montreal, OD, which was previously known as Overdose, had been in development there for around a year in 2023. The game was internally known as P21, but development of the project at Eidos Montreal ceased after a request from Kojima Productions to have the developers move to Japan and cut ties with Eidos Montreal, said the people.</p>



<p>At the time of the request, around 20 developers were working on the project.</p>



<p>Kojima’s ‘Overdose’ title suffered a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-overdose-gameplay-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monumental leak in November 2022</a>, when gameplay footage obtained from the backend of YouTube by a leaker known as ‘The Snitch’ surfaced online. The two minutes of gameplay revealed that the game featured Death Stranding’s Mama (Margaret Qualley) in a blue dress and officially leaked the working name of the game as ‘Overdose’.</p>



<p>In 2023 at The Game Awards, Kojima officially announced with Jordan Peele that the game would be called ‘OD’, saying that people would “either love it or hate it”. In September 2025, a new teaser for the game, titled ‘Knock’, was released.</p>



<p>The game has seen several setbacks since its announcement, with filming for the game being delayed until 2026 due to the&nbsp;2024–2025 SAG-AFTRA video game strike. On November 23, 2025, Ubo Kier, who was set to star in the game died at the age of 81. </p>







<div><p>Kojima said in a statement on X,</p><p>“I’m at a loss for words. It all happened far too suddenly. Because of the strike, we weren’t able to shoot “<em>OD</em>” for a long time, and we were forced to reschedule to next year. Even during that time, Udo and I exchanged emails frequently. We stayed in close contact. When we met in Milan at the end of September, he told me how much he was looking forward to the shoot starting up again next year. He was full of energy then too, making me laugh with his usual “Udo-isms.” I still can’t believe this. Udo wasn’t just an actor. He was truly an “icon” of his time. We’ve lost a great “icon.” There will never be another like him. Udo, rest in peace. I will never forget you.”</p></div>



<p>It’s currently unknown when the game will officially be released, but it will be published by Xbox Game Studios.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon’s God of War May Have Cast Thor and Baldur]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A rumor from a reliable film insider may have revealed who’s cast as Thor and Baldur in Amazon’s God of War series. The show was recently given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-god-of-war-director-second-season-greenlit-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a two-season greenlight</a>, with casting underway.</p>



<p>Ever since 2005, PlayStation and Santa Monica’s God of War series has delivered on the action front. With excellent drama, fun hack-and-slash gameplay, and gory godly kills, there’s a lot to love. The reboot series, consisting of God of War and God of War Ragnarok, put a more dramatic twist on the series, earning it huge praise. In 2022, it was announced that Amazon Prime Video would be making the reboots into a streaming show. Earlier last month, Emmy-winning director Frederick E.O. Toye was revealed to direct the first two episodes, with the casting ongoing. Now, it seems a new rumor says that actors for Thor and Baldur are close to being cast. </p>







<h2 id="h-boots-and-severance-stars-in-talks-to-play-baldur-and-thor-in-amazon-s-god-of-war-according-to-film-insider">Boots and Severance Stars In Talks to Play Baldur and Thor in Amazon’s God of War, According to Film Insider</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The rumor comes from reliable film insider <strong>DanielRPK</strong>, who’s leaked details on several projects like Avengers and Spider-Man. In <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/145161885?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Patreon post</a>, it’s mentioned that <strong>antagonists Baldur and Thor have actors in talks to play them for Amazon’s God of War</strong>. For <strong>Baldur</strong>, <strong>Max Parker</strong>, who recently played the lead in Boots, is up for the role of the Norse immortal. Meanwhile, <strong>Olafur Darri Olafsson</strong>, known for his role as Mr. Drummond in season two of Severance, is in talks to play the drunken god of thunder from Ragnarok, <strong>Thor</strong>. </p>



<p>It’s important to note that <strong>these castings have not been confirmed</strong>, so <strong>take it with a big grain of salt</strong>. Even if not, both actors are pretty great choices for the roles in God of War. As of now, no official casting has been revealed. Filming is expected to start early next year, so it won’t be long until it’s known who Kratos and Atreus are.</p>







<p>What do you think of the rumored Amazon God of War cast for Thor and Baldur? Do you think they are good choices? Who do you think would make a great Thor? Baldur? Kratos?
