<p>It’s going to be a huge moment when we get to drop into Battlefield 6’s battle royale mode. The spiritual successor to Firestorm and Hazard Zone will be a historic occasion, and we’re checking to see if it’s free-to-play, plus anything else cost-related, or what you need to hop in.</p>



<p>Battle royale is an interesting one in 2025. The genre’s peak days feel behind us more than they are ahead, but millions of players are still dropping into huge maps slowly being engulfed by electricity, storms, and gas. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> launched with a decent campaign and a brilliant multiplayer mode, but we’ve always known a battle royale extra was lurking in the background.</p>



<p>It’s fascinating to see how destruction is factored into the fray. Before we get there, however, let’s see if you’ve got to pay to take the ride.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play">Is Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Free To Play?</h2>

<p><strong>According to Insider Gaming sources, yes, the Battle Royale game mode will be completely free-to-play under the Battlefield 6 umbrella.</strong></p>



<p>We exclusively reported on Feb. 27, 2024, that EA was working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale mode</a> for the (then) upcoming Battlefield 6. Pretty much everything in that story came to fruition. But the story also added:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Ripple Effect, the studio that is working on a ‘new experience’ for the Battlefield franchise is working on a new Battle Royale title that’s currently aimed to be <strong>free-to-play</strong> and follow a similar strategy to the highly successful Call of Duty: Warzone that will see the free-to-play experience tie-in with its premium release.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Officially, all we know in this moment is that BF 6’s battle royale is happening. EA hasn’t confirmed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-pois-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>, nor officially confirmed our report that it will be free. Stay tuned for further updates, but we’ll be shocked if you have to pay an extra penny for BF 6’s battle royale—perhaps with one slight caveat.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-battlefield-6-battle-royale-be-a-standalone-game-like-warzone">Will Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Be A Standalone Game Like Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>There has been no news or leaks to say if Battlefield 6’s battle royale game is included in the overall BF 6 package, or if it’ll be a free-to-play download like Call of Duty: Warzone.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s that caveat we mentioned. We haven’t heard anything regarding EA’s final decision on the battle royale being completely free, or only free to paying Battlefield 6 customers.</p>



<p>Warzone is a Call of Duty game, but it’s a separate (free) download. We’ll have to see if the new battle royale component follows its path.</p>



<p>If we can and do learn more about the battle royale mode, you’ll hear it from us. We haven’t steered you far wrong when it comes to BF 6 news and leaks, so we’ll keep our eyes open on more battle royale news. Are you looking forward to seeing how different a BF 6 BR looks in 2025?

<p>Like other games, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has Shinies. These are extremely rare and differently color-paletted versions of their regular counterparts. If you’re worried about the game’s auto-save ability making it so that you miss out on rare Shiny encounters, then you can breathe easy and use Sleep Power on yourself.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/are-starters-shiny-locked-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shinies</a> are the holy grail of Pokémon. Legendaries are great, but the feeling of finding a Shiny version of a Pokémon is like pulling a Charizard from a Pokémon pack—wilder than anything that inhabits Viridian Forest. Shinies are usually liable to disappear if you don’t reach them in Pokémon games, but this isn’t the case in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pre-order-bonus-redeem-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>

<p>Players are learning that if you hear or see a Shiny Pokémon in Legends: Z-A and it’s in your game world, you have infinite time to catch it—providing you don’t go over the Shiny limit.</p>



<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AustinJohnPlays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Austin John Plays</a> does a great job of explaining how Z-A approaches Shinies. Despite the game’s auto-save system, once a Shiny appears in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, it will remain until you interact with it: Fighting it or trying to catch it.</p>



<p>Austin John Plays explains that “Up to 10 Pokémon, who are Shiny, will be preserved in the game’s memory.” This means you have ample time to catch or reach a Shiny Pokémon,</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The mechanics and theory have been tested by other Pokémon Legends: Z-A players, too. A subreddit thread explained how the OP encountered a Shiny Magikarp, went away, changed the time of day, came back, and it was still there.</p>



<p>They did several other actions—also involving the passage of time and/or traveling—and the Shiny Magikarp didn’t budge.</p>

<p>This is what we call a good quality of life feature. You don’t have to worry about games or loss of connection ruining your chances of capturing a rare Shiny. Do you think this is a well-thought-out decision by Game Freak? Get into the comments and let us know.
