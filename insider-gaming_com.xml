<p>To celebrate the 25th anniversary of Final Fantasy 9, Square Enix has launched a special website dedicated to the title. But all this has done is spark gossip and speculation that a Final Fantasy 9 remake is on the way and close to being announced.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-single-player-record-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> project has been a hit. It’s won awards, both games have sold millions of copies, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-developers-have-already-written-part-3s-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third and final chapter of the trilogy</a> is sure to round things off in style. But while the FF7 remake talk has been constant, the chatter about a Final Fantasy 9 remake has been just as loud and fervent.</p>



<p>The ninth mainline game is considered as important as any to many in the FF community. So when Square Enix suddenly drops a new FF9 website, eyebrows are raised, and questions are sure to be asked.</p>

<p>We already know that 2026 brings us a new reboot of Resident Evil. However, thanks to words from director Zach Cregger, it could be one of the most faithful adaptations of the legendary survival-horror series to date.</p>



<p>The history of Resident Evil movies isn’t the best. There’s been plenty to love, and we’ve seen countless nods to the game from characters to Resident Evil Apocalypse’s full inclusion of Nemesis. Milla Jovovich killed it as Alice in the original six movies, but the franchise has moved in a different direction since.</p>



<p>2021’s Resident Evil Welcome to Raccoon City has already been forgotten, but now we look ahead to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new 2026 Resident Evil film</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-movie-is-unlike-any-of-the-previous-films">Resident Evil Movie is “Unlike Any of The Previous Films”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This news has us howling. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Through <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-resident-evil-movie-will-be-unlike-any-of-the-previous-films-director-promises?utm_source=facebook,threads,twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, we’ve learned from Zach Cregger—director of the Resident Evil movie reboot—that his interpretation “Will be built in the spirit of those games and follows one central protagonist from point A to point B, as they descend deeper into hell.”</p>



<p>He wants to capture a truer feel of the survival games, and has boldly claimed the reboot is “<strong>Unlike any of the previous films</strong>.”</p>



<p>Zach Cregger is an actor-turned-director and producer. He’s had several roles across TV and movies, but he’s recently best-known for writing and directing 2022’s Barbarian. The Resident Evil reboot is a huge project, and if the movie can be a success, it could start a new trend of Resident Evil movies to go along with the game series.</p>



<p>We know a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-confirm-new-resident-evil-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Resident Evil game</a> is well into development, and it’s also rumored that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 0 and Code Veronica remakes</a> are on the way. Join the conversation in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to see if anyone else is excited at the prospect of more Resident Evil screentime.</p>
