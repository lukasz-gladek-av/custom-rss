<p>Two minutes of in-engine footage of ZeniMax Online Studio’s cancelled Project Blackbird has leaked online.</p>







<p>The footage, which Insider Gaming can verify is legitimate, was used internally at ZeniMax to showcase the game’s lighting. You can see the two minutes of footage below:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="es" dir="ltr"><p>👀🔥 LEAK ⚡️</p><p>Nuevo metraje de "Project Blackbird", el MMO de Zenimax Online cancelado hace meses por Xbox.</p><p>Qué ganas le tenía 🥺. <a href="https://t.co/4Nz1G22l2F">pic.twitter.com/4Nz1G22l2F</a></p></div>— eXtas1s 🎮 Noticias &amp; Rumores (@eXtas1stv) <a href="https://twitter.com/eXtas1stv/status/2012971422679765352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Project Blackbird was cancelled by Microsoft in July 2025 as a part of Microsoft’s mass layoffs, which also saw other projects at the publisher cancelled.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources on Blackbird, the game was targeting a 2028 release date and had amazed Microsoft Gaming executives just months earlier during a presentation. As of the time of writing, Microsoft Gaming still haven’t given a reason as to why Blackbird was cancelled.</p>



<p>The game’s cancellation led to the layoff of some 300 developers and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/matt-firor-quit-zenimax-project-blackbird-cancelation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">departure of studio president Matt Firor</a>. </p>

<p>The live-action Legend of Zelda movie will stream exclusively on Netflix after its theatrical and home entertainment releases.</p>



<p>Very little is known about the Legend of Zelda movie, aside from the fact that it is slated to release in May 2027. However, as part of Sony Pictures’ Pay-1 licensing deal with Netflix, the upcoming Legend of Zelda movie will join Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse and the forthcoming quartet of Beatles movies, directed by Sam Mendes, in streaming exclusively on Netflix.</p>



<p><a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-and-sony-pictures-entertainment-enter-new-global-pay-1-deal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a press release, </a>Paul Littmann, EVP of Global Distribution at Sony Pictures Television, praised the partnership with Netflix and cited the new deal as the next step in that relationship.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Our partnership with Netflix has always been incredibly valuable. This new Pay-1 deal takes that partnership to the next level and reinforces the enduring appeal of our theatrical releases to Netflix’s global audience. It also further underscores the strength of our independence and unique ability to create meaningful opportunities that benefit our creative stakeholders, consumers, and world-class partners.”</p>

<h2 id="h-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">What We Know So Far About the Legend of Zelda Movie</h2>



<p>In November 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-images-reveal-link-and-zelda-in-costume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official images</a> of Zelda and Link in the film were revealed. Bo Bragason will play Princess Zelda, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth will play Hyrule’s protector, Link. Filming began in 2025, but there’s still over a year until the actual release, and much remains to be learned about the casting, plot, and more. Recently, it was suggested that a star of the popular Apple TV series, Severance, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zelda-movie-leak-impa-severance-actor-filming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">could be joining the cast.</a></p>







<p>2026 is also the 40th anniversary of the The Legend of Zelda franchise as a whole. In celebration, a new LEGO set is on the way.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Apex Legends Global Series Championship 2026 has <strong>just wrapped</strong>, and it was OBLIVION sitting at the top of the table after a hard-fought grand final. The final series was dragged out by so many teams racking up enough points to land themselves on <strong>match point</strong>, waiting on one final win to claim the trophy and the $600,000 prize.</p>



<p>Team Falcons was the first squad to reach match point after a dominant run throughout the tournament. It seems that nothing, not even a banned controller, could stop ImperialHal – <strong>except OBLIVION</strong></p>







<p>It has been a pretty mixed year for the Apex Legends Global Series. We saw Team Falcons storm to the top spot time and again, running through much of the season as <strong>the team to beat</strong>. The year came to a close in Sapporo (again), a site fast becoming the <strong>home </strong>of Apex esports, with a hugely polished event backed by some stunning sponsorships.</p>



<p>It was easily one of the biggest years for Apex esports.</p>



<p>This year introduced an all-new LAN structure, a <strong>monumental </strong>ALGS Open featuring 160 teams, a revamped points system, <strong>and </strong>an expanded map pool, just to make things more varied.</p>



<p>It all came to a head at the ALGS Championship 2026, live in Sapporo. By the time the grand final of the tournament was set to end, six teams sat on match point, making for an exhilarating showdown in front of a <strong>huge </strong>and energetic crowd in the Daiwa House Dome in Japan.</p>



<p>As Team Falcons sat with toes touching the finish line, Fnatic stepped up and threw themselves into the running with a huge upset, especially buffed as the team was playing on <strong>home turf</strong>.</p>



<p>The next map went wild, and the final fight came down to a razor-sharp line, with the last three teams fighting in the most minuscule circle, trading shots and playing as patient a game as possible, everyone conscious of the fact that E36 sat on match point while nobody else did. That became the focal point, E36 was wiped, and another round was lined up against all odds.</p>



<p>Eight teams now sat in the match point realm.</p>



<p>The <strong>very final map </strong>saw Oblivion surge out of nowhere, with the LCQ champions breaking into the final three and storming to success in Sapporo. The mostly North American squad put up a masterclass in the Apex space, securing the biggest underdog win in the history of the space.</p>



<p>Until now, the organization had won just $10,000 in the Apex tournament world; the team has claimed a $600,000 prize, while not even having team jerseys on the stage. Huge congratulations to Monsoon, Blinkzr, and FunFPS.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In December, a Ubisoft Toronto developer posted on LinkedIn with a heartfelt, emotional message. The developer, Anthony Armstrong, revealed that a member of their family had been battling cancer ‘for years’ and had been given the news that nobody <strong>ever </strong>wants to hear: they had months left to live.</p>



<p>Armstrong explained that they were <strong>a huge </strong>GTA fan, but the final timeline meant that they wouldn’t get to play Grand Theft Auto 6 after <strong>years </strong>of waiting. It was recently confirmed by Armstrong that they’d finally managed to talk with Rockstar Games and that they’d received ‘great news’ and issued thanks to the developer.</p>







<h2 id="h-gamer-with-months-to-live-may-get-to-play-gta-6-early">Gamer with Months to Live May Get to Play GTA 6 Early</h2>



<p>The post on Anthony Armstrong’s LinkedIn page was deleted after final adjustments were made, keeping followers updated about the situation. It has been theorized that this was due to some kind of legal requirement, given that the post almost <strong>confirmed </strong>that the family member would get hands-on with GTA 6 <strong>early</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anthony-armstrong-793453110_final-update-we-spoke-to-them-today-and-activity-7402775456988770313-aBME" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">original post</a> text:</p>

<p>To any of my connections at Rockstar Games and Rockstar Toronto, or anyone else that may be able to help. A member of my family woh has been battling cancer for years just recently got the worst possible news, he was given 6 – 12 months to live.</p>



<p>The reason I’m reaching out is that they are a huge GTA fan and, with this latest update, he may not be around long enough to actually get to see GTA 6 launch, best case scenario he will be leaving us the same month it does. He currently lives only a stones throw from the Oakville studio, so its my hope that one of you may be able to set up an exclusive playtest, so he can have a chance to experience the game, before passing.</p>



<p>I absolutely understand the need for secrecy at this point of development, so at the very least an NDA is probably needed.</p>

<p>Update: The CEO of Take-Two reached out and we are just waiting to hear from the Rockstar team to discuss this further. Thank you to everyone who has shown support, reshared, and reached out to your contacts for us.</p>

<p>And:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Final Update: We spoke to them today and got great news. That’s all I can really say, but thank you all from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p>When you run a quick search, you can see that Google still has the post cached, but it has since been deleted from LinkedIn:</p>

<p>This is far from the first time a situation like this has surfaced in gaming, and it’s not the first time Rockstar Games has granted such a wish.</p>



<p>In 2018, a terminally ill gamer was allowed to <a href="https://gamerant.com/red-dead-redemption-2-terminally-ill-fan-play-early/">play Red Dead Redemption 2 early</a>, weeks before the game was set to launch. Bethesda Game Studios has honored the passing of fans by immortalizing them in games, such as Fallout 4 and Starfield.</p>

<p>It was recently confirmed that Amazon’s New World: Aeternum will be shut down next year, going offline forever and locking players out of the game they might have loved for a good while. The MMORPG was released in September 2021, soaring to epic player counts, but it quickly dwindled and the ever-marching progress of time saw the game fall out of favor <strong>fast</strong>.</p>



<p>Following the announcement that New World: Aeternum will be taken offline in 2027, an unlikely figure stood up and offered $25 million to keep the game alive, because ‘games should never die.’</p>



<h2 id="h-will-facepunch-keep-new-world-aeternum-alive">Will Facepunch Keep New World: Aeternum Alive?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/Alistair_McF/status/2011894052128768316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Alistair McFarlane, the director of Rust and COO at Facepunch Studios, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>25m, final offer Amazon Games</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Followed by a statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Games should never die.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The original post was made in response to a Facepunch employee joking that they’d asked ‘Ali’ to buy New World for them, but he told them to f*** off. This line is enough to make users doubt the validity of McFarlane’s messages, but who knows? We’ve seen stranger things.</p>



<p>As the comments unfolded, McFarlane explained when asked what Amazon should do for the players:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As with everything we do at Facepunch, empower the community. Give them control, make servers publicly hostable. A game will live forever in the hands of a dedicated community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In October 2025, Amazon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-development-cancelled-amazon-layoffs/">issued layoffs and ended</a> any more development on New World: Aeternum, and on January 15, it was revealed that the game would be taken <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-aeternum-to-be-taken-offline-next-year/">offline forever</a> in 2027.</p>



<p>This has been a major point of contention in the gaming space for the longest time. It surfaced most recently (and prolifically) with Ubisoft’s The Crew being pulled offline, a situation that spawned <strong>a court case</strong>, raised by disgruntled fans.</p>



<p>For the last few years, the concept of online-only games ending development has been a major debate, with many claiming that games should <strong>never, ever </strong>go offline.</p>



<p>It seems highly unlikely that Facepunch Studios will acquire New World: Aeternum, but what do you think? Do you think it’s up to <strong>other studios </strong>to keep games alive when they’re shut down by their creators?

            <title><![CDATA[Apex Legends Global Series Year 6 Roadmap Revealed]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Apex Legends Global Series is gearing up for another ambitious season, now that the ALGS Championship 2026 has wrapped. Electronic Arts has unveiled the full ALGS Year 6 roadmap, outlining a <strong>packed </strong>competitive calendar bursting with international events and structural changes.</p>



<p>At the heart of the announcement sits a renewed commitment to that perspective of global competition. This year, the three-event international LAN circuit returns, giving teams around the world more chances to make their name heard.</p>







<h2 id="h-algs-year-6-roadmap-is-bigger-than-ever">ALGS Year 6 Roadmap is Bigger Than Ever</h2>



<p>The season kicks off early with the Online Open, with qualifiers set to run from February 28 to March 23. Following that, the first Pro League Split will take place in April, running until June. The Challenger Circuit Split arrives in April and runs through to early June, spread across <strong>four </strong>circuits.</p>



<p>The first major LAN date to mark in your book is the Split 1 Playoffs at the 2026 Esports World Cup in Riyadh from July 7 to 11. </p>



<p>In the latter half of 2026, we’ll get the second round start, with the Pro League Qualifier taking place in late July, followed by the Pro League Split 2 in August to October. The second Challenger Circuit Split arrives in August and runs to October, and then the <strong>big events start unfolding</strong>.</p>



<p>Las Vegas plays host to the Split 2 Playoffs from October 29 to November 1, and the LCQ from November 20 to 22.</p>



<p>The ALGS Year 6 season comes to a close in Sapporo, Japan, from January 28 to 31, 2027. That’s when the Apex Legends Global Series Championship 2027 will take place, putting a cap on a bold season.</p>



<p>Electronic Arts has established a massive <strong>$7 million global prize pool </strong>for Year 6 of Apex Legends’ esports ecosystem, including $2 million reserved for each international event.</p>



<p>It was revealed that competitive integrity is becoming an increasing focus of the team this season. Legend bans will now be extended into the Challenger Circuit realm, ensuring the utmost consistency across all tiers of competition. Teams will face stricter roster rules, tighter transfer windows, and more control around Championship Points.</p>
