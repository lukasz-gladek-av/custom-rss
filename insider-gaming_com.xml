<p>After an epic 2024, it’s already time to look ahead to the biggest games coming out in 2025 across all the major platforms: PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC—and it’s good news, many amazing-looking titles are looking to bankrupt us all.</p>



<p>I would argue 2024 didn’t reach the sky-high heights of 2023’s barnstorming 12 months. However, this isn’t to say it was a bad year by any means. RPGs have smashed it with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-games-coming-in-2025-best-new-games/ReFantazio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a> brought a new lease of life to 3D platformers, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-has-generated-approximately-4-4-million-on-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro</a>—an underdog indie title—justifiably achieved Game of the Year recognition.</p>



<p>There’s been plenty to enjoy in 2024, but now, we look ahead to the next year. 2025’s biggest projected games are seriously seismic, and my bank account is already worried. Providing we don’t get any delays, here is our projected list of the nine best new games releasing in 2025 across PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>



<h2 id="h-9-best-new-games-releasing-in-2025">9 Best New Games Releasing in 2025</h2>



<p>You can never tell what the gaming industry has up its sleeve. For now, this is our list of top titles expected to come out in 2025, but expect to be blindsided by shadow drops and shock announcements during Summer Game Fest, Gamescom, and the Tokyo Game Show, amongst others.</p>



<h2 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Expect GTA 6 to mirror real life more than ever. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s be honest, if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> does release in 2025, it’s game over for everyone else. Every subsequent launch for about a month  (and beyond) has to contend with millions of players getting stuck into GTA 6. It’s probably already got Game of the Year in the bag, and it’s the<strong> biggest video game ever</strong>. </p>



<p>Rockstar’s track record is about as good as any, and while we’ve seen very little of GTA 6—we don’t need to—what we have seen looks like the meatiest and most engaging GTA project to date. Fingers crossed GTA 6 comes out in 2025, and if it does, we’re already in for one of the best gaming years in recent memory.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for 2025.</p>







<figure><figcaption>SNAAAAAKE. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>The initial Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake trailers show Konami is faithfully recreating the original story and fleshing it out with refined gameplay mechanics. The lifelike graphics are what we come to expect from a Konami production, and the fact a new generation gets to experience the thrill of where the series chronologically began, gives me a beaming smile on my face.</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid is one of my two favorite franchises ever (God of War being the other) and I’m not making it up when I say <strong>MGS3 is my pick of the bunch</strong>. The fact it’s the first one to get the fully-fledged, next-gen remake treatment warms my soul more than any fire-roasted Kenyan Mangrove Crab could. Welcome back, Big Boss.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for 2025.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Z-A has big shoes to fill. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>In Pokémon Legends: Z-A, we’re in Lumiose City—set in the Kalos region. Again, not much is known about what the new adventure entails. It is another isolated journey in a fixed location, and the debut trailer suggests the game world might be slightly more crowded compared to the quieter nature of Arceus.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends Arceus deviated from what is considered the norm for a Pokémon game. Its large, open-world design is still relatively new, it moves away from the familiar locales of cities, gyms, and the hustle and bustle of an active Pokémon title, and it features the game-changing attribute of having wild Mon attacking you! Between the flexible catching mechanics, epic Raid-style boss battles, and unique story, Legends Arceus was a bold and beautiful new direction for the franchise. </p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can Ubisoft finally get it right? Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>2024 was not a good year for Ubisoft</strong>, and its stock might metaphorically and literally might be as low as it’s ever been. Skull &amp; Bones’ hellish development cycle costing hundreds of millions of dollars flopped, Star Wars Outlaws is more low-level rookie than it is heroic wookie, and XDefiant—Ubisoft’s much-hyped Call of Duty killer—is already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-xdefiant-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down</a> in 2025. Several other Ubisoft games have been canceled, the company is facing countless layoffs, and the public perception of the once-legendary studio isn’t great.</p>



<p>No pressure on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> then. The cut-and-dried Ubisoft open-world formula is a big concern heading into the latest AC game. Players are tired of the same routine, collect-a-thons with barebones stories, and a lack of innovation. Shadows can write these wrongs, its 16th-century Japanese setting intrigues, and gameplay footage shows you can be a true assassin once again. Ubisoft needs a big win here, and it could be a true Valentine’s love story if Assassin’s Creed Shadows captures the hearts and minds of its fan base on launch day.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Feb. 14, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t toy with our emotions, Nintendo. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond didn’t have the “Beyond” name for a while, nor did it have any identity, or fill fans with confidence it would ever see the light of day. Metroid Prime 4 was announced at E3 2017 and went through development hell after having its progress restarted. Finally, the June 18, 2024, Nintendo Direct showed us the first-ever gameplay footage of Prime 4.</p>



<p>Two minutes of Morph Ball mayhem, Space Pirate scallywags, and Samus being Samus later, and Metroid Prime fans everywhere are crying—me included. <strong>I fail to see a universe where Metroid Prime 4: Beyond isn’t a GOTY contender</strong>, and even if it’s not, everyone is primed and ready for what’s coming—and Beyond.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-judas">Judas</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Years in the making. Credit to Ghost Story Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Oh, Ken Levine, where have you been in my life for the last 11 years? The Bioshock trilogy is as consistent as three games get, and Judas is the natural successor to Levine’s masterful trifecta of first-person shooters. <strong>Judas’ core mechanics are akin to System Shock and Bioshock</strong>, and short of having the word “shock” somewhere in the game title, I’m pleased to say the shooter appears to share a lot in common with those who painfully paved the way through Rapture and Columbia.</p>



<p>Your left hand is used for magical powers and elemental enchantments, whereas your right hand is mainly used to fire weapons. I expect another deeply woven story with an assortment of narrative strands taking us in every direction, allowing us to dictate our ending. The enemies manage to look equal parts cutesy, terrifying, and horrifying, and Judas’ biomes are sure to give Levine’s previous work a run for its money.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for March 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-2025">Call of Duty 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’ve got another job to do. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>CoD titles leaking years in advance is a common occurrence. We already know the 2025 edition of Activision’s multi-billion shooter bonanza is a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">semi-futuristic Black Ops 2 sequel.</a>” It’s under the codename of “Saturn,” and <strong>Call of Duty 2025 is set well in the future</strong>. It remains to be seen if your boots remain on the ground—I hope so—but what is going to be seen is an assortment of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-2024-black-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops map remakes</a>.</p>



<p>BLOPS campaigns are always a blast, so it should be fun to see where the franchise goes next. Call of Duty 2025 should have no connection to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, and we expect more leaks to come out of thin air like a ramp-propelled RC-XD. Stay tuned for further developments throughout 2025.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for October / November 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A beloved classic is back. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Oddly, we haven’t had an original Donkey Kong game in a while, but Donkey Kong Country Returns HD should suffice. In the same way, 2018’s Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze was a port of the OG 2014 release, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a sprucing up of 2010’s Donkey Kong Country Returns—first debuting on the Nintendo Wii.</p>



<p>You know what to expect with Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, and even if you’ve played it before, it might be worth swinging into the jungle one more time—you’d be bananas if you didn’t, so stop monkeying around.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Jan. 16, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Monster Hunter be wild. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>It can be argued that 2018’s Monster Hunter: World catapulted the long-running series into the marquee: Finally achieving worldwide superstardom. A metaphorical sleeping beast is now very much awake. The attention Monster Hunter: Wilds has gotten already—thanks to exposure from PlayStation Showcases and similar presentations—shows Capcom’s monster-maiming franchise is escalating at a monstrous (pun intended) rate.</p>



<p><strong>Monster Hunter: Wilds incorporates more naturalism and realism</strong>, it’s catering to fans both old and new, and features a slew of new monsters waiting to be slain or saved. The first open beta alone attracted half a million players on Steam, and you can tell Capcom is chomping at the bit to make Wilds larger than life.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Feb. 28, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-reveals-data-about-loot-boxes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-leak-reveals-data-about-loot-boxes.1068579/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-reveals-data-about-loot-boxes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A prominent Marvel Rivals leaker has revealed some details about loot boxes that were seemingly removed from the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-datamine-leak-loot-box-scrapped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, RivalsLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871169815278195163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) has provided information about Marvel Rivals’ cancelled loot boxes, such as the rarities, animations, icons and more. The loot boxes would’ve been divided across four tiers: Gray, Blue, Purple, Yellow, and Red. Grey would’ve been the least rare, providing potentially a recolour of the skin, and Red would be the rarest of the lot, where all the premium cosmetics can be found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To acquire these loot boxes, players would have to “convert Lattice and Units into Crystallization (main currency) and Marscoin (blue currency), which can then be used to pull for skins.” Besides a new skin, these boxes might’ve also included rewards like emotes, player cards, sprays and more. Moreover, the files revealed that the loot box system is time-bound and potentially connected to a special limited-time event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, RivalsLeaks has clarified that they could be wrong about Marvel Rivals loot boxes, as they are only going by the information they can dig up from the files. In the same thread, the original poster also <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871178424016105934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a> that they had been told that the loot boxes “might be crapped, but who knows, maybe one day they might get added?”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals celebrated reaching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-celebrates-20-million-players-with-a-free-reward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20 million players with a free reward</a>.

<p>Black Myth Wukong, Game Science’s latest action RPG, is the latest title to receive a knock-off on the Nintendo e-shop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Black Myth Wukong knock-off on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/wukong-sun-black-legend-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo eShop</a> is titled “Wukong Sun: Black Legend,” which couldn’t be more obvious. The title will be released on December 26, 2024, for the Nintendo Switch and can be purchased for $7.99. Even the cover art is heavily inspired by the cover art used by Game Science for their game. For those wondering, Black Myth Wukong wasn’t released for the Switch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It gets worse when you read the description for the Black Myth Wukong knock-off, as it states the following:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Embark on an epic Journey to the West in Wukong Sun: Black Legend! Step into the role of the immortal Wukong, the legendary Monkey King, as he battles through a chaotic world teeming with powerful monsters and untold dangers. Explore a story inspired by Chinese mythology, filled with action-packed battles, stunning environments, and legendary foes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, the gameplay for this Black Myth Wukong clone is miles apart from the original title. From the screenshots on the store page, it seems like Wukong Sun: Black Legend is a 2D, side-scrolling game where you fight various enemies and bosses in four different biomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clones and knocks-offs are not new in the gaming world; whenever any title goes viral, we see copies of that game floating around different stores. Last year, we saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-switch-clone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a clone of The Last of Us</a> appear on the Nintendo eShop, too, and just this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-copy-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a rip-off of Gary Zone Warfare</a> was seen on the PlayStation Store.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-science-ceo-reveals-his-views-on-black-myth-wukong-not-winning-goty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Science CEO recently revealed his views</a> on Black Myth Wukong not winning GOTY. Also, the title helped push <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/china-gaming-industry-black-myth-wukong-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">China’s gaming industry to new heights</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-shooter-of-2024-best-fps-tps-games-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This year has been wild for shooters, with bullets ricocheting all over the place and in different ways. So let’s give you a guide to Insider Gaming’s 2024 best shooter of the year, across FPS and TPS games.</p>



<p>Choosing the best shooter of 2024 boils down to several key aspects: Gunplay, Story, Sound Design, and how much we rage when we play it—maybe not the last one. It’s easy to whip up a few levels or maps, stick some enemies in it, and declare it a shooter, but at the core of the genre is so much more than this.</p>



<p>A shooter needs to hit all the senses: It should look good, and feel good, and the intense sound of whirring bullets should instill uneasiness due to realism and authenticity. Every game I’m about to discuss for Insider Gaming’s best shooter of 2024 award hits this in droves, but only one can be king of the hill.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-shooter-of-2024-winner-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Best Shooter of 2024 Winner — Call of Duty Black Ops 6</h2>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> does what few CoD titles have done in recent years—innovates. Once you’ve dived (literally) into omnidirectional movement, it’s <em>impossible</em> to go back. Your Operator glides around with a buttery smoothness I’ve craved for so long and you quickly wonder where it’s been all this time. </p>



<p>The campaign is juicy and jaunty and features one of the most intense and exciting story missions in years. Zombies is back and better than ever, with a bundle of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wonder-weapons-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Weapons</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-super-hero-easter-egg-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Easter Eggs</a>, and everything you could want from the undead merry-go-round of round-based Zombies. Finally, the multiplayer brings back the classic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-level-is-prestige-1-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prestige System</a> we love so much, makes the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-black-ops-6-mastery-camo-in-multiplayer-zombies-warzone-all-camos-listed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastery Camo</a> grind the simplest and most accessible it’s ever been, and outside of the usual bugs, it looks to be a great year ahead.</p>



<p>The sheer mention of a new Call of Duty title is enough to give many players the ick. However, Black Ops 6 shouldn’t as it’s a fantastic entry, and I would argue it rejuvenates the long-running first-person shooter series for the first time in a long time. CoD has been in the doldrums for several years now with the lackluster (and recycled) Modern Warfare 3 feeling low-effort, Modern Warfare 2 feeling like a solid entry, and nothing more, and a dependable but forgettable Vanguard. </p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is the best iteration since Black Ops Cold War—also made by Treyarch and Raven Software—and I stand by this. It’s not a perfect Call of Duty, and very few are, but it’s the complete package we’re looking for in a shooter, and Black Ops 6 deserves the best shooter of 2024 recognition.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-shooters-of-2024-nominations">Best Shooters of 2024 Nominations</h2>



<p>We feel Black Ops 6 rightfully took the top spot. However, it might pique your interest to know who else we had up our sleeves for the best shooter of 2024 category. Everything is subjective at the end of the day, so let’s see if your favorite shooter was among our honorable mentions.</p>



<h3 id="h-xdefiant">XDefiant</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It was onto something. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ubisoft’s XDefiant started the year as one of the most hyped titles of 2024—dubbed the “Call of Duty killer.” It does a lot of what FPS fans are asking for: Gets rid of SBMM, actively listens to and acts on player feedback, tracks XP properly, and tries to avoid bugs. Fast forward to the end of the year, and suddenly years of development are up in smoke as Ubisoft announces <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant is shutting down</a>.</p>



<p>Let’s take nothing away from XDefiant though. I loved my time with it, and it possesses some of the snappiest and most engaging shooting mechanics from a newcomer in years. However, it still doesn’t feel like a massive step away from CoD, and its hero abilities and microtransactions were too much for many in the community—possibly contributing to the FPS title’s quick downfall.</p>



<h3 id="h-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl">Stalker 2 Heart of Chornobyl</h3>



<figure><figcaption>As eerie as ever. Credit to GSC Game World</figcaption></figure>



<p>Stalker 2 Heart of Chornobyl is one of two single-player-focused nominations in this category. We head into the Zone to uncover the mystery behind anomalies, and artifacts, and do our best to survive. Ukraine’s radiation-plagued world is a magnificent, mysterious, and mortifying world, unfortunately, marred by questions about its quality. </p>



<p>If you read almost any <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2 Heart of Chornobyl review</a>, one theme is prevalent throughout—technical issues and bugs. Stalker 2 seems to be in a better state post-launch compared to its hampered debut; nevertheless, we need to stamp out giving games free passes with the allure of fixing them later. That being said, Stalker 2 is the perfect example of how shooters can be original, why single-player titles are needed, and not everything needs to be online multiplayer with live-service elements.</p>



<h3 id="h-helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Buggy, in a different way. Credit to Arrowhead Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>The biggest surprise hit of 2024 easily goes to Arrowhead Game Studios and Helldivers 2. A live-service shooter not immediately sentenced to purgatory like some of its other contemporaries around the same time—<em>you </em>were thinking Suicide Squad, I said it. You’re tasked with saving and protecting Super Earth using an array of weapons and fun Strategems that can either scurry a turret to your location or drop a devastating bomb and kill everyone.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 was a huge success <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling 12 million units in 12 weeks</a>, but its reputation was soured somewhat by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/negative-helldivers-2-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Account controversy</a>. This isn’t why we didn’t give the win to Helldivers 2 though; it gets a ton of credit for its world-building and marketing, and rightly so. But the gameplay itself can get repetitive—even with friends—and the thrill of annihilating Automatons feels like it has an expiry date. Still, plenty to build on here for Helldivers 3, and it’s great to see a new multiplayer game smash it.</p>



<h3 id="h-warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Classic gameplay. Credit to Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>My goodness, I miss single-player-driven shooters. Like Stalker 2, the main emphasis for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is its story, dramatic events, riveting visuals, and epic battles. As an almighty Space Marine with unreal strength and combat abilities, you tussle with Tyranids&nbsp;throughout a several-hour-long campaign. This is one sticking point for Space Marine 2—its campaign length—but it has plenty of replayability, and I understand the comparison to Black Ops 6’s story length.</p>



<p>Space Marine 2 compares favorably to the over-the-shoulder third-person-shooter style of fan favorites like Gears of War. It’s somewhat of a niche by today’s standards, and I’m keen to see more of this. Overall, a minor lack of originality and a less-than-stellar multiplayer component edge Warhammer’s newest shooter out of the top spot.</p>
