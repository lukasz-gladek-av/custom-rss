<p>It’s been over a year since Rockstar revealed Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6 to the world, and fans are eagerly awaiting any sort of news about the first GTA game in over a decade. Now, in what appears to be a leak from a former employee, there’s a small look at what appears to be GTA 6 running on a development machine.</p>



<p>First shared on Reddit, user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1hr9lkk/a_photo_from_mid2021_i_think_its_been_long_enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JustLovett0</a> posted an image of the game that was reportedly taken in 2021. They said that it was taken by someone they are “close to” when they worked at Rockstar.</p>



<p>“I think it’s been long enough I can post this,” they said.</p>



<p>The post was immediately removed from the GTA 6 subreddit. However, it has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hratml/reupload_of_the_guys_gta_6_leaked_photo_vids_from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reuploaded elsewhere</a> for those who want to see it. Overall, it’s nothing much aside from one still image and two short clips showing the inside of Rockstar’s office with numerous dev kits on desks.</p>







<p>GTA 6 is currently scheduled for release in fall 2025. Since the original trailer, however, Rockstar has been silent on when more information will be shown. That’s led to worry and rumors that the game will ultimately miss 2025 and be pushed to 2026.</p>



<p>When it does release, GTA 6 will be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. </p>



<p>When do you think we’ll finally get new information on GTA 6? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Last year was a great year for sports video games. In 2024, we saw the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-response-to-college-football-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">college football</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/undisputed-review-redefining-the-boxing-game-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boxing console games</a>, fantastic new indie titles, and some of the highest-rated games in the history of long-running franchises. But if 2024 was that great, just how much better could 2025 be? If what’s expected to release in any indication, sports fans could be in for another stellar year. So, let’s take a look at the biggest sports video games expected to release in 2025.</p>



<p>Whether you want to hit the links, drive around the track, or get back on the football field, there’s going to be no shortage of options for your this year.</p>

<h2 id="h-biggest-sports-games-of-2025">Biggest Sports Games Of 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-college-football-26">College Football 26</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>College Football 25 took the world by storm in 2024, and became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-remains-2024s-best-selling-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling sports video game</a> in United States history. What’s more, the game has remained at the top of the 2024 sales charts in the United States, even keeping games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 at bay. So, naturally, it’s time to think about just how EA Sports will follow up with this year’s game.</p>



<p>We know it’s coming, but what will College Football 26 do to improve on the first college football game in 11 years? Will Road to Glory see added depth? Will Team Builder allow for custom stadiums? Facility improvements in Dynasty Mode? Will it come to PC? There’s a lot that can be done to keep the momentum going in 2025.</p>

<h3 id="h-pga-tour-2k25">PGA Tour 2K25</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A game that hasn’t officially been announced yet, PGA Tour 2K25 is currently planned for a release by March 31, 2025. At least, that’s what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two CFO Laine Goldstein let slip</a> during the company’s Q2 FY2025 earnings call last November. Since then, there has been no mention of the upcoming game in any capacity, seemingly confirming that it wasn’t supposed to be mentioned on the call. However, now that the game’s out there in the open, it seems like it’s only a matter of time before fans find out how it’ll improve upon PGA Tour 2K23.</p>



<h3 id="h-wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>WWE 2K24 was the best-selling and highest-rated game in the WWE 2K franchise since Take-Two acquired the WWE license in 2013. The game wasn’t without it’s issues, however, which makes WWE 2K25 all the more anticipated. Sources have told Insider Gaming that due to the success of 2024, Take-Two is investing more into the game. So, the hope is that it translates into improvements that fans have been hoping for for years, such as updates to the game’s Universe Mode.</p>

<h3 id="h-iracing-nascar-25">iRacing NASCAR 25</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s been over three years since NASCAR fans have received a proper video game — if you want to call NASCAR 21: Ignition a proper game. That’s what makes this year so exciting. A new NASCAR console game is scheduled for the fall, and it’s the first one coming from iRacing since it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-announces-new-console-game-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased the license</a> from Motorsport Games. </p>



<p>The deal was announced in October 2023, and it’s been pretty quiet on the update front from the team working on the game. We know it’s going to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-iracing-nascar-console-game-monster-games-in-unreal-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built in Unreal Engine with Monster Games</a> leading the way as well as it being available on PS5, Xbox Series, PC, and, as of today, Nintendo Switch. With the 2025 NASCAR season right around the corner, we should start getting more information on what to expect sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Esports remains a relatively divisive topic going into 2025. Many still see the esports industry as a fledgeling thing doomed to fail, while others believe it’s a titanic powerhouse of potential with untapped avenues of income left, right, and centre.</p>



<p>In recent years, esports has been nothing short of a turbulent space to exist in. It’s still developing – and likely will be for many years to come – and a lot is happening under the hood that the average fan might not see or understand.</p>



<p>In a recent piece covered by Esports Insider, several high-profile stakeholders and leaders in the esports industry were interviewed about their predictions for esports in 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mature-and-evolve">‘Mature and Evolve’</h2>



<p>Some of the best answers in Esports Insider’s look-forward piece came from Steve Arhancet, the CEO of Team Liquid, one of the oldest and most successful esports organisations in the world.</p>



<p>When asked about his expectations for 2025, Arhancet said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that in 2025, esports will solidify itself as a cultural force rather than a fleeting trend. The past few years have forced companies to mature and evolve, and the separation between companies that have built real businesses and those who chase empty metrics will grow even more significant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of this, we will see more consolidation, mergers and acquisitions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We’ve seen plenty of high-profile mergers and acquisitions in the last few years. For instance, in the Call of Duty League, several teams performed mergers to either stay afloat or bolster their resources, with the likes of Cloud9, Gentle Mates, and Team Falcons working their way into the Call of Duty pro scene in earnest.</p>



<p>Arhancet went on to dip into Tema Liquid’s success in 2024, commenting on what’s coming next:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Team Liquid achieved its 2024 goal of being EBITDA positive.</p>



<p>(In 2025, Team Liquid wants to) be a leader in competitive gaming and build a global and multigenerational sports team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On the topic of ongoing success and sustainability, Arhancet suggested what needs to be done for more organisations to become profitable and hit their EBITDA boosts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Monetisation models remain the Achilles’ heel of esports.&nbsp; We need to find that next gear beyond just ad spend and sponsorships, and create direct fan monetisation systems that feel natural, rewarding and equitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This would go hand-in-hand with improved economics between developers and/or tournament organisers and teams.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full breadth of interviews can be found <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/01/esports-industry-predicts-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in Esports Insider’s complete report</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GTA 6 Could Make $1 Billion Before It’s Even Released]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-could-make-1-billion-before-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-6-could-make-1-billion-before-it%E2%80%99s-even-released.1072641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-could-make-1-billion-before-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been estimated by a gaming research group that Grand Theft Auto 6, the world’s most anticipated game, could secure $1 billion in pre-orders before it hits the market later this year. This monumental figure was expanded by the agency suggesting that GTA 6 could go on to make more than $3 billion in under a year.</p>



<p>It has been predicted that GTA 6 will make around $3.2 billion in 12 months once it launches this year – expectations are currently sitting at an October release date.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>In a report published in the Financial Times, the stability of the games industry was explored. It all began with a deep dive into how much GTA 6 is expected to make when it’s finally released later this year. Per an estimation from DFC Intelligence, GTA 6 could make $1 billion in pre-orders alone. </p>



<p>Ultimately, it has been predicted that GTA 6 will go on to decimate the numbers secured by GTA 5 in 2013.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1413cdb1-aee9-422f-8b78-15aa0bf40dca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Financial Times</a>, Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two (Rockstar Games’ parent company) said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I never claim victory before it occurs. That said, I think Rockstar Games will once again deliver something absolutely phenomenal. Certainly the anticipation is high.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zelnick also contributed to the discussion about the health of the current gaming generation and consumer spending habits:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s way too early to believe that this [console] generation is maturing or has reached its apex.</p>



<p>You’re seeing more consumer demand broadly. And the industry, frankly led by us, has an amazing release schedule coming in 2025 and beyond. A hit coming from one company tends to benefit the entire industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GTA 6 has already broken viewership records on YouTube. From the moment the first trailer was released in December 2023, fans turned feral, scouring every frame for secrets and hints. Today, it’s still one of the most talked-about videos in the world, and that’s aided by the fact that a high-res version of the trailer recently surfaced online.</p>
