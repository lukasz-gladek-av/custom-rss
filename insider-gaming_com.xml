<p>New details about the 2022 Saints Row reboot have surfaced online, suggesting that the game was originally intended to be a sequel to Saints Row: The Third. </p>



<p>For those unaware, a Saints Row reboot was released in 2022, developed by Volition and published by Deep Silver. The game featured a brand-new story and characters, featuring a crime-based adventure in Santo Ileso. However, fans of the series were not happy with this direction, with many expressing disappointment over the shift in tone and the narrative’s lack of substance. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-the-2022-saints-row-reboot-could-have-been">What the 2022 Saints Row Reboot Could Have Been</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The details about the Saints Row reboot originally being a sequel come from mrsaintsgodzilla21’s video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZfzp0NrM4Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> (via Synth Potato on <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1962204453500551604" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>). In this video, the creator discusses their 2019 visit to Volition’s development studio, highlighting every detail, story point, or other aspect that was cut or changed during the transition from a sequel to a reboot. The game was to be called ‘Saints Row Cinco” and would arrive as a direct sequel to Saints Row: The Third. </p>



<p>To make the Saints Row sequel a possibility, they would have to retcon all events from Saints Row 4 and even negate Johnny Gat’s death in the third installment. So, instead of an alien invasion, the Saints, along with The Boss, would have to exit Steelport and establish a new base in Santo Ileso. The sequel would have also featured all the Original Saint Members as the main characters in the sequel. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers intended to make this a fan service game, checking off all the things they had requested over the years. The Saints Row sequel would follow a 20/80 rule for its tone, where 20% of it would be inspired by Saints Row 3 and 80% by Saints Row 2. There was also a secret mission in the game, where players would have the chance to confront and kill Dex. The Saints Row sequel was so far in development that Pierce’s actor had recorded some of the lines for it, too. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-things-started-to-change">When Things Started to Change</h2>



<p>Things reportedly changed as soon as THQ Nordic acquired Deep Silver, with the former outright rejecting the sequel idea and forcing Volition to go back to the drawing board. For the new story, heavy restrictions were placed on what the characters would be able to say, including swear words. Then, a new version of the reboot was pitched, which would have retained all the original Saints; however, that was rejected by THQ Nordic as well. </p>



<h2 id="h-other-features-that-could-have-been-a-part-of-the-saints-row-sequel">Other Features That Could Have Been a Part of the Saints Row Sequel </h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other cancelled and rejected features for the Saints Row sequel were also revealed. Ultor was going to return instead of the Marshals, with the Skill Tree being split into wealth, fame, and muscle branches. Body shields were also going to return, but Deep Silver rejected them for being “too violent.” Criminal Ventures would have allowed players to customize the entire city, choosing what businesses to place in the open world. </p>



<p>They also had a ‘proclamation’ system, which allowed players to instill laws in districts under their control. These laws would vary from setting dress codes to enacting standoffs as a method of resolving conflicts. The game was also bringing back Cribs and customisation, where players could customise cribs and the church and place items where they wished. You could also purchase furniture from the store, but these features were cut. </p>



<p>Moreover, cheats would have been unlocked during the endgame, requiring players to find and unlock a massive secret genki pyramid to make them available. Also, New Game+ was cut. There are a lot more details in mrsaintsgodzilla21’s video, which you can find embedded below. Readers should note that as these details do not come from an official source, they should treat it with caution. </p>

<p>Once you’re done with Borderlands 4’s main content, the roadmap shows us what’s coming later on. We can see what 2K has planned in terms of DLC and all the extra content coming to the looter shooter.</p>



<p>We’re seeing roadmaps announced in advance quite regularly. It gives you an incentive to invest in a game, as you know more content is arriving post-launch. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a> senses this, and it’s why 2K has gone early with a look at the game’s full roadmap of content arriving in 2025 and beyond.</p>



<p>If you want to see Borderlands 4’s roadmap and future plans, you’re in the right space, fellow Vault Hunter.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-upcoming-borderlands-4-content">All Upcoming Borderlands 4 Content</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shut your Claptrap. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>2K has indicated that Borderlands 4’s roadmap includes free and paid DLC, new story content, fresh gear, skins, bosses, events, and much more.</strong></p>



<p>To make this more digestible, I’ve whipped up a quick table so you can see the individual additions to <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/en-GB/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, and if they’ll cost you anything.</p>

<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-roadmap-release-window-explained">Borderlands 4 Roadmap Release Window Explained</h2>



<p><strong>We’re not sure when the majority of this new Borderlands 4 content is coming, but the official roadmap indicates the Horrors of Kairos Seasonal Mini-Event begins in October.</strong></p>



<p>2K hasn’t revealed the dates of release windows for the majority of the announced roadmap content yet. ‘Horrors of Kairos’ will likely tie into the spooky and kooky nature of Halloween. I’d also say it’s a safe bet that we’ll get some kind of Christmas-themed Borderlands 4 seasonal event, too.</p>



<p>The Story Pack and Bounty Pack content—which come with upgraded Borderlands 4 editions—are currently TBA. However, I’d expect 2K to give us more insight closer to the game’s full launch.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-productions-celebrating-10th-anniversary-glimpse/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-productions-celebrating-10th-anniversary-with-%E2%80%98future-projects%E2%80%99-glimpse.1285674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kojima Productions has announced an upcoming showcase poised to celebrate the company’s tenth anniversary. The ‘Beyond the Strand’ event will offer a ‘glimpse into future projects’ and pay tribute to everything the studio has accomplished thus far.</p>



<p>Beyond the Strand will be both a digital and in-person event, with the live portion taking place at TOHO Cinemas in Roppongi Hills, Japan. </p>



<h2 id="h-ten-years-of-kojima-productions">Ten Years of Kojima Productions</h2>



<p>Hideo Kojima will host the Beyond the Strand event in Japan on September 23, and the showcase is set to feature a hefty assortment of special guest appearances. It’s easy to predict who will show up, and I’m willing to bet hard cash that Norman Reedus will appear.</p>



<p>Kojima Productions <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/kjp10th_beyond_the_strand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">unveiled the event</a> earlier today, revealing that tickets for Beyond the Strand will go on sale from tomorrow, September 2.</p>



<p>In the most recent Hideo Kojima space, the iconic game creator revealed that he’s effectively <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working ‘all by himself’</a> on Physint, the tactical espionage game set to be a spiritual successor to Metal Gear Solid.</p>



<p>Before that, he stressed in a somewhat bizarre way during an interview that, while making games, he has learned many ways in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-learned-many-ways-kill-people-bags-studios/">which to kill people</a>. It was his opinion that more developers need to understand these elements of development if they want to make better games.</p>



<p> Looking forward to Beyond the Strand, it’s easy to see a heavy focus on OD, one of Hideo Kojima’s next big games. There might even be talk of an expansion for Death Stranding 2. As for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-written-concept-death-stranding-3-wont-make/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 3</a>, the man himself recently admitted that it might not be him who makes the game, if it does ever surface.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Semiwork is hard at work on the next big REPO update. The indie sensation horror game retains a healthy player base, and loyal gamers are going to have their passion and playtime rewarded with many new monsters, likely to require your toilet to be on standby.</p>



<p>While not quite as lively as it was in its early weeks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/repo-is-the-best-selling-steam-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> remains very popular. Over 20,000 people are still logging in each month, and the game’s peak hovers around the 40-45K mark. Semiwork understands this, which is why a new update is in development.</p>



<h2 id="h-repo-receiving-more-monsters-in-big-october-30-update">REPO Receiving More Monsters In Big October 30 Update</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Yeah, I’d have that face too. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p>A fun new video was released on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@semiwork" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">semiwork</a> YouTube channel on August 29. It’s titled “REVEALING THE NEXT R.E.P.O. UPDATE,” and it did exactly what it promised.</p>



<p>“The next update will be all monsters,” we are told by the narrator. Now, only one of the new creatures was revealed as semiwork wants to keep the remaining designs a secret.</p>



<p>But a special spotlight is given to one of the new monsters. It’s described by the host as an “innocent goblin-looking thing” and looks small in stature, but horrific in design.</p>



<p>It has two large tusks alongside its set of teeth, a long tongue, a large protruding nose sticking out the top of its head, and, while I can’t see any eyes, I have a feeling they could be on its body.</p>



<p>REPO’s ‘The Monster Update’ drops on October 30—just in time for Halloween—and comes with new gameplay features, and much more.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-co-op-split-screen-is-technically-feasible-says-ceo/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2’s CEO has stated that the split-screen co-op feature is technically possible and is on the developers’ list of features to investigate.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 is experiencing its best time since launch, with the game releasing for a brand new platform, the Xbox Series consoles, and hitting its highest concurrent player count on Steam since April 2024. Moreover, the game has also received the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-warbond-release-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legendary HALO ODST Warbond</a> recently.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-devs-have-co-op-splitscreen-on-their-to-investigate-list">Helldivers 2 Devs Have Co-Op Splitscreen on their ‘To Investigate’ List</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/helldivers-2-split-screen-co-op-ceo-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, a player recently asked about Helldivers 2 getting split-screen support on the game’s official Discord. The CEO of Arrowhead Studios, Shams Jorjani, responded, stating that co-op split-screen for Helldivers 2 is “technically feasible”, but isn’t sure whether this is a feature players really want. However, the feature has been placed on their “to investigate” list, so there’s a chance we may hear something about it, but players shouldn’t get their hopes too high.</p>



<p>Since the advent of online co-op, offline split-screen co-op has begun to disappear from games, with almost no recent games offering this feature anymore. Split-screen co-op could be a great addition for Helldivers 2, but it all depends on the execution. However, as it is a PvE title, a local co-op option might be something players might be genuinely interested in. Regardless, we will have to wait and see if Arrowhead takes action.</p>



<p>In other news, Helldivers 2 devs thought Fortnite’s new season <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-new-season-feels-like-we-have-helldivers-at-home-arrowhead-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">felt like</a> “we have Helldivers at home”.

<p>James Bond fans, get ready. On September 3, IO Interactive is offering a brand new look at 007 First Light with a special PlayStation State of Play. </p>



<p>Announced by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/01/state-of-play-presents-007-first-light-gameplay-deep-dive-on-september-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Yann Roskell</a>, IO Interactive’s senior global communication manager, the upcoming State of Play will showcase over 30 minutes of gameplay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The idea of LEGO Pokémon prices allegedly being expensive is as shocking as being unable to catch Mewtwo first go with a Poké Ball—it’s not. A new leak claims to have gotten wind of the first LEGO Pokémon date and prices, and while not official, it seems there will be at least one monstrous set.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-mario-kart-spiny-shell-set-promo-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO</a> acquiring the right to use the Pokémon license is a win for all. MEGA has done a great job with its range of products over the years—my house proudly displays a giant Gyarados, Eevee, and a Poke Ball! But it’s certainly exciting to see what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Pokémon</a> is in the works.</p>

<p>According to the popular and reliable <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LegoLeak</a> subreddit, the new LEGO Pokémon sets are releasing on March 1, 2026.</p>



<p>Three sets have been outed: 72151, 72152, and 72153. The first one reportedly has 587 pieces and will cost $59.99. The second set contains 2050 pieces and costs $199.99. The third and final set (72153) apparently features a whopping 6838 pieces and will set you back $649.99.</p>



<p>Again, this is a rumored leak, so take this information at face value for what it is. The fun part is now speculating what the sets could be. LEGO tends to have different versions of the same theme. The Millennium Falcon, for example, has three variations, and the main difference between them is size and price.</p>



<p>The three models mentioned in the leak could be Pikachu, but getting progressively bigger and more expensive. Either way, I can’t wait to see what LEGO Pokémon sets are in development.</p>

<p>Which LEGO Pokémon sets are you keen to see? Who’s your favorite Pokémon? I am desperate for a Gastly, Haunter, and Gengar set, personally. Let me know what you hope to see through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
