            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone knows that video game journalists aren’t good at games, right? It’s as true as the sun rising in the morning or the knowledge that it was <strong>lag </strong>that led to you losing your match, and not your abilities (or lack of). That’s why it’s exciting that a game is coming out that journalists <strong>must </strong>be good at – <strong>Final Sentence</strong>.</p>



<p>In Final Sentence, up to 100 players face off in a battle royale like no other. It features typewriters, revolvers loaded with a single bullet, and a warehouse full of bodies… Except for one person, that is. As you advance through the rounds, you have to type as though your life depends on it (which it does), and a single typo could mean a bullet to the head.</p>



<h2 id="h-in-final-sentence-a-single-tpyo-could-mean-death">In Final Sentence, a Single Tpyo Could Mean Death</h2>



<p>Final Sentence is slated to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2413950/Final_Sentence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch on Steam</a> in Q4 2025, but until now, no concrete release date has been lined up for the title. Several months ago, the game’s solo developer, operating under the name Button Mash, revealed Final Sentence, explaining why the idea of the game surfaced in the first place:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am notoriously bad at typing myself, so I searched for the entertaining ways to improve. That’s when the idea of Final Sentence was born.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Final Sentence, players wake up in a warehouse full of people, all sitting at desks topped with a typewriter from days gone by. There’s a clock that ticks down seconds, and a masked man standing at every desk with a revolver. In that revolver sits a single bullet, and each mistake could mean <strong>death</strong>.</p>



<p>As you type, the other 99 (<em>up to</em>) do the same thing, and shots echo out around the room as a fatal mistake brings them to a grisly end.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a Russian Roulette of sorts, and it could be your first mistake or your sixth mistake that sends you to an early grave.</p>



<p>What’s bizarre is that the prompts you need to type in Final Sentence appear to reference pop culture classics and movies, with lines such as ‘Press F to pay respects’ and ‘Hide yo kids, hide yo wife’ being prompts.</p>



<p>Button Mash has explained that Final Sentence uses a ranking system that evaluates your performance and lets you know where to improve, so this is one battle royale title that has real-world, practical applications.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>It also runs on an utter potato, which is great news for PC gamers without the best equipment.</p>



<p>Games journalists can finally enjoy a title that they’re good at, without worrying about pretending that they like games just to appease the masses.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-3-in-the-works-at-warner-bros/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mortal-kombat-3-in-the-works-at-warner-bros.1322887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Mortal Kombat 3, stylized as Mortal Kombat III, is now greenlit at Warner Bros and New Line, according to the screenwriter.</p>



<p>The Mortal Kombat film series is rather new, starting in 2021. The newest entry, Mortal Kombat II, is currently in post-production, having been delayed to May 15th, 2026. However, it seems the reception from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-mortal-kombat-2-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its huge red-band trailer</a> was enough to get another entry going before the sequel hits theaters.</p>



<h2 id="h-mortal-kombat-3-confirmed-by-screenwriter-at-comic-con">Mortal Kombat 3 Confirmed by Screenwriter at Comic-Con</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Jeremy Slater, screenwriter for Mortal Kombat II, announced at New York Comic-Con that Mortal Kombat 3 is officially in the works. Furthermore, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/mortal-kombat-iii-jeremy-slater-writing-new-line-1236582473/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exclusive news from Deadline</a> confirms that New Line and Warner Bros will return to distribute and produce the film. As the sequel isn’t out, no story details or casting have been confirmed. Even more so, there is no release date for the film, as it’s in the writing stages. </p>



<p>At the Comic-Con panel, Jeremy Slater stood with the cast and crew of Mortal Kombat II, like Karl Urban and Tati Gabrielle. As he was telling the audience about Mortal Kombat II, he revealed the third entry’s existence. He says,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Our friends at New Line and Warner Bros. are so happy with this movie,” Slater remarks. “They are so excited. They are so convinced that there is a giant fanbase waiting for it that they have already hired me to start writing the next installment of Mortal Kombat.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a pretty good sign when Mortal Kombat III is greenlit before Mortal Kombat II is even out. While the delay from October 2025 to May 2026 is a big leap, it seems Warner Bros. is happy with the film enough to do another. The original Mortal Kombat film did quite well at the box office, so perhaps we can see the series get another lease on life in film.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever gotten into an argument with a friend over who is the greatest of all time between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, then we suggest taking a few minutes to check out the popular Roblox title Neo Tennis. As the name suggests, Neo Tennis is a sports game where players are pitched against each other in 1v1 or 2v2 tennis matches. There are global as well as seasonal ranking systems in the game, adding further reason for players to grind out Neo Tennis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With special in-game abilities and custom rackets to acquire, the competition level can be quite high, which is why some Neo Tennis codes could prove to be useful. Although cosmetics and in-game currency can be highly sought-after items from these Neo Tennis codes, getting a unique racket is an experience on its own. To get free rewards in this game using Neo Tennis codes, continue reading on.</p>

<h2 id="h-expired-neo-tennis-codes">Expired Neo Tennis Codes</h2>



<div><p>As of the writing of this article, there are no Neo Tennis codes that have expired. Although the lack of codes could be a cause for concern among aspiring players, considering that the game came out relatively recently, they don’t need to be overly worried. Moreover, with just how popular the game has become recently, new Neo Tennis codes are surely on the horizon, and players are urged to wait patiently for the next drop.</p><p>In the meantime, we recommend that all active players of the game keep this page bookmarked, as we update this article with the latest codes as soon as the developers release them. Be it through their Discord server or through the socials, rest assured that our page will be updated soon after the codes come out.</p></div>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-neo-tennis-codes">How to redeem Neo Tennis Codes</h2>



<p>Redeeming codes in Neo Tennis is a fairly simple process, with no major steps needing to be completed before players can get their hands on the rewards on offer. Although many Roblox games nowadays impose requirements on players before giving them the ability to redeem codes, Neo Tennis has done no such thing. Redeeming Neo Tennis codes is as simple as navigating through the menus and inputting one of the active codes into the correct text box. Here’s a step-by-step guide for beginners:</p>



<ul>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Neo Tennis</li>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-megan-fox-matpat-cast/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/five-nights-at-freddy%E2%80%99s-2-adds-megan-fox-matpat-to-cast.1322728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 has revealed three new cast members at Comic-Con, with two directly related to the series.</p>



<p>A sequel to the original 2023 film adaptation, Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 plans to up the stakes and deliver some quality scares. The story will seemingly see the animatronics of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria unleashed to the public. New to the film are the Toy animatronics from the video game’s sequel. Now, confirmed at Comic-Con, we have a fresh new look at them, alongside who will be voicing them.</p>



<h2 id="h-megan-fox-matpat-cast-as-toy-animatronics-in-five-nights-at-freddy-s-2">Megan Fox, MatPat Cast as Toy Animatronics in Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>During a panel for Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 at New York Comic-Con, it was announced that the Toy animatronics will have some well-known actors attached to them. As Toy Freddy, the role will be played by VA Kellen Goff, who voices Glamrock Freddy in Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach. For the role of Toy Bonnie, MatPat, former host of Game Theory and FNAF icon, will voice the robotic bunny. Finally, and perhaps the most out-there, Transformers actress <a href="https://x.com/FNAFMovie/status/1976815880626679994?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Megan Fox</a> will voice Toy Chica.</p>



<p>Megan Fox’s addition to Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 is an interesting one, though not too far-fetched. Previously, the Jennifer’s Body actress voiced Nitara in Mortal Kombat 1. She has stated to be a fan of games, so being in FNAF is a no-brainer. MatPat (Matthew Patrick), interestingly enough, already cameoed as a waiter in 2023’s Five Nights at Freddy’s film. Still, given his contributions to the fandom, it’s a great role for him, especially considering his acting background. </p>



<p>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 is set to hit theaters on December 5th, 2025. A new poster, showing off the Toy characters, is <a href="https://x.com/FNAFMovie/status/1976814091596619866?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">above</a>. If the film is anything like the original, fans are in for one fun ride.</p>
