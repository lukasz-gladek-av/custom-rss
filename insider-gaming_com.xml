<p>When STALKER 2 was released on November 20, one thing that was missing was the ‘A-Life 2.0’ that was promised to make The Zone a living, breathing world. It was said that A-Life 2.0 would serve as a solid evolution of the A-Life mechanics featured in the earlier STALKER games, giving players a sense of being present in a world populated by intelligent AI characters.</p>



<p>That’s not there in STALKER 2, and recently, GSC removed a reference to A-Life 2.0 from the game’s listing on Steam. However, GSC’s CEO has sat down with IGN to explain what happened to A-Life 2.0 and why it’s not in STALKER 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-did-a-life-2-0-go">Where Did A-Life 2.0 Go?</h2>



<p>In an interview with IGN, Ievgen Grygorovych, the CEO of GSC Game World, explained what happened to A-Life 2.0. It was penned as being one of the most advanced features in STALKER 2, allowing players to witness events unfolding independently of their input, with NPCs almost living their own lives irrespective of what the player was doing.</p>



<p>Grygorovych said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This system to work properly requires a much larger area for spawn NPCs, and it requires much more memory resources. We were fighting with optimization. To optimize, you have a lot of things that need your resources, and you try to cut things from different directions to properly optimize the game well.</p>



<p>But to make it work we had to optimize some things, and they make A-Life work in many situations not as it should. Also, we created some bugs not long ago before release with NPCs spawning in the air and dropping back to the bottom. They should actually spawn in the terrain. Why it happened, I don’t know! And also we had some bugs with AI behavior.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He explained that the team is working very hard to stabilise A-Life 2.0 and deliver what was promised, but it’s ‘very broken and not working’. In another statement, GSC’s creative director, Maria Grygorovych, threw the blame at the company’s marketing team, stressing it was <strong>them </strong>who removed the reference to A-Life 2.0 on Steam without permission.</p>



<p>She brought receipts, though. In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the interview with IGN</a>, she showed screenshots of a conversation between her and the ‘marketing person’ who removed the details on Steam. However, the team <strong>won’t </strong>put the reference back until they’ve fixed A-Life 2.0.</p>



<p>That’s what happened – but it’s now up to GSC to patch up A-Life 2.0 and turn it into something that resembles what was promised.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has reignited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-zombies-split-screen-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a> as the mode returned back to its round-based roots. The undead mode has been all about giving the community what they want, a classic Zombies experience, with all the Perks and features fans know and love.</p>



<p>Speaking of Perks, you’ll find a familiar bunch in both Terminus and Liberty Falls, from Juggernog, Speedcola and Quick Revive to Deadshot Daiquiri, Stamina-Up and PHD Flopper.  With the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle des Morts map</a>, the devs have decided to reintroduce a Perk from Black Ops 2 called Vulture Aid.</p>



<p>For those who aren’t familiar with the Perk, here’s what Vulturue Aid is in Black Ops 6 Zombies and how it works.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-is-vulture-aid-in-bo6-zombies">What is Vulture Aid in BO6 Zombies?</h2>



<p>Vulture Aid is a <strong>Zombies Perk that players can purchase in the Black Ops 6 Citadelle des Morts map</strong>, which arrives December 5, 2024, as part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1-reloaded-release-date-new-guns-codmas-event-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 Reloaded update</a>. </p>



<p>The Vulture Aid Perk was first introduced in Black Ops 2’s Buried map and hasn’t been seen since. It returns in Black Ops 6, and it will likely feature the same coffin-style red and white Perk machine design.</p>

<h2 id="h-vulture-aid-perk-effects">Vulture Aid Perk effects</h2>



<ul>
<li>See Perks, wall weapons, the Pack-a-Punch machine, and the Mystery Box through walls when close-by (they will also have a brighter glow for better visability).</li>



<li>Zombies also occasionally drop ammo or points on death</li>



<li>Some Zombies will release a green cloud upon death that players can walk into to mask themselves from Zombies and be ignored.</li>
</ul>



<p>These are the effects of Vulture Aid in Black Ops 2. There’s no telling whether the Perk will have the same effects in Black Ops 6 until mwe get hands on, but it will likely be very similar.</p>

<p>Venture Aid is on the Citadelle des Morts map in Black Ops 6 Zombies. We don’t yet know exactly where the Perk Machine will be, but it has been confirmed for the new map.</p>
